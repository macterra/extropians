Sorry to set off so many people's Bullshit Meters.  When I made that last
statement, I did not mean to imply that I was unknowledgeable on this
subject and could only quote other people's reports.  I make my living by
consulting on telecommunications and computer security for private industry
and certain government projects.

Please read my statements more carefully.

This is incorrect for approximately 90% of the population.  Your
liver synthesizes about 1 gm/day of cholesterol and downregulates
production based on consumption: eat 200 mg/day more, it makes
200 mg/day less.  For this 90%, cholesterol consumption has no
effect on cholesterol levels.  What does affect cholesterol is 
fat and calories.  Many cholesterol-high foods are also high in
fat and calories as well (e.g. eggs) so they do indeed raise
cholesterol; this confounding correlation is part of the reason
many think that consumed cholesterol makes a big difference for
blood cholesterol.

I eat meat, and my cholesterol level is 135.  My family history
for heart disease is absolutely hideous, with three of four 
grandparents dying of atherosclerosis and both parents having
highly elevated cholesterol.  I get this with a low-fat diet
and fairly casual CR.  You can get a great cholesterol level
on animal products.

I'm not so sure about those limited applications; cannabis is used to
treat glaucoma, nausea (due to chemotherapy, for example) insomnia,
anorexia, depression, epilepsy, pain in general and lots more.
See also http://www.hyperreal.org/drugs/marijuana/medical/index.html 
I think we need a lot more serious, unbiased studies to fully understand
the potential (or lack of it) of this plant. In the present "war on drugs"
climate, studies tend to be more political than scientific (God-weed vs
Devil-weed).

One thing is for sure though: cannabis can be great FUN! It enhances you in 
all aspects...your imagination explodes, music sounds absolutely heavenly, 
food has never tasted better, you feel euphoric & energetic, it's a _potent_ 
aphrodisiac and more. Smoke (or better yet, vaporize) pot and feel...transhuman 
(or maybe even posthuman with some *really* good weed ;-) When used 
moderately none of the alleged negative side effects like memory loss or 
decreased motivation occur, as far as *I* can tell. Sure, some people get 
passive and incoherent from smoking pot, but they usually use it too often 
(several times a say) and didn't have much of a life to begin with. Pot
won't turn a healthy, happy transhumanist into a demented zomby. On
the contrary, it might give you that edge you need to solve a difficult
problem etc. It would probably be a good thing if scientists would "lighten
up" every now and then, the greatest breaktroughs are made when looking
from a different perspective.

Be sure to visit Amsterdam sometime ;-)

I'm very wary about doing hedonic engineering (or deep
metaprogramming) without *very* careful planning. When you modify your
own motivational structure, you can easily get trapped in unexpected
or unplanned behavior-attractors. These attractors will since they are
attractors, appear natural or pleasant for you, but they might not be
in accordance with your original goals.

In the long run I of course think we will do a lot of hedonics, it is
after all so fun! (why? because it is hedonics - it is fun/pleasant by
*definition*. Hmm, this seems to suggest that all sufficiently
advanced intelligent entities will be tempted to deal with it) What I
worry about is that so many simply accept that the subjective very
positive results correspond with real positive results - as a
scientist, I want to find good evidence for that before I start
endorsing it as a transhuman technology.

I am a computational neuroscientist. I deal with how the brain works
and (hopefully) how these processes produce our mental experiences and
abilities. I'm also studying psychology, trying to learn as much as
possible about the high-level phenomena of the mind so that I can work
towards bridging the gap between neuron and mind.

My posting was simply based on what we know of how cannabinoids affect
the brain on a purely hardware level, fairly objective unless it turns
out that the experiments were done in the wrong way or cannot be
replicated. The problem with drug experiences (or for that matter a
lot of our subjective experiences) is that they are highly unreliable
- how much of the effects are real, and how much is just delusion?
There are plenty of mechanisms that make us fool ourselves, especially
when we are in unusual mental states (not that the normal state is
delusion-free). A typical example would be a paranoid delusion - once
you accept it partially it quickly makes you find more evidence for
it, even if an outside person would say this evidence is weak or
delusional. But to the paranoic, the persecution is experienced as
real.

Sounds reasonable. Note the similarities with the temporal lobe
syndrome; many temporal lobe epileptics have been deeply creative or
intuitive, cf. Dostoyevski or van Gogh (slightly debated, could be
bipolar disorder instead). The hippocampus is likely involved in our
context binding process and memory encoding. If it is affected by
something, then we could expect that the normal bindings of context
and experience are changed, which might influence creativity by making
it more fluid. 

An interesting find I found on Medline (I haven't read it):
"Undergraduate marijuana use as related to internal sensation novelty
seeking and openness to experience" by Eisenman R, Grossman JC,
Goldstein R J Clin Psychol 1980 Oct;36(4):1013-1019 says that "after 2
years of use, expressed boredom with the environment decreased
significantly". This supports my guess that cannabinoids make novelty
detectors fire more. Another find on Medline supports the idea that
associations become more fluid:

Marijuana effects on associative processes.  Psychopharmacology (Berl)
1985;85(4):426-430 Block RI, Wittenborn JR

	Acute marijuana effects on associative processes involved in
	long-term memory retrieval were studied. Results were
	partially consistent with expectations based on previous
	subjective reports that marijuana promotes more uncommon
	associations. Marijuana altered responses when people gave as
	many examples of a specified category (e.g., CLOTHING) as they
	could for 2 min, and when they gave an example of a specified
	category beginning with a specified letter (e.g., WEAPON -
	G). Reaction time in the latter task and in prior studies was
	not altered in the expected manner, a finding problematic for
	some theoretic interpretations of marijuana's effects on
	associative processes.

In addition, the drug affects the basal ganglia. I'm not that familiar
with them but they seem to be deeply involved in our planning and
acting abilities, both by building up new behavior patterns and
inhibiting patterns before they are to be used. If they are affected,
then they might become less inhibiting, setting free new and unusual
patterns that would otherwise have been suppressed.

However, one should be careful to test these hypotheses. For example,
the following paper did not find any increase in creativity:

Marijuana effects on associations to novel stimuli.  J Nerv Ment Dis
1978 May;166(5):362-364 Tinklenberg JR, Darley CF, Roth WT,
Pfefferbaum A, Kopell BS

	Sixteen college-educated male subjects were given an object
	description task during placebo conditions and while
	intoxicated with marijuana extract cookies calibrated to 0.3
	mg/kg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a dose within the range of
	usual social use. The task was scored for fluency,
	flexibility, elaboration, and uniqueness, all of which
	represent associational thinking and are considered to be
	components of creativity. Marijuana did not enhance any of
	these measures.

Something similar was reported in this paper, which instead suggests
that it is the pleasant and social effects that are important:

The effect of marijuana on small group process. Am J Drug Alcohol
Abuse 1977;4(2):251-255 Salzman C, Kochansky GE, Van Der Kolk BA,
Shader RI

	In a research group setting, marijuana increased
	social-emotional interpersonal communication and decreased
	task-oriented behavior. Following a frustration stimulus,
	groups of marijuana smokers appeared nonintoxicated and showed
	improvement in consensus problem solving.  Interpersonal
	behavior with marijuana may depend in part, on the presence or
	absence of demand characteristics for task
	performance. Creativity in group problem solving was not
	improved by marijuana.

A good point. Unfortunately the cannabinoids as they stand today seem
to be rather crude tools for enhancing creativity. The studies above
are not necessarily the last word, but they suggest that the
cannabinoid induced creative experience may just a subjective
experience of creativity, not something that actually produces more
creative results (I admit that measuring creativity is at best hard
and in itself somewhat subjective). We cannot trust our subjective
experiences to reflect the objective world, we need to check them
carefully.

Yes, but I doubt most of us would regard Gabapentin and other drugs
against the above illnesses as very transhuman, They are just useful
tools to live a healthy life, and cannabinoids would belong in that
group of limited transhuman applications in this respect. What makes
the cannabinoids more interesting is of course the mental effects, and
the question of whether they can really be useful.

> I think we need a lot more serious, unbiased studies to fully understand

True. But I think it might be a good idea to start with the
cannabinoids themselves since they are less controversial - they do
exist, they have objective, measurable effects and can be studied
using the normal psychopharmacological methods. Given these data we
can get a better knowledge of the potential.

Definitely. And I usually have my best ideas in quite altered
states. It is just that I do not need drugs to get there (thank
Heisenberg for my personal mix of receptor protein genes! :-)

Well, we european transhumanists have to meet somewhere, don't we? :-)

Anders:

All the pitfalls you mention do exist.

Nonetheless, all the studies you've mentioned sound to me as if they lack
enough of an individual motivator to really test the creativity hypothesis.
Set and setting, remember?

But if all a truly creative person lacks is just a _little_ tweak to their
serotonin and dopamine sites, and they apply their changed state to
projects which truly matter to them...
how to test that?

Eminently reasonable. And not contradicted by anything I've said. :) I did
_fail_ to say that. The people I know who get value are people who do
indeed plan before they act. :)

Agreed. This is particularly at issue because cannabis appears to affect
what I call "flow of the first kind"--absorption. A consequence of this is
that one can become absorbed in _anything_, and if one has an agenda, it's
important to check for mismatch during the experience and redirect
attention appropriately.

It's also important to get perspective by comparing your results with your
intentions _after_ you're back at baseline.

Furthermore, flow of the first kind is _rudimentary_ flow. I have a lot
more to say about this, but it's not ready for publication yet. :)

That's a toughie, because of the set and setting issues. White lab coats
and arbitrary goals can squeeze all the results flat. The missing piece
here is, I suspect, a kind of discipline that some so-inclined people
manage to work out for themselves. Codifying this as part of a long-term
study might provide more evidence than was obtained feeding students
cookies in a lab and giving them a test.

Tim Starr <TimStarr@netcom.com> asked me for corroboration of the 
proposition that J. Edgar Hoover was the most evil man in American history.


Let's look at that:

Stalin's and Beria's NKVD; Hitler's and Mueller's GESTAPO;  Hoover's FBI:

All of these organizations of social control were similarly structured.

The evils of the NKVD and the Gestapo require no introduction to 
libertarians.  Well, Hoover's FBI was America's Gestapo.

The NKVD, the Gestapo and the FBI all combine omnipresent social control; 
ideological control; specialized policing functions;; and -- most 
dangerous of all -- counterespionage functions.

The combination of counterespionage (NOT counterintelligence) and internal 
policing is extraordinarily hazardous to the survival of a free society.  
Free societies are unpredictable; and are made up of unpredictable people 
who have their own aims and ideas. This is _anathema_ to the 
social-control mentality.


We all see the world (quite literally) mediated through a perceptual and 
cognitive framework which is structured by our ideas about it.  A hungry 
man sees possible sources of food; a cold, wet man sees possible places of 
shelter; a frightened man sees possible threats.


(As Popper says: It is often thought that we are bad -- perhaps even 
wicked; and we are also clever; and it is this combination of badness and 
cleverness that is at the root of humankind's problems.  As aginst this 
(says Popper): we are good (perhaps even too good): but we are also rather 
stupid.  And it is this combination of goodness and stupidity that 
underlies most of our problems.  This second view has the great advantage, 
that we know more about enlightening peoples' stupidity than we know about 
correcting their evil).


A policeman sees potential offences and offenders everywhere.  A 
counterespionage man sees everything as a potential threat -- possibly 
something other than what it _appears_ to be (see 'The Wilderness of 
Mirrors' by David Martin or Ed Epstein's 'Deception' for an immersion 
course). This is exactly analogous to the occult Weltanschaung or 
World-View, and incorporates a Manichaean 'good-vs-evil' polarization; 
with the added twist that fair can always be 'really' foul, and foul can 
always be 'really' fair.

This is profoundly corrupting and perilous psychological territory.  Many 
counterespionagw controllers reckon that three or four years is about all 
that anyone can handle before their thinking becomes pervaded by a 
paranoid 'sick-think.'

Worse: the counterespionage chief practices deception all the time, which 
is _morally_ hazardous.

Worse still:  all internal-security chiefs end up thinking that they know 
best what is going on in society, _and what is best for other people_. 
They cannot explain _why_ they know better, because "it's a secret" -- and 
because their world-view is so at variance with everyday reality that 
'no-one will understand us anyway.'  

(Compare and contrast: James Jesus Angleton (CIA _Counterintelligence_ 
chief) spent four hours one day explaining his version of 'the big 
picture' to Bill Colby (DCI); and Colby said afterwards that he simply 
couldn't even _understand_ it, never mind accept or reject it.  Bill Colby 
was really bright (and well-versed in covert operations)).


Worst of all: because they see the worst elements in society, and then, in 
the worst possible light, they see society as under mortal and multiple 
sustained _threats;  and they are the only ones who stand between an 
egshell-like 'normality' and horrifying chaos.  They then justify what 
they're doing (i.e. anything) by saying:  "We do this so that ordinary, 
decent people can sleep safely in their beds at night" (John le Carre).

Like the people at Waco?

Ask yourself what sort of person is drawn into this sort of vocation.


Hoover may well have started by doing some good work, and with the best of 
intentions.  But so did Heinrich Mueller (from his own point of view). 
However, he became aware of the extraordinary powers conferred by being 
the President's eyes and ears.  Then, the files on politicians -- full of 
all those incriminating and salacious tit-bits -- steadily built up. 
Hoover was soon 'hooked' on hard-core political pornography (including 
'kiddie-porn' -- 90% of U.S. 'kiddie-porn' is under FBI or State control).


Hoover's intelligence-gathering ambitions steadily extended, first to 
Latin America, then -- megalomaniacally -- to the _entire world_.  He 
fought tooth-and-nail to get CIA strangled at birth, as a potential rival, 
and as a threat to his monopoly of information. (See 'The Wedge' on the 
CIA-FBI wars). Clearly, if he had been able to monopolize 
intelligence-gathering, analysis, reporting (including via a vast network 
of servile media assests), political blackmail and entrapment, and 
policing powers, he would be the diametric opposite of everything the 
Framers of the Constitution sought for a free society.  He directly 
abrogated the Separation of Powers.  In actuality, for most significant 
purposes, he _directly controlled_ the United States (including via 
servile political proxies like McCarthy and Nixon).


Hoover openly boasted that he owned and controlled the Communist Party of 
the United States of America.  50% of CPUSA members were agents or 
informers.  That didn't stop him using it to orchestrate vast 'Red Scares' 
(see i.e David Caute, 'The Great Fear'), so as to gain extra illicit 
powers for himself and the State he also owned and controlled.  Perhaps 
this is why he wanted Japanese-Americans remaining at large -- to whip up 
'Yellow Peril' scares.  If you read Hoover's -- aptly-named -- book 'the 
Masters of Deceit', it's clear that he hates communism for all its 
democratic and libertarian bits, not the 'social-control' aspect.


Hoover _organized_ 'Organized Crime', which can only survive with 
State-conferred approval -- approval that only Hoover could confer.

Hoover operated the -- clever -- 'no-empty-rooms' scheme, whereby _every_ 
significant alternative political niche was colonized by the FBI.  Then, 
in the second stage, Hoover spread this fact about -- the 
'agent-behind-every-mailbox' tactic -- so as to to disillusion and 
dispirit actual and potential political activists, and make organized 
political resistance appear to be _impossible_


And no-one _dared_ openly to defy him, because he could ruin their life, 
and/or murder or otherwise destroy people.  As he -- very publicly -- 
murdered the Kennedys.  And Martin Luther King. And Jean Seberg.  And 
_hundreds_ of other radical political activists and intellectuals -- an 
official serial-kiling spree that only slowed and near-stopped when Hoover 
died of old age (or whatever).

The extended authoritarian extreme-Right subculture of social control 
freaks that Hoover spawned and bred _still_ plagues America (and American 
'law-enforcement'; and American politics -- especially Republican 
politics; and the media).


    Can anyone point to anyone more evil in America's entire history?

    And who did more to destroy the Constitution?

    And whose authoritarianism nearly cost us the Battle for the World?


    Judge William Webster was no libertarian.  Yet his first act as FBI 
    Director was to seize the bust of Hoover its prominent place in the J. 
    Edgar Hoover Building's  Reception Area, take it out into the street, 
    and contemptuously hurl it into the gutter.

    It's about time we did the same with Hoover's entire grotesque and 
    morally filthy social-control legacy.  Janet Reno please note!

Could you explain what metric this is?  I was aghast a few months ago to
find that both my blood pressure and cholesterol levels were dangerously
high (I'm a skinny coot who gets around by bicycle and foot).  Cutting out
full-cream milk/cheese and butter and avocados (sob) and the like, and
walking fairly briskly for a few klicks most days, have enabled me to get
both parameters down by about a third.  But here in Oz we measure high
density lioproteins separately from the dangerous low density lps, that
ideally (I gather) ought to be about 3.5, and invoke a magic ratio between
the two.  My LDL is currently 6.3 [somethings] (was 8.9, 12 weeks back)
with a ratio of 4.8.  How does this map onto the US measure?

Well, there WAS a fellow back in the 1860s who actually brought this 
country to open warfare to defend the primacy of the national 
government over any lesser entity and over the Constitution.

1)   THE DEFENSE OF THE SPECIES

1a)  Our species, HomoSapiens, arose from the stuff of beasts. Perhaps
as little as a few
     hundred thousand years ago.  Before that time the earth was
populated with two or
     maybe more species that had the potential to become what we are
today.  Those other
     proto-human species did not survive the fire of evolution.
Perhaps we killed them,
     perhaps they succumbed due to an unknown deficit or lack of
resilience.  Nonetheless,
     they are gone.  We will not go.  We are now endowed with tools
that will overcome the
     fire and enable us to change.  To change our environment and to
change ourselves.

1b)  We have the power to direct the next step in our evolution.  If
we do not take initiative
     and mold our future, nature will do it for us.  We are a loose
cannon on the evolutionary
     timetable, we have effectively stifled the mechanisms for change
due to our social
     behavior.  Therefore if left to it's own devices, Nature will
destroy mankind.  It will
     cleanse the earth of our menace and replace us with a less
intelligent more predictable
     docile creature.

1c)  The path to intelligence that our species has taken is a road
seldom traveled, it is only
     available to a species under the direst circumstances.  When
those circumstances of the
     environment are such that it requires less effort to make a
species intelligent that it does
     to make them something else.  An extremely rare serendipity

1d)  Now that we have this weapon, intelligence, we must use it in our
defense.  Against the
     forces of evolution that would destroy us.  We must weald the
sword of intelligence in
     defiance of the Luddite mentality that will inevitably arise in
societies, religions and
     governments as resistance to the new man.  We must use this tool
to form a new
     species.  We must mold our evolution to produce an altered man.
One who improves
     the best of the best of our attributes both physical and social.
One that in turn will
     continue the process of species improvement on it's own.

2)   OUR BODIES

2a)  HomoSapiens are ill equipped physically to maintain existence for
very long.  We have
     within our structure subsystems that are fragile, any of which
have the potential to cause
     our death.  

2a1) Our respiratory system does double duty.  It is used to oxygenate
our blood and enable
     our verbal  communication.  We have no backup system in the event
of failure.  Nature
     has given us nothing to fall back on as a crutch to keep us going
in the event of a minor
     malfunction.  Respiratory distress is a major cause of death.  It
only take a few moments
     visiting hospital wards to realize that a solution must be found.
Millions of people both
     infant and aged suffer and strangle in their sickbeds gasping for
a tiny breath.  One tiny
     wheeze of oxygen to fill their lungs, when a better engineering
job could heal them, and
     send them on their way.  

2a2) By combining these two uses, nature has given us a tripwire to
our own destruction. 
     The path to our lungs is intersected with the path to our
digestive systems. A deadly
     combination.  Intelligence will  enable us to devise a
technological solution.       
     Mechanisms can be invented and installed that will provide
oxygenation on a continuous
     basis, thereby freeing us from this dangerous intersection.
Others can be installed that
     will control airflow over our vocal cords enabling us to speak.
An improved man thus
     altered will then become a master of many environments.  He can
live and work in the
     depths of the sea, and in the emptiness of space.  The limitation
to our expansion into
     these realms will then become a matter of pressure compensation,
a problem we are
     already able to technologically solve to a great extent. 

2a3) Our Renal system is also very fragile.  We already have in use
huge devices that
     inadequately filter toxins and excess fluids from our blood.  The
technologies must be
     improved to the point where one structure may be unintrusively
installed in our bodies
     with adequate backup making our Livers and Kidneys obsolete.
Such an improved man
     will no longer suffer and die from the myriad of minor events
that currently kill millions
     of people worldwide.

2a4) We need more than one heart.  Perhaps as many as four that each
have the ability to
     maintain blood flow throughout our circulatory systems.  One for
each lung and one for
     each Femoral Artery in our legs.  Heart attacks will disappear,
or become a minor
     nuisance easily resolved.  Minor blockages will no longer be life
threatening.  Our
     bodies already have mechanisms to reroute blood vessels in the
event of blockage.  The
     altered man will now have time to let those new pathways grow on
their own without
     the threat of death in the interim.    

2a5) With the invention of a workable nerve/mechanism interface we
will be free from the
     limitations of structure in our bodies as a whole.  A thus
altered human will be essentially a
     brain and spinal cord with life support structure.  Able to be
plugged directly into
     anything from a earthmoving machine to a spaceship.  Man at this
point will be free to
     roam any environment, and he will become the master of all.

2a6) We carry with us evolutionary baggage.  Attributes both physical
and social that
     originated in that Odd Little Primate.  Evolution is a violent
and bloody process, full of
     stress and horror and gnashing of teeth.  Our bodies are built
for fight or flight and not
     suited to calm easy times.  Likewise our behavioral attributes
are built for conflict.  We
     Hate and Fear and Lust and are full of Self Pity because it comes
naturally to us.  They
     are the four basic instincts.  They are also attributes we should
leave behind on our way
     to the next evolutionary plateau.  

2a7) Recognize them for what they are.  Keep watch on your emotions.  

2a8) You will not succeed in mastering them, because they are
ingrained in the structure of
     your body.  Some control however is better than none.  In the
millions of years to come
     the creature that will evolve from us, may at long last be free
of them.  There      
     unfortunately is no guarantee that our species will survive to
change.  We may be    
     another of life's dead ends.  On the way we may also be destined
for devolution, a return
     to the wild, ignorant, savage, and Odd Little Primate.  Not the
first species to cause its
     own extinction.

2a9) The decedents of that Odd Little Primate developed language.
This miracle caused a
     giant leap forward in our evolution.  A brain without language is
a confused stewpot of
     emotions, images, and instincts.  Without any structure
consistent from one individual to
     another.  It was as if the brain was a clean unformatted hard
drive.  It had lots of storage
     space, but no consistent way to retrieve data, and no method of
recording anything
     complex.  Language is the disk operating system of the brain.  It
allows for consistent
     retrieval of data by structuring the way each bit of information
is stored.  It allows more
     than one individual to share complex information.  It allows them
to learn from each
     other.

3)   OURSELVES

3a)  Faith is a commendable asset, only when it is based on truth.  It
is described as the proof
     of things unseen, the "I know that I know that I know."  Bad
faith is one based on a
     falsehood.  It is a set of beliefs that result in injury or
limitation to the advancement of
     the species.  Good faith is any set of beliefs that reinforce the
species in it's quest for
     truth.  

3a1) I have faith that my children will be good people, yet I know
that bad people come from
     good loving parents sometimes, yet I believe.  I have seen my
children mature from
     infants to young men and women.  I have seen their tears, and
their concern for people
     other than themselves.  So I have faith and  am comforted by it.


3a2) I have faith that science will search for the truth in all
matters, yet I know that  
     falsehoods sometimes become politically or financially expedient,
yet I believe.  I know
     that falsehoods eventually fall under the yoke of independent
verification.  Vindication
     will come to the truth.  Sometimes later than it should, but it
always comes.  So I have
     faith and am comforted by it.

3b)  Humans have an almost infinite capacity for self delusion.  I
know this to be true.  I
     therefore have no faith in other peoples miracles, I only have
faith in my own.  Life itself
     is a miracle, in which I believe.  Language is a miracle. DNA is
a miracle.  Intelligence is
     a miracle.  The structure of matter and the laws by which the
universe is constructed are
     miracles.  The fact that mankind arose from such humble fibre as
an Odd Little Primate,
     is the biggest miracle of all.  

3c)  How can good be defined as anything more or less than this.  Good
is anything that has
     the effect of insuring the survival or prosperity of the species
in part or as a whole.  Bad
     is anything that has the opposite effect.  A cultural or
religious definition of good and
     bad has no meaning at all.  Cultures rise and fall, religions
continually redefine   
     themselves with every generation.  There is a truth, that can
easily be found.  It is self
     evident.  Every honest human instinctively knows it.  It is not
dictated by religious or
     cultural bias, although it might be reinforced by them.  These
are the seven basic truths.  

3c1) Death is Bad. All humans while alive have the potential for good.
The premature ending
     of another's life has the effect of destroying that potential, of
preventing it from ever
     maturing into reality.  It ends all comfort they might have given
to those around them.  It
     stops the growth to intellectual or social enlightenment.  It is
the finish to discovery for
     the individual.  By ending another's life we cancel any benefit
the species might have
     enjoyed by the existence of this member.  Conversely anything we
do that has the
     potential for increasing our lifespan or the lifespan of the
species is good. 

3c2) Abuse of another except in self-defense is bad.  No human being
should ever harm
     another, by violence, by emotional distress, or by verbal attack.
To do so causes an
     injury to the species as a whole.  Any victim of this abuse is
rendered less productive,
     and more introspective by the experience.  When we are occupied
with "licking our
     wounds" we can not benefit the species.  Everyone has the
obligation to protect
     themselves and fellow members of their human family from any such
intrusion, perceived
     or real.  Defense against abuse is good.  Reinforcement of
another is good.  

3c3) Species Classification is bad.  We are all members of one human
family, the species
     Homo Sapiens.  We are all decedents of the same Odd Little
Primate that emerged from
     the African continent in the distant past.  We share the same
genetic code with all
     ethnicities, nationalities, and religious groups.  Separate is
not equal.  Any action or
     belief that has the result of creating an "Us and Them" mentality
between humans only
     strangles one group or the other from realizing it's own
potential.  Tolerance of those
     you perceive to be different than yourself is good.  

3c4) Ignorance is Bad.  Growth of the species can only happen if the
current generation is
     able to stand on the shoulders of the preceding one.  We can
learn from our ancestors
     mistakes.  Only by learning can we progress.  We must learn in
order to survive.  We
     must also teach.  We must teach the young everything we have
learned from our
     progenitors plus everything we have gleaned from our life so that
we might form a
     foundation for them to stand upon in their quest for more
knowledge. This is critical for
     the survival of the species.  No ethnicity, nationality or
religious group can be excluded
     from this obligation.  Potential for advancement in every field
is evenly distributed
     among all races, and nationalities.  This potential can not be
realized if every generation
     consumes it's life relearning lessons that were common knowledge
to previous    
     generations.  My children are obligated to be more intelligent
than I.  Just as I am      
     obligated to be more intelligent than my ancestors.  Learning is
good.  

3c5) Lying is bad. All humans must be endowed with a thirst for truth.
Deception is evil
     whether it is directed to the individual or to the whole.  It
robs potential by bringing into
     existence a spiraling vortex of error that wastes time causing
deception to compound
     deception until the very concept of truth is weakened.  It
rattles it's ugly chains thru the
     species as a whole.  There is no little white lie, there are only
big monstrous ones. 
     Goodness and truth are the same thing.  

3c6) Self destructive habits are bad. Your life must be spent for the
advancement of the
     species, or you are just excess baggage.  Any activity you engage
in that cuts short the
     length of your life limits your potential for good.  It prevents
your efforts from ever
     coming to a successful conclusion.  The only successful human is
the one that advanced
     the species during or because of his or her life.  Failure is the
wasting away of potential. 
     Realization of potential is good.

3c7) Theft is bad.  It doesn't matter whether the stolen thing is an
idea, an object, or the
     affection of another, it is evil and has the effect of causing
strife within the species and
     will result in any or all of the other bad things.  It can be the
cause for Murder.  It is a
     form of abuse to another member of your species.  It can be the
cause of hate for those
     you perceive as different from yourself.  It is ignorant, a lie
and a self destructive habit.  

3d)  Ignorance is the birthplace of all evil, and will if unchecked be
the ultimate cause of the
     extinction of the Species of Man..

Poorly.  The US does LDL/HDL ratios too.  180 is considered a "desirable"
cholesterol level in the way a 3.5 LDL/HDL ratio is, but they're different.
You can have a high ratio and a low cholesterol or vice versa.
There is a correlation in that a good cholesterol level *usually* comes
with a good ratio.

However, 135 is in the very low range and would be like a 2 - 2.5 ratio in
terms of risk.

It  doesn't matter to me if some experiences seem only an illusion. The
resulting thoughts and actions are all I can measure. It seems that if I limit
my use of hemp to sessions where I'm exorcising my creative best, the results
are very productive and insightful. Often, I find myself almost too detail
oriented and as an art lover, its the details where I think some of the most
ingenious ingredients are found. ...so I tolerate the obsessive nature of the
experience.

On a different tangent, I'd be willing to try a synthetic drug if I thought
that I could get similar results minus the negative effects of hemp. (oh yes,
there are undesirable side effects, the worst being dehydration)

As a neural scientist, what does hemp do that causes dehydration? Ever heard of
cotton mouth?? Are there herbal supplements that I can eat which would help
combat that effect??

 I don't have my references handy, so I can't give a quantitative
picture, but I have a pretty good memory of what chimps in the wild
have been observed to eat. Besides all the fruit they can stuff in
their greedy little mouths, they eat regularly or opportunistically:

* carrion
* small animals
* termites and other insects
* grubs

And on rare occasions, chimp, as has been pointed out.

Mountain gorillas eat more greens than chimps do, and less animal 
flesh.

This is pretty pointless, really, unless you're interested in primate 
diet for its own sake or just like to argue with militant vegetarians. 

Oh, and Gorilla gorilla is coprophagic, also -- his intestinal flora 
synthesize a B-vitamin that he can't synthesize otherwise. That might
help dissuade the next person who insists we should be eating a gorilla 
diet.

A non herbal solution is to get some Tums (I prefer the fruity
kind), tuck one in
each cheek. Slow to dissolve, stimulates saliva, lasts a long
time (I get dry mouth while sleeping, and the Tums will last all
night)

I knew translating from legal logic to commonsensical English was
a challenge, but now I have a new appreciation of the degree of 
difficulty.

As a Southerner, an Indian, and a project manager, I have a tremendous
affinity for lost causes (the effects are multiplicative). I really
must work on this.

I don't have a dog either. My dog is trained to bark at lawyers. If he 
bit you, he wasn't my dog. If we can settle for what my insurance 
company is willing to pay, we can get out of here in time for lunch.

Sheesh :-)

Hi everyone,
   I'm new to this list having just discovered it, I wonder if any
extropian gurus would like to walk me me through my first faltering steps
in to the world of extropy. My interests are nanotechnology and "uploading"
(I think that's the correct term). I'm afraid I've never used a list before
so I'm not even sure if I'm subscribed properly, you might want to mail me
back direct.You tell me a bit about yourself and I'll do likewise and we'll
go from there.

I just finished James Halperin's "The First Immortal", and to be
quite frank, I loved it. (@@@@)

I would love to start a discussion on it, but I guess I'll wait a
couple of weeks to avoid spoiling...... (get it?)

I see it is in development as an upcoming mini-series, if done
properly, IMMHO it could change the future of cryonics.

I am currently researching insurance policys for my signup, State
Farm quoted me $59.00 a month for a $50,000.00 Universal whole life
policy (I'm a 40 year old male/nonsmoker in excellent health.) I
would be interested in anyone out there (even insurance agents ;)
) with any advice. I would also be interested in a $120,000.00
policy (ALCOR whole body price?)

I'm thinking whole body patients may be revived first, then I could
get to work on the rest of you/us.  ;)

As some of you  already know, there have beed discussions about 
creating a World Tranhumanist Association. The good news is that 
we have now reached the stage where we can make an inofficial 
announcement and invite participation from the transhumanist 
community. Together we have a unique pool of talents that I hope will 
make this a big success and allow us to have an impact :-)

---------------------------------------------------
MISSION STATEMENT
The WTA was founded in 1998 with the aim of turning transhumanism 
into a mainstream academic discipline. The WTA seeks to promote 
research into the science and philosophy of the future; to encourage 
reasoned debate; and to facilitate the exchange of ideas between 
researchers on all transhumanist themes. We work to increase public 
awareness of the benefits, but also the risks, of the technologies by 
which humanity will seek to overcome its biological limitations.

The WTA publishes the Journal of Transhumanism; organizes conferences;
promotes informed media coverage; provides information resources on
its web pages; and supports networking within the transhumanist
community.
----------------------------------------------------

We need members (membership will be free) but above all we need 
persons who want to take an active part in shaping the WTA. The 
content is still very preliminary. The WTA web site will be at 
http://www.transhumanism.com; it is under construction but you can 
already find more information about the WTA there.

If you want to get actively involved, please send me an email. At the 
moment we are especially looking for persons who can take 
responsibility for some part of the web pages, assist in the graphic 
design, create a WTA logo, or implement features such as mailing 
lists and threaded discussion archives.

I will continue to post updates on how the WTA develops... (I am 
quite excited about this...)

There are several resources on the Internet to get more familiar with some of
the ideas you mentioned.  A good starting point is Ander's Transhuman site at
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/ which contains enough material to keep you busy for

Er, isn't this a bit of an over-simplification? I am not an astrophysicist,
however I vaguely recall reading a fair bit lately about head-scratching
over the initial era of expansion, and some suggestions (does the name
Linde mean anything?) that it was driven by a one-off particle which
subsequently disappeared behind an event horizon, creating yet another
universe, to repeat the process all over again ad infinitum -- indeed,
that our universe is just one of an infinite fractal foam of universes,
all budding off one another whenever and wherever a singularity is
formed. There's also been some muttering along the lines that this
implies that universes that spawn lots of black holes are evolutionarily
fit and will give rise to lots of children, and that our particular
set-up (which permits massive stars, atomic nucleosynthesis, and 
supernovae) is particularly well-tuned for this.

Or have I grasped the wrong end of the stick ...?

I missed that part.

But it seems to me that there is quiet a bit of "stretching" going on.  

Eric Lerner in "The Big Bang Never Happened" provided a logical (to me)
alternative explanation to the physical evidence that is purported to identify
black holes...that is...trans galactic electrical currents producing enormous
magnetic fields which cause the same effects as Quasars...(massive energy
release...jets..etc)...

And I still don't get how it's ok for faster than light "expansion" then but
not now.

Or how conservaton of mass energy  applies to anything which exits the
universe thereby making the universe a NON closed system.  Be it the purported
black holes...of quantum fluctuations producing  hydrogen nucluei one at a
time...evenly spaced everywhere...etc...

First of all let me admit that I haven't read Lerner's book and I think it's  
possible that electrical effects have been underestimated when explaining 
large scale structures in the universe, but unless he says where the energy 
came from to produce the gargantuan electrical currents needed then he's just 
kicking the problem upstairs. Black Holes have no trouble explaining this, 
gravitational collapse into a mathematical point will give you all the energy 
you want.

It's OK now. There may still be stars in the universe moving away from us 
faster than light, it's just that their light will be redshifted by an 
infinite amount so we'll never see it. Relativity doesn't say it's impossible 
to move faster than light, it just says you can't send matter, energy or 
information between two points faster, and an expanding universe does not do
this.

Quantum Mechanics has modified the law of conservation of mass energy, it is 
passable to borrow mass energy from nothing, but you must pay it back, and 
the more you borrow the shorter you can keep it.

I liked it a lot, too, and in fact I started reading it again right after
I had finished it the first time.  However my son is reading it now so I
didn't finish my re-read.

One of the big problems in any 21st century SF which incorporates nanotech
and similar advances is how to avoid the Singularity - the acceleration of
advancement into a pace so furious that the world becomes unrecognizable.
It appears that Halperin has no more than postponed the Singularity, as
it looks unlikely to me that humanity will come out of his 22nd century
in any kind of recognizable form.

Halperin has a couple of tricks to slow the rate of technology advance.
One is to put restrictions on AI research.  Some early AI machines become
aggressive and kill people, and after that they are not supposed to be
programmed with emotions or survival instincts.  They're just a bunch of
Vulcan types.  They do become much smarter than humans over the course
of the 21st century, but presumably these restrictions do limit their
rate of advance.

The other magic which Halperin has up his sleeve is his Truth Machine.
This was the subject of his first novel, which I haven't read.  The device
is a foolproof lie detector, and it allows laws to be enforced with a
certainty far beyond anything which would be reasonable today.

Once there is a world government armed with the truth machine, they
can pass laws restricting access to nanotech (and presumably any other
destabilizing technologies) and be sure they are enforced.  This prevents
various technology runaway scenarios, both good and bad.

Not having read the first novel, I find the potential for abuse with a
truth machine very troubling.  It is presented in almost purely beneficial
terms, but obviously it could be misused as well.  The idea reminds me
somewhat of David Brin's "transparent society", where you have a Big
Brother-like monitoring system, but it's OK because the people doing the
monitoring get monitored, too.  The danger is that if an evil person somehow
got into power, he'd be able to use these technologies to maintain his
power very effectivelly.  No revolt or rebellion could be hidden.

In effect this kind of technology is a power amplifier.  Whoever has the
bulk of power in society can use this to enforce their will.  If the mass
of people ultimately has the power, then in many ways the truth machine
will be beneficial, as they can prevent evil people from seizing power
away from them.  On the other hand, where the masses misuse their power,
there won't be the limitations on their abilities that we have today.
The majority of people in the United States believes in conventional
religious morality, but if it wants to legislate on that basis, in
practice it can't control people's private lives very well.  A truth
machine would change that.

> I see it is in development as an upcoming mini-series, if done
> properly, IMMHO it could change the future of cryonics.

I'm a little skeptical about this, having seen many efforts fail in the
past which were going to change the future of cryonics.  For example,
Omni magazine had a reasonably well promoted contest where the prize was
"immortality" - a cryonic suspension contract with Alcor.  This was a
big jump into the mainstream, especially with the idea of cryonics as
a prize, a reward, not some kooky perversion.  However it was not much
of a success; there weren't many entries, and I think most people were
just not ready for it.

I thought Halperin's novel was most effective in depicting a 21st century
where we'd like to live, and where technology really does advance to
the point where it solves many of our most difficult problems.  I was
uncomfortable when it took on a scolding tone, shaking its head over how
blind people were in the late 20th century not to sign up for cryonics.
This reminds me too much of a temperance tract regaling us with the
evils of Demon Alcohol.

Science fiction authors often succumb to the temptation to have their
future characters talk about the mistakes of the 20th century - if
only they'd taken care of the environment, or if only they'd been more
socialist, no, if only they'd been more capitalist, etc.  I never find
this realistic (how much time do we spend talking about the mistakes of
the 1890's?), and even when it does fit, I don't necessarily think the
future characters are right (people today disagree over the morality
of the "robber barons" of the 19th century, even with 100 years of
hindsight).

Halperin doesn't overdo this, fortunately.  If his novel is a success
then it probably will help to make cryonics more acceptable.  But I
suspect that it will be many years before it becomes truly mainstream.

The statement was made that in a future where MNT reached its full potential
(as described by Drexler) that the only commodity (scarce resource) would be
creativity.  I am not comfortable with this statement.  The underlying
assumption in the statement is artificial intelligence will not be able to be
creative.  I am not a cognition expert but I am not so sure that we should
attribute creativity exclusively to humans.  As I undestand it, we do not have
a thorough understanding of how creativity works.  If this is the case I think
it is premature to assume that artificial intelligence in the future will not
be able to be creative.

This entire issue gets back to the strong AI/weak AI issue.  I believe this is
the most significant issue when speculating on how the future will look.  If
creativity is a computable problem, meaning if it could be manifested by some
algorithm, then even weak AI could be creative.  If creativity is some result
of brain functions entirely alien to computation then it is still possible that
it could result from the cognitive activities of a strong AI entity.  Thus it
appears its possible that in a MNT future that creativity could be a commodity
but only in a weak AI future where creativity turns out to be a noncomputable
function.

Anders cites Biol Psychiatry 1980 Dec;15(6):841-858:
< Where comparisons could be made, the performance of
these "temporal lobe" [impaired] patients paralleled
the performance of subjects acutely intoxicated with
known doses of delta 9-THC. >

There is a difference between 'acute intoxication'
and dosages desirable for nootropic purposes. 
Simplistic analogy: the difference between the
'loosening up' seen in someone who has had 'just a
couple' of alcoholic drinks, versus the
unconsciousness seen in someone who has had 'too
many' drinks.

Anders, later:
< The problem with drug experiences (or for that
matter a lot of our subjective experiences) is that
they are highly unreliable - how much of the effects
are real, and how much is just delusion? >

Is it delusion, or merely annecdotal, when certain
affects are replicated time after time over many
years of trials, under many different environmental
conditions, especially when the subject has
attempted, with varying levels of success, to achieve
this affect with other substances and methods?

Perhaps the more serious delusion is the belief that
useful information can be obtained primarily by
chemical studies of the effects of a single substance
without sufficient regard to the "set and setting"
influences that Michael mentions.

< What I worry about is that so many simply accept
that the subjective very positive results correspond
with real positive results - as a scientist, I want
to find good evidence for that before I start
endorsing it as a transhuman technology. >

Some real positive results: 
(a) greater interest in and responsiveness to the
stories and activities of a child than is otherwise
the case after a long day of work and study (as
measured by that most important of objective
measures, 'sparkle in the eyes', as well as
documented retention of concepts covered); 
(b) contrary to the study of college students cited,
greater fluency, flexibility and elaboration of
literary expression (in personal journals - as
validated at later times while in 'sober' and/or
critical modes.) 

On the other hand, I've seen no evidence that the
substance in question has any positive impact on
ones' ability to perform mathematical or logical
calculations; although, a little attitude adjustment
is sometimes helpful for finding the logical (or
syntactical) bug that has been 'hiding' in that
program all day. How would psychologists (or
neuroscientists!) set up tests to measure the
'causes' of that type of 'ah hah!' experience, I
wonder?

Notice that the new metal-vapour lamps offer a sol-like spectrum (brands
with emission maxima up to 10 kK and beyond are available), while having
similiar efficiencies as fluorescents. So far, they are quite expensive,
since low-volume (expensive car headlights & professional illumination)
and requiring an electronic gadget to operate them. Price trend looks
good, though.

Btw, I've heard they are great for seawater aquaria, e.g. for corals.
While hydroponic hirises are silly, subterraneous (subselenous?)
ecosystems are not. Rad load and danger of explosive decompression would
seem to require gopher mode for extraterrestrial settlements.

This is a slightly dated story (3 months old) but its interesting and a bit
amusing.  In a contest of sorts, two competitors, one a human music professor
and the other a computer program, were asked to write Bach-like musical
pieces.  An audience then heard three pieces: one composed by the human
professor, one composed by the computer program, and one composed by Bach
himself.  The audience concluded that the piece actually written by the human
professor was written by the computer program, the piece actually written by
the computer program was written by Bach, and that the Bach piece was written
by the computer program.  An interesting state of affairs... (pardon the size
of the article)

date    : Saturday 29 November 1997
source  : New York Times
headline: Music by the numbers
reporter: George Johnson

In a low-key, musical version of the match between Garry Kasparov and
the
chess-playing machine called Deep Blue, a musician at the University of
Oregon competed last month with a computer to compose music in the style
of Johann Sebastian Bach. Dr. Steven Larson, who teaches music theory at
the university, listened anxiously while his wife, the pianist Winifred
Kerner, performed three entries in the contest -- one by Bach, one by
Larson and one by a computer program called EMI, or Experiments in
Musical
Intelligence.

Larson was disappointed when the audience concluded that his piece - a
simple, engaging form called a two-part invention - was written by the
computer, but he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners decided that
the invention composed by EMI (pronounced "Emmy") was genuine Bach.

"Bach is absolutely one of my favourite composers," Larson said. "My
admiration for his music is deep and cosmic. That people could be duped
by
a computer program was very disconcerting."

The cybernetic pretender, which was invented by David Cope, a composer
at
the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been upsetting long-held
assumptions by people in the music world because of its ability to scan
pieces by famous composers, automatically distill some of their essence
and then churn out imitations of the work.

The cognitive scientist and author Dr. Douglas Hofstadter, who presided
over the contest at the University of Oregon in Eugene, calls EMI "the
most thought-provoking project in artificial intelligence that I have
ever
come across."

"EMI forces us to look at great works of art and wonder where they came
from," he said. "Nothing that I have seen in artificial intelligence has
done this so well."

The artificial composer was the focus of a recent symposium, organized
by
Hofstadter at Stanford University, which included two live concerts of
EMI's music. In addition, a new CD of EMI's compositions, called
"Classical Music Composed by Computer" is being released by Centaur
Records.

The collection includes not only artificial Bach inventions but also
works
imitating a Beethoven sonata, a Chopin mazurka, a Rachmaninoff suite,
Mozart and Stravinsky and a Scott Joplin piano rag. Casual listeners
could
easily mistake many of the pieces for the real thing.

On a more ambitious level, EMI recently composed a full-scale Mozart
symphony and piano concerto, which were performed in April by the Santa
Cruz Baroque Festival on period instruments.

Linda Burman-Hall, who played the piano solo for the concerto, said, "It
felt a little different than playing a normal Mozart work, but it was
very
much like a work of the same period. It was certainly in the ball park."

All of this is rather disconcerting to music lovers who believe that the
unique style of a composer springs from a deep well of emotion and
experience, that the creator of a composition is speaking musically in a
very special way.

EMI is not trying to say anything. It has no passions, no memories and
knows nothing about life. Its entire inner world consists of rules for
how
to sift through past compositions for characteristic patterns of
melodies,
harmonies and rhythms, and then to recombine them into plausible ( and
sometimes beautiful ) music.

The implication, which many composers and musicians emphatically reject,
is that musical style might just consist of a collection of simple
recipes, that the feelings and intent of the composer may not be so
important after all.

In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Godel, Escher, Bach," published in
1979, Hofstadter speculated on whether uplifting music would ever be
composed by an artificially intelligent machine.

A program that could produce music as mesmerizing as the great masters',
he concluded, would require more than simple routines for stringing
together notes. The machine would have to learn what it feels like to be
alive. It "would have to wander around the world on its own," he wrote,
"fighting its way through the maze of life and feeling every moment of
it.
It would have to understand the joy and loneliness of a chilly night
wind,
the longing for a cherished hand."

Now he is not quite so sure. "I find myself baffled and troubled by
EMI,"
he said. "The only comfort I could take at this point comes from
realizing
that EMI does not generate style on its own. It depends on mimicking
prior
composers, but that is still not all that much comfort. To what extent
is
music composed of `riffs', as jazz people say? If that is mostly the
case,
then it would mean that, to my absolute devastation, music is much less
than previously thought."

Not all of EMI's illusions are equally beguiling. The longer the program
tries to sustain its masquerade, the more likely it is to stumble. "If I
turn on three seconds of EMI and ask myself, 'What was that?' I would
say
Bach," Hofstadter said, "but if I leave it on for twenty or thirty
seconds, it does not make sense. It is like listening to random lines
from
a Keats sonnet. You wonder what was happening to Keats that day. Was he
completely drunk?"

Burman-Hall said that EMI did its best renditions of composers like Bach
or Mozart, whose style is "more Apollinian, restrained, logical and
equation-like."

The program is not so successful, she said, with less predictable
composers like Beethoven or Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. "When
I
play C.P. Bach," she said, "I hear him having second thoughts, wandering
off and then feeling remorse and coming back to what he said before."
For
now, anyway, some of these more subtle motifs seem to elude EMI's
pattern-
recognition routines.

Cope concedes that real Bach, younger or older, is still better than his
program's pseudo-Bach. "EMI produces beautiful music but maybe not
profound music," he said, but then how many people, he asks, can come as
close as EMI does to mimicking the greatest composers of all time?

As he continues to refine the program, he expects the imitations to
improve, incorporating more and more of the trademarks that make up a
composer's musical personality.

As a test of EMI's abilities, Cope likes to play its compositions to
people who do not know that they are hearing music that was written by a
computer. "When they assume that the music is human, they are obviously
moved and speak in the same terms as if it had been composed by Chopin,"
he said. They describe the emotions unleashed by the music and speculate
on what the composer was trying to say.

"When I tell them that there is nothing behind the music but cold hard
machinery doing addition and subtraction," Cope continued, "then they
will
not admit that they were moved." These experiments have led Cope to
believe that the meaning of a piece of music lies largely in the ear of
the beholder.

Today's discoveries:

* Greg Stock's _Metaman_, (1993)
* That I can smell an extropian within two paragraphs.  (Never mind
recognizing the name.)
* That I can't easily say what extropians are.

My advisor lent me his copy, which Stock had given him at some
conference at UCLA last month.  I mentioned having seen or heard of him
on the extropians list.  My advisor asked me what 'extropians' was.  But
I can't echo the Five Capitalized Principles, and my hash of
extropianism as a rejuvenated Enlightenment feels fine as a hash, but
pretentious as an explanation to someone who doesn't know about it.  So
I fell back on "technophilic futurist libertarians".  Later I thought
that "optimistic technophiles who know evolution, economics, and the
fact that the two are nearly the same thing" might have been better.  I
suppose self-transformation should be worked in, although I think I'd be
more comfortable with 'adaptive'.

Not only a speedup, but a critical enabler. If
nanorobotics/mechanosynthetic tip road is blocked, we're left with the
solvated biopolymer bootstrap route.

This is comparing apples and oranges. Producing a crude molecular
assembler is a bootstrap tinkering thing, while (i)PFP is just (lots) of
crunch. Engineering bacteria and jarvesting proteins in (k)g quantities
from fermenters is not particularly hard.

Doesn't _seem_. I do not see how I can engineer enzymes, and design
good-fit complementary surfaces without a full-blown IPFP. Btw, granted
how fantastically inert inner buckytube faces are, putting an infinite
C=C=C=C-rope generating designer enzyme into a watery microenvironment on
the other side of the (fluorine-terminated) buckytube, mounted onto an SPM
cantilever in vacuo would seem to make a good hybride bootstrap for
mechanosynthetic nanolitho.

Dick Armey is a conservative political pundit who is trying to make a name for
himself in American politics.  He has no expertise in science nor, to my
knowledge, does he have government-based counsel on scientific issues.  Armey
has equally inane strategies for dealing with the United States income tax
(which will never work but sound good on paper).  Armey is simply trying to
seize an issue that the American public pay attention to in the hope that he
can score some political brownie points.

In my own opinion, anyone who has sufficiently research the human cloning issue
would not take such alarmist stances as you see being taken by a variety of
United States government officials.  In discussions, most people bring up the
idea of cloning marginalizing the value of life and the notion of clone armies
ravaging the world.  Given the low value human life has in general in the
world, marginalizing it does not seem to be an important issue (this assuming
that cloning would marginalize the value of life, which I think is the exact
opposite of what would happen).  The objection of "clone armies" is absurd in
my opinion.  You could also state that the Internet should be shut down since
child pornography is transmitted over it, that guns should be outlawed since
people use them to commit heinous crimes, that automobiles should be discarded
since people speed in them and people die in accidents, etc. etc.  Every
activity has potential negative consequences and can be abused.  Cloning is
simply "spooky" to the average person.  "Spooky" and ignorance combined
together creates "witch hunt".

  Famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke,
  author of the sci-fi epic "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
  denies the shocking report published in a British
  tabloid, the Sunday Mirror [1], that he admitted 
  to the Mirror that he was a pedophile. As the 
  Associated Press (2/2/98) just reportED [2]:

	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Science 
	fiction author Arthur C. Clarke today 
	denied a British tabloid's claim that 
	he is a pedophile and asked that his 
	knighthood ceremony be postponed so
	not to embarrass Prince Charles. 

	"I am outraged by the Sunday Mirror's
	allegations, and I am seeking legal 
	advice," Clarke said in a statement 
	read to reporters by his secretary, 
	Roshan Amarasekhara. 

	"Mr. Clarke is very upset by the 
	false reports," Amarasekhara added. 

  Take the "Arthur C. Clarke admits he was a pedo-
  phile" report with a very big grain of salt. Re-
  member CNN's "Goddard admits TWA 800 theory was 
  a hoax" hoax http://www.erols.com/igoddard/hoax.htm 
  I suspect and seriously hope that Clarke has been 
  set up rather than that these charges be true.

  The Mirror article sounds bad, but it could be 
  a pack of lies. The Mirror reporters could have 
  just made up everything. Where's the proof that 
  he said that the Mirror claims he said? Without
  a recorded interview, this report has no legal
  and thus very little weight. When we consider
  that making such shocking charges stands to 
  sell a lot of newspapers, we can say that 
  Mirror had a motive to fabricate. 

  I cannot imagine that Arthur C. Clarke, even 
  if the charges were true, would say what he's
  alleged to have said.  We need to wait till
  we get all the facts before we can pass our
  personal judgement on Arthur C. Clarke. 

  IF the story is true I still respect the great 
  contributions the man has made to society, but 
  would strongly condemn such sexual behavior. I 
  think that because all adults are inherently 
  authoritarian figures to all children, that the
  concept of "consensual adult/child sex" is in-
  herently and fatally flawed, since any alleged
  consent of the child cannot be determined in
  light of the fact that the authoritarian rela-
  tion inherently contains an intimidation factor.

This is one of those things that demonstrates the ole  "too much of
a good thing. A reading of over 200 increases your risk of heart
attack, arteriosclerosis, and some types of stroke, a reading under
150 increases your risk of liver cancer, lung disease and other
types of stroke. So 170-190 is recommended.

I got this from an interesting book called "The Green Pharmacy" by
Ethnobotanist James A. Duke Ph.D. published by Rodale ISBN 0-87596-
316-1.

I think this is a book every Extropian would find usefull, it's
full of excellent information and wonderfull anecdotes. When he was
with the Designer Food program under NIH, they decided on the "5
helpings of fruits and vegetables" a day bit. Duke suggests "five
fruits and five veggies, seasoned with five different herbs and
garnished with five different nuts."

This book also has a whole chapter on fighting aging.

He also points out that his vast medicinal plant database is

Do you know of any Extropian groups that have considered seting up
computer match-making services for use among Extropians. (Especially for
those that are physically far away from existing Extropian groups)

It may sound, odd, desperate, and silly, But it seems like a proactive /
self-actualizing thing to do. Extropian couples may be able to work more
effectively, reinforcing/complementing each other.

Most great ancient philosophers were pedophiles,
slave owners, and wholeheartedly approved various
"interesting activities", from sex with animals
(should there be freedom for it?) to ritual human
sacrifices.  Somehow nobody feels disturbed about it.

Also, is the concept of *any* relations between
adults and children "inherently and fatally flawed",
because the adults are authoritarian? Or many of
these relations are productive exactly because of
the authority - like teaching?  What if there is
a relationship between a tough 15-yo slut and a
timid 25yo virgin?  What about an authoritarian
relationship or difference in social status or
intelligence, or in sexual experience between
adults?  Who should be considered a child, and
who should measure authority?

I think if somebody wants to claim that something
is wrong, he should provide good rational arguments
why each of those parameters (age, authority, type
of relationship, etc.) is chosen, and why authority
and experience are so bad in one case while they are
so good in another.  Otherwise, such arguments will
never lead anywhere.

Maybe we should declare war to the perverted people
of India and Middle East where a marriage of a young
girl to a mature man of authority is considered a
natural social norm (as well as in lots of other
cultures throughout human history). What's wrong with
all those people?  Is it women's liberation that made
us rethink our principles, or higher educational
requirements? (why don't we prohibit fools to breed then?)

I've tried a few different drugs (both synthetic and natural), and I do
consider them a "transhuman tool". Still, I don't think it makes a lot
of sense to do the same drug again and again. Once you've played around
with certain "experiences", it gets quite easy to "remember" them
whenever you want to, which gives you almost the same effect as when
you've actually taken the drug.

This works quite well with hallucingenics, which hemp more or less
belongs to.

By doing so, I avoid negative physical side-effects as well as terror
from bureaucrats ;-)

later,
Holger

An old idea for mechanizing creativity is to divide it into two parts:
one is an exploratory part, which is highly random and throws out a lot
of "crazy ideas".  In the visual arts, maybe it tries lots of different
combinations of colors and shapes.  The other part is the judgement part,
which looks at the output of the first part and decides what looks good.
In some models this could then feed back and narrow the search space of
the first part.

To say that computers can't mechanize creativity, you either have to say
that this method won't work to produce creative artworks, or else that
computers can't do the first or second parts.  The most questionable is
probably whether computers can ever be able to have esthetic judgement,
to be able to look at different artworks and say which ones people will
find attractive.

It's not clear when this will be possible, but making a computer a critic
sounds easier than making it an artist.  Actually the two are not as
different as they seem.

No chance dude...there are way too few extropian females...
Besides, there aren't too many extropians alltogether...you'd
get inbreeding or something ;-)

Setting up is easy - use any existing service, like match.com, and add
your favorite keywords, like singularity, transhumanism, extropy, etc.
You may have much better luck if you add "gay" to the description.
There are very few extropian women out there, and chances to recruit
more anytime soon do not seem great. I think we need to clone some female
extropians.

In numerous cultures around the world heroism is a respected personal
quality. I am curious as to how the act of placing oneself in immediate
danger to assist someone already in danger came to be recognised as such
a worthy deed. Surely it is for both the social good and the personal
good not to do so? How did heroism evolve into such a widely respected
quality, and should it be held as such?

Your missing a key piece..

It is good for YOU if others desire to be HEROs.. so society rewards
them.. Clearly the risks deserve the rewards...

Therefore society creates and prompts HEROs

We don't have a group here in Atlanta (that I know of), but I'm
actually interested in this, and could devote time to developing/
installing any needed software. Besides personal matchups, you
might also be able to use it to match up people with similiar
technical interests who are looking to start a team for any
projects?

I didn't know that. Now I'm more confused than ever.

OOoooookaaaaaay...

It seems to me that youre saying  the big bang COULDN'T have happened then.
Since if all the mass in the universe came from nothing then it couldn't stay
around very long.

However....if one proton at a time "virtualize" out of the quantum foam...then
they could stay around for a VERY long time.  Which is my understanding of
Lerner's thesis.

As for the Galactic Electrical Currents..I understand (from the book) that
evidence of their existence has been observed.

I'm not sure of anything myself....nor am I claiming anything...I'm.just
trying to sort it all out in terms I can understand.

The cloning ban seems to be a knee-jerk response, a response that buys
some time for reactionary politics to get a handle on this issue.
Genetic engineering was merely a fantasy when most of these politicians
lost their imaginations, and now they are struggling to deal with the
implications of childhood daydreams come to life. My personal
experiences with law students, lawyers, and judges during the course of
my time here at school have validated my suspicion that few of the
people making the law are equipped to understand the current state of
technology, never mind the potentials ten years down the road. I spend a
good amount of time reading up on current research, but still I know
next-to-nothing. The people many trust to make, interpret, and change
the law know even less than I do. As the old legal adage goes, tough
cases make bad law. 

And the cases are only getting tougher.

The most recently I've come across someone reaching this conclusion 
from *current* data was about five years ago.

I used the info once... some doofus was posting to newsgroups asking 
for pointers to kiddie porn web sites... so I gave him the IP address 
of the FBI's server, with appropriate verbiage to make it sound 
interesting.

The PPC is a 32 bit chip, no? What OS? I assume that your Word app is the
Apple version, since Word was not made in a 4.0 version for Windows. So
Microsoft's application is running undocumented instructions on the Mac OS?
Apparently MS isn't the only bear in the woods.

This (the follow email) makes perfects sense, the thing that confuses me
is:

(excuss my incoherent rambling, I do become repetative)

1. person undergos perfect suspended animation
2. half their atoms ( randomly picked ) are plucked out of their body and
brain and replaced by other atoms. The plucked out atoms are joined to new
atoms
3. net result
  two individuals in suspended animation that are perfect copies of each
other and only differ in
	1) what random assembly/reassemble mistakes were made
	2) and which suspension vat they are in.

4) What happen when they wake up. Who went to sleep, who woke up, who was
"born"

It makes me slightly dizzy, but that doesn't mean there is a problem, or
any need to invoke the supernatural, but I'ld feel better if I wasn't
cloned (mind and body) in suspension, even though we'ld become two totally
differnt people (with shared memories) And there is certainly nothing
wrong with that, its just creation of another person. But what happened to
the old one ? I'ld rather be a new twin and think I had been frozen
earlier than be a person going into a freezing and duplication process and
being confused about how a person can be split in two and become two
differnent individual. 

Can anyone explain away this apprehension in a logical/scientific manner ?

They *** DO *** collude. Almost all the European PTTs are either state
owned, or were state owned until recently -- the exception, British Telecom,
was part of the post office until privatisation in 1982.

In the UK, the main NSA/GCHQ tap is at Menwith Hill. They plug into BT's
microwave and fibre-optic backbone; you can see the receivers from miles
away, over the moors. I kid you not, the monitoring operation is out in the
open and it is huge. There's a whole network of GCHQ interfaces with the
civilian telecoms infrastructure around the UK; prod me hard enough and I'll
try to dig up some of my referances and repost them.

In 1945 the UK and USA signed a joint intelligence sharing treaty. The way
I hear it, NSA isn't allowed to spy on US citizens at home, and GCHQ isn't
allowed to spy on UK citizens at home. That's why there are joint GCHQ/NSA
monitoring posts -- makes it easier to share intelligence, if you follow my
drift.

So? I've heard estimates that as much as 10% of all the CPU power in the UK
is owned/operated by GCHQ. NSA spends billions on supercomputers per year.
You think those are doing nothing?

A little tidbit. System X and System Y digital telephone exchanges made in
the UK are the backbone for BT, and are exported around the world. An 
interesting feature the recent EU report highlighted is that it's possible
to program the exchange to make any ISDN TA connected to it go "off hook"
for monitoring -- in effect, turning the entire collection of terminals
plugged into such an exchange into a massive array of infinity repeaters.
It's no surprise that Russia and China have both bought into this
technology ...

> Really?  Does that still apply?

      As far as I know, yes.  It's a 'guesstimate', inevitably.  Here's 
      Rudolp Chelminski and Olivia Moussouris, writing in the June [1997] 
      issue of the Reader's Digest:
      

      "American authorities ... now work with an effective weapon: the 
      Child Protection Act of 1984.  This legislation authorized 
      aggressive police work and initiated a national programme of 
      identifying paedophiles in their communities.  Ray Smith of the US 
      Postal Inspection Service, which finds itself on the front line of 
      intercepting both domestic and imported child pornography, explains 
      how it works.
      
      "When we find out about child porn for sale, we go and buy some.  
      Then we arrest the dealer and sieze his records.  After that we go 
      proactive: we take over his business and his contacts. "Sorry we've 
      been away" we say.  "Now here's what we've got for you."  If a 
      customer takes the bait, we grab him"
      
      These and other aggressive methods work. "Paedophiles have told me 
      they would never touch a kid in the States" says Patrick Yvars, a 
      Paris police commissioner..."
      
      [60 Minutes documented a horrifying case of such 'proactive' 
      witch-hunting, where the US Postal Inspection Service produced 
      tempting porno catalogues, and bought up mailing lists up to twenty 
      years old.  They mailed the damn things out.  One who responded was 
      a former Korean War Air Force pilot.  When his order was delivered, 
      it was accompanied by police officers with warrants for his arrest.
      
      He refused to 'plea-bargain' and instead fought the prosecution.  He 
      was acquitted.  When he obtained discovery of case documents, he 
      found that over a hundred people had been similarly entrapped.  Five 
      had committed suicide.  Many had lost marriages, families, jobs and 
      homes.  Lives had been ruined.

> What bits are those?

OK.

This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).

There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William 
Kinkaid [publ. RKP].  It attracted a lot of flack in the reviews -- I 
haven't read it.


Let's look at this seriously.

Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)


Following Alfred Tarski, we can say:

"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les 
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, 
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such 
relationships are known in French as 'Special friendships.'  There's a 
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No 
sex in it, BTW.


We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of 
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext 
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent 
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not 
binary.  They range from being completely erotically indifferent to 
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but 
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.


Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a context of reproductive 
acts. So we're not dealing with 'sexuality' at all -- pre-pubescent 
girls cannot reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except 
in conjunction with fertile females.

So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally 
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred 
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic 
interactions.

But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- 
again, there is no external (or internal) metric.  And they can therefore 
have _no impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other 
people can sense them at some tacit level).

Insofar as pre-pubescent children really have no capacity -- knowledge and 
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense 
it in other people, or understand it either.

So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.

But is it perhaps objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Cut to the chase.


People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly 
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on 
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in 
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  

Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it 
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of 
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and schools.  There is much 
empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on children 
(genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the home: 
people who have 'legitimate' power over them.

In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented 
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, 
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.

Either one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more probable 
-- it was a carefully staged 'demonstration' killing, carried out by paid 
psychopaths.  The investigating authorities are not making it very easy to 
discover the facts in this matter.

Asking 'What powerful people has John Ramsey upset?' might prove a 
most fruitful line of inquiry.  The 'moral panic' brigade are obvious 
candidates -- his daughter was intelligent, good-looking and clearly 
enjoyed appearing before the public.  Hateful, to some minds...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with 
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, to be activated 
in crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal,  This 
can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and given 
Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent to 
the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.


        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  
Training children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. 
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in 
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This 
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of 
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by 
the governing hierarchical authorities.

Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in 
the Seventies.  

Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, 
Howard, Shephard) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is now 
actually being made available to children under threat within their 
homes in America...

Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little 
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each 
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.

The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, 
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- 
so-called 'safe sex.'

The social-control freaks are _really pissed off about this failure.  A  
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.

Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and 
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, 
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.

It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.

Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern 
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as 
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go 
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures 
and text.

        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive 
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  
Coercion. Wonder why?

No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: -- 

                                  VOTES

                               MANIPULATION

                              SOCIAL CONTROL.
                       
                              BIGGER BUDGETS

                       MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the 
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  >:-}


But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his 
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvement with -- and on occasion 
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve 
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to 
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a 
moment longer.   We were just 20 years old...


With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to 
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat 
trainer.  He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, 
but is still an 'out' gay.

I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to 
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and 
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, 
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged 
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect 
to go on 'doing it.'

All too true.


A little later, he was found dead, by his mother and his sister.

> Really?  Does that still apply?

      As far as I know, yes.  It's a 'guesstimate', inevitably.  Here's 
      Rudolp Chelminski and Olivia Moussouris, writing in the June [1997] 
      issue of the Reader's Digest:
      

      "American authorities ... now work with an effective weapon: the 
      Child Protection Act of 1984.  This legislation authorized 
      aggressive police work and initiated a national programme of 
      identifying paedophiles in their communities.  Ray Smith of the US 
      Postal Inspection Service, which finds itself on the front line of 
      intercepting both domestic and imported child pornography, explains 
      how it works.
      
      "When we find out about child porn for sale, we go and buy some.  
      Then we arrest the dealer and sieze his records.  After that we go 
      proactive: we take over his business and his contacts. "Sorry we've 
      been away" we say.  "Now here's what we've got for you."  If a 
      customer takes the bait, we grab him"
      
      These and other aggressive methods work. "Paedophiles have told me 
      they would never touch a kid in the States" says Patrick Yvars, a 
      Paris police commissioner..."
      
      [60 Minutes documented a horrifying case of such 'proactive' 
      witch-hunting, where the US Postal Inspection Service produced 
      tempting porno catalogues, and bought up mailing lists up to twenty 
      years old.  They mailed the damn things out.  One who responded was 
      a former Korean War Air Force pilot.  When his order was delivered, 
      it was accompanied by police officers with warrants for his arrest.
      
      He refused to 'plea-bargain' and instead fought the prosecution.  He 
      was acquitted.  When he obtained discovery of case documents, he 
      found that over a hundred people had been similarly entrapped.  Five 
      had committed suicide.  Many had lost marriages, families, jobs and 
      homes.  Lives had been ruined.

Actually, it is not obvious that this is true; the uncertainty
relations only hold *in* the universe, the universe itself may or may
not behave similarly. The "universe from quantum fluctuation" model is
interesting but right now rather vague. The problem is of course that
we are trying to apply a theory outside its range of application.

The energy has to be taken from somewhere. This is the reason black
holes evaporate, they make electrons and positrons appear permanently
and the energy has to be taken from somewhere, in this care the black
hole.

Hi Brian,
Thanks for your kind comments about my novel. I am a 45-year-old
nonsmoker, and my $125,000 life insurance policy cost me only about $250
per year. I suggest that you check out <www.quickquote.com> (listed in
the back of The First Immortal, along with numerous other resources) for
more competitive bids. Best wishes, Jim Halperin

I thought that extropy in its classical formulation was precisely a
measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience,
diversity, and opportunity for growth, and so that the
broadening and complicating of ethical perception would pretty
self-evidently be extropian.  It's an ethical analog to pancritical
rationalism.   It is an embracing of the moral  richness of the
world.  To say that you "accept" complexity when its "unavoidable" 
suggests that it is scarcely a value at all.  I agree that it is possible
to overcomplicate situations from time to time, with the consequence that
you are, say, sometimes more hesitant to act or less confident in acting
than you need to be.  But this seems like a reasonable tradeoff for
cultivating the widest possible appreciation of the world.  One of the
reasons I am a vegetarian is that I found the world became more
interesting and more beautiful when I started thinking of nonhuman animals
less as putty and more like peers.

I said vegetarian practice was an ethical *laboratory*, by which I meant
the kind of thinking that happens when you try things out in practice as
well as in thought.  A person who decides to become an ethical vegetarian
faces lots of unexpected decisions -- what about fish? leather? wool? 
medical services? etc. -- that have a special urgency and clarity that you
are not likely to face simply thinking about these things in the abstract.

The following post is long and contains potential spoilers for
those who have not yet read James Halperins novel "The First
Immortal" read ahead at you own risk.

True, the "Singularity" as you define it did not appear, but I
think that there is a certain amount of subjectivity to it's
definition. The rate of progress as portrayed in the book would
floor the average American, and completely overwhelm the average
third-worlder. I know I was reeling at some of the possibilities.

I think this was more than a mere trick to avoid the singularity,
The author, seems to be against certain advances:

"We could implant intelligent machines in physical bodies like
ours, or some other higher life-forms. Hell, before you know it,
we'll be advanced enough to create a wholw new species superior to
ourselves. Sure we could do that, but why would we? Then we'd have
created a hyperintelligent competitive species. Such an act would
be insane: would have a wholly unpredictable outcome. It would be
as mad as a full-scale nuclear exchange in the 1980's so I don't
expect it, even in light of todays crisis." (page 303)

Yes, I've ordered, but not yet received his first book, the truth
machine made for a very interesting story element.

Good points all, I have serious doubts about the idea of a "world
government". They mostly revolve around "redistribution" (wealth,
poer, etc) scenarios. Control junkies are dangerous.

I didn't see this as a scolding, it made me a little sad, and more
determined than ever to sign up. In my own case this novel
solidified my reasoning on the issue.

Yes, vision in the "retrospectroscope" is always 20/20, but I
thought he accomplished this quite well. In a world where cryonics
has proven to work, those who didn't see the possibility will be
seen as lacking vision.

I think when this is widebanded as a T.V. miniseries, this could
have a big effect.

If by 'Strong AI' you mean human-level cognitive ability, then:

- Yes, I believe in it, but I think its harder to achieve than is currently 
  believed, even if we get accurate brain models via Nanotech. (Mother nature 
  does worse spagetti code than microsoft, and in hardware to boot...)

If by 'Strong AI' you mean supra-human level cognitive ability then:

- Yes, I still believe this is possible, but it is MUCH harder to achieve, 
  since it requires not just duplication of human ability, but a thorough
  understanding of it, and improvement thereon.

The British science magazine NEW SCIENTIST reports in the January 31
issue that the Hubble Space Telescope has imaged an object which is
apparently orbiting around Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun.
This object is speculated to be either a brown dwarf or a planet "at least
ten times the size of Jupiter."

As I noted back in December, there is an essay by
Patricia Churchland called "Feeling Reasons"
available on the Web as part of an ARS Electronica
symposium from September 1997 at
http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html which
explains why autonomous reasoning requires an
'affect' or 'feeling' system in order to function
properly.

Another (6-page) paper that comes to mind as being
relevant to how 'feeling' might be incorporated into
a non-biological system is Neven Tomov's 9604 paper
in Complexity International online
(http://www.csu.edu.au/ci/vol3/paper4/paper4.html )
called "Towards Combining Artificially Alive and
Artificially Intelligent Agents".

In light of these issues, and as a 'response' to Doug
Bailey's 'poll', I would just add that 'Strong AI'
seems possible to me, BUT, it would have to be
'grown' and/or learn on its own; in other words, it's
unlikely that it can be planned or programmed
according to specs the way we develop software today,
otherwise it will never be creative on its own.  This
is the big challenge for using it to control
nanotechnology.

Bruce Edmonds (at Manchester Metro Univ. in the UK)
has some interesting papers on subjects relevant to
this.  In particular, see Edmonds, B. "The Possibile
Irreducibility of Software Artificial Life." CPM
Report 97-14, MMU, 1997.

>  why do you think [the consumption tax proposal] is inane?

I am a tax lawyer here in the United States.  I have analyzed the various tax
proposals (flat tax, consumption tax, national sales tax, VAT, etc. in a
variety of vicissitudes) and have found them wanting.  A consumption tax is
especially distasteful on a variety of fronts.  The central idea that people
get hooked on when talking about replacing the current system is not what its
being replaced with but the fact that its being replaced.  Most Americans hate
the current system so much that they would take anything as substitute for it.
This notion is misguided and unwise.

A National Consumption Tax (NCT)

A NCT sounds great when generalities are discussed.  It would reward saving and
penalize consumption.  The capital generated from the additional savings would
allow the economy to grow and so on.  But when this proposal is analyzed in
detail it becomes obvious how completely ridiculous it is from a real-world
standpoint.  For the NCT to raise as much revenue as the current income tax
system, it would have to tax final sales at a rate of 28% (this rate does not
incorporate the need to also raise funds that payroll taxes currently
generate).  This is higher than many NCT advocates quote, but that is because
their proposals include huge cuts in federal spending.  But there is a deeper
problem with this 28% figure and that is the tax base that is used in deriving
that rate.  The 28% rate would have to be imposed on every single expenditure
by individuals.  This means that individuals would have to pay 28% tax on
groceries, rent, house payments, automobiles, gas, auto repairs, donations to
charitable organizations, health care, etc.  Everything.  Many proposals exempt
several of the aforementioned categories from tax.  All this does is increase
the necessary rate on the remaining taxable expenditures.  If you exclude
"necessities" then you end up with a rate of 63% on all remaining
expenditures.  So when you go to buy that $5,000 P6-300mhz computer,
remember... it will cost you over $8,000.

Regardless of the rate, there is another crucial problem with the rate that is
initially determined.  The tax will reduce the amount people buy.  If you could
buy $100 worth of "things" before the NCT and the NCT is 30%, you will only be
able to buy $75 worth of "things" now.  Sure you'll have more money because you
will not be paying income taxes but the average American pays only 16% federal
taxes.  16% is lower than any estimate of the NCT rate needed meaning consumer
demand will diminish.  What does this mean?  Tax revenues will go down which
will result in higher NCT rates (which will consequently diminish spending
more) or an explosion of the federal deficit (which will gobble up all the
extra capital generated by the NCT and then some).

The real push behind this is by ultra-wealthy individuals who would benefit
from the NCT.  Steve Forbes would (based on his current financial position)
save over $1 billion in federal taxes over his lifetime if the NCT was
implemented.  No wonder he supports it and is willing to spend millions to get
it implented.  Wealthy individuals, generally, do not consume most of their
income.  They invest it.  Thus the tax burden on the wealthy will plummet while
the tax burden on the lower and middle classes will increase dramatically.  The
NCT will become an extremely regressive tax and have a severe negative impact
on the economy.

Ask any NCT proponent this question:  Why not simply the tax code in this
manner:  Create a flat rate of 40% with a universal exemption of $100,000.
This would reduce the tax code to a couple of pages and raise the same amount
of revenue that the currrent system creates.  Consumer demand would skyrocket
as hundreds of billions of dollars is put back in the hands of the lower and
middle class thus creating wealth for the upper class.  They will balk at such
a plan because it does one thing:  Raises the tax burden on the wealthy.

I'm inclined to _believe_ that strong AI is very likely, I don't
necessarily think be by _design_ as in current "expert systems", more
likely it will arise as a (hopefully) controlled evolutionary process
involving self configuring hardware/software.
I see no reason why it must be modeled in a one to one fashion with the
human brain, after all there is a great deal of superfluous functionality
in the brain and in any case the hardware base is likely to be _very_
dissimilar.
Try to think of it as evolution in action. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

	I think we can already do it, we just need a lot more of the
same.  For example, we can produce a machine that can tell us what
color something is much better than we can.  Such machines are aware
of what color something is much better than we are.  But this is all
missing the real point of what our consciousness is built out of.  Our
knowledge of color is represented by phenomenal color qualia or
feelings or sensations.  A "strong AI" device represent color with
abstract sets of bits.  The fundamental quality of these
representations is, by design, not relevant.  But to us the particular
fundamental qualia or sensation we use to represent a particular color
(and what it is fundamentally like), which is our knowledge of what
color something is, is all important.  If you swap the hardware
representations of two particular colors in a "strong AI" machine,
there is no significant difference.  But if we represent 700 nm light
with a green sensation rather than a red one, there is all the
difference in the world!

	I say yes, strong AI is possible given an absurd amount of
increased and unnecessary complexity.  A "strong AI" device isn't
"strong" enough because it lacks our phenomenal ability to represent
knowledge in more than almost meaningless and non unified "abstract"
ways.

The original author indicated that his posting was accidental.  He did
not include a definition of the strong AI hypothesis.

In philosophical circles, "strong AI" has a specific meaning.
It means that executing a certain type of computer program *produces*
consciousness.  This happens irrespective of the nature of the computer
which executes the program.  Any kind of computer which executes an AI
program (of which no examples are yet known to exist) becomes conscious
(or perhaps we might more carefully say that it causes consciousness
to exist).

Weaker forms of AI might propose that computer programs have some
properties like consciousness, or that we can learn more about human
consciousness by studying programs which model it, etc.  Strong AI says
that all you need to be conscious is to execute the right kind of program,
an AI program.

Many thought experiments have been proposed on each side.  Searle's
chinese room is designed to show that strong AI can not be true, while
the gradual-neuron-replacement scenarios are intended to show that it
must be true.  It is probably one of the most contentious issues in the
philosophy of consciousness.

What does it mean when science begins to appear more stimulating that science
fiction?  Lately, I have found the most enjoyment from reading nonfiction
science books.  This may be because I have read most of the science fiction out
there already (though I am preparing to read the Zindell books).  Does this
mark some crucial point where the discoveries of science are beginning to catch
up (dare I say outpace) the imagination of science fiction writers?  Is this
phenomenon a precursor to the alleged Singularity (virtually infinite
scientific progress)?  Does it at least indicate that scientific progress is
beginning to proceed at a such a pace that our imagination does not have time
to investigate its implications thoroughly?

(Of course, you can't always assume that the author's views are the same
as his characters.  But in this case you may be right.)

Actually there are many people who would seem to be quite sane,
even Extropian, who would not see it in these terms.  Hans Moravec
views computers as "mind children", as much our offspring as those of
flesh and blood.  Who would not want their children to exceed their own
capabilities?  Are we supposed to jealously prevent them from taking on
new powers because they would go beyond us?

In Halperin's novel, by the end, people have some pretty amazing
capabilities.  I think most people would view this as hopeful and
positive even if they personally don't expect to survive to that era.
Does it really make so much difference if our children are made of
silicon and steel?

Good question.  My gut says the same thing would happen - cryonics
is not much more popular today than it was a few years ago during the

Yes, but the mere fact that you are seriously considering signing up for
cryonics puts you in a tiny, tiny minority.  The question is, how will
a person react who shares the common view that cryonics is a spooky cult?

This is possible.  We see this to some extent with medical advances,
where some "obvious" innovations were slow to catch on - things like
washing hands between patients, or the use of anesthetics during surgery.
It is tragic that there was so much unnecessary pain and death.  I don't
think we really feel angry or disappointed with the human weaknesses and
limitations which caused those problems, though.  More, we feel compassion
and pity for the hard lives which people had to struggle through in those
days, and gratitude that we live in a more enlightened age.  Do you agree?

It will be great if it does.  I don't have a sense of how mainstream
SF readers will be responding, though.  The reviews on amazon.com are
very favorable, but I saw a lot of names I recognized as being part of
the extropian/cryonicist community.  Hopefully it will be equally well
received by the larger audience.  I enjoyed it a great deal, but it
touches closely on those areas in which I am most different from other
people, so I really don't know how it will go.

I am uncertain about the ancient origins of heroism, but analyzing heroism from
a memetic perspective could prove fruitful.  Heroism generally is respected

The ironic thing is we do the same thing in real life - appoint
authority so we can quitely 'ignore' the real complexity of a
situation.  I've said it before and I'll say it again - authority is
ignorance.

The problem with (most) Sci-fi is the way it's written - first you
find a problem (crime), the you find a solution (the truth machine). 
However, real life works differently - breakthrough technology is
created before any 'real-world' application has been thought of.

I wrote a paper on how the web could evolve into a "truth machine" of
sorts, but it would not be abusable in the same way.  One of the
factors people are most worried about on the internet is the lack of
privacy, but it could turn out to be its greatest advantage.  When
everything you do is recorded and stored in a distributed/open
environment and then linked to everything everyone else does, it's
impossible to lie or cheat.  This doesn't require a revolutionary new
technology but the continuation of a trend (so it's more likely to
happen.)

Of course, if there was absolute truth (and I mean "absolute" not just
the detection of crime) then it would create a truly 'open' society. 
We would  not only see the crime, but the reasons for the crime and
may well decide it is not a crime after all.  We would also see that
*everyone* is breaking the law.  The idea of this kind of
"open-society" appeals to me (not because it brings peace and love,
but because it's one of those things that changes *everything*.)  Hey,
and finally others may see the world in the same way I do
(-->shocking<--)

This is something I don't get - people (writers especially) seem to
think that in their future (unlike their parents, or grandparent
before them) they'll look back and think, "I'm so ashamed by all that
pain and suffering we caused, things are so much better now."  The
problem is, things aren't going to better from our perspective, but
they will be better.  'Good' is subjective and future 'good' is
subject to future citizens (i.e. kids)  The only way
potential-immortals could 'survive' tommorow is by doing away with
that kind of subjectivity (hence the reason I don't believe in
'morals', 'ethics', etc).  Here's a clue: if you think there's
something wrong with the world today, you're not going to fit-in
tommorow.

The only obvious advantage of mainstream acceptance is having cheaper,
more ubiquitous cryonics centers.  Which would be nice (I want a
portable.)

Beware of self-styled gurus. That is a good first step :-)

Perhaps you might want to read around a bit on the web, there are
quite a few good texts out there. I suggest that you take a look at
www.extropy.com and www.aleph.se/Trans/Intro, and ask here about what
you don't understand or want to hear different opinions about.

If you mean transferring or copying the contents of a mind to a
computer, then I think it is relevant here. Some of us spend far too
much time discussing it.

This is an interesting point, but I don't think that it may be the case
fore everyone. When I was in my early 20's, I spent a lot of my free time
experimenting. As soon as it began seriously interfering with my the
stability of my life, I moved on. I think that hemp falls into its own
unique category. I wouldn't consider myself a casual user of this drug. Its
important to me to keep usage connected to the creative process. I'm not
saying that I use it when I want to be creative, but that sometimes, when
it feels like a good idea, I'll indulge. In a way, it is very decedent. But
then again, so is eating fine food.

General relativity (GR) does forbid faster-than-light (FTL) travel through
space-time.
However, GR places no restriction on the speed at which space can inflate.
Additionally,
If you are 50 light years from point B and you set out at .99 the speed of
light towards
that point B, you will get there in less than 50 years due to the length
contraction
predicted by GR.  However to a (essentially) stationary observer on Earth 50
years would
pass between the time you set out for point B and the time you actually reached
point B.

Quantum tunneling would appear to violate the GR prediction that information
can not travel
at FTL speeds through space-time.  However, you can not determine the state of
the new
quantum state until you observe it.  Since you can not travel at FTL speeds you
can not
reach the object that experienced quantum tunneling and learn the information
in a manner
that would violate GR.

The whole affair is nonintuitive and if you are confused thats a strong sign
that you
understand it! :)

Here is something I posted last Aug 13 about memetic propagation of
things like heroism:

I might add though that a similar effect is involved in the spread of the
memes for serial killing and for suicidal terrorism.  The meme causes
an act whose notoriety spreads the meme widely.  It then only needs to
take root in a few individuals to survive.

Of course, heroes are praised, while serial killers are condemned.  So
there is more involved than just this simple memetic competition.  But
the cases do share some similarities in how the memes spread.

As was pointed out (on this list, I think) most current sci-fi has been
forced to go for bigger/fancier because the future has already passed
beyond their/its event horizon.

Or, yes, we are seeing a prelude to the singularity.

  I think it means that the science finally ran ahead of the imagination and
interests of the slightly-smarter-than-mundane  layer of the population that
constitutes the bulk of SF readership.  SF writers mostly write techno-fairy
tales,  I wrote abut this in 1991 - see

As I continue to work on the Transhumanist Gender Site, I plan to 
include some information on so-called 'alternate' modes of sexuality, 
including polyamory, bisexuality and androgyny.  I will not, however, 
include pedophilia nor make any statement that it is representative 
of any sort of evolved relationship or sexuality.  Given that I'm 
making a strong statement in favor of removing some clinical 
definitions of abnormality that surround some sexualities, this was a 
tough decision, and I had some tough talks with both clinicians and 
the nice man/boys from NAMBLA before coming to this decision.

My reasoning:  There is no need to depend upon social norms to
assess the value of pedophilia.  Rational ethics supports
establishing a set of criteria by which to assess a truly evolved
sexual experience/relationship--let's choose the basic ones:  safe,
sane, consensual, equal.  Pedophiliac sexual relationships do not fit
the basic critria and often depend on the emotional or
physical vulnerability of one individual.  (Note that B/D/S/M
enthusiasts and polygamists have no trouble fulfilling these
criteria).  Indeed, these relationships bear a strong resemblence to 
early forms of marriage that depended upon the female remaining 
ignorant, dependant and infantile.  

As puberty begins to occur at earlier ages in humans, the age of
consent probably could stand to be lowered by several years, but
basic principles of consent and maturity remain problematic. I'll
agree that some adults probably are not ready for sex and that some
younger folk are, but when you plan to live for over 100 years, a few
years of waiting can't hurt!

Sin,

Kathryn

Paedophiliac behaviour is a great egoism, since children,
in general, do not have the minimum counscious sense of what she/he is
really doing...
For this, he/she is named "minor"... And, worse, lots of times a child who
had sexual relations with adults,
when grows up, will possibly have psycho problems...

If individuals do not educate their instincts, mankind will walk to a
high-tech paleozoic  era...

Actually, I heard a rumour years ago that Mr. Clarke had an interest in

I do wonder, however, why Mr. Clarke chooses to live in a third world

Lets try that again...

 I am uncertain about the ancient origins of herosim.  However, I think
analyzing heroism from a memetic perspective could prove fruitful.  Heroism
appears to be respected most lavishly when the individual who sacrifices or
risks a great deal does so in the name of an ideology or broad ideal.  Heroism
in the form of protecting one's family does not seem as spectacular.  Actually,
protecting one's family might appear more of a duty than a selfless act of
valor.

Memes that reward heroism might have an edge over those that do not.  Images of
heroes inspire others to cling more vitally to a particular meme.  Memes may
use heroes as a focus point to anchor their "hold" on a society.  The general
idea is "If this guy, who we will idealize, saw fit to risk so much for this
idea then the least we can do is continue to promote it."  The fact that
heroism appears in virtually all social systems supports the idea that heroism
was a very successful "adaptation" in memetic evolution.

Perhaps with the rise of transfamily metaorganisms which in turn needed memes
to maintain cohesion, the concept of heroism was created.

Because an authors royalties make him a king in that economy, with a
tropical climate, and British Commonwealth status, the only real downside
is the local tamil separatist geurrillas, and of course all that eastern
mysticism floating around.

Sri Lanka was one of the most civilized countries in the world, 
before it instituted affirmative action.

And the climate is a nice improvement over England's, according to 
most people's point of view.

Look at it this way, the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle says that there is  
a relationship between position and momentum, the more you know about one the  
less you know about the other, the same relationship holds for energy and 
time. If you measure the energy in a vacuum over a short time interval there 
will be a large amount of uncertainty over how much energy is there. You can't 
observe it but over extremely short periods of time there is nothing to 
prevent huge amounts of energy from being there, enough to make  matter, 
if fact enough to make every particle  known. Most believe that Nature is 
totalitarian, if it's not forbidden it's mandatory, so some people started to 
think that these particles, called virtual particles, might really exist.
          
You might think that this is all pointless philosophy, like arguing about how 
many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but Richard Feynman proved that 
it has observable consequences, like the Lamb shift in the spectrum of the 
Hydrogen atom or the photon shot noise of a LASER. Even though there an   
infinite number of these virtual particles Feynman showed how they effect
real particles, you can calculate with Feynman's theory and get numbers. 
  
Calculating the effect an infinite number of virtual particles would have on  
an electron, Feynman predicted in 1948 that the magnetic moment of an electron 
can't be exactly 1 as had been thought but must be 1.00115965221 . Amazingly, 
the best modern experiments give a figure of 1.00115965221 with an uncertainty
of 3 in the last digit. He couldn't have been guessing, nobody's that lucky,  
Feynman must have been on to something important.

Quantum Mechanics doesn't even have a theory of gravity so it's certainly not 
ready to explain why there is something rather than nothing.

Currents strong enough to explain how a Quasar, an object smaller than the  
solar system, can produce a thousand times as much energy as a galaxy of 500 
billion suns? Even if we knew for sure that such currents existed, and we 
don't, it still wouldn't answer the basic question, what huge power source 
generated them, where did the energy come from? Gravitational collapse is the  
only thing known to be able to produce that much energy in such a small  
amount of space.

The term [`hard cases'] originally meant cases that tug at the heartstrings;
that is its meaning in the old saw `hard cases make bad law.'  By semantic
drift it has come to mean difficult cases, which makes nonsense of the old saw.
Only difficult cases make law, good or bad.  Cases that are easy to decide are

There is an old and somewhat foolish saying that `Hard cases make bad law,'

`Bad law makes hard cases,' and therefore the law must be amended.  The real
truth lies somewhere between.  Mere freaks of fortune should not be made an

Or for that matter, why not have a NCT to motivate the lower income people
to better their incomes?  This "tax the rich" meme is destructive to the
lower economic classes in the long run.  More than half of the current
millionaires in the US are blue collar workers who busted their ass and
invested wisely.  If you look at the profile of the average millionaire in
the US (Money magazine did such a detailed survey last year), you will find
that most of them are indistinguishable (lifestyle-wise and
background-wise) from the average American.

I am one of those people who makes more than $100k, but I worked and
invested to make every penny.  I should not be penalized because I make
more than the next guy; odds are I work harder and longer than the next guy
to make my money.  Nonetheless, I pay more than half of my income in taxes
already, to support a system that was unwilling to help me when I made
nothing (yes, I am a single white male).  For most of my life, I have lived
in poverty by any American standard (i.e. didn't have a TV for most of my
childhood, and sometimes no food either).  


It doesn't disturb me that I was unable to get aid from the goverment when
I needed it.  What *does* disturb me is that they expect me to pay for
everyone else now that I make decent living by my own efforts.  This is
terribly inequitable and gives me nothing but the deepest revulsion for
government and the taxes they impose.  It is government of the parasites,
by the parasites, for the parasites.  I would rather opt out, thank you
very much.

The astoundingly sloppy way this story is being bandied about on the net
appals me.  

`Young boys' is a term I see repeatedly.  What is mentioned in the
(unsourced) press reports is consensual fondling and fellatio with youths
or young men in their early or mid teens.  Yet surely most people assume
`boy' refers to male humans from birth to 11 or 12, so `*young* boy'
therefore makes the accusation sound like molestation of infants.  No one
has ever suggested that Clarke has been involved in such crimes.

But it's interesting to look at the original Mirror piece 

http://www.mirror.co.uk/stories/F0102832.html

(assuming the Web version's complete).  There's a lot of malign cutting &
repositioning.  E.g. (I'm going on memory here) allegations of
non-age-specific wickedness with lads is claimed, and then ACC is quoted as
saying that he couldn't admit to certain things or he'd be outed and this
would embarrass everyone in high places.  Later, the context makes it
obvious that he's talking here about gay qua gay plain and simple.  And the
men cited, former `victims', are all recalling stuff from 20 or so years
back, and none of them was 12 at the time; I recall 15 and 17 being
mentioned.  (Cue Romeo and Juliet.)  The youths who were allegedly depraved
and degraded in this fashion met ACC due to their habitual hanging about in
a known den of preverts.  

Key evidence: filthy Arthur was often seen *playing ping-pong with boys of
12*!!  There you go!  What more proof is needed!  Arrest the scout-masters!
 (Not exactly what'd be required in a prosecution, I imagine.)

Homosexual acts between consenting adults in private were legalized in
the UK in 1968.

Arthur C. Clarke left the UK for Sri Lanka in 1962, at short notice. (He
has, however, revisited the UK since 1970 once or twice.)

There are rumours in UK SF fandom that, allegedly, he left because he had
been told that the Vice Squad were going to pay him a visit in the very
near future if he didn't. The allegations were that Clarke was gay, not that
he was a paedophile -- at a time when homosexuality was a criminal offense.

I draw no connection between the allegations and the date of legalisation
of homosexuality in the UK except to point out that if the allegations were
true they would be compatible with the observed course of events.

It is worth noting that one of the events of Prince Charles' current visit
to Sri Lanka is to bestow a knighthood on Arthur C. Clarke.

That sounds like anecdotal evidence unless it has been carefully
collected and analysed. I don't trust individual reports like the
above, since they are heavily biased in a lot of directions - most of
the reports are made by people who are convinced about beneficial
effects, each case is completely different from the others, there are
plenty of confunding variables etc. There are a lot of areas where you
could make the same claim, like the danger of swimming shortly after
eating (there is no real danger, but try telling that to a mother) or
the dangers of electromagnetic fields (where the real dangers appear
to be rather diffuse). I prefer more careful studies, even if the
anecdotal evidence may sound convincing.

The goal IMHO should be drugs that are as independent of set and
setting as possible - they should work even if you don't believe in
them. Sure, set and setting can build a lot on this, but without a
strong pharmacological basis you could as well eat sugar pills and use
the placebo constructively.

Yeah I got it. Made me wonder though at the snide cut about Microsoft using
undocumented instructions, when its not even their operating system. If Apple
were to have a word processor that used undocumented instructions in the Mac
OS, then I'd see the sinister aspect. As it is, the comment was cheap and
immature.

It seems to have various peripheral autonomoic effects, but they do
not follow an obvious pattern (we simply don't know enough about how
the cannabinoids act in the relevant parts of the brain; I would bet
parts of the hypothalamus get modulated by them). The main effects are
tachycardia (the heart beats faster), vasodilation, reduction of
ocular pressure and bronchodilation. The last could probably explain a
bit of why people dry out; it is also possible that dry mouth is
simply another result of the sympathetic activity that also causes the
tachycardia. I would also not rule out the effect of smoking itself.

I'm not sure I'm competent enough in pharmacology to suggest any, it
is not a clear-cut case of sympathetic arousal (in that case it would
have been easy). Cannabis is a rather atypical psychotropic drug.

For the next day or two, amazon.com will have The First Immortal on sale
at 40% off. I recommend that anyone interested in buying a copy go to
Alcor's bookstore <http://www.alcor.org/tfi1.htm> then click on "order
here." That way Alcor will receive a commission as well.

A new data point for the computational acceleration. Here's an excerpt
from a story on Deep Blue's successor. URL below.


<excerpt>The technology is expected to appear in a prototype in the year
2001, IBM said. Plans call for the new, high-powered version of its
RS/6000 SP line to perform 30 trillion to 100 trillion calculations per
second, or up to 100 times today's computing power.

I don't know about "young" boys, but in a Playboy interview a long
time ago he essentially admitted to being bisexual. The picture
accompanying the article showed him wearing a gold lame luigi. It
gave me quite the chuckle.

Despite it's political troubles, Sri Lanka is a beautiful place,
and on his income, Clark could live very well indeed. The story
goes that Clark an avid skin and scuba diver fell in love with it's
tropical reefs which he experienced while on a vacation there. He
also wrote the book "The View from Serendip" based on those
experiences. He is also known to greatly admire the Indian culture.

        ...Which is doubtlessly the reason that these allegations are coming
out right now.  Generally, people love scandal; headlines like: "Pedophile
Arthur C. Clarke Denied Knighthood...shocking story inside" are sure to
attract a few more people than usual to buy the newspapers and tabloids.
Isn't it sad to note that it can take decades for an author (or any public
figure) to build up lasting respect and a fan-base, yet it is ever so easy
for others to knock it down.  Sadder still that his alleged sexual
orientation will likely overshadow most of his life's accomplishments and
ideas.

Clarke lives with a lifelong friend of his and that friend's family in Sri
Lanka.  The family benefits Clarke because he has a family-atmosphere (Clarke
is divorced and has no children) and they provide assistance to him since his
health is somewhat frail.  Clarke also operates a business (scuba diving I
believe) in the region where he lives.  Clarke stated in a special on the
Sci-Fi Channel a few weeks ago that he likes the weather and the people of Sri
Lanka and that is why he lives there.

As for reports about Clarke's sexual life, I think the only thing worse than
speculative tabloid-like reports is the proliferation of such reports by
others.  I think, given the current political witch-hunts masquerading as
pursuits of justice and the tabloid atmosphere we have in America at the
moment, I have had my fill this year of speculative rumors.

BTW, James Halperin offers a reward to people who find factual errors in
TFI which he later corrects.  I emailed him a couple of minor points,
and he promptly sent me an autographed copy of The Truth Machine!
This was very generous of him, and I was pleased because I'm looking
forward to reading his first novel after enjoying the second one so much.

If you're worried about ordering from Amazon, I can say that I got TFI
that way, and it arrived in just three days even though I specified
standard shipping (which I think was $4).  It's an inexpensive way to
get books, and the current discount makes it a "steal".

Well put. I'm often wondering if the effects I enjoy on the drug are
learned and only triggered psychological reactions to being drugged.

What do you think about the effects of meditation and relaxation on
creativity?

For a while, I considered that perhaps hemp put me into a state similar to
that of a meditation guru.  Perhaps this sent me down the road to thinking
I was really short cutting years of serious mental discipline...?


Above you discuss that everyone seems to have a biased view point and that
I can certainly agree with. But what about the effects on artists that
have learned to use the drugs during the creative process? I can clearly
see the science in isolating the effects of hemp on inexperienced
subjects.

I remember that when I first tried to smoke it and create music I was
completely unproductive. With all of this computer and synthesis
technology around me, not to mention the recording technology, I was
completely lost. It took some trial and error for me to get comfortable
doing complex things under the influence. HOWEVER, once I passed through
this stage, it seemed that overcoming that barrier had given me a more
intuitive relationship with the gear. Sort of like taking off the ankle
weights and jumping around. My mind seemed lighter and more flexible in a
way. As an experimental musician, I found my experiences more profound and
informed by that less tangible portion of consciousness. What is
intuition? Perhaps I'm using it too liberally. But I still find that under
the influence my mind seems to flow better while immersed inside of the
web of technocomplexity. If I was an engineer /scientist it may be
different, but for artists, I think we all have the same story to tell
when under the influence of hemp. (if you don't mind me speaking on behalf
of you out there..)

all right.. enough ranting...rambling...

Do you have a good reason to believe that a 40% tax starting at $100k
would really raise the same amount that the current structure raises or
are those figures off the top of your head?

I've wondered in the past why someone prominent hasn't proposed such a
"progressive flat tax" as it would seem to hold great appeal for most
people other than the IRS, some libertarians and those with very high
incomes and/or peculiar exemptions/competitive advantages in the current
system.

H. Beam Piper thought the same thing about radiation. He wrote one time travel
story in which a future dictator escapes a coup in a time machine to the past
(the 20th century) where he is treated as a walking high level nuclear waste
site, because his ambient radioactivity level, that is entirely comfortable for
him, is deathly to others.

I think that people view cryonic suspension with the same dread they view any
sort of preparation for death, which is why not many people have prepared
themselves beforehand with a contract with a funeral home, nor do most people
get wills prepared, at least until they are old. What needs to be done is to
lobby within the insurance and death industries to offer this as another
service. If institutions as conservative and stodgy as insurance companies and
funeral homes make this a common option, it will gain popularity, much like
cremation has gained popularity in recent years as it became more available
and became the affordable option.

If you want to go the sales hype route, you need to sell the concept of
cryonics as time travel.

Here's my opinion on Mr. Clarke's sexuality:

I am not interested in him, and for a wide variety of reasons (basic 
civility being a primary one) he is extremely unlikely to attempt to 
sexually assault me; therefore I don't see why I should be concerned.

Well, it's been proposed numerous times by numerous political 
figures, some of whom were considered serious possibilities as 
presidential candates at the time.

I went to you new site, which is really great, and I noted the exceptional

fact, I copied it to use on my web links to you.  Is this not a logo you
would consider to represent WTA?

I haven't read all posts on this topic, but in some of the early ones, the
phrase "strong AI" was being used at odds with the accepted usage in
philosophy of mind. There it means not more-than-human AI, but
consciousness being achievable purely through software without having to
worry about the particular physical instantiation. In that sense of "strong
AI", I too have major doubts. I'm not at all convinced that a massive look
up table would be conscious. I would not want to replace my brain with
software based on a lookup table. In practice, I don't expect to have to
worry about this, since I doubt it will be practicable to build a mind in
such a manner.

You may have much better luck if you add "gay" to the description.
There are very few extropian women out there, and chances to recruit
more anytime soon do not seem great. I think we need to clone some 
female
extropians.

- Sasha, who avoids dating the mundanes, and stays single.

My Response:

I love when I get the oppurtunity to play devil's advocate, and such an 
oppurtunity this is.

Has anyone ever wondered *why* there are so few extropian females?  What 
does this say about extropians?    What is it, either about our 
philosophy (basically sound) and our communication (needs work), that is 
a turn off to so many women who would otherwise be sympathetic?

I can think of at least 4 women who I personally know who want to live 
forever, increase their potential and explore the greater cosmos as much 
as all of us.  So why do they feel so uncomfortable when I have given 
them extropian writings?

I'll tell you why.  Many of you will scoff at their reasons.  But your 
reasons for scoffing lie at the root of their distaste.  Bottome Line:  
Too many extropians put too much emphasis on certain aspects of their 
self, particularly their reasoning abilities and scientific knowledge, 
at the expense of the rest of your being.  Many of you on this list have 
such high intelligence (the narrow one measured by IQ tests) that you 
have unfortuantely let the other equally important aspects of you self 
atrophy.

I too consider myslef an extropian.  Unfortuantley I don't limit myself 
their.  The extropoian principles layed out by Max More are some of the 
best written words underlying my life philosophy.  But I have also 
learned how to live beyond words, and equations and abstract concepts.  
There is a whole universe out their just waiting to be lived in and 
experienced.  At some point, many of you need to stop thinking cosmic 
thoughts and start living them.  How many of you excersize on a regular 
basis?  How many of you spend quality time outdoors *regulary*?  How 
many of you have gone out on a date?  If you havn't found any 
"extropian" women at heart, then you arn't looking in the right places.  
Besides, Sasha,  who wants a clone of yourself to talk to on very 
specific subjects that only you are interested in?  Don't you like 
surprises?  Part of the joy of living and especially of being involved 
with another person is the surprises they offer you in ideas and 
perspectives.   Take a chance - date somebody who is *not* an extropian 
- you might be surprised that they really are, they just approach it 
from a very different semantic point of view.  This has been my 
experience.

A true extropian philosophy embraces surprise, novelty, and fresh 
perspectives.  Meeting people can be scarry - but as extropians can we 
afford to be scared?  Isn't our philosophy all about surpassing such 
limiting states as fear of the opposite sex?

--> A true extropian philosphy is one that should appeal to both sexes 
equally- a transexual philosophy..  Since it isn't, perhaps we need to 
re-asses how it can.  IMHO, a future without a womens touch is no future 
at all.

Warm Regards,

Paul Hughes

Dear all,

I thought a lot about these aspects. To me they have a
very obvious relation, and I've try to make this point several
times. Please read this contribution as intended, I don't want
to "ride" along on somebody else his effort............

I have this discussion a lot with members of Tanscedo,
members of the CroNet and other private mail. I think we
have to actively spread the positive meme. I usually refer
to our introduction page as "cold", but we will not change 
it, since we have to stick to the facts and worry about 
scarring of the true academic-world. They want cold hard
facts and like to speculate along the way. This has an
obvious reason. You want to keep the people aboard
who really know what is going on.

Still, you want to function as a group in this society.
The society is everything but "cold", it's dynamic and
does a lot based on emotions. (which we "hate" because
they so often contradict with what we would like to achieve
based on facts). I think the majority refers to "us" as 
science-"fiction"-nerds. Hooked up in their own fantasy and
not living in the real world. And if they do look at what we
"picture" for them, they see this "Cyberpunk" world, with lots
of wire's, computers and biotech "monsters"......
And since they don't have the scientific background (and in
relation to that the required imagination) to cope with it,
they want to stay as far a way as possible. Also they
will strongly influence the political-opinion.
(see cloning debate)....

Since I often offered my help here, I noticed people are wondering
if "they" should accept it. For clarity, I don't have a Ph.D. nor
do I have the University diploma's required to really grasp what
is going on. (nanotechnology is for me, gluing balls together :-).
No serious, I know a lot of a lot, but not much of some specific things.
And I think this goes for more people. The digital-generation is
eager to incorporate the new technology in their life, but they 
can't grasps it to the full extend as a lot of you can.

So what do I think I can contribute:
I plead strongly for an organization that educates people
"all of them". People like to think in visuals. Let's paint them
this beautiful future that is coming. Let's show them that there
is a real chance to make some thing out of this: with the environment
, the world hunger, war. Not by shutting down science and go back
to basic "this favorite spiritual mantra", but by embracing the new
technology's for the good things they bring. Yes realistic and Yes,
we look at the side effects of what comes along with them.
I think if Extropie & Transhumanism want to grow to a well known
and respected philosophy (accepted as a realistic bunch of
people by the world of science) we do have to work on Marketing.
......and that's were I come in ;-)

I think what Nick is doing is great and I will offer again all my
help. What I would like to contribute on, is the translation of
all these idea's, opinions and research to the majority.
To gain the benefit of the doubt. I'm realistic, I don't expect "them"
to join by the 1000nds. According to a lot of you, Jim's book the 
"The First Immortal" can do a lot for Cryonics. I say, let's use
this moment to actively make use of this and present an
institute were people can learn more. Try to find company's
who would like to pay a fee for visibility and an active lobby for
the fields they are working in to be accepted. Although this 
could mean "we" have to present our selves a bit less radical.
But for the sake of the good cause.........

I mean. So often we discuss here that "they got it all wrong...again!"
But, shouldn't we try to do something about it. Present the alternative.
Make them aware there is a realistic chance on a great future.
I think you have to educate them in steps. So don't trough directly,
uploading at their feet :-), it scares the hell out of them.......

I guess it sounds a bit like founding a new religion and some 
of it may also sound very idealistic. I am also aware of the
fact that many of you have already tried lot's of things and that
what I say here probably isn't all that new. But I think I feel
a "vibe" :-). There is a lot going on, I think if we harness the 
"power" that is here in all of us, we could pull of a organization
for the future.

Anyway I am more then willing to do my part, focussing on
Marketing the issue's, educating people, look actively for
sponsors, etc..... all those things, not so heavily relying on
scientific knowledge. Building this Worldwide Transhuman Vision.

Again: my intentions are pure, positive and open.
So, if you "all" feel this is a waste of time, stick to what you
do best.......and go back to school :-)..........I accept it
with out a problem. I do feel very passionate for "everything"
that goes on here, I think it has a fundamental truth that 
should be shared to all who are willing to listen. We have a
great chance to actually build a great future and I would like
to be a part of the building process. I think there is a lot of 
room for an organization, that holds the alternative for all the
others (e.g. religion, and other spiritual groups)

Anyway, I am very eager to learn all your opinions...........

Greetings,

The "trickle down" Reaganomics theory for less progressive taxes has already
failed once.  See http://epn.org/prospect/22/22wolf.html for a cogent
discussion on the effects of the "trickle down" theory.  Wealth simply
gravitated towards the upper eschelons of American society.  The theory of
"trickle down" economics is that it would help the lower and middle class by
creating benefits that would "trickle down" to them from the upper class (who
would reap benefits from lower taxes).  The exact opposite occurred.
Ironically, the deficit ballooned and the monies that the wealthy saved in
taxes they then in part loaned to the American government in the form of
treasury bonds to fund the deficit created by the tax savings.  Ironic.

> This "tax the rich" meme is destructive to the lower economic classes in the
long run.

On what basis do you make this statement?  Please refer to
http://www.scruz.net/~kangaroo/4Inequality.htm for a good discussion of how
"trickle down" resulted in real dollar decreases in the incomes of the lowest
60% of American society.  During the 1960s when the tax system was decidely
progressive (with the highest marginal tax rate exceeding 70%) all portions of
American society experiencd real wage growth.  And what about countries such as
Switzerland and Sweden that have very high marginal tax rates?  They some of
the highest income per capita figures in the world and they're lowest quintiles
of society are not suffering or being "destroyed".

>  I am one of those people who makes more than $100k, but I worked and
invested to make every penny.

I also make in excess of $100k annually.  However, you good fortune and mine is
a result of the capitalist system in America.  Is it untenable to be expected
to pay back some of the rewards we have wrought?  How much money would we be
making if the lower and middle class were not there to work and consume?  I
doubt it.  Furthermore, (and these are questions of personal opinion), is it
unreasonable that the ones who reap the most from the American system pay a
higher portion (though still retaining ample amounts unto themselves) in return
for that opportunity?  I say no.  If the tax system was such a dire spectre
then people would not make money, people would not take risk... but they do.
Why?  Because despite the tax system there is still significant rewards to be
wrought from taking risk.  The rewards are still there.  Taxing them is not
unfair.  But hording your gains to the detriment of the system that gave you
the opportunity to reap them is, in my opinion, unscrupulous.

Monaco has no income tax.  Perhaps you should try there.  I suppose you also
think philanthropy is complete nonsense.  Rockefeller giving his money away for
the benefit of the "parasites", Gates funding the installation of Internet
access in Alabama libraries, and other such nonsense?

I find it extremely ironic that on a list that looks to the future (where the
concepts of sharing information and resources is generally viewed as optimal)
that the spectre of individual greed rears its ugly head.

Please do not take this as me attempting to be confrontational or generate a
flame war but what relevance does J. Edgar Hoover's status in American history
have to do with the subject discussions for which this list was intended?  I do
not dispute that historical perspective is often important in charting future
pathways.  However, I do not see how a consensus on Hoover's place in American
history one way or the other provides salient insight into the future and the
objectives of this list.

If you disagree I would like to hear how this subject does have relevance to
this list.  This same message could be directed to the recent Clinton
discussion we had and probably to my own post on Armey's tax philosophy
yesterday.

In Pearson and Shaw's _Life_Extension_, they reported that low levels of
background radiation lengthened the lifespan of test animals.  Ditto
with low levels of pollution.  I think that low levels of poison
innoculate the body and trigger its immune responses.  Too much poison,
and it's bad.  Too little poison, and you have no defenses.

This is a question of policy and economics about which people have 
opinions, not merely a matter of opinion.

Your statement might make sense if tax proceeds, oxymoronically, went 
to support free markets, but they don't, and free markets don't need 
it. Commissions, at most, suffice there. The money that government 
expropriates instead goes into wasteful and disastrous programs that 
transfer wealth, distort markets, and create perverse incentives.

Taxation is not *unfair*? That's the least of it. It's armed robbery,
of which "unfair" is a very mild description.

I could go on and on, and I expect others will.

Oh, and as for Monaco -- I am sure a lot of us will opt out at some 
point. I can't see us carrying the clunky machinery of government into 
the far future, we can do MUCH better.

Because:
--women are generally more modest & less assertive/self-secure (arrogant) 
than men. This is almost certainly a genetic (ooops!) trait later reinforced by 
society. Extropianism is partially about "taking control of your life", "breaking 
away from the herd", "being independent, assertive and self-confident", and 
these things go directly against the female nature/reinforced role-model of meek,
altruistic nurturer. People in general don't like to go against the flow, and 
of those who *do*, most are men. The more agressive and egocentric nature
of men (generally speaking, of course) makes it easier for them to reach the
sky and touch the stars, so to speak. If women join a "radical" group, it is
usually out of loyalty to (or fear of rejection by) a boyfriend/husband/father etc. 
who has joined first. Only few join out of personal initiative.
--also, it must be noted that women usually consider clubs/associations/
organizations as childish boy's business.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think these are the main reasons why we see
so few women in transhumanism/extropianism/cryonics etc.

By the way, it's not just the women that are underrepresented in transhumanism.
*Everybody* is, except relatively young, white, higher educated middle class males.

As technology advances, and becomes a part of everyday life, the (present) 
extropian ideas will slowly loose their SF image and become mainstream.
Then the women, and the rest, might finally join in greater numbers. Then
again, the extropians of the future will probably be 20-200 years ahead of 
*their* time (unless a singularity makes this impossible), so extropianism
might by definition never be able to become mainstream. As long as there
is diversity, there will always be entities with some more foresight than others:
the extropians.

I've just completed reading "Prometheus Rising" by Robert Anton Wilson -
and I am *very* impressed and inspired by that book. I'd really
appreciate some opinions from other people on this list about that
particular book, since it's one of the "top-ten" books in the Extropian
Principles Reading List, and it basically says what you say. Of course,
it says nothing about Extropians or anybody on this list... well, at
least it says that extropy/negentropy is "good" - AND it says a lot
more... maybe I should put it the other way round: what you say reminds
me of some things I read in that book ;-)

I wonder how many people have experienced, or at least are interested in
- for example - the neurosomatic circuit mentioned in Prometheus Rising,
which might be a more reliable means of life-extension than having to
wait for better technology (I don't see it as an "alternative", though -
becoming immortal is a matter of technology because mortality is a fatal
hardware-bug that you can't overrun with even the best software). Or
simply checking out different reality-tunnels (which looks very much
like an important part of self-transformation to me, and it is fun).

On the critical side, I can think of no way of "falsifying" most of the
ideas in Prometheus Rising (except for Wilson's too optimistic view of
the future which was falsified by time). I'm afraid any attempt of
falsifying could be simply overcome by saying "this is dogmatic circuit
3 (dogmatic rationalist) argueing". That puts up the question: how
useful are the models explained, to people who use them?

Holger

Smoking itself probably does not play a major role since eating hemp
(well, any psychoactive drug made of hemp) has about the same drying
effect as smoking...

Most drugs (at least those forbidden by law) DO have an intense effect,
no matter what you think about them. I think set and setting is less a
question of whether it does work or not, but whether it will be useful
or useless for you (maybe that's what you actually meant).

I'm quite sure that the less a drug is dependent upon set and setting,
the higher the risk of abuse in terms of "making the drug do something
that you should do yourself". According to a study about drug-abuse,
hallucinongenics (which are totally dependent on set and setting) have a
rather low "abuse-potential", while opiates are frequently "abused" (if
anyone's interested I can dig it out - unfortunately, I have the mail on
another computer...)

I seem to recall a funny newspaper article from several years ago: several
cows died of THC poisoning when accidently having discovered a hidded hash
cache in the barnyard. I don't know whether they liked it well enough to
feast beyond measure, or simply overdosed because of latency. The fact
is: they ate most of it.

I think it is a good book. Not in the sense that it is 100% true and
useful, but it is a good starting point in meta-programming. One has
to keep a critical mind when reading it though, since a lot of the
stuff Wilson claims is of a questionable nature or made up (he would
say that this is the point, of course, but I think it is true even for
some of the things he didn't plan as trickery).

The first four circuits are not very controversial, they exist in
rephrased form in plenty of models for personality. Of course, one
might argue that personality psychology is also filled with
unfalsifiable propositions (I must admit that I do not have a high
opinion of the field even after reading it as a part of my psychology
studies). And remember that any model which explains away attempts to
check it, especially by "ad hominem" explanations of why you are
trying to check them, is very liable to contain mistakes or falsehoods
that are never corrected. Such defenses against falsification should
really be reasons to intensify scrutinity - what is the model hiding?

I think the upper four circuits are not very well described (that is
of course understandable, since they are outside normal experience)
and unverified. The fifth circuit seems to have some basis in fact,
during my studies in various subjects I have run into it, but the
uppermost three might just be recurring myths among psychonauts,
nothing real or useful at all.

Most likely a bit of both. I get more energetic by drinking Coca Cola,
despite the fact that the caffeine contents are far below my rather
high threshold. It is a learned reflex, but quite useful.

Relaxation unequivocally promotes creativity; that seems to be the
general consensus. Of course, you need to be active enough to do
something with the ideas, but otherwise tension reduces creativity a
lot.

Meditation is a bit more contentious. My impression is that the
benefits are mainly due to the relaxation and the fact that you spend
time exploring your own thinking processes, learning to control them
and change their flow. But that may be very individual and have very
different effects in different people, so I'm not sure about the
overall effect on creativity.

Most likely not. There is more to being a guru than bliss :-) 

We had an interesting discussion today at a course in biological
psychology I attend about the effects of antidepressants like Prozac
on depression compared to cognitive behavior therapy. It turns out
that Prozac makes people feel better and gets them out of the
depression, but they have a large probability of relapse. CBT on the
other hand works even better and has a fairly good prognosis
afterwards. The combination of CBT and Prozac isn't synergetic, it is
just as good as CBT alone. On the other hand, Prozac can help people
out from the really deep depression so that they can start with
CBT. What makes the difference is that Prozac doesn't give you any
strategies of keeping out of the depressive state, while CBT attempts
to. So if this can be extended as an analogy, chemical methods might
miss the important cognitive structures you would like to set up in
order to really profit from the experience. This might also fit in
with your musical experiences with hemp: you need to develop or learn
how to use it properly in order to get any use out of it.

	Exactly, but people don't see this. SF has so much horror in
it.  cryonics is in no way portrayed in a "warm and fuzzy" way
although it could very easily be done so.

	I was raised in the LDS church.  Have you ever been to the LDS
"Temple Square" in SLC?  That is a good example of "warm and fuzzy"
and that is why they are growing the way they are.

	Take, for example, the cover of TFI.  I'm proud to have that
book and would be very excited if some of my LDS family would pick it
up to read it.  But as soon as they see the cold and cracked face
cover, I'm sure a cold shiver goes through their spine.  These people
evidently can't see past what the cover actually means.  They must
have their warm and fuzzies served to them on a platter, like is done
in the LDS temple square and so forth.  If there was a glorious
colorful picture of a future world full of immortal people on the
color or something, I might be able to get some of my kids to take an
interrest.  But that cracked and cold face just turns people,
especially women, right off with a shiver.

I've just read an article by Frederick Edwords which seems to adress the
same problem, only with Humanism (I don't know much about Humanism but
it seems very much to be Transhumanism or Extropianism without focussing
on the future or the Extropian Principles, right?) The title was
"Freethought challenges of the '90s", and it should be available
somewhere on the web (I read it on my PalmPilot... ... I found it, see
below ;-) )

The most interesting idea in that article was to engage in all kinds of
"social" work. You don't reach "the masses" with discussions about
high-tech or even advanced psychology/philosophy because they don't even
understand what you're talking about. Instead, *live* Dynamic Optimism
and Spontanuous Order in a way that people can see - 

"The most Atheist and Humanist groups around the world do this. For
example, during my travels in India I met with the people of the Atheist
Center in Vijayawada who were active in counseling battered women,
rehabilitating criminals, providing birth control services, helping
people develop a rational life-style, even teaching 'atheistic' dances."
(Frederick Edwords "Freethought challenges of the '90s" -
http://humanist.net/humanism/freethot.html)

In that respect, I think the idea of "Extropian Gatherings" is quite a
good one - provide that kind of service for anybody, but make it an
"Extropian/Transhuman Service" ;-)

Unfortunately, that sort of action needs a certain "critical mass" - a
lot of supporters and a few people who are willing to spend a great
amount their time... in that respect, I find working with like-minded
organisations and individuals quite important.

later,
Holger

The picture you are referring to is Ander's ray-trace work "Escaton". 
I personally like it a lot (simple, powerful), and it was me who put 
it there; but some other people I've shown it to were not very 
excited about it. Perhaps they just have bad taste?

Yes, hallucinogenic drugs have a low abuse potential (that is widely
acknowledged in the scientific literature). But this might not be
because of their reliance on set and setting, rather the low abuse
potential and the set-and-setting-ness are both a result of the fact
that they do not strongly affect the reward systems of the
brain. Anything that makes those systems fire is addictive, if ever so
slightly.

I think it _is_ important to increase the appeal of the transhumanist 
philosophy to women. We've been thinking a bit about how the WTA 
could contribute that, so far without any very definite conclusions.

One good way, I think, would be to capitalize on the women we 
already have (sorry for this way of phrasing it...). I mean, there 
are female contributors to this list, for example, who could serve as 
superb role models -- sucessful, strong, creative, confident. It 
is much easier to assimilate a philosophy if there is a person you 
admire who embodies it. And it would show that transhumanism is not 
just abstract words but also something that can be _lived_.

It might also be true that there are some issues which are more 
"male" and some that are more "female". Perhaps, on average, men are 
comparatively more interested in molecular nanotechnology and women 
in, say, new forms of interpersonal relations. If that is so, then 
one could try to give more coverage to these "female" topics. (Or 
prehaps, I am just prejudiced.)

Very true, and that is often the hardest part. I was doing a debate 
last Sunday on cloning. Afterward, many people came up and typically 
they would say that they were impressed by the arguments presented by 
our side. "Your presentation and your arguments were much better." -- 
Did you vote for us? --"OF COURSE not!".

Thanks. I'm just a part of it, though. The initial response has been 
extremely encouraging :-)

Let me also say, just to forestall any possible misunderstanding, 
that though the WTA is a separate entity from the Extropy Institute, 
it is not a rival or even competitor, but rather a symbiont and ally. 
The goal is to increase the outreach to include extropians and also 
those transhumanists who do not accept all features of extropian 
transhumanism. One important goal is to bring transhumanism to 
academic respectability

...which is another main goal, perhaps the most important one.

 I think he's only off by a small amount here. From _Barron's_, 1/5/98,
page MW9 blurb on Computer Motion (NASDAQ:RBOT):
 "The FDA cleared the sale of the company's voice-controlled surgical
 robots, called the Aesop 3000, which are used in minimally invasive
 heart surgery."

 I'm puzzled by the connection between economic growth and jury trials.
I guess I need to read the book.

 The 6th and 7th amendments look clear enough that there shouldn't be
any risk of this; however, this quote from a 1996 story makes me wonder:

	WASHINGTON, June 24 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 Monday a  
defendant who is prosecuted in a single trial for multiple petty 
offenses does not have a constitutional right to a jury trial, even if 
the penalties add up to more than six months. 
	But at least four justices issued warnings about the dangers of  
straying too far in the direction of trials by judges only. 
	Under Supreme Court precedent, a jury is not required in general when  
a single crime is punishable by less than six months in prison. 
	In a New York case, however, a former mail carrier faced multiple  
charges, each punishable by less than six months in prison. 
	The Supreme Court said Monday that is constitutional.

 Wiring isn't the only way to get there - direct satellite communications

 I think that a discovery in the next few years of a cryoprotectant good

 I'd suggest the question "why were people so complacent about the Nazi's
in the 1930's?" as a good example. Or why weren't blacks treated like
human beings in the south.
 Or things like opposition to anesthesia research. See a long list in:
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/News/negativeComments.html">Erroneous Predictions</a>.
 Of course it takes an unusually good SF writer to get this right.

 Just using lots of cpu power won't solve the PFP, at least not before

 Instead of engineering new proteins, just build things by attaching
known proteins to each other and to dna.

I pointed this page out to the list about a month ago; it is
purely humor.  My cousin Clifford Crocker did some of the art
on that page.  Like me, he enjoys making fun of our Southern

Personally I think this whole idea of an 'age of consent' (that noone is
able to give consent until one particular day of their lives and that
anyone can give consent afterwards) is one more ancient myth we need to
eliminate. I like the libertarian idea that's been posted here before;
any 'child' who can prove to a court that they are able to make their
own decisions should be treated as an adult from that time onwards, 
regardless of age. Seems pretty clear, simple and flexible to me.

Unless being treated as a kid when you're perfectly able to handle life
by yourself screws you up so much that you need years to recover.

My guess:
juries give too much in punitive damages, choking growth.  Eliminate
jury trials, and companies will surge forward, unhindered by the
millstone of high damages.

I'd bet this is far too simplistic a view of law and the economy, but
Greg Burch or Robin might be more qualified to say something about this.

Hmmm.  I found the current Code of Federal Regulations OL at:

but couldn't find any reference to extraterrestrials.  Unfortunately, I
couldn't seem to page though title 14 section 1211, it needed an
additional number (maybe paragraph?).

If tax rates are 0%, taxes are 0.  If tax rates are 100%, taxes are 0,
because no one's bothering to work.  So there's some curve relating
rates and revenues.  If rates are below the optimal rate, then raising
rates will increase taxes; if above the optimum, then the rates are
being a net disincentive, and should be lowered.  Essentially
supply-side ("voodoo economics" according to candidate Bush) stated that
we were above the optimum.  Apparently this was not the case.

My problem is that the biggest expenses are welfare for old folks.
Defense, welfare for poor people, and other things, don't add up to that
much; it's SS and Medicare which dominate.

I'd vote for the reality of the first six (he did have the metaprogramming
circuit as number six rather than seven, didn't he?), but I'm pretty
dubious about the others, except in the most limited sense. In many
respects I preferred John Lilly's model (in 'Center of the Cyclone') for
the region beyond the fourth circuit.

BTW, those interested in this subject should probably also read Lilly's
book 'Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer', which
is on the Web somewhere. It's a bit of a tough read in places, but it has
a lot of interesting background information.

    Mark

P.S. I'd also strongly agree with Anders' statement a few days ago about
the dangers of careless alteration of motivational systems.

In early 1997 It became clear to me that my children needed
an explanation for their fathers weird beliefs.  My youngest son
came to me one day with a plaintiff look on his face and asked. 
"Dad, why aren't we christian anymore?" In his mind he equated
being a christian with going to church.

I stammered a bit then tried to explain that I wanted him to
search for truth with all his heart and mind, and use the time
life had given him to make a better world for those who follow.
To do that effectively he would have to utilize his intelligence
and not allow others to define truth for him.  I clearly lost him 
in the translation.  (his attention span timed out)

I have four very bright children (and do not anticipate contributing
further to the gene pool), all of them impress me daily with their
intelligence.  We are very close, more so than most.  Since they
first learned to comprehend whole sentences, we've been playing a game.
We call it talking.  We gather at the table or sometimes on the carpet.  
One of them brings up a mystery...anything they don't understand.
Then we have a free-for-all brainstorming session on the problem.
We have together solved (....well not really) puzzles ranging from
time travel to "If Methuselah was so darn good why did he drown in
the flood."

As a result of his question I began a diary which came to be called
the Blue Book for no other reason than pure chance.  The first 
draft was stored on a blue floppy disc.  My idea was to develop
a little life-guide and have a few copies made up, so they could
read it when I'm toothless and senile.  Perhaps then they would
understand what their Dad was trying to tell them.

As they are all critical thinkers, I am sure they will end
up with as much awe and wonder as I feel towards science and 
engineering.  My hope was to give them a defined set of ethics
and a reason for the same without resorting to pie in the sky,
carrot and the stick (read religious) fairy tales.

In January of 1998 I posted a portion of the text on Usenet.  To
my delight, the response was overwhelmingly positive (although
some accused me of being a Jim Jones type cultist).  Most wanted
to read more.

More importantly I discovered that my ideas were shared by
many others.  A new friend asked me if I was a Transhumanist
or a Extropian.  I had no idea what he meant.  My first
thoughts in retrospect were probably off base.  I became angry
that he would dare question the status of my sexuality or of my
vision.  (I am pretty sure an extropian is also someone with
Wall-Eyes)

After a little searching I discovered that both of these groups,
however unfortunate their choice of names, were very much like me.

I had been calling myself a New-Realist (from Wild Palms) much
to the chagrin of my religiously impaired friends.  So I guess now
I really am a STRAIGHT Transhumanist, and an Extropian with
good vision.

So that he does not get angry with recent (Ga)Yeltsin comments, after
having, of course,  drinken a little more vodcka than usual...
And, by other side, he also does not kill Irakians unnecessarily... just
take Adolf Hussein  out...

I say that 'cause the list is not closed to them... the great majority

I, IMHO, disagree...just  'cause:

1-->  Transhumanism IS NOT 'just abstract words'... Possibly it shoud de
better say: more 'intelectually accessible'... what is diff. from abstract...

2-->  The presence of women is indifferent to the abstraction or
concreteness level of the discussions (to be discussed...)... it may be
important just to having more the simple presence of theirs... what is
always a pleasure...

3-->  The great majority of women must be humbler... and accept better the
almost unavoidable (and always positive) critics that will be done to their
opinions, AS are done to any other person... be male or female... ( when
I'm talking about exact sciences, I WILL NOT anyway week a concept just

her less capable than she really is...>>> Mr T. A. Edson said that a

Well, well... do not know... 
I also participate in a discussion list named 'european sociologists'
<european-sociologist@mailbase.ac.uk>...and if there are not more men, they
are tied in number... Men, in general, naturally get well succeded in what
they want to... women too, when get ineterested in... ( their formation
unconsciously leads, in general, to accomodation and existencial
ociousness... When there is necessary a real result so that the bridge
really DO NOT fall... they call a man... unless they are woken up to
this... got it up ???) 
The women should do their work and bring such topics to discussion... I
really hate some of theirs's  tendency of ALWAYS being just 'laid with legs
opened' waiting for us to do something... They also know how to do a lot of
movements and 'jobs' tooo... hehehe... If the related topics survive in the
natural intellectual process... When my product is good and I am interested
in selling it, I will have to fight for it...
( I am just being intentionally too rigid... F.ex: If they - in general -
were really more independent, an idiot model whose name  I do not remember
now, would not be trying to process that guy ( if I'm not wrong, that who
died with  Dy...), just because 'he promised to marry her' and did not do
that..  fuck her!!! go her learn how to get money honestly !!! and worse...

Truth Machines and Open Networks

Although Im sure this would make a nice tie-in with Jim Halperins
The Truth Machine I havent read it, so I cant comment.  Well I
can, but that wouldnt be fair.

Imagine for a minute that the Internet is thriving, and for
organisational purposes we now mirror real-life events, places and
people inside the computer.  Mirroring a real world event, place or
person inside the computer is basically the autonomous production of
meta-information (see www.mirrorworlds.com).  This information can be
easily organised by agents.  For instance, if I go and fill my car
with petrol the transaction can be automatically made.  This is
because somewhere within the network environment Ive created a piece
of information stating that I used the pump.  This just happens to be
the way the World Wide Web is progressing (and if you dont believe me
ask the W3C.)

All this information is then linked together and presented in a
machine-readable fashion.  As the potential of these mirror worlds
is realised, more and more information will be created on the network.
 Eventually, every single thing you do will be stored on the network. 
As is the nature of the Internet, all this information will be stored
in an open format (encryption and fast machine-based organisation
doesnt mix) on a non-centralised network.  What this means is that
anyone can find out anything about anyone at anytime.  And therefore
it is impossible to lie (falsifying one piece of information means
falsifying *every* piece of information, as is the nature of complex
hyperlinked networks.)  Concerns that this may lead to lack of privacy
are, to an extent, correct.

Solving crime becomes easy.  Actually, crime ceases to exist. 
Seeing what caused the crime is just as easy as seeing the crime
itself.  Secrecy is no longer possible, as Ive said this is
*absolute* truth, if something is happening we will know about it.  At
first this may mean the moral majority goes on the rampage, but
where to?  There neighbours, their local politicians, their own homes?
 How long will it take them to realise that their morals have become
overwhelmed by this new-found openness?  How long before we all become
tired of making petty judgements?  Besides, who can say what I do is
wrong when I clearly see that they indulge in it every night at 8:00PM?

Of course, youre going to have to forget Intellectual Property
Rights.  If its been thought of, it need never be thought of again
(only improved on.)  A completely open economy (or Open Market) has
already made a small emergence on the Internet (with several freeware
products.)  Software will be the first to undergo this transition,
because it can already be easily copied and distributed (piracy is a
good thing.)  

So would you mind giving up privacy for absolute truth?

It should look like a capital I with a loop on the right side so it looks

Nope, you need a time machine.  14 CFR 1211 was repealed April 26, 1991.
And it never actually made contact with ET illegal, it just gave NASA
the authority to quarantine such "extraterrestrially exposed" persons
at its discretion without hearing (pretty nasty, but no criminal
record).  It was passed shortly before Apollo 11 in fear that those
exposed to moon rocks might have some contagious pathogen.

Mr. Bailey, in case you didn't realize it, the government coerces you to 
pay taxes. You don't pay, they throw you in jail. You resist, they blow 
your head off. It's as simple as that. I'm a libertarian. I oppose the 
initiation of force, whether by an individual or a collective. 

I doubt if anyone on this list has any objection to people voluntarily 
sharing information or resources. What people do with their money and/or 
knowledge is their own business. It's the violence of the state many of 
us object to and the idea that we should be forced to give our money 
away to others. Taxation is just another form of slavery. This is a 
moral issue to me and arguments about what taxes are "fair" and whether 
Reagan¹s tax policy "worked" (whatever that means) are totally beside 
the point. People should pay for the services they want and not be 
forced to pay for those they don't want.

I want zero taxes. Zilch. Zip. As an interim measure, I want everyone's 
taxes to go down and the government to shrink. 

We could argue about the economics of chattel slavery, but it's 
irrelevant. Slavery is wrong, and has no place in a civilized society. 
It took about 100,000 years for people to realize this. I can only hope 
people will realize the same about taxation at some point.

O.W. Holmes once said that taxation is the price we pay for 
civilization. He was dead wrong. Taxation is the price we pay for not 
having a good enough civilization.  

As for the philanthropy of the Rockefellers and Bill Gates: fine and 
dandy. They are free to give away their money as they see fit. However, 
it's my opinion that the Rockefellers did much more to help people by 
providing high quality petroleum at low prices than they did with any of 
their charity. (Unfortunately, power hungry Nelson Rockefeller did much 
to undo the positive aspects of the family business when he became 
governor of New York and started taxing, regulating and throwing people 
in prison for victimless crimes.) As for Bill Gates, I believe does much 
more to help people by running a successful business than he does by 
giving away computers to schools, admirable as that may be.

As for greed, what's wrong with it? What's ugly about it? The idea that 
the only people who do any good for others are the altruistic Mother 
Theresa types is nonsense. If I provide you with a product or service at 
a good price and I do it solely to add to my bank account, what's the 
problem? I'd like my (unfortunately low) standard of living to increase 
and keep increasing. What's evil about that?

I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything. I cooperate with 
others when it is in my self interest to do so. I'm happy to cooperate 
with you if there is a good reason to. Otherwise, I'd like to be left 
alone.

As stated below, today's economy is not the same as the economy of 1980. That the 20%
cut in income taxes led to the largest spurt of growth in the postwar era is not
debatable. That we needed deficit speding to soak up the dollar supply overseas that
had been accumulating during the postwar gold standard era in order to kill
inflationary trends that began after Nixon let the nation loose from the GOld
Standard is also widely accepted. That the huge defense buildup of the early 80's
financed the computer industry to a viable status, to which we now owe our present
incredible gains in productivity (which is what is paying all of those increased tax
revinues) is also not debatable... A very good case can be made that we owe our
present economic vitality in large part to the economic policies of the Reagan era. I
notice that countries (and liberal controlled states here in the US) that laughed at
Reagans economics are now still rather behind the average US economic performance.

Also note that Reagan's policies of deregulation, which he was not very successfull
at due to a democrat controlled congress, have gone very far to help the economy as
well, now that a Democrat president has jumped on the deregulation bandwagon....

Its false. It is based on government inflation statistics which even Greenspan has
acknowledged were hopelessly wrong. If inflation is reported to be higher than it
really is, then, by the reported statistics, wage growth that keeps pace with real
inflation is seen to be declining wages. The stats in the 80s also completely ignored
the increase in the average standard of living on a systemic basis due to advances in
technology in the home....

Its been estimated that entitlement liabilities the government owes to retirees will
exceed the entire federal budget sometime around 2015-2020. No money for pork,
defense, education, children, foreign aid, research, etc. The US government will be
owned lock stock and barrel by the AARP, and we'll all be wage slaves to the
oldsters. I'll be turning 50 in 2018, so maybe its not such a bad thing for me, or
anyone else over 30 right now, as we'll be in the ruling party.

When this happens, kids won't just be killing other kids, they'll be taking out
retirees, while the AARP will be having lynchings of teenage punks.

Viewing this site with my rather primitive version of Netscape, I see black

Well, I really think hemp is a way to open doors that are inside of us. Let
us view the reality in another way that is very useful not only for artist
but for any human kind.
My points of view would never be the same if I didn´t smoke a long time ago.
I began constructing a more open point of view of so many things. 
I didn´t change my previous thinkings, but they´ve grown more colorful,
respectful of other´s points of view, and I hope deeper.
Then comes an obvious question, why it is not legal? Well I´m not sure that
the State wants us to be free, colorful, repectful, and so on...
The state wants 1000 workers, for 2 or 3 thinkers. The thinkers -artists,
designers- can smoke, but not everybody. Obviously I don´t agree with this.

Yep, spot on - but it's not really *sf* that is replete with horror and
ghastly imagery so much as *sci fi*, its idiot younger brother.  Alas, the
cretin is the one whom most people meet in the street.  

The reason why key sf novels such as Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND
were so wildly popular is exactly their warm & fuzzy quotient, alongside a
subtext of bracing sardonic skepticism concerning many traditional
oppressive values.  The most beloved sf from the 1950s bears this out
exactly, I think - Ted Sturgeon's work especially, with its superhuman
gestalts struggling to emerge against the hostility, indifference and
cruelty of `ordinary homo sap, Zenna Henderson's sentimental `People'
stories, with their psi-powered superhumans, Van Vogt's SLAN (which grows
bleaker, it's true, as it turns into a cold-blooded power fantasy), much of
Arthur Clarke's redemptive, aspiring, gloriously poignant visions of the
remote future...  

And yet the market ninnies, when they don't simply let such key work slip
out of print, seem to be stuck in the nasty 10-year-old playground
tear-wings-off-flies mentality - or at least they assume most sf readers
are.  So the artwork is either insanely malign weaponry jerkoffs, or
twisted mutants and deformed faces that are somehow meant to be symbolic
(metonymic) of `the future'.  

Meanwhile, the fantasy genre that hived off sf has gone in the
chocolate-box art direction with billowing clouds and unicorns and
handsome/beautiful wish fulfilment figures... and it way outsells sf,
surprise surprise.

Exactly.  On the other hand, we surely don't want to get into corrupt
bullshit like fundamentalist Xian art, with its happy 1950s families rising
into the glowing sunset of the Apocalypse *in their levitating Chevvies*...

Just so.  This is the iconography of abjection and fear, and it is an error
of the first water to stick with it.  But I gather that it's the guys at
the coalface of distribution whose opinions count most nowadays, and they
know nothing of either the contents or the actual readers, just some blurry
guesstimate of their own ignorance, which then feeds back into numerical
data, and it all goes into a blindingly stupid loop of illogic that drives
out interesting, subtle work that might otherwise modify the cracked, cold
face of the genre - and works of advocacy such as FIRST IMMORTAL.

The following is from the American Enterprise Institute. www.aei.org. This article 
refutes the doom and gloomers who continue to insist that most of us are becoming worse 
off. It ain't so. We continue to become better off economically despite the monstrous 
parasite of a government we have. (Oh, to have that burden lifted!)


Here's the article:

Living Standards in the United States

The ninth seminar in AEI's series Understanding Economic Inequality was led by Daniel 
T. Slesnick of the
University of Texas at Austin. Mr. Slesnick argued that consumption is a more relevant 
measure than income for
gauging economic inequality, and he showed that consumption data suggest little change 
in inequality over the past
twenty-five years. A summary of his presentation follows.

Economic inequality and its growth are almost always measured in terms of income. In 
recent years, considerable
publicity has been given to studies indicating that since the early 1970s median family 
income has been stagnant,
inequality has been increasing, and the poverty rate has stopped declining. But 
material well-being is actually a
function of consumption, not of income. Assuming consumption could be measured 
properly, what would it show
about trends in standards of living in the United States over the past quarter-century 
and trends in the gap between
rich and poor?

Research into these questions yields striking results. Measures of consumption show 
that--contrary to what is
generally believed--living standards for rich and poor alike have continued to rise 
since 1970 and that the disparity
between rich and poor has increased very little.

Measuring trends in inequality is difficult for many reasons, and those difficulties 
have an important bearing on the
controversy over inequality, as other scholars in this series have shown. Measurement 
problems are particularly
significant in the case of income, but they affect analysis of consumption as well. 
Consider the following issues:

  How should housing be treated? A homeowner whose mortgage is paid off enjoys the use 
of his house but
makes no cash outlay for that use. He consumes but does not spend. The same problem 
arises on a smaller scale
for other consumer durables, such as automobiles.

  What price index should one use to measure consumption in real (that is, 
inflation-adjusted) terms? There are
problems with the consumer price index, including the widely acknowledged flaws in its 
treatment of housing
before 1983, which exaggerated inflation.

  How does one adjust for family size? Does a family of ten require exactly five times 
the consumption of a family
of two? Clearly not, but what is the right adjustment for "equivalence"? What about the 
households not composed
of families?

After accounting for these and other measurement problems, I have developed measures of 
economic well-being
based on data on personal consumption expenditures in the national income accounts.

Real median family income, the traditional measure of economic well-being, increased by 
an average of 2.7 percent
per year from 1947 to 1970 but stopped rising after 1970. Real per capita consumption, 
however, kept on
growing. It rose by 2.4 percent per year from 1947 to 1970 and by only a little 
less--2.1 percent--from 1970 to
1993.

What accounts for the divergence in these trends? Part of the explanation lies in 
changes in family size. If a family
of four and a family of three have the same income, the standard of living--the per 
capita availability of income for
consumption--of the family of three is obviously higher. This would not matter if 
average family size were stable,
but in fact it has been declining over the past quarter-century. In addition, measuring 
changes in real median family
income ignores the nearly one-third of the population composed of "unrelated 
individuals," that is, persons not
living with family.

Another part of the answer lies in the aforementioned flaws in the consumer price 
index, which exaggerated
inflation before 1983 and, as a result, decreased measures of real income. The deflator 
for personal consumption
expenditures in the national income accounts, which is used to eliminate inflation from 
measures of consumption,
does not have this problem.

The argument that standards of living have been rising since 1970 finds further support 
in Engel's law, which with
plentiful historical evidence posits an inverse relationship between one's standard of 
living and the share of total
spending one devotes to food. Reported decreases in the proportion of total expenses 
households devote to food
therefore support the view that standards of living have continued to rise in the past 
quarter-century.

Measures of inequality based on the survey of consumer expenditures also show a quite 
different trend from those
based on income. According to the latter, inequality has increased strikingly. For 
example, the ratio of income in
the top three deciles to income in the bottom three rose from 5.4 in 1961 to 7.9 in 
1992. But when consumption is
substituted for income as the basis for measuring inequality, the ratio scarcely 
changes--it was 3.9 in 1961 and 4.0
in 1992.

Incomes fluctuate more than consumption does from one year to the next. People do not 
decrease their spending
significantly when they regard a loss of income as temporary. Material welfare is best 
measured, where possible,
by lifetime or "permanent" income. Since consumption is a more accurate proxy for 
permanent income than annual
income is, this is still another reason to prefer consumption to income as a measure of 
material welfare.

These varied approaches to the problem of assessing economic inequality all point to 
the conclusion that both the
level of economic well-being in America and its distribution have performed far better 
during the past
quarter-century if consumption rather than family income measures are used. Moreover, 
on several counts
consumption is a more appropriate measure of economic well-being than income.

How many Republicans are from Albania???? Good a reason as any.

What is even more pathetic is that Clinton is also sticking to the
script, mostly, only he's using a better boogeyman, Hussein, and
Carville is a much more colorful spin doctor than De Niro's  Breen.

I personally like the term Bubbaquiddick, myself. Since its a Democrat
scandal, involving possible sex, you should do your scandal name
derivations by a more logical convention.

  I agree and practice, actually - don't take my posts too seriously,
I play with words for arguments' sake and fun.  My last lover, a month
ago, was a young passionate Israeli woman who likes spending time
discussing philosophy with Bedouins, and who was telling me that in U.S.,
people know how to make money but don't know how to live.  Before her,
an oriental woman who went from Transcendental Meditation to software
development; she was a good dancer - a rare thing at the time where
people can't do much more than hope around and flail their limbs.
She liked expressing here ideas that "science doesn't explain much",
and I couldn't stand that for long.   There is a big difference 
between a lover and a girlFriend though; a real relationship requires
good mutual understanding and commonality of interests.
Otherwise, I love hanging out with all kinds of people, and have
good friends between 15 and 75 years of age, with all kinds of beliefs
and interests, and learn a lot from any of them; it's quite interesting
to practice changing your roles in relationships, too.

I'm not sure what you mean by a "lookup table", but almost any  meaning
that makes sense would be a turing machine. So, you appear to believe
that "strong AI" is equivalent to saying that a intelligence is turing
computable,
and that you don't agree? What needs to be added? would continuous
analog elements of some sort suffice, or do you need quantum effects?

I don't have a strong opinion on this, but don't think it much matters
as its trivial to incorporate either analog or quantum elements in
any actual physical system, so the need for such elements will not
hinder the advent of an SI. In particular, the digital elements can
interact with humans, with the humans providing the necessary non-
turing portion of the intelligence.

I think this is a good idea.

I watched a program on TLC last summer about Cryptography.  Romana
Machado appeared on this program.  I was struck by the level of
confidence she conveyed.  Enough so that I did a search to see if she
had a web page.  From her page I found my way to the Transhuman and
Extropian pages.  Had it not been for Romana's appearance on that
program I would not be aware of Transhumanism or Extropians.

Darl'n Nick!  I love this idea!  Especially the capitalize part!  

Yes, there are many strong, confident extropian transhuman women, to be
sure.  We can find admirable examples on this list as well as in the in the
news, media and writings.  Check our Wendy McElroy, Carla Sinclair and Celia
Pearce whose books ring of transhumanity. And, Judith Lewis whose writings
on technology hit the headlines. Not to mention Linda Chamberlain who
co-founded Alcor Foundation, the leading cryonics organization. And, Amara
Graps, a favored media-alert astronomer.  Also, there are Chris Peterson and
Pattie Maas whose spear-heading techno-know-now set the pace.  Then there's
Sandy Stone - an exemplar transgender lady who peaks the international
conference circuit.  Let's not forget Tanya Jones, an Extropy Institute
Director who organizes projects at the Foresight Institute. Also, Sarah Marr
whose transhuman savvy has won many a debate, and Kathryn Aegis whose
knowledge about genders is formidable.  And of course Nadia Reed who is an
accomplished artist and well-known extropians Carol Shaw, Kennita Watson,
Ailing Freeman and Sunah Caroline Cherwin who founded the zine "Slippery
When Wet!"

Shall I go on?

And "Dr." Fiorella Terenze's accomplishments and forever glamour and media
attention has been an uplift to anyone enthusiastic about astro-physics.  Or
Regina Pancake whose special effects company produces the designs for
Hollywood's major science fiction films!

And Lee Close, who in the 1970's was a top Hollywood beauty and SF film
actress, and how writes about transhuman beauty and practices it as well!

OH!  I'm out of breath!

Cheers!

Irrelevant?  If a society with slavery was more stable and more
productive than a free society, the latter would shortly pass out of
existence.  This is not the case now, but it may well have been the case
for every agricultural society above the subsistence level.

It is easy for me to believe that we have greater scientific truth than
ever before, because I can see where it is coming from.  The claim that
we are ethically superior to all previous civilizations is harder to
swallow, especially as I still lack any idea of where 'right' and 'wrong'
come from.

Science cannot answer questions of right and wrong, but it can answer
questions of how society should be arranged to reach a certain goal.  I
suspect that in the long run that is all which really matters.  I will
be convinced that a gov't-less society is possible, let alone optimal,
when I see one exist and succeed.

Fair enough, but what does that mean?  Is the failing a moral failing,
or a lack of low enough information and transaction costs, and a stable
enough starting position, for market-like mechanisms to do all the work
of maintaining growth _and_ stability?

That's because the government proclaimed "trickle down" and then put

I read once that at one of the early uranium mines in Europe, before 
they discovered all the nasty stuff radiation would do to people, the 
average miner -- and the average member of a miner's household -- 
would die of lung cancer at about age 70.  Meantime, everyone in 
the area who *wasn't* a uranium miner or residing with one, 
typically died of a wide variety of diseases at an average age of 45.

It's closing in on 10 years since David Gelernter
first proposed his vision of all-encompassing "Mirror
Worlds". Yak Wax says:
< For instance, if I go and fill my car with petrol
the transaction can be automatically made.  This is
because somewhere within the network environment I've
created a piece of information stating that I used
the pump. This just happens to be the way the World
Wide Web is progressing (and if you don't believe me
ask the W3C.) >

I just linked from Amazon to UPS to track my book
order and saw that the package was scanned in my
local post office this morning.  This is useful
information but is supported by strictly commercial
interests and it is not available to everyone,
besides, who else would care?  When I filled my car
up with gasoline the other night (using a credit card
at the pump), the transaction was sent to the company
via satellite.  This data is not likely to be
available on the Web any time soon.  When I purchased
my groceries, the company recorded the scanned
information in a private database, which they will
aggregate with millions of other transactions and
sell as purchasing trends information back to the
consumer products companies - they're not about to
make this data freely available.

As David Gelernter puts it at
http://www.mirrorworlds.com/horizons/
< in a society where researchers and practitioners
lead wholly different lives, where practitioners are
rich and researchers remain stolidly middle-class --
research will only attract a handful of fanatics. >

Wax waxes about how:
< Eventually, every single thing you do will be
stored on the network. >

Why and where?  It's one thing to have 'everything'
being transmitted over 'The Net', it's quite
something else again to have everything *stored*
somewhere that anyone can access.  The only thing I
can see that would make Gelernter's 'ideal' a reality
is for a world government to mandate that all
transactions and transmissions by stored centrally -
just think of all the 'optimizing' 'mechanism design'
policies the central planners could then dream up!

On the other hand, read Greg Bear's novel SLANT for
some ideas on who might have commercial interests in
tracking all the urinalysis samples collected by
intelligent toilets attached to the Net...

David Brin has a similar idea in his Transparent Society.  He had an
article about this in a recent issue of Wired, and is coming out with
a book on the subject in May, 1998.  He envisions widespread use of
surveillance cameras and other kinds of monitoring devices.  This will
prevent many forms of crime and dishonesty.

One problem with the idea is that people do like their privacy, and so
they may try to use technologies to protect it.  Encryption, anonymous
communications, digital cash, and similar tools can be used to allow
people to interact while preserving privacy.  No doubt you are right that
there will be costs involved in using these, but there will be those
who find the costs worthwhile.  You then are faced with the prospect
of using coercion to prevent people from using technologies to protect
their privacy, in order to achieve your desired result.

That's where I draw the line.  If people want to voluntarily give up
privacy, that's fine.  But they should not force others to do the same.

As long as you or David want to predict that society will voluntarily
move into a culture where there is no more lying, no more adultery, no
more secrets, and no more privacy, that's fine.  I'm skeptical, because
this would be such a total change in human culture that it is hard for
me to imagine.  Most of the conflicts explored in classic fiction would
become impossible.  (I accused David of wanting to make stories about
illicit sexual affairs the exclusive domain of science fiction writers
like himself.)

The problem arises when people become so excited about this marvelous
new world that they are willing to use force to get there.  I think
most of us would agree that these changes should be adopted voluntarily.
People should be free to expose more of their private lives to public
scrutiny, with the decisions being made on an individual basis.

	We don't yet know what the sensations we use to represent our
conscious knowledge are.  We just know what they are introspectively
like.  We don't yet know how these sensations are able to be put or
unified together to build or conscious awareness.  We just know that
we can be aware of much of it all simultaneously in a unified
conscious world of phenomenal awareness.  We don't know whether these
qualia are based on something analog or quantum or something else
entirely.  But one thing is very obvious, red (which we use to
represent 700 nm light, and by the way is nothing like 700 nm light
since it is in our brain) is certainly a lot more (and much more rich
in meaning resulting in our greater intelligence) than some mere non
unified abstract set of bits where it doesn't matter if these bits are
represent by a man in a room reading kanji, holes in paper, or quantim

The principle was known, yes, but radar development was a costly toy,
pushed by military necesseties. In the Albion air battle, superior British
radar vs. the Teutonic neoludd Heldenmythos ('Ich will keinen Kinntop im
Flugzeug') made a significant impact on the war theatre.

Btw, modern radar (synthetic aperture, phased array) has experienced/is
experiencing a second revolution due to advances in (digital and analog) 
electronics, xref terrain mapping/surface probing from LEO. Also, check
out lidar.

I thought this might be of interest to both those interested in art

I'd like to announce the existence of Monadnock Online,
a website devoted to "joy and reason and meaning" (in the

contains:

1. The Monadnock Review, a webzine of art and philosophy

2. The Ism Book, a hypertext dictionary of philosophy

3. "Fan Spaces" devoted to inspiring thinkers and artists

4. My personal website (writings, song lyrics, poetry, etc.)

Now that I have a dedicated domain name, I plan to more

I think there is a tribe in India (no refs, of course) who is also into

also been invoked for an explanation for the origin of the habit.

Like Trevor Goodchild? (A transhumanist dictator in the animated

"everybody-watches-everybody" policy - while still keeping some dirty

It's not just governments playing games with security.  One of my
clients is IBM Corp.  They sold Lotus Notes systems to the Swedish
Government with high-level encryption.  Normally, high-level encryption
is not legally exportable, but IBM got a special waiver from the U.S.
Government.  Everybody was happy, until recently.  The Swedes found out
that the way IBM got the waiver was to give the NSA a copy of all
decryption keys for every system they shipped.  Thus, the U.S.
Government has decryption capability for all of the Swedish Government's
new computers.  The Swedish Government is NOT happy about this, and does
not understand how this could be done without their knowledge or
consent.  They currently are investigating, and are considering this a
breach of their national security by IBM Corp.

Ah, who needs "real" sex when you can spank ye monkey...THE
Extropian thing to do, IMO (total control, no hassles...a cheap,
quick way to deal with them nasty primal urges!) Also, porn
mags are usually a better investment than sex partners (hookers
or otherwise) -- they last a lifetime, are user-friendly & relatively
cheap. Now *this* is efficiency! ;-)

True, and equally true is the fact that the data in a computer's memory that 
a photo cell has received a photon of 700 nm light is nothing like that light. 
I don't know if that data is anything like my idea of red, and I don't know 
if your red is the same as mine either.

All bits are abstract whether in a brain or a machine, and if computers  
contained nothing but non unified set of bits they would produce only 
gibberish. They don't.

To exist information must be in a context, otherwise a hole in a paper tape 
is not data it's just a hole, but there is nothing unique about the human 
mind in that regard.

As for Searle's Chinese Room, it only proves one thing, a very small part of 
a mechanism does not have all the attributes of the whole.

Here's a manipulative strategy:  Convince religious leaders that by
constructing a clone of Jesus that we would actually be manifesting the Second
Coming.  With some clever influence we could get them to believe that cloning
was brought about to bring about the Second Coming.  It'd be interesting to see
how the Christian community would react to the ability to assist Jesus in his
"return".

I believe that there is no convincing evidence to lead one unequivocally state
that software will not eventually be "conscious" or "intelligent" (comparable
with human intelligence).  The reasons given by those who do state such things
are impossible are almost dogmatic.  Their reasons  (when you get past all the
fancy technospeak) are basically summed up in the phrase "it just does not seem
like it should be possible".  I like to stay away from positions that presume
something intrinsically mystical or special about the human mind.  We used to
think we were special by our location in the universe and in the solar system,
by our species, by our "divine" image and so forth.  The belief (subtle that it
is) now is that the seat of our essence, the mind, is somehow unique or beyond
mere technology.

I understand the position that people doubt "machines" could achieve a
conscious state, or wonder if such entities would be creative.  But emphatic
positions that such things can never come to pass are uncomfortable to me.  I
can not say that such a thing will surely come to pass either.  I do not know
what mechanisms would bring about consciousness.  But no one knows what
mechanisms present in the human mind would forbid it either.

I may be stating the obvious.  But it appears sometimes that the obvious is
cast aside in the interest of human pride.

The exercises are quite inspiring... unfortunately, I didn't manage to
find (mystically create) a quarter, yet (well... I've only had a few
days to try ;-) ).

Does anybody know a Hindu meditation 'guru' near Munich?

I've started doing a few of them and I'm planning to try each and every
one (more or less seriously, of course). It's just a matter of time...

Thanks - I've put them on my reading list (I currently have a pile of
books that I'll read one by one, plus the stuff I want to read for
University... seems like I've become the prototype of a student ;-) )

I've just started to re-read Prometheus Rising, and in fact, quite in
the beginning he says that the 8 circuit model is just "for
convenience". Since that particular model comes from Timothy Leary, and
I may still have a few prejudices against Leary (because Albert Hoffmann
critizised his "LSD-Propaganda" - for good reasons I would say), I was
quite "careful" while reading about them.

What fascinates me, is that without beeing too irrational, Wilson brings
in the idea that there possibly are things that cannot be explained
rationally. I once questioned pretty much everything, including the
concept of science (without even knowing what I was doing... I just
decided that it would be quite dumb to believe any single thing before
critically thinking about it). My idea was that "science" is only
possible with language, and language narrows your horizon extremely, so
obviously, science has quite rigid limits.

I didn't really follow that idea because I soon reached the point where
I couldn't get any further (how should I (verbally) think and understand
that language - which my thinking is heavily based on - is a bad model
for reality). Besides, I have a million other things to do which at
least promise bio-survival food-tickets ;-)

That's perfect critical rationalism (my favorite epistemology). The
question is: will critical rationalism reveal *all* information? Not at
all - that's exactly what it's about. Maybe this finally helps me
understand pancritical rationalism: would that allow saying
"ok, here we have some knowledge which is ever increasing (hard
science), but there, we have something we can't really deal with (for
example because it doesn't allow falsification), so let's try making a
use of it, even if its on another 'dimension' of knowledge"

Understand 'dimension' in a strictly mathematical sense!

Is there any physical way of brain/DNA-communication? I mean, some sort
of "scanning" the DNA with your brain? I sometimes theorize, that by
what we are (result of evolution + a lot of information), the DNA, and
so the whole evolution is "within us". If you look at it from one
perpective, it's totally obvious - we are the result of physical,
biological and cultural evolution. It gets more interesting when you
ask: is it possible for our conscious minds to get information about the
previous evolutionary states by only "experiencing" the result? If that
*is* possible, the 6th circuit makes sense... even though I can't
imagine any 'practical' use right now ;-)

Whatever, I'll see what I can do with the 5th circuit theory... I do
feel like being on that circuit pretty often, but I don't meet the
"haven't been sick for a long time"-criterion, yet (which seems the most
useful quality of that circuit... among fascinating people with your own
joy, which doesn't seem like a convincing proof for being on that
circuit, though).

later,
Holger

---- From Intellectual to Guru ----

You are an intelligent person and you have a deep understanding of the
workings of the universe.  You look around and see fellow humans who
dont seem to have the same understanding and you want to help.  You
talk with them, but they do not understand.  You need to find away to
make them understand...

---- Dogs & Christians ----

Dogs

* He sits, holds his paws in the air as if to beg, eats the food, and
acts eternally grateful.

* He would never do anything against his masters will, because he
fears punishment.

When you first get a dog, you dont want to have to hit it, so you
dont.  But now and again you loose patients.  Clearly, you are the
intelligent one and since the dog can not understand the meaning of
your words, its up to you to lay down some rules. Its customary to
use a snack or treat to reward the dog and thus imprint certain
concepts of right and wrong on the dogs mind.

For the early part of the dogs life these techniques will be used to
train the dog to respect basic house rules.  To make sure they do
not create unnecessary mess or harm others.  However, as the dog
learns these basic rules it will become all to easy for you to impose
other rules for purely your own convenience.  As time goes by you will
impose new laws whenever you find the dog to be a nuisance.

Christians

* He sits, holds his hands together, gives thanks for the food, and
then eats it.

* He would never do anything against his masters will, because he
fears punishment.

When you first meet a human, you dont want to have to hit it, so you
dont.  But now and again use loose patients.  Clearly, you are the
intelligent one and since the human cannot understand the meaning of
your words, its up to you to lay down some rules.  Its customary to
use euphemisms to explain the necessity of these rules and thus
imprint certain concepts of right and wrong on the humans mind.

For the early part of the humans life these techniques will be used
to train the human to respect society.  To make sure they do not
create unnecessary mess or harm others. However, as the human learns
these basic rules it will become all to easy for you to impose other
rules for purely your own convenience.  As time goes by you will
impose new laws whenever you find the human to be a nuisance.

---- My Little Pony Ethics ----

It has been said that Extropians have seen one too many Star Trek
episodes based on pleasure planets where the entire population wears
towels and preaches kindness and love.  Now, Im not saying the
world is a harsh place, its just much more interesting than some
ethically whitewashed pleasure planet.

In the disgustingly titled Unbounding the Future (porno for
extropians) K. Eric Drexler applied his my little pony ethics
(contrary to popular belief Im not the originator of that phrase.)  I
paraphrase, I will not go into detail of the potential abuses of this
technology.  Which leaves the market for my forth coming Nano War:
The Definitive Guide to Global Destruction wide open (featuring
diagrams of actual nanoweapons.)

Libertarians!  Cant live with em, aint no fun in killing em (damn
non-aggression!)

---- Conclusion ----

Im just really glad I got my spellchecker working.

I'm a newbie to this list, and have a lot of reading to do.  The
current spat of mail seems to be mainly concerned with the efficacy
of hemp and why more women are not extropians.  I have been a closet
libertarian since college so I have no qualms about a discussion
as to the medical uses of THC.  But quite honestly, while I believe
the current controlled substance laws are ridiculous, I think it is
a waste of time fighting for its legalization, or developing religious
type zeal over spurious benefits it may or may not provide.  My goal
in life is to help make the transhuman and extropian dreams come true.
=20
I am drawn to this group, because I am convinced that Dr. More has
the same goals.  He also has his Sociology right.  Humanity is=20
already on the road to transhumanism.  Easy examples can be found in
my own family.  My daughter has a tooth implant to replace one
that never developed.  My ex-wife has breast implants to enhance
her sexuality (not that I personally have benefited from them).
My mother is a Prosaic and Ritalin televangelist.  She's always trying
to prescribe them to anyone she meets.  Thank goodness she is no
longer a Valium queen.  The list goes on and on.  From pacemaker
implants to nicotine patches, humankind is already on the road.
=20
While I dream about physical enhancements that will eventually
change the course of human evolution, or rescue us from the
devolution I believe has already begun, I think the first priority
should be those devices and pharmacological substances that might
extend our life-spans.  Exciting research is underway on the Telemerese
magic bullet.  Tremendous research is going on to find mechanical
replacements for our organs.  These are the efforts that will
eventually make our transhuman dreams real.
=20
I'm looking for a lay working group, of bio-medical engineers and
practical theorists, to discuss the current state of the art in
artificial organ development, and to be a springboard for new ideas.
I agree with the recent comments by Natasha Vita More, this group=20
if full of highly intelligent people all going down their own paths

Artificial organs are a fast-approaching technology.  Biologists have
found ways to induce cells to grow on artificial substrates so that they
can control their shape and many of their characteristics.  I don't
think we'll see artificially grown hearts for a while, but artificial
skin and other connective tissues are under heavy development.

One of the stories on the extropian reading list is Marc Stiegler's
"The Gentle Seduction", which explores this theme.  People reject the
wild dreams of technophiles like ourselves, but when presented in small
steps, each one seems reasonable.  James Halperin's new novel _The
First Immortal_ has some similar ideas.

Somewhere I have a machine readable version of Stiegler's story, so it
must have been online at one time, but I can't find it now.

	Exactly!  I wish all people that thought about consciousness
would get this simple representational idea through their skull!  Then
we might be able to make some progress in this field.

	In order to know that we use the same red, you must
objectively know what and why red is or what objective physical
phenomenon produces a red sensation in our consciousness and be able
to objectively observe that particular phenomenon going on in your
brain and my brain before we can know if we use the same subjective
sensation to represent 700 nm light.  I like to call this "effing" of
the ineffable which we will be able to do once we understand what and
why qualia are and can objectively observe such phenomenon
representing information in our consciousness awareness.

> All bits are abstract whether in a brain or a machine, and if

	You can measure possible diversity or information content in
any particular physical data media as bits of information, and you can
abstractly simulate any physical media or physical representation with
any other physical process as long as it can store the same number of
bits of information (but it is usually not possible to represent one
physical phenomenon with equal efficiency in some other physical
media.  For example: one oxygen atom can represent perfectly what one
oxygen atom is like but it takes many atoms of silicone formed into
transistors to achieve enough abstract bits to represent all the
information about one single oxygen atom, not to mention the
additional interpretation hardware...)

	What the fundamental physical representation is like is very
important to consciousness and our ability to process information and
consciously "know" about things.  When there is a dot of red qualia in
a field of green in our conscious representation of a strawberry
patch, the fundamental nature of this red qualia, what it is like, how
it is fundamentally different than a green qualia, how it stands out,
and how it is represented in an isomorphically similar 3D space in our
mind is a key part of the computation process that allows us to be
aware of and select the ripe strawberry that is ready to be picked.
What these qualia phenomenally are, how they are fundamentally
different from one another, and how they are unified together into one
simultaneous filed of visual conscious knowledge in our brain is why
we are smartly aware.  Unlike an abstract machine which purposefully
isolates it's representations from the particular physical
representation of the data, requiring much more machinery to
accomplish the same intelligent awareness, especially if it is a man
in a room.

> To exist information must be in a context, otherwise a hole in a

	No.  This is only when talking about abstract information.
The meaning of a whole in a paper tape, as you say, perfectly
represents a whole in a paper tape.  THAT is the meaning unless you
put it in or interpret it within some other context.  An oxygen atom
perfectly represents what that oxygen atom is like.  Again, THAT is
the meaning.  It is when you try to represent that oxygen atom with
wholes in paper tape that requires the mapping, context, and
interpretation.  Red is like red, there is no other meaning required.
But, in the context of our consciousness and other color quali, it can
represent 700 nm light and visa versa.

> As for Searle's Chinese Room, it only proves one thing, a very small
> part of a mechanism does not have all the attributes of the whole.

	No!  All Searls's Chinese Room proves is that any physical
phenomenon, no matter how absurdly inefficient, can abstractly
represent or model any other physical phenomenon, including conscious
qualia, and can eventually duplicate the output.  This has nothing to
do with the fundamental nature of qualia and what consciously aware
information is fundamentally composed of and what it is fundamentally
like.

The whole series is so damn transhumanistic, everybody should see it!
I'd also recommend the Robotech "trilogy" (the animated series, not the book(s)),

I sent my pop sci book on the singularity, THE SPIKE - published in
Australia about 6 months ago - to a well-disposed US publisher, who
declined it for the following rather interesting reason (which suggests a
more drastic sense of accelerating change than anything we assume on this
list, he mutters sardonically):

====================

    
     ... the editor ...
     considered it, but feels that, given the pace at which the technology 
     is racing, the book would most likely be outdated by the time we were 
     able to get it out 
  
======================

I replied:


I have to say that I'm *flabbergasted* by this reason for declining the
book.  I can only assume that the editor read only the first few dozen
pages, which drew for effect upon the latest news at the time and can
easily be updated.  Since the bulk of the book is about the truly
mind-boggling possibilities that won't kick in until about 2030, it simply
*can't* get outdated (unless extraterrestrials arrive, or time travel is
announced).  The topics I emphasise are the social impact of mature
nanotechnology, AI and uploading.

That is, THE SPIKE *isn't* a book about the wonders of the Pentium chip and
its immediate successor, but about what happens when (for example) the
entire ecosystem gets suffused with almost invisible `nano Utility-fog', or
people begin to port their consciousness into nanocomputers.  I haven't
noticed any uploaded posthumans running on nanotechnology in a Dyson sphere
on my street lately.  I don't expect this to occur between now and
publication date.

Gary Wolfe's review of the book Diaspora by Greg Egan which appeared in
Locus magazine contained the comment:

   I can't recall another novel with so many descriptions of
   diagrams and equations that you begin to wish you simply
   had the diagrams and equations themselves, if not a full 
   set of computer graphics.

In the February issue of Locus Egan responds:
   
   Wolfe's wish to see the diagrams described in Diaspora has been
   granted, though - at least for anyone with an internet connection and a
   web browser - at:

   http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/

   Most of the diagrams are static, but there are a couple interactive
   ones for people with Java-enabled browsers.

Is there an "Encyclopedia of Misinformation" in print, or a "False Fun
Facts" data-base on the World Wide Web, or something like that?

I know about the Urban Folklore sites, but I'm looking for something broader.

Here's a sample application: I just read that the mathematician-philosopher
Leibniz once claimed (wrongly!) that when one rolls two dice, one is as
likely to roll an 11 as a 12, because in each case there's "only one way"
(11=5+6, 12=6+6).

Now how can I tell whether Leibniz really said this, or whether it's a false
story that (say) 80% of historians of science believe because _they_ read
about it in books whose authors read about it in other books?  After all,
it's such a Fun Fact that it's the kind of thing that would be repeated,
whether it was true or not.

An arduous way to show that something like this is false is to go through
the complete works of Leibniz and fail to find the quotation.  (There are
shortcuts, like indexes and concordances, but let's leave that aside.)

A *quick* way to convince oneself that such a rumor is LIKELY to be false
is to find some expert who says "This is a famous legend with no basis in
fact, and the 80% of experts who think otherwise are using second-hand and
third-hand bad information."  But in such a case you'd have to ask three
experts before you'd stand a roughly even chance of finding an expert who
was in-the-know.

Also, what if it turns out that the most informed 1% know that the bottom
80% are right after all, and that "Lincoln really _did_ write that speech
on the back of an envelope..."?  You really want to get your information
from a public resource of some kind that is subjected to scrutiny by a
wide variety of people.  Any particular edition of the "Encyclopedia of
Misinformation" would contain some errors, but one would hope that each
error would be corrected in the very next edition (or that the editors
would at least indicate that there was genuine controversy among the
seemingly equally well-informed about some particular issue).  A readily
modifiable data-base would be even better than a book, since mistakes
could be rectified very quickly.

I own a book called "The Experts Speak: the definitive compendium of
authoritative misinformation", but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

In that most ancient of nations, Japan, the stage is again set for
humans who would push themselves to the utmost physical and mental
ability, to set modern records for endurance and performance.  

Onbashira and dohyoiri rituals harken back to the beginnings of
history to cleanse the evil spirits and create the sacred space for
competition primed by the latest in nutrition, fitness and
technology.  The portals of the temple erected in the circle become
the passage for television cameras and athletes clad in the most up
to date equipment.

The athletes march in groups defined by national boundaries, and 
the hopes of their home countries go with them.  Though each athlete 
wears the flag of his or her own country, once the torch is lit, the 
competition becomes athlete vs. athlete, athlete vs. individual 
limits, athlete vs. human limits.  Not every athlete will walk away 
with a medal, but who can say that any have failed?

Bring on the hockey (and the popcorn!)

Masturbation (sex by yourself) and sex with others are not mutually
exclusive.

Also, sex with others gives other pleasures and one only has two
hands.:)

Finally, for humans "primal urges" include curiousity as well.  Do
you plan to eliminate that as well?

It is not pure efficiency here that one should look for.  For instance, a
society which is more efficient at making war but less so at everything
else can usually conquer others.  E.g., the Mongol invasions of China
or the Roman takeover of the Eastern Mediterranean.

The ethical superiority thing may or may not be so, depending on a
lot of factors, BUT you are right to bring this up.  There is generally
a "Whig" view of history -- that what is now is better than what came
before -- pervading these sorts of discussions.  (This is not exclusive
to Extropians/transhumanists.  Almost everyone I've talked to on
anything like this is a Whig in this sense.)

I think questions of right and wrong can be answered by reason,
if you will.  I do not think they are totally arbitrary, but that is a
discussion for another time.

Greed is good!

[A couple of comments, upon being roused from my literary torpor by mention of
my name . . .]

I haven't read TFI (but soon will), but think Damien is probably on target, at
least as far as expressing one part of a fairly wide-spread negative view of
the role and result of jury trials.  The more generalized expression of that
view is that "lay" juries (1) don't do a very good job of judging factual
disputes involving complex or technical matters and/or (2) are too easily
swayed by emotion.

On the first point, opponents of the lay jury point to the increasingly
complex and technical nature of matters brought before the courts, and bemoan
the necessity of using expert witnesses to express such issues in "common
sense" terms that sometimes lose essential matters.  Thus the development of
the professional expert witness who may have a minimum of technical expertise,
but who has "jury appeal".  And thus the recent spate of (I think laudable)
judicial opinions creating a filter for scientific methodology on such expert
testimony (although that just moves the preliminary assessment of methodology
from the jury room to the bench).

As I and others have written on this factor before, the use of private
arbitration panels in which the arbitrators are people selected for (among
other reasons) their experience and expertise in the field at issue is a
developing trend arising from dissatisfaction with the lay jury as judge of
technical fact questions.  The problem is that such arbitration is only
available as a matter of contract: Juries are still the primary -- and,  in
most cases, the only -- judges of facts made available by our current legal
system in tort cases.  The one exception is the use of "special masters"
appointed by the court (although a party may in some instances move for
appointment of such a master).  Unfortunately, special masters are rarely used
in jury trials.

The second point is much less susceptible to rational argument and analysis.
Opponents of the lay jury argue that lay jurors, with little or (usually) no
experience in resolving important disputes between people with whom they have
no personal connection, tend to base their decisions far too greatly on their
"gut" reactions to the emotional aspects of the case.  The paradigm example is
the apparently natural human tendency to be less than properly skeptical in
deciding the question of liability when faced with evidence of painful
personal injury.  The natural human tenancy to empathize with someone who has
been badly injured causes most people to want to do SOMETHING for the injured
party.  In the context of a trial, the only available remedy is the award of
money damages.  All too often a clearly injured plaintiff is awarded damages
out of sympathy, despite the fact that the defendant has made a compelling
case that she was not the CAUSE of those damages.  Professional judges become
quite literally (and, in my opinion, properly) "hard-hearted" in this
connection: Having seen many similar disputes and having been schooled in the
skepticism inherent in evidentiary law and the procedural due process inherent
in the adversary legal system, they more easily reserve judgment and separate
natural human empathy from the task of deciding causation.

There are those who point out, perhaps ironically, that private arbitrators
suffer from the same failings as the lay juror on this second point.  Most
arbitrators perform that function only a few times in their lives.  Thus,
while they may be more technically competent judges of complex factual
questions, they tend to be less adept at isolating their own personal
emotional response to the issue presented to them. This factor tends to be
offset by the subject matter usually presented to professional arbitrators,
which by and large tends to be in less emotional disputes to begin with (a
construction contract or maritime charter dispute, for instance).

Proponents of the lay jury advocate their use for two main reasons: (1) lay
jurors represent a means of tapping a community's standards of common sense in
deciding basic human disputes and (2) they serve as a check on the sometimes
arbitrary exercise of power by a professional judge.  The first of these
points is difficult to attack, as it is usually expressed in terms so closely
allied with the democratic ideal of our age that to do so risks being labeled
the tool of tyrants or plutocrats.  The second (closely related) point has
more rational appeal, as it represents a systemic argument based on the ideal
of a legal system characterized by procedural and substantive checks and
balances.  On more than one occasion I have heard an otherwise conservative
lawyer ruefully admit that she was glad of having a jury to protect her client
from a cantankerous judge.  In any event, proponents of the lay jury
ultimately appeal to essentially political concepts to support continuation of
that institution.

The extropian ideal of a polycentric legal system appeals to me because it
holds out the promise of experimentation with all of the elements discussed
above.  It isn't difficult to imagine many different procedural variants in
which professional judges, technical arbitrators and lay jurors are mixed,
matched and set in dynamic tension to achieve an optimal system of dispute
resolution for disputes of different kinds.  The U.S. federalist experiment
has been a beginning in this direction, as has the development of arbitration
law as a regime of private law-by-contract.  The common law's and modern
procedural codes' division of labor between judge and jury in matters of law,
procedure and fact is another.  Abolition of lay juries in one of the states
would be an excellent experiment and forum choice clauses would allow parties
-- in contract disputes at least -- to engage in a determination of the merit
of such an experiment.

Yes, ancient history can provide lots of such examples, but recent history  
shows that a society that's good only at making war is doomed, consider 
imperial Japan, Nazi Germany or the USSR. I think there are two reasons for  
the change. 

 1) When technology is primitive it's difficult to create wealth, the best way   
    to get it is to steal it from somebody else who has fewer weapons than you   
    do. Technology is no longer so primitive, wealth is not conserved it can     
    be created, and there are easier ways to get power and money.

 2) The power of offensive weapons has increased enormously while the 
    increase in defensive weapons has been much more modest. War is no longer    
    profitable.

        >Greed is good!

I agree.

No, it just means that when they finally discover this thing you've
been hiding from them for so long they become obsessed with it and you
get another pervert on your hands.  Which may be okay, if they happen
to have a rubber fetish, but if somewhere along the line they link
violence and sexual behaviour (both treated in the same way during
childhood - I'm suprised violent rape isn't the norm) society has a
problem.

Being "emotionally ready" is a myth made and enforced by society, if
you have sex before society says you're emotinally ready the only
emtional troumer your suffer will be caused by the very same society.

That's the thing about "genius chemicals" vs. set and setting: I don't
think any chemical substance, even a complex mixture of different
neurotransmitters can really help you achieve new insights. The only
thing chemicals can do is change the mood you're in, or even change the
way how your brain works - but not what kind of thoughts your brain
produces. That's what set and setting are all about...

For technologically changing "the kind of thoughts" your brain produces,
you probably need to stimulate the brain much more directly (like
inducing certain types of neurotransmitters in certain parts of the
brain - or finally connecting neurons to computers ;-) )

Well, it wouldn't happen as - "give up your privacy and make a better
world."  Absolute truth is a potential biproduct of a global meta
network, so the only reason anyone would "disrobe" is to gain the
advantages of the technology on offer.

I only mentioned "Mirror Worlds" once, don't get all hung-up on it.

Exactly, it's a lot easier just to dump that information somewhere
than it is to secure it, so why not?  Besides, that information isn't
about you it's about the package.

Again, that information isn't about you it's about the company.  Make
your own records freely available and nobody can make money from
unsolicited information.

Well any form of computer storage is likely to be accessible, we're
talking about the effects of a global distributed network.  If you
can't think of any advantages that you would get out of having your
lifes information stored on computer then you lack imagination.  And
what about it being machine-readable and linked to all other
information?  Wouldn't that make your life a little easier to
organise?  And it doesn't have to be all input (your actions creating
meta on the network) it can be output (the network creating meta
information in the real world.)

I wasn't preaching Gelernter's ideal (I just gave the web address!) 
Thus I don't care what would make it a reality, I was predicting a
trend, the word "mirror" happened to fit what I was talking about.

Most information would be collected for personal use.

I was merely making a prediction so coercion would be clearly out of
the question (I have no opinion on this subject or any other, and do
not seek to enforce anything.)

Try looking at it from a different perspective.  Imagine a world where
something like this has happened, and now look at our 'society' from
that perspective, which is more radical?  And don't get me wrong, I'm
not trying to stop people lying or being adulterous, this is just a
prediction.  If anything people would be more 'adulterous' in an open
society, we just wouldn't care anymore.  I think most people would be
shocked (and in a bad way) by this future.

Absolutely, I agree.  The nature of the system is that if it is forced
it will not work.  Also I don't think people will give up privacy for
peace on earth, they'll give it up for the advantages the technology
brings to them.

I can see this is a joke, and I missed most of this thread, but of course
most single people are not pining for friction, but for interactive love.
There are lots of kinds of love we can make by ourselves, but of course
there is a biological payoff for interpersonal love with sex, and a mandate
to yearn for it in its absence.

I've been a good girl about staying out of these kinds of 
discussions, and a lot of my extropian friends happen to be male, but 
I swore that once I had heard the above question for more than 29 
times (guess what, this is the 30th), I would say three things:

1.  Most women are drawn to Extropian and Transhumanist ideas for the 
exact same reason the men are, and we would all make a lot more 
progress on shared ideas by assuming that everyone is here as 
intellectual explorers.

2.  I was the first woman to post to the Transhumanist list run by 
Alex Bokov, and no fewer than fifteen men told me, in no uncertain 
terms, that they didn't want girls in their sandbox.  Two of them 
petitioned Alex to remove me from the list, and this caused the mother 
of all internet fights, for about two weeks.  Alex, Rich, Anders, and 
many other men went to bat for me because I couldn't fight it alone.  
The thread remains in the archives as a badge of shame for all 
transhumanists.

3.  I have, over the past two years, received many notes from women 
who have lurked on the two lists for awhile, and then left.  Their 
reasons varied, but most stated that they saw strong expressions of 
mysogyny on the lists.  Some of them were receiving very rude come-ons 
from guys on the list, some were treated like they didn't have a 
brain in their head.  I think that if guys are going to 
complain about the lack of women on the lists, you should take a minute 
to think about what you are personally doing to make them feel welcome 
here.

It's up to you!

In response to Mark Unicorn and Yak Wax:

Although I recognize the libertarian yearnings behind your postings,
most of your comments are completely unfounded in clinical
psychology or biology.  Emotional readiness is just as important a
factor in sexuality as physical readiness, and fetishes (not a
sickness, BTW) and rape inclinations do not stem from sexual
deprivation.  Therapists treat thousands of individuals yearly in my
country alone for the damage caused by pedophiliac activities or
pressure to have sex at a young age.  Given the difficulty in
repairing that kind of damage, I'd rather have a young person
chomping at the bit a little prior to engaging in any serious sexual
activities.  Most of them have engaged in heavy petting by high
school, anyway, and haven't exactly been deprived of pleasure. 
Learning to pleasure oneself is important as well, an important
first step in learning to pleasure others.  

Practice makes perfect!

Kathryn

Speak for yourself; I don't have any nasty primal urges.

I have plenty of *nice* primal urges though.

Hey, thanks for the lists!  It's great to read about people who are 
members (of whatever gender) of EXI, and what they do.

<sigh>  I just think it's sad that we even have to have this kind of
discussion.  I'd love to get some projects done on the subject of
gender and leave it behind to pursue other interests, like
technological innovations, but then I realize how much work remains
to be done...

Last Monday night while in downtown Toronto I spotted a film crew around Ed
Mirvish's theatre. Lots of 1930's cars and people in period costume. In the
midst of all this was a fancy graffito of, "Who is John Galt?" At the time I
assumed they were shooting a commercial for the theatre. Afterwards I thought 

A couple of minutes on AltaVista confirmed that a movie is in the works:

If people treat others unfairly because of gender, orientation, or
ethnicity-- by assuming they have some limitations, etc..
Then we are in big big trouble and society is in for a lot more pain and
suffering, not something I want.
Discrimination is totally counter-productive and non-extropian.
I want a diverse mix of people on this list, not just guys.

It sickens me to think any female would ever be discouraged from being on
this list, or from exploring her full potential (including intellectually)

I hope we can raise the level and quality of these discussions.

Possible - but I prefer the image of an evil shrink loosing a horde (or
hoard, as Yak might put it) of feral psychotics on this poor unsuspecting
animal, bearing out the fabled headline: `Man Bites Dog'.

Natasha, could you post a message re Aeon Flux, and how to access
it? I saw one video at my local video store with an Aeon Flux
title, but didn't rent it. How do I go about getting the full AF

I agree that "outing" available Exi women would be disrespectful.
I would also mention that I have twice been approached by private
email by Exi women and after some private email correspondence,
did indeed meet with them face to face... This is just to say,
guys, that Exi women *do* let Exi guys know if they are
interested. Now, your challenge is to grow up enough, (ie, learn
what it is that attracts the Exi women) so you *will* be
approached. Good luck!

Insufferably yours,

Estacado:  please tell me more about Mel Ash!

I have practiced most of the exersizes in Prometheus rising.  But the 
most powerful (non-drug) technique I have yet for metaprogramming is 
Christopher Hyatt's "Undoing Yourself".

Having practiced his techniques for more than 7 years now, I have yet to 
find any more powerful.  I have however refined his techniques 
SUBSTANTIALLY.  I can now "energize" myself at any time or place I want, 
regardless of what I'm doing.  It's ability to reduce or eliminate 
anxiety and other pesky neurosies always amazes me.

Over the last 5 years, I have taught over 200 people my particular 
technique, so anyone wishing to find out more, please feel free to 
e-mail me.

Nick: My very best wishes with the WTA. I'm delighted to see the work
you're doing to add another important strand to the transhumanist movement.
I look forward to helping the WTA in whatever way I can as an individual
and as pres. of ExI. 

Feel free to post the announcement to the exi-euro list, since that might
reach some folks not on this list.

Transhumanism is now really starting to flower. I'm excited to see where we
will be in ten years...

Onward!

And objectively observe that observation of that particular phenomenon going

We'll never get anywhere with that approach, we need to use a different

As you say this can have practical considerations, but I can find absolutely 
no evidence that the way information is represented has any philosophical 
ramifications at all.

Exactly, good qualia makes our behavior smarter and unlike consciousness,  
intelligence can be tested for. They've improved a lot in the last few years  
but even now no machine can do a job like picking ripe strawberry's as well  
as a human, so I think it's safe to say that a machine's qualia of red is not  
as rich as a human's. Yet.

I don't understand your objection, all information is abstract.

        >paper tape that requires the mapping, context, and interpretation.  
        

And a human brain can put a hole in a tape in the context of other holes and 
so obtain information from that tape, but obviously machines can do this too, 
that's why punched tape was invented and that's why feeding such a tape into 
a machine does not produce random output.


        >Red is like red, there is no other meaning required.


I agree, some things can not be reduced further, and I can give another 
example. Intelligence produces consciousness, no explanation why is required  
or possible.

Searls's Chinese Room is a foolish thought experiment that teaches us nothing.

Nothing to do with it?! I think it has everything to do with it, good thing  
too because that's all you'll ever know for sure about the subjective 
experience of another person or machine. If I'm wrong about consciousness 
then random mutation and natural selection would never have bothered to come 
up with it, but I know for sure that it managed to produce it at least one 
time because I'm conscious, I have a strong hunch you are too.

I'll never be able to prove it, but I think the best way to make progress in  
this area is to just forget about consciousness and concentrate on 
intelligence, because you'll get consciousness anyway and free of charge.  
That's the tactic Evolution took, in fact nature found that intelligence was 
a much harder nut to crack than consciousness. The emotional parts of our 
brains are very old, little different from that found in many other animals, 
the higher brain functions, like logic and simulating the future so we can 
make plans, operate in much more recently evolved parts of the brain. 
Conscienceless is a dime a dozen, intelligence is not, If nature  found one 
to be much harder to produce than the other, why would the opposite to be 
true when we design our machines?

I have practiced most of the exersizes in Prometheus rising.  But the

Christopher Hyatt's "Undoing Yourself".

   I think that Mel Ash studied/practiced Zen as a way to overcome 
alcoholism. His book _Shaving the Inside of Your Skull_ is packed
full of exercises that may help you to get rid of beliefs that no 
longer serve you(which tends to be most beliefs). 
   I would be very interested in learning of your additions to Hyatt's
techniques. If you found his philosophy in _Undoing Yourself_ enlightening
you may want to visit http://www.neo-tech.com for a more detailed
philosophy concerning the potential of human beings.
   Have you studied Chaos Magic? (Similar to the methods of Hyatt).

Check out http://www.sonymusicvideo.com/catalog/Titles/mtv/index.html (in the left
frame, below Beavis & Butt-Head). Ik think this is the whole series.
http://chloe.hgs.yale.edu/hhh/reviews/aeonflux.html has some general info.

I've downloaded the text file at one stage but can't find it in my bookmarks
page.  Grrrr.Has anyone ever come across 'The Human Biocomputer'???

This is the second edition of  'Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human
Biocomputer', apparently the first version had some of the more obvious drug
references toned down as Lilly was still running a research institute at the
time and wanted to avoid controversy.

I bought it at a second-hand store last week, I'm going to put some time aside
to read it over the next few weeks...

I'm interested as well for purely personal reasons   :-)
I'm not overly interested in cloning research associated with pleasure,
unless someone has started cloning supermodels  :)

It has been said here before that there may be humans still living with
neolithic technology at the time of "transcendence" of the first real post-
humans.  This statement captures the idea that the future is certainly not
evenly distributed and points to the fact that as we on the cutting edge of
transhumanism contemplate the coming of post-humanity literally billions of
humans struggle their entire lives with poverty and ignorance.  

I've recently been reminded of someone who seems to embody a clearly extropian
approach to the social, economic, political and moral issues raised by these
facts.  Muhammad Yunus' Grameen Bank and its associated enterprises
(http://www.grameen.com/gfly.htm) embody many of the extropian principles in a
broad front of efforts to "more evenly distribute the future." Yunus makes so-
called "microloans" (on the order of $50-$100) to would-be entrepreneurs in
the third world (especially in the Indian subcontinent).  Most of his
borrowers are women, who use the credits to establish small businesses such as
irrigation services, textile manufacture, small-scale retailing and the like.
Borrowers are organized into neighborhood credit-guarantee associations that
multiply as one member after another utilizes Grameen credits, much on the
model of American midwest agricultural credit co-ops at the turn of the
century, but on a much smaller scale.

Apparently Grameen has been wildly successful.  Here's an excerpt from an item
that can be found amongst Grameen's material on microloans at their website
(http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gbank/micro/trinews.html ):

> Microcredit was invented 20 years ago in Bangladesh 
> by Muhammad Yunus. Today, Professor Yunus's Grameen 
> Bank and copycat organizations have 3.5 million women 
> borrowers; adding their dependents, that amounts to about 20 
> percent of Bangladesh's population. In the latest

> flexed their muscle. The Islamic Society, the fundamentalist 
> party antagonistic to the West that wants to keep women at 
> home, lost 14 of its 17 seats in Parliament.

Friday, NPR carried a news item about Yunus' latest venture: Using his bank's
microloans, he is selling solar-powered cell phones to poor people in
Bangladesh. (http://www.grameen.com/grameen/gtelecom/index.html). They pay for
themselves quickly in villages that have never known any form of
telecommunication, and serve as a vector for modernization on many fronts.  An
example cited was the use of the phones by village farmers to check market
prices for their produce to reduce exploitation by grain traders.  The NPR
story noted that Grameen Communications supplies phones to its customers at a
price of $300 per unit.  The Bangladeshi government phone system was selling
them for about $50,000.  Grameen's web site reveals that Yunus' next plan is
to set up a wireless, solar-powered internet system in Bangladesh for the same
purpose, using the same financing methods.  Now THAT'S what I call extropian:
Using "bottom-up", highly distributed systems of networks based on principles
of individual effort and responsibility, people are employing innovative means
and the highest available technology to bootstrap themselves upward.  The next
time you're feeling a little discouraged, stop by Grameen's website for a shot
of enthusiasm!

I'm not completely sure how emotional readiness is founded in biology,
but psychology is a different matter.  Psychology is the understanding
of the mind by diversity from what is considered normal.  It is based
on the very same social biases that cause the problems it tries to
understand.  We then use therapy to try and solve these problems, but
never in this process to we question "normal."  It is merely based on
social trends and has no grounding in scientific fact.  So if my
comments are unfounded in psychology, it's because psychology is a
product of the problem.

Now, I do not expect you to give much credence to these ideas, but I
would ask you to give them some thought.  If the ideas I express can
do a better job of explaining these problems than traditional
psychology then I would expect you to take them more seriously.  So
challenge these ideas, give reasons why they are not true.  Just
because something is the accepted way of explaining a problem it does
not make it the only way of explaining a problem.

As posted previously either here on on the transhumantech list, this group
is involved in what could be termed 'culture hacking', or in the parlance
of hackers: "social engineering":

http://www.paranoia.com/~rtmark/index.html

I just got a project proposal accepted by the group, and now its on their
page. I put an initial $200 bounty on its accomplishment by anybody. The
proposal is for at least 1000 copies of a popularly used operating system
to be sold in which the normal splash screen that is displayed on bootup
of the operating system is altered such that either the logo of a rival
operating system, or simply a rock is seen as smashing through the logo
normally on this splash screen. (NOTE: while the group wanted the proposal
to not be brand specific, one can easily see that the best use of this
would be for an Apple to smash through a Window.......) This must be
reported widely in the press.

Now, if any of you potential memetic engineers out there who might have
the means to accomplish this goal are interested in attempting this feat,
go to the RTMark page to volunteer....

WARNING: attempting these acts could endanger your employment......The
sponsors accept no responsibility that might accrue to  your career,
reputation, criminal record, and livlihood as a result of commiting the
proposed acts....

It seems like many people posting to this list have forgotten what sort
of list this is supposed to be.  There are certain kinds of topics this
list was intended to discuss (not President Clinton's alleged sex-affair
or government conspiracies).  Topics outside the scope of this list
should be discussed outside this list.  There are many other mailing
lists and chat-rooms to discuss such things.  

Also, this is an *Extropian* list, which means that extropians are
reading it.  Extropians tend to prefer things of high quality (one could
even think of Extropianism as the quest to increase the quality of the
universe).  I don't think most of us want to read the low-quality
postings that come through every day.  You know what I'm talking about: 
the one or two line response, the posts that ramble on aimlessly,
argumentative or insulting posts, etc.  Just because we're interested in
life-extension doesn't mean we want to use our extra time reading inane
or unthoughtful posts.  We are extropians, after all; our time is
valuable to us.

So, please, before you send anything to this list, ask yourself if other
extropians *really* are going to be interested in what you write.  If
not, don't send it.  Just send the good stuff, well-organized,
well-thought-out and well-written.  Please don't send impulsive
one-liners or insults or incoherent ramblings; restrain yourself.

Thank you,

Why not post to the list? That way even more people could at least get
an idea of what it is about, and some people be encouraged to start
trying seriously if it turns out to be good.

Not necessarily. One can do useful psychology by just discussing (say)
"Do these persons like the mental states they find themselves in?" and
similar questions. You are right in that a very large amount of work
has gone into studying non-normal psychology, especially since most of
the non-normal mental states are distressing to be in (and to some
extend distressing to others). There is a much smaller subset of work
dealing with positive mental states, without necessarily defining
"normal == good" (e.g. Csíkszentmihályi's work on flow, which is
rather different from the usual mental states we have).

The problem seems to be that since normal in most cases is a rather
good mental state to be in compared to the alternatives (with a bias
since psychologists are much more likely to meet depressed patients
than self-reliant happy people with no need for help) that it forgets
that it would concentrate on optimization of mental states instead of
just normalizing them.

I haven't seen Aeon Flux on MTV for a while now.  She is one of my all-time
favorite heros. The only problem I had with the segments is the storyline
being cryptic - full of sexuality and mystique but like reading a c.c.
cummings poems without the punctuation.

Tell me more, please.  I am always looking for drug-free methods to reduce
anxiety and increase energy levels.  Exercise is the most effective method
I've found so far, meditation a little less so.

An interesting factual tidbit to ponder: no two countries that

Sometimes I think the storyline is deliberately random just to keep
the viewers coming up with their own explanations, which of course
will suit them much better than any obvious storyline. I really enjoy
the cryptic mood of the series and the nicely surreal setting.

The main theme IMHO seems to be the conflict/love between top-down
planning and bottom-up emergence, usually getting the ordinary
people/entities in between into trouble.

If I ever become an evil dictator, I promise to at least try to be as
ingenious and bizarre as Trevor Goodchild :-)

 The word "greed", at least as it is used outside of Objectivist circles,
refers not just to a position on the selfish to selfless axis, but also
to an area on the negative-sum game to positive-sum game axis. Supporting
the welfare state is one alternative to greed, but there exist perfectly
selfish strategies that most people will classify as not at all greedy.
For example, the Linux software development model, or Eric Drexler's "get
rich slow" scheme (make everybody rich through nanotech, and since he's
somebody, he'll be rich).
 I see nothing wrong with the sentiments expressed in the part of Mr.
Bailey's message that you quoted. However, his implication that taxation
promotes sharing is pretty questionable. Taxation is almost always a
negative-sum strategy, which tends to foster greedy attitudes among
the people it affects. In contrast, adopting new positive-sum sharing
strategies tends to foster further support for more sharing.

 That was probably true at some time, but now that the Linux model for
producing software has shown itself to be superior in many cases, I think
it is perfectly resasonable to critisize Microsoft for being more greedy
than is in it's customer's best interests.

 Mark, what was the purpose of your libertarian rant? Do you think Mr. Bailey
was unaware of libertarianism? I find it improbable that his support for
taxation results from ignorance of the ideas that taxation is immoral or
that selfishness is good, yet your message seems to do nothing more than
repeat those ideas.
 There's a reason why debating the basics on this list is discouraged: few
of us learn anything from it. This is especially true of messages that agree
with the prevailing ideology on the list.

I think you should be almost flattered - he believes in your scenario
so much he won't publish the book. ;-)

There is a surprising number of stupid or irrational people around. I
really wonder how they become what they are?

This point would indicate to me that war has become enormously profitable, to the
winner. Witness the Gulf War, which cost the US less than $5 billion (while US
weapons industries raked in $60 billion, mostly from other countries, a handy
return on investment...). If the US were more interested in becoming an empire,
it really would not have much opposition. Numerically yes, but technologically
not in any way, shape or form.

Fortunately Americans have found, and proven to most of the rest of the world
that it is much easier to build an empire through business shenannigans than
through outright force, its more stable in the long run, and nobody gets shot.

I would say that the reason why nations like Imperial Japan, nazi Germany, and
the USSR are no longer in existence is that the rest of humanity know how rude it
is to be a military agressor nation, and cooperated to bring down the first two,
while they defeated the third by simply giving it the silent treatment.

What I worry about is when The Corporate Republic of MacDonalds declares war on
the Corporate Republic of Burger King. To be known as The Food Fight, it will
kill more bystanders from indiscriminate use of second hand cholesterol
weapons.....

Funny, when I browsed their site, they seemed to me to be an offshoot of the
EST 'technology'. All sorts of interesting hodgepodges are cropping up, it
seems.....

The Case For Cloning 
FEBRUARY 9, 1998 VOL. 151 NO. 5

The benefits of this bold technique outweigh the risks, and the danger is
not what you think

By J. MADELEINE NASH 

An elderly man develops macular degeneration, a disease that destroys
vision. To bolster his failing eyesight, he receives a transplant of
healthy retinal tissue--cloned from his own cells and cultivated in a lab
dish.

A baby girl is born free of the gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease, even
though both her parents are carriers. The reason? In the embryonic cell
from which she was cloned, the flawed gene was replaced with normal DNA.

Damien:

I'm glad you noticed that. My view: A heresy.

Harry Palmer (and btw, I love the fact that he didn't change his name)
_was_ at one time fairly deeply involved with Scientology. I suspect Harry
just needed a noun and picked one he knew.

Based on my reading of Scientology and my experience of the Avatar
materials, the Avatar rundowns, and other exercises, are _much_ more
respectful of the individual. One size does not fit all. I could imagine a
hostile investigator equating the two, but that person would have to have a
serious axe to grind...

Harry refers in one of his (two) books to his having had a problem with the
upper (OT) levels of the Scientology stuff, where they expect(ed) you to
relive the big cataclysm (I assume he's talking about Ximu/Xemu, "have you
ever enslaved a planet", and all that)--
--and Harry says he found himself wondering "is all this really necessary"? 

Of course, the answer is "no".

The key nifty thing in Avatar is the notion and practice of "discreation",
which is effortless and recovers attention you may not have noticed you
were using. Since I happen to believe that attention is the only thing that
is in fundamentally short supply for me, I took to it; and (after three
separate attempts to get all the way through the material :) ) got to where
I can do it fairly often.

I think Harry & Co. have gotten to where Ron thought he would get people
to, giving Ron maximum benefit of the doubt (I have the semiheretical
thought that when Ron wrote "Dianetics", he was acting in good faith,
responding to genuine shortcomings in the psych-therapeutic methods of the
time, and still had most of his screws fairly tight).

I make no particular guarantees that Star's Edge has no shortcomings. But
I've given serious thought to presenting the Avatar materials in a
non-woo-woo, non-Newage way, to every gearhead, Dilbert and transhuman who
is interested in reclaiming and focusing attention, and "creating what you
prefer."

My biggest open area (including doubt) regarding the Avatar materials lies
right around the region of "persistent conditions" and "rundowns"--I may
someday come to an answer to the same kind of question Harry found himself
asking: "is all this really necessary"? But dat discreation stuff is da bomb.

Details of my personal experiences available upon request.

I don't consider the Avatar materials a hodgepodge, especially when
contrasted with Erhard's more primitive approach. Real usable technology
doesn't have to announce that it's a tool :) .

I have a taxonomy of the human potential movement; in my view many
splinters had something at least slightly better than what came before.

NOTE: The chart below doesn't mean that the evolution really progressed in
this way, it's based on observed characteristics of materials and
participants.
And I'm not finding fault with Taoism or Zen, OK? :)

=====

Taoism   Hinduism  Buddhism  Zen...
...MUCH time passes...
 Objectivism                     ...ZON
     Dianetics    Scientology (very rigid)
                 ...est (rather rigid)     ...the Forum
                    ...Leary   Lilly   R. A. Wilson (chem assist?)
                                     ...NLP (as by Grinder & the Andreases)
                     ...LaBerge's Lucid Dreaming work
                          ...Lifespring (less rigid than est)
                             ...the Sage Experience (REAL humor?!? wow!)
                                ...Warrior With Heart (serious Sage)
                                
Concluding, at present, with:                         
 ...Avatar (no/vanishingly small dogma, self-paced, no cult... what a relief!)

=====

At the risk of being slaughtered by someone from CSICOP, I think every one
of the things I listed has some value in personal transformation. 

I also think every one of them has room for improvement, and I do not
advocate any of them for everyone.

Of course, I have direct personal experience of all the above except for
Scientology and the Forum. :)

My view: Avatar is the least messed-up of all. How's that for a sterling
endorsement? :)

Oh, btw, Avatar costs a lot of money. I'll let you know when I'm ready to
let you give it to me. :)

I was going to say something of the kind (I think I was thinking of the
word "practice" :) )... but I'll essay a serious response.

Anders--I can think of two possible meanings for your utterance. 
Before I try to reply, did you mean "I wonder how they become (or stay) 
stupid or irrational"? Or did you mean "I wonder how they wind up 
holding the positions/power/occupations/influence they do"?

Or were you just blowing off steam, and I should be quiet?

:)

Since I have gotten so  *many* responses for more info on EM, I will 
post what I have written so far- 

Keep in mind that what I'm posting here is enough to get everyone 
started.  As you progress with this technique you will eventually want 
to adapt it to fit your own needs.  Therefore I can give additional 
advice to those on an individual level as to how you might progress if 
this method works for you.

Enjoy!


Energized meditation (EM) makes at least one assumption - that our 
psychological states (Circuits 1 and 2) are synonymous with actual 
physical tensions in the body.  That these tensions are in fact the 
neurosis and anxieties that we are all plagued with to some degree.  So 
the key to these techniques is to eliminate these tensions.

Over the years, I found dozens of ways to practice this technique, but 
it all comes down to 2 basic things:

1) Maximizing the stimulation of  bodily tensions through a liberal 
application of exercising and stretching.  This can be as simple as 
waving and wagging your arms about in as many ways as you can for 5 
minutes.

2) Circular breathing - any speed you want.  Although in most cases you 
want to reserve rapid breathing for those times that a deep tension 
seems ready to release itself.  To do circular breathing, just make sure 
that there are no pauses between your inhalations and exhalations.  Keep 
in mind there will be times during the warm up that we will do more 
counted and controlled breathing.

These techniques can be very powerful.  So I think we should play it 
safe by starting with a less intense regiment. If you think your ready 
to attack the deeper and more blocked tensions please let me know.  I do 
however recommend that if you haven't done any type of body or breath 
work to stick with this first regiment for at least 3 months.

Although I can now utilize these techniques regardless of my condition, 
I recommend that you start out by making sure your bladder and bowel are 
empty and at least 2 hours have passed since your last meal.  Also make 
sure that you will have 30-45 minutes of little or no interruptions.

Note: The purpose of these exercises is to remove chronic muscle 
tensions.  You will experience "explosions" of energy and some clonisms 
(tremors or shudders) if you do the exercises properly.  Be prepared for 
this and do not be afraid when it happens.

Step 1. Sit, lie down or stand up.  Make faces - stretch all the muscles 
in the face.  Open your mouth as wide as you can, move the jaw from side 
to side.  At the same time open your eyes as wide as you can.  Move your 
eyes up and down and from side to side.  This will begin to release 
tension, thereby removing obsessive thoughts that lie hidden in these 
areas. Make as many different faces as you can.  Use a mirror if you 
wish.  Do this for 5 minutes.

Step 2. Hum and chatter - Hum from the depths of your belly.  Use Om or 
just Um.  Do this for 1-2 minutes.   Now stick your tongue out and 
chatter DADA, MAMA, BABA.  While doing this stick out your jaw as far as 
you can and continue humming and chattering.  Do this for 3 minutes.

Step 3.  Pull your shoulders up as if you where trying to reach your 
ears.  Hold for several seconds feeling the strain then drop them as low 
as you can.  Repeat this for 2 minutes.

Step 4.  With your mouth open take in a deep breath inflating your chest 
and pulling your stomach in and up.  Hold for a count of 5 and then just 
let the chest fall and the belly relax.  Repeat this 10 times allowing a 
count of 7 to elapse before your next inhalation.

Step 5.  Turn your head from side to side as slowly and as far as you 
can.  Try deep breathing in rhythm to your motion.  Repeat for 1 minute.

Step 6.  Lying down on your back, hold your legs about 4 inches off the 
ground and stretch arms and legs outward.  Hold this as long as you can 
then let them drop.  Repeat 2 times.  (If this bothers your back, try 
some kind of support - the key here is for your abdominal and leg 
muscles to be stimulated).

Step 7.  **This step is by far the most important part**  With your 
mouth slightly open breathe rapidly, sighing as you exhale. Do this for 
2-3 minutes.  When you finish and or you start to feel lightheaded or 
dizzy slow your breathing down and lie on your back.  For the next 15 
minutes relax and enjoy the experience.  Don't do anything other than 
experience and feel your body as deeply as you can.  If you feel your 
about to shudder don't stop it, just let it happen and breathe it out.
 
Step 8.  I'm a big believer in positive re-enforcement, so at this point 
go treat yourself to your favorite desert or goodie.  You deserve it!  
:-)

Dear all,

Yesterday we had a meeting; and in relation to my last mail
I thought you would like to know what we are up to.

1. We all will offer our help to the WTA of Nick and the new site
    of Natasha.......... (so, both...just give us a call :-)

2. Arjen Kamphuis, will give a presentation to a group of "free-thinkers"
   about Transhumanism (maybe we will get some new members)
   We noticed that our posts in "science.nl" (a newsgroup) are not
   getting us new members (which I personally think is very strange, if
   there is one group that should be interested.....)

3. We will work on a poll, regarding the willingness of Hospital and
Moratoria
    to assist on a Cryo-transport.

4. We will start to work on a European version of a Cryo-Network.

Just one more thing - I  highly recommend that you only do this  *no 
more than twice a week* until you've gained a broad base of experience 
in its application.  :-)

I'll take this little space to plug my latest work which will soon be
online.  It's entitled "So Real : Surreal",  and follows my stream of
consciousness through my Illuminations series and onward.

Anyway,  have fun finding religion online. ;]

You will, I presume, explain why I somehow have responsibility for the 
actions of fifteen idiots? And why that 'badge of shame' also applies to 
those transhumanists who backed you up?

Ok, to reiterate: I said that claiming that there was some magical 
age (somewhere between twelve and twenty-one depending on location 
and orientation) before which no-one could give consent to sex  and 
after which everyone without exception was able to give consent was 
dumb, and that each person should be judged as an individual, and that 
preventing people from taking charge of their own lives when they were
perfectly able to do so could cause as much psychological damage as 
forcing them into things they didn't want to do.

Where exactly is this "completely unfounded in clinical psychology or
biology"? You mean there *is* some objective standard for determining
this magical age and even those who might by any other standard be
considered adults are unable to 'consent' until they reach it? The
mere fact that the magical age varies by nearly 100% between cultures
should be a glaring indicator that it's purely subjective.

Well, as long as a little self-advertisement seems appropriate
here, I'll point to a nice recent photo:

<http://www.javaconference.com/conf/speakers/crocker.html>

Just for the record, I think the impression of scarcity in
Extropian women is unfounded.  I recall some serious babeage
at Extro3, and many of the SF gatherings.  I also think that
most bright, open-minded women are quite receptive to the
ideas when presented well.  The Alcor bracelet is a good
conversation-starter, and a good /pons asinorum/ for me.

The amount I've found while trying that exercise has just about paid the

I, personally, agree, but not completely...

Yes, because if there is not a certain moderation, a 'natural deviation
tendency' may grow and grow... 

And no, because it's very important to know Extropians' opinion about SOME
'daily' facts..: Any movement that is exagerately closed in itself tends to
disappear or become secondary... And it is not what we want to
Extropianism... Got it, young babies???... ( Just learn a little more about
Political Sciences, Sociology and even Philosophy... always,  if you want
to ...).

Impressive! This is indeed the kind of idea that has truly far-ranging
positive consequences.

All of the above :-) 

Although I think the question is interesting and relevant: how can we
avoid becoming as irrational or stupid as others, and are there useful
ways of helping people out of such states? 

A lot of stupidity is just lack of education/experience in thinking
and acting, a simple lack of knowledge about how the world and oneself
works. That can be dealt with to some extent. A more worrying form is
when it becomes a self-supporting belief system, actively preventing
the victim from waking up. Are there any really good ways of
undermining such schemata?

I'm an electronic media artist, sometimes my responses to my environment
take on non-verbal form (music/graphics), so forgive me if I read all
the postings but don't have much more than a shout out to add now and

That said, you people are stimulating and uplifting my individual human

Well, let's just say I get a little hot under the collar when someone promotes a 
form of slavery. I think I'm entitled to get a little emotional, just as the 
anti-slavery people were in the early 1800's. I suppose I should assume that the 
people on this list are familiar with libertarianism, unlike the general public.

OK, you make a good point. I won't bring up the topic again.

$ci and est have the same root, I gather, so it's not surprising that
there's an overlap there.

I did the Forum as a four day weekend deal about 3.5 years ago with my former
business partners. That intro weekend is extremely useful in getting people to let
go of , or at least realize the fictional basis of, the meanings we all give to
the world and everything in it, and is also good at getting people to learn to
speak and think logically, rationally, and literally, which for most would
probably be the first time in their lives. They are also big on personal
integrity, which I can at the very least enthusiastically cheer for. I did
however, find them also to be heavily marketing oriented in the same manner as
Amway, and can be incredibly earnest to the point of annoyance. However, if you
are into winning every argument and having the other person like you at the end,
even though you walk away with all their money and clothes, I'd recommend it as a
full time hobby, as I knew people in it that could use its rigid rationality
combined with its meaning making on the fly to get anything they wanted.

Cost for a four day weekend? At the time, as I recall, it was $600.00. Was it
worth it? Two years ago I would have said that it was a waste of money. Today, I
think it was about 75% worth it. Would I get into it more? Nope.

A freind of mine in Seattle was raised in scientology, and being from a wealthy
family, he and his siblings got the full hands on blessngs from El Ron himself. He
now thinks, at age 44, that it has its useful aspects for cleaning up onself, but
that the organization has been co-opted by a bunch of young turks out for nothing
but their own persoanl aggrandizement. Needless to say, he and his sister were
excommunicated a couple years ago (when they ran out of money).

As it happens, most big telescopes -- including the Hubble -- use 
both lenses and mirrors.

Transportation is too cheap.

When it's really expensive, no one can project power/expect to perform
resource extraction, but no one can colonize effectively, either.  When
it's sorta medium, one can establish a marcher state and develop the
ability to assert sovereignity faster than one can be subjected to control
by someone over yonder performing power projection.  When transportation
is really inexpensive, you can't get far enough away in economic terms to
establish a distinct sovereignity.

It applies because they applied it to themselves--the concept came up
in the correspondence with me during that time.  They did not want
the entirety of transhumanist thought to be painted with such a
patina of intolerance.   They decided to take responsibility for a
large part of the situation, even though they were not the
perpetrators.  While I strugged with the present harassment, they
were looking toward the future of transhumanist thought and what
direction it might take if I left the list.  I deeply respect them 
for the decision that they made to take on a difficult task.

I'll go with Ander's comments and the addition that a lot of
interesting work has been done in philosophy and anthropology in
navigating different mental states.  Some of it pushes the
boundaries of traditional psychology, but in a sound methodological
manner.  I would highly recommend Oliver Sack's book _An 
Anthropologist on Mars_.  

That being said, we're still a far cry from recommending sexual 
activities prior to proper maturity, and I don't think you will find 
any sound research in any field to support it.

Then you gather incorrectly.  I did est back in '77, and I hear that
its more recent incarnations ("The Forum") are much the same thing:
a kind of Americanized Zen, some traditional group-therapy exercises,
a bit of not-so-farfetched cognitive model dogma, and lots of good
old-fashioned salesmanship.  No magic devices, no aliens.  Wouldn't
waste a dime on 'em today, but nor would I put them anywhere near the
same class as the criminal conspiracy of Scientology.

I thought the original mirror for the Hubble was ground incorrectly, and
that it had to be repaired with corrective lenses to compensate.  I
heard this while working for a (nameless) client who temporarily feared
that the Mirror error was caused by their computers.  Later it was
discovered that the error was due to other causes.

The Hubble repair used small corrective mirrors to fix the problem.

Biotechnology Industry Organization on Cloning Legislation

The following memorandum was issued by Dan Eramian, Vice President,
Communications of BIO, regarding cloning legislation. 

The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BI0) has steadfastly
opposed the cloning of a human being. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has already asserted its regulatory authority
over cloning and announced its intention not to allow such
an unsafe and unwise procedure. Still, the Senate is scheduled to
take its first vote on S. 1601, Tuesday, Feb. 1O -- legislation
that would not only ban the cloning of a human being, but could
inadvertently interfere with ongoing and vital medical research.
To avoid this, legislative language must be extremely precise,
after all you are talking about legislating the world of molecular
biology, which can only be seen under a microscope. 

Attached please find background information on this important
issue. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to
call BIO at 202-857-0244. 

ANALYSIS OF S. 1601 TO BAN CLONING OF HUMAN BEINGS 

The bill to ban cloning of human beings, S. 1601, sponsored by
Sens. Lott, Bond, Frist, and Gregg, makes it a federal crime --
with a ten-year prison sentence and substantial civil fines -- if
any individual, with or without federal finding, engages in the act
of ``producing an embryo (including a preimplantation embryo)''
through the use of a specified technology, somatic cell nuclear
transfer. It would ban the production of this embryo even if the
production of such an embryo is for purposes completely
unrelated to the cloning of a human being, including for research. 

The bill as currently drafted prohibits many uses of somatic cell
nuclear transfer related to research, separate from the goal of
banning the cloning of human beings. 

First of all, the bill bans research to generate ``customized''
stem cells to treat disease if it involves somatic cell nuclear
transfer. Not all stem cell research involves somatic cell nuclear
transfer. If the stem cell research does not use this technique,
the research would not be banned by the bill. (See attachment,
``The Science at Risk.'') 

The bill bans the production of an embryo (1) if it contains a
fertilized nucleus, not a cloned nucleus with DNA identical to that
of an existing or previously existing human being, or (2) if it
contains a nucleus which has been modified in some way and is not
identical to that of any person. 

The bill's definition of somatic cell nuclear transfer is
imprecise. The bill bans the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer
to transfer a ``human somatic cell'' into an egg, but it does not
state that this is limited to a somatic cell which contains nuclear
DNA identical to that of an existing or previously existing person.
This means that the bill is not limited to cloning (creating a
person or embryo with nuclear DNA identical to that of someone
else), but would also apply to the use of somatic cell nuclear
transfer of nuclear DNA which is not identical. As currently
drafted, it would, in fact, prohibit the use of somatic cell
nuclear transfer where the nuclear DNA is the product of normal,
sexual reproduction, which is the opposite of cloning. In addition,
the bill would also prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear
transfer where the somatic cell had been modified in some way prior
to the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer. 

Even if the legislation were limited to the transfer of somatic
cells with nuclear DNA identical to that of an existing or
previously existing human being (which is not currently the case),
it would still ban one type of stem cell research. This is the type
of stem cell research which would create stem cells ``customized''
to treat an individual patient. In this case a researcher or doctor
could create a human zygote to start a customized stem cell line
with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously existing
person through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to treat
the individual from whom the DNA was extracted. By using the
same DNA to treat the individual, the stem cell would more likely
be compatible and not rejected by the person when the stem
cell is transferred back to the person for treatment. 

Finally, the bill would ban the use of somatic cell nuclear
transfer to treat mitochondrial disease. For example, a
nonidentical nucleus, such as a fertilized nucleus, is transferred
from a person with mitochondrial disease into a healthy egg from
which the nucleus has been removed. This treatment has already been
successfully used to treat infertility. 

Section 5 of the bill is entitled ``Unrestricted Scientific
Research'' which states, ``Nothing in this Act (or an amendment
made by this Act) shall be construed to restrict areas of
scientific research that are not specifically prohibited by this
Act (or amendments).'' This provision uses circular reasoning. It
merely states that the bill does what it does and does not do what
it does not do. The provision does nothing to modify the
prohibitions on research. 

To ensure that customized stem cell research is not banned by the
bill, it must be substantially revised. One approach would be
to include a broad exemption for biomedical research on stem cells
and other technology to treat patients. 

The bill includes: 

 no preemption of inconsistent state laws; and 
 no sunset to ensure that it is reviewed. 
 It creates a new entity to review the ethics of this issue, an
 entity which is separate from and duplicative to the National    
 Bioethics Advisory Commission. 

The Science at Risk 

Pending legislation regarding human cloning includes over broad
definitions which put the science described in this paper at
risk. 

Scientists are developing an entirely new approach for treating
human diseases that depend not on drugs like antibiotics but on
living cells that can differentiate into blood, skin, heart, or
brain cells and potentially treat cancers, spinal cord injuries, or
heart disease. This research -- called stem cell research -- holds
the potential to develop and improve cancer treatments by gaining
a more complete understanding of cell division and growth and the
process of metastasis. This could also lead to a variety of
cancer treatment advances. 

The kinds of cells that make up most of the human body are
differentiated, meaning that they have already achieved some sort
of specialized function such as blood, skin, heart or brain cells.
The precursor cells that led to differentiated cells come from the
embryo. They are called stem cells because functions stem from them
like the growth of a plant. Stem cells have the capacity
for self-renewal, meaning that they can produce more of themselves,
and differentiation, meaning that they can specialize into a
variety of cell types with different functions. In the last decade,
scientists studying mice and other laboratory animals have
discovered powerful new approaches involving cultured stem cells.
Studies of such cells obtained from mouse stem cells show
that they are capable of differentiating in vitro or in vivo into
a wide variety of specialized cell types. Stem cells have been
derived by culturing cells of non-human primates and promising
efforts to obtain human stem cells have also recently been
reported. 

Stem cell research has been hailed as the ``(m)ost tantalizing of
all'' research in this field. The reason for this is because adults
do not have many stem cells. Most cells are fully differentiated
into their proper functions. When differentiated cells are
damaged, such as cardiac muscle when someone suffers a heart
attack, the adult cells do not have the ability to regenerate. If
stem cells could be derived from human sources and induced to
differentiate in vitro, they could potentially be used for
transplantation and tissue repair. 

Using the heart attack sufferer as an example, we might be able to
replace damaged cardiac cells with healthy stem cells that
could differentiate into cardiac muscle. Research with these stem
cells could lead to the development of ``universal donor cells''
of invaluable benefit to patients. Stem cell therapy could make it
possible to store tissue reserves that would give health care
providers a wholly new and virtually endless supply of: 

cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and degenerative
heart disease; 

skin cells to treat burn victims; 

spinal cord neuron cells for treatment of spinal cord trauma and 
paralysis; 

neural cells for treating those suffering from neurodegenerative
diseases; 

pancreas cells to treat diabetes; 

blood cells to treat cancer anemia and immunodeficiencies; 

neural cells to treat Parkinson's, Huntington's and Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); 

cells for use in genetic therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, 
including Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, schizophrenia,
depression, and other diseases; 

blood vessel endothelial cells for treating atherosclerosis; 

liver cells for liver diseases including hepatitis and cirrhosis; 

cartilage cells for treatment of osteoarthritis; 

bone cells for treatment of osteoporosis; 

myoblast cells for the treatment of Muscular Dystrophy; 

respiratory epithelial cells for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis
and lung cancer; 

adrenal cortex cells for the treatment of Addison's disease; 

retinal pigment epithelial cells for age-related macular
degeneration; 

modified cells for treatment of various genetic diseases; 

and other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention
of other deadly or disabling diseases or other medical conditions. 

The use of stem cells to create these therapies would lead to great
medical advances. We have to be sure that nothing we do in
this legislation concerning human cloning would obstruct in any way
this vital research. 

Note: A researcher/doctor might want to ``create a human zygote
with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously
existing person through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer''
in order to create a customized stem cell line to treat the
individual from whom the DNA was extracted. By using the same DNA
the stem cell would be more likely to be compatible and not
rejected by the person when the stem cell is transferred (back)
to the person for the treatment. The language in brackets would
prohibit this technology even though its sole purpose is to provide
medical treatment for the individual, not for reproduction
(cloning) of that individual.

The Industrial Revolution brought machines to make work faster and easier.
The Information Revolution brought computers to make work smarter and
faster.  The Communications Revolution speeded the flow of information over
great distances, and brought people and countries closer together.  The
Broadcast Revolution enabled the delivery of mass entertainment and
information to the world.  As  the nexus of the convergence of the
computer, communications and broadcast revolutions, what will the Internet
bring?  Will it bring people closer together in virtual communities or will
it isolate neighbors even further?  Will it enable a democratic society or
a big-brother government and the elimination of privacy? Will it deliver
mass  entertainment to more people or will it enable self-publishing and
narrowcasting of information and entertainment to niche audiences?  Will it
enhance our children's education and play or will it simply expose them to
more sex and violence? The answer is probably all of the above, depending
on the choices we make.  We have invited big thinkers and noted futurists
to share their looks into the digital crystal ball.

Show Me The Money:  Business Models That Work

For entertainment on the Internet to flourish, a viable financial model
needs to be developed.  Today, advertising support for Web content, via
banner ads, is growing rapidly.  An alternative model relies on users to
underwrite content through subscriptions or microtransaction fees. Others
dream of an era where, like the golden age of television, advertisers
sponsor entire shows. Alternatively, Web developers are looking to license
content to content aggregators such as Microsoft Network, AOL or Sony
Station and letting them worry about making money. This session will
examine the small beachheads of economic success that have been achieved
and how a sustainable economic infrastructure can be created.

Face to Face

In the 1940's, when the television industry was in its infancy, most
programming was financed by television-set manufacturers, and it showed.
The early 1950's saw the emergence of a unique new medium, with programming
that transcended its roots in radio and theater to become a medium in its
own right. Almost overnight, television attracted a mass consumer audience
and became a multi-billion dollar industry. Both the entertainment and
television industries were forever transformed by this convergence.

Today, entertainment on the Internet is going through its own
metamorphosis, clearly at an accelerated pace befitting the high-speed
technology that underlies the medium. What will the new medium look like as
it emerges from its infancy? The answer may depend upon whom one asks: on
the one hand, Silicon Valley and the technology community which has given
birth to the Internet; or from Hollywood and the entertainment industries,
whose ability to capture mass audiences with stories and characters are key
to the medium's growth.

This two part session will look at the intersection of entertainment and

Uh, I don't think so. From my estimations, a 50 k$ hardware investment now
will yield in a desktop device capable of traditional-MD-probing well into
the us domain (roughly a 1000x increase since 1987/88). Sans any novel
algorithms whatsoever (btw, such simple things as DMPTA have turned O(n*n)
into O(n) while maintaining accurate long-range Coulomb interactions).
Today, a hypothetical large ASIC box should reduce that amount noticeably,
and thus make ms domains accessible. Several proteins fold that quick. 

This brute-force approach may be actually unnecessary. If we can guarantee
not to miss a critical carrefour in the folding process (which is not too
easy), shortcutting the brownian randomwalk in the configuration space by
a clever minimization should reduce the effort vastly. Precise endgame
potential can be extracted from empirical data.

The idea of autoassembly is based on complementary-surface alignment and
noncovalent bonding of subblocks resulting in your desired space-filling. 
Noncovalent attachements require excellent precision, even more so
covalent bonds (xref disulfide bond engineering difficulties in protein
stabilization).

I hope I am not commiting St. bovicide when questioning claims as to the
reality of existance of such circuits, their analyzability via
introspection and as of their mutability by any rituals.

Besides of anecdotal, do we have any other evidence?

Questioning the validity of such circuits is a *healthy* thing to do.  
In the end they are all models of very wild and strange stuff people 
have experienced.  Beyond pure statistical improbability of my 
experiences being a conicidence I have experienced "teleportation" while 
asleep that correlated exactly with what I saw hours later in the waking 
world.  The experience was so exact that I have since kept an open mind 
regarding the possible existence of a Circuit 8.

I like John Lilly's models of such states because he treats them more as 
a continuum than a discrete set like Leary's 8 circuit model.  :-}

I have a 'thing' which I call to "talk them out."  Basically you get
your mind to function like theirs.  Then you start to talk to them
about general problems from their perspective.  Then slowly change
from their perspective to your own and they'll start to do the same. 
It sounds like a long process, but with practise you can do it in a
matter of seconds.

It takes years of practise (see below), but it can be fun.

I started a sort of 'metaprogramming' about 4 years ago and managed to
're-link' my emotions and motivations in a more rational way.  But I
started to lack all motivation (except to live, it would seem) which
started to make things difficult.  So I needed a fix, so I figured if
I can change my mind state why not learn to link and re-link emotions
at will (actually easier than it sounds.)  Now, the way I manage to
talk people into my point of view (it doesn't work through e-mail BTW,
I've tried) is by quickly re-linking these emotions into a way their
body language, tone of voice and use of language suggests.  And then
bringing myself back to my usual state.  But I really don't suggest
everyone doing it, because for about six months I was close to
homicidal (which, to say the least, isn't a fun experience.)  BTW, I
didn't use any guides or books for this (I didn't know they existed) I
just came to the conclusion that I could make my mind run faster and
changed it.

Most of those links wouldn't work for me, but after a bit of linking I
came across an interview with Aeon's creator Peter Chung at:

http://www.hallucinet.com/n6/aeon.html

"Aeon Flux is not someone who reacts to things. She makes things
happen. She actually meddles in things the way they are...she's a
force for change as opposed to the status quo."  How very Extropian.

You've made a big mistake here, I don't want to "recommend sexual
activities prior to proper maturity" I want to not "stop sexual
activity before 'proper maturity.'"  Thus, it is not up to me to prove
anything, but up to you to prove that we *do* need to stop sexual
activities before maturity.  So how do you determine "proper
maturity"?  What damage does not having an 'age of consent' do to a
person or society?

You haven't once criticised the ideas I expressed, instead you
criticise the lack of books on the subject.  New ideas don't come in
print form, and sometimes it's worth looking at things from a
different perspective.

This is a problem. I think many adherents to the circuits hide too
much behind "it is just a model" - in science a model must be useful,
i.e. testable/falsifiable, make predictions etc. 

I think it is fairly clear that the first two circuits are on a fairly
solid ground, most theories of personality seem to involve security
vs. exploration and aggression vs. submission factors. And the third
circuit seems almost as well founded. I don't have my textbooks within
reach, but one could probably make a good case for these circuits
being central factors of personality. I don't really grok the fourth
circuit as a whole, but it seems easy to deal with too. The circuit
model just says that these factors are fairly independent aspects of a
working mind, and that they are in general static except during
imprinting. This seems testable.

The fifth "rapture" circuit is less well understood, but I think it is
fairly clear that these states appear so often in the literature (both
mystical and psychological) that they can be said to be real. They are
however not well understood, and it is by no means clear that they are
all due to the same circuit.

Mystical experiences may be grouped together, but I'm not sure they
form useful circuits.

As a neuroscientist I'm interested in the neural correlates of these
circuits. Note that the monoaminergic projections might correlate;
serotonin and the first circuit, noradrenaline and stress hormones the
second, possibly acetylcholine for the third, oxytocine, vassopressin
and others for the fourth, and *maybe* dopamine for the fifth. But now
I'm just guessing and waving my hands :-)

Good adivce!  Although with enough practice one can do it *anywhere*.  
I've managed do apply these techniques while doing everything from 
watching TV to driving a car.  Its all matter of becoming familiar with 
the varying degrees of potency that result from specific exercises.  The 
only way to become familiar enough to do it in public is by gaining a 
broad base of experience with its effects upon you - this takes alot of 
time!

Yak:  By the way, what is the extent of your experience with EM?

To the contrary, if one plans to turn the course of current
psychological theory, one would have to provide some hard data to
support a new position, such as a study or a critical analysis of
present theory.  If you are able to provide that type of evidence,
then your case for pedophila would merit consideration.  My position 
at this time is that I have not yet seen such evidence, either in my

	No.  Something physically real and objectively (or abstractly)
observable is going on in our brain that is producing conscious
sensations or qualia.  We simply must figure out how and why this is.
Once we do this we will have, or be able to produce, a one to one
mapping between particular objective physical phenomenon observed by
scientific instruments in our brain and the real qualia sensations we
introspectively feel.  With such we will be able to perfectly predict
what a person is seeing and/or eventually produce sensations in the
mind and know what the experiencer will sense.

	Someone will say, I'm going to manipulate/stimulate a part of
your brain in such a way that it will produce precisely the sensation
I experience or use to represent salt in your mind.  The experiencer
might respond with, that's not what salt tastes like to me. You would
be able to verify that this person isn't lying, and that he uses a
different sensation to represent salt because you will be able to
objectively observe the physical phenomenon that is producing his
sensation and see that it is different.  You could then reverse the
process so you would both be able to understand both sensations both
objectively and subjectively or introspectively.  You would then know
what both salt sensations were like and how they were different just
as you now know that salty is very different than, say, a warm or
painful... sensation.

	We will be able to eff the currently ineffable and this will
finally get us around all such problems.

> As you say this can have practical considerations, but I can find

	Are you saying that abstractly representing 700 nm light with
an array of transistors in a particular state could reproduce the same
phenomenally glorious "red" qualia your consciousness use to represent
700 nm light?  The proof is in the introspection.  You know what red
is like and how it is different than other qualia.  You can't ignore
the importance and realness of these representations and what they are
like.

> I don't understand your objection, all information is abstract.

	In order to represent any abstract information, there must be
some physically real phenomenon that can reliably assume various
different distinguishable states.  Light can exist in various
distinguishable wavelengths.  Thereby it can abstractly represent
information.  700 nm light can represent a red quale.  Our mind can
produce various different color qualia.  In the same way it can
thereby abstractly represent information.  Even though red can
represent 700 nm light and visa versa, the two are not anything "like"
each other.  The fundamental nature of any particular physical
phenomenon and all it's attributes are what they are "like".  Though
certain physical phenomenon can model different physical phenomenon,
they will never be precisely, fundamentally, like each other.  The
actual true fundamental base nature of whatever is doing the physical
representation is important and can never be completely duplicated,
other than abstractly, by some other physical phenomenon.

	You are as smart as I am.  But if you use a drastically
different sensation to represent a salty taste than I do, this
matters.  A purely abstract machine can achieve the same ability to be
aware of salt.  But again, the fact that there is no real subjective
salty that is representing salt still matters.

> I'll never be able to prove it, but I think the best way to make

	I believe this is exactly why we have not yet made progress.
People think that red is something out beyond our eyes, some quality
of light or something.  Therefore, they don't realize how real it is,
how important it is, and how our conscious/intelligent worlds are
built out of this real subjective physical phenomenon.  Forget all the
intelligence for the moment!  A stupid human with no other intelligent
ability other than the ability to tell what color something is is what
is really important.  If we could figure out what this stupid person
is using to represent this red knowledge and what it is like for him
to have this knowledge, why and how all this works, how this stupid
person is different than an abstract color detecting machine..., we
could then, finally, figure out all the rest of the intelligence.

Naive people do, but people with a clue *don't* think that `red  is
something out beyond our eyes, some quality of light or something.'  It's
*obviously* a construct.  A nice simple discussion of the proof for this is
in Steve Pinker's charming new book HOW THE MIND WORKS.  Or you could read
Land (old) or Zeki (current).  Our experience of colour constancy is a
ceaseless collaboration between conflicting signals from outside the body
and `best guess' (and therefore fallible) evolved inferential algorithms on
the inside.  So qualia are real - that's just the word we use to label
experience - but are not (and *cannot* be) indefeasible entities, which I
assume is Brent's claim.

I can think of a neural analogue for the first four circuits 
- the sensory areas of the brain.  The largest parts of the 
sensory map on the brain are mouth, anus, hands, and genitals 
(not in that order, however.)

I think there's a plausible connection there with the first four
circuits, in order: oral, anal, semantic, and socio-sexual.

That would be clairvoyance and/or precognition.

Please refrain from using such loaded words. These guys' point of debate is
completely justified considering the diversity in today's world, as well as
this countries own history, where boys have been considered men and girls
married off at ages as low as 12-13, while today here in the US, the
current furor people are having over Monica Lewinski is partly a bias
against her age (21 at the time of her alleged actions with Bill( who most
women consider sexy even though he's in his 50's), and now 24), as well as
the current hypocritical attitude of much of the baby boom generation
toward the 'genX'ers. Now that I've turned 30 this past Jan 19th, does that
mean they can trust me now???? (ironic hint, hint, wink, wink).

As the boomers age, I can easily imagine that they will lobby throught the
AARP to deny voting rights, driving priviledges, rights to reproduce (or
even keep custody of their children) of anyone under 30. Will that mean
that two people having sex at age 25 in that future will be comitting date
rape, statutory rape, pedophilia, or what have you??? How rational are such
charges when the post is easily raised and lowered depending on the current
state of the culture? Will senior psychologists promote and accept the
concept that sex before 30 is a traumatic experience for 'children', and
should be banned, that men who want to have sex with nubile 25 year olds
are sick SOBs who should be locked up, castrated, imprisoned without due
process, and be branded for the rest of their lives with the Scarlet Letter
of SEX OFFENDER? Please excuse me while I puke.

For someone such as you who have advocated sexual liberty to take such a
puritanical position is the height of hypocritical arrogance IMHO (sorry
for the ad hominem, but it is needed). I hope you see from my scenario how
indicative such societal mores are of the current cultural sickness that
needs treating much more than 'pedophiles' who would have been considered
average citizens a few years/decades ago, and still would be in many other
developed countries....

 Random numbers are complex. The tit-for-tat strategy is simple.
Increasing those other features you mentioned may tend to cause an increase
in complexity, but that doesn't make complexity valuable in and of itself,
nor a good indicator of the others.
 This is particularly true of moral systems. A moral system, if it is to
be more than a personal set of habits, must be something that a community
can agree to follow. Simplicity is valuable in a moral system because
the easier it is to follow a moral system, the easier it is to keep it
effective by drawing a clear dividing line between those who follow it
and those who reject it. Also, the more rules a system has, the harder it
is to achieve a consensus about it.

 Vegetarianism, unless accompanied by a clear principle for dividing
nonhuman lifeforms into those whose rights we respect and those we don't,
risks blurring the boundaries in a way that makes it seem easier to
for people to decide that that boundary is just a matter of personal
choice.

Here's what I ended up submitting. The original was fully referenced and
footnoted - if anyone wants a copy email me and I'll send you a Word 6.0
document.

I'd be interested in any comments (and, I expect, criticisms).

Topic

Why do you think the image of modern technology being 'out of control'
has such a strong appeal? In what ways does technology appear difficult
to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore their
implications for government policy-makers. Provide examples for your
arguments.

Abstract

The essay examines several explanations for the prevalence of the view
that technology is 'out of control'. Possible types of control are
considered and analogies drawn with technology itself. Factors which
have determined the public perception of technology and they way in
which it appears 'out of control' are examined through issues such as
the image of machines in the entertainment industry and mass media,
historical views of technology, human emotions and resistance to change,
the increasingly specialised nature of technology, the perception of
individual technologies as 'out of control', and ethical considerations.
Difficulties for policy makers in a capitalist democratic society are
investigated in light of the increasingly esoteric nature of technology,
the disparity between ethics and technological development, and the fact
that the end result of technological progress depends on the people
using the technologies as much as the technologies themselves.

Humanity has long aspired to mould nature in it's image, to force nature
to conform to human desires, to control nature. The universe was
perceived by early humans to be volitional, and early religion speaks
testimony of this anthropomorphic world view. The development of the
deterministic paradigm upon which the modern artifacts of science and
technology stand is therefore one of many places where a line separating
primitive from modern man may be drawn, as it is this insight into the
universe which began to allow humans to predict, explain, and - most
importantly - affect the workings of nature. Nevertheless, a new dilemma
has arisen - that of the control of technology itself.

It has been said that whoever controls technology controls the future. A
view which has become prevalent in modern society is that technology is
'out of control' - and therefore that the future is out of human hands.
The reasons for this view are numerous and in the majority erroneous.
The intuitive or common notion of the word control involves a
centralised directing or restraining force; in this sense technology is
'out of control', for there is no single agency or regulatory power
which exercises authority over technological development.  Furthermore,
there is no person or collective which can lay claim to understanding
all existing technology. An alternate form of control, with it's origins
in robotics and computer science, is termed distributed control , or
bottom-up control, where overall order is obtained through the smaller
scale independent management of component parts of a system. A breakdown
in this analogy is that in robotics component parts are designed with a
goal in mind; and there is not necessarily an "equivalent selective
force in society as a whole that will cause the techno-societal system
to tend toward homeostasis" . These models, however, do not take into
account the social framework within which technological development
operates.

Interestingly, the 'out of control' image is not primarily the result of
an awareness of these broad issues; rather, it results largely from the
interplay of various other determining factors. 
The manner in which society presents technology through the arts and the
media has been a significant factor in the perception of technology as
'out of control'. In science fiction especially "the view of technology
as a violent, animal force is widespread and, in popular culture at
least, no longer needs justification". The Terminator movies, which
portray a world in which machines have overtaken humans, are one
example. Adding to this negative image of technology is the mass media,
renowned for  focusing primarily on bad news. This emphasis on negative
connotations results in the public perception that either technologists
are inhuman, or the effects of technology itself are out of control.

Additionally responsible for the 'out of control' image are residual
historical attitudes to technological development. Anti-technology
sentiments most likely originated with the Industrial Revolution of the
late 18th Century, which saw the machine become viewed as a displacer of
humans and inherently evil. The public perception of the progression of
technology since that time period has passed through and now
incorporates attitudes of infatuation and blind acceptance of results -
"Can we?", ethical considerations due to the possibility of undesirable
results - "Should we?", and the current dilemma of control - "Can we
manage it?" However the inherent issue of control "is not, as some
historians and philosophers would have us imagine, that of man versus
machine. It is the much older conflict of man versus man" Technology
does not simply arise from nothing - rather, it is the result of human
desire to extend our ability to control nature, and to improve the
convenience of life.

If this is the case, and it is certainly logical that technology is
fashioned in the human interest, why does the 'out of control' image
persist? The answer lies partly in the collective human psyche - for
"how we try and control technology has a great deal to do with how we
feel about it." Technological progress means change, and technophobia is
often a part of a larger state of neophobia, the aversion to all things
new. This is not only due to the fact that change is occurring but,
increasingly, because of the extreme rapidity of technological
development. The multitude of decisions which are forced members of a
technological society result in feelings of bewilderment, resentment and
mistrust of established authority. Additionally - and this may sound
frivolous - people tend to attach inordinate value to superseded
technology. Some would suggest that this romantic posture is more than
trifling in it's influence on the general resistance to technological
change. This reluctance of people to take control of new technology
contributes to the overall 'out of control' image.

On a slightly different note, new technology by it's very nature is
increasingly esoteric, and the 'out of control' image is partly fuelled
by a general inability to understand it. The nature of technological
progress itself means that "while we have more knowledge, we have less
understanding" - and this is also true of the technologists at the
fringes of technological development. Couple this with the increasing
integration of and reliance on technology in every day life and the
question of whether technology actually controls us  appears to become
more valid. This polar view of technology is not rational when the
origins of technology itself are considered, however - more accurate is
the statement that humans control or limit themselves through
technology. 
The 'out of control' image is also partly due to the relaxation of
direct control on individual technologies themselves. Current machine
technology is becoming increasingly biological and directly
anthropomorphic, while technology is also delving into genetic
engineering and other biological realms. It is being realised that to
fully reap the benefits of technology some element of decision making
and independence must be incorporated into machines, which means that
"the creator must share control, and his destiny, with his creations."
This does not mean, however, that humans have resigned control - we
merely control the level of control given to machines, as it were. 

The transfer of previously human functions to machines obviously raises
challenges to traditional beliefs, morals and ethics - indeed, some
would say that it promotes unwanted values: "Technology has caused
softening, dependency, degradation, disengagement and escapism -- all of
which impart a loss of meaning." And this is not the only area in which
technology infringes on untrodden ethical walkways, as the current human
cloning debate highlights. Of course, the 'out of control' image is
further added to by such ethical dilemma, but the issues really are
separate - in the case of cloning the technology is under control but
the ethics are lagging.  As Paul Schmitt notes, "We have to get our
theology and philosophy and legislation all sort of thought through in
light of this extraordinary new set of circumstances." Thus government
policy is given the task of adapting to the new technology of cloning
and ensuring the public interest is upheld.

It can be seen that the perception of modern technology as 'out of
control' has resulted from a large number of influences. In modern
democratic society it is the responsibility of government  to manage
both the public perception and the public interest. Under a capitalist
society individuals and companies try to manipulate technology for their
own personal advantage - innovation forced by competition. Every
technology can deliver unexpected risks, however, and so the government
must responsibly manage the risks of technological development. For even
in a capitalist society, "The grand issues of our time are settled by
public policy decisions more than by market forces". The difficulty for
policy makers is that it is hard to establish ensure beforehand
responsibility and accountability as the overall success  of policy
(together with blame and liability) can only really be determined long
after the fact.  Moreover, every technological choice raises ethical
questions, and so the end results are determined as much by the morals
and ethics of policy makers as by the technical content. This is
juxtaposed with the 'out of control' image of modern technology, and it
can be seen that steering technology is inherently a political act which
may be sufficient to provide the corrective forces necessary for
effective distributed control.

The social nature of technology indicates that technological development
is not necessarily unidirectional and blindly deterministic, and that
policy based on prevailing values actually affect the direction which it
takes. The major problem for government then is unpredictability, and
technological complexity - "our social evolution has fallen behind the
technical", and it is a problem which must be faced, as progress is
inevitable on the long term. Modern technology is not 'out of control',
but the end result of technology is determined as much by the nature of
the tool user as by the nature of the tool itself. The implication of
this is that ensuring a positive direction for technology must involve
maintaining a broadly technically literate populace who are at ease with
change, while maintaining close relations with those at the
technological forefront; and if technology appears to be 'out of
control' it is the social structure which is at fault - not technology
itself.

Call it what you will, but the feeling of leaving my body and flying to 
the places in question was so real that I was surprised to find myself 
waking from sleep and even more surpirsed later to find the places 
exactly as I experienced them.

                    ~~~  The COBAL Programmer  ~~~
I hope you've not heard this before ....
anyway what's the point .... just re-surfacing ....

Jack was once a COBOL programmer in the late 1990's who
(after years of being taken for granted and treated as a
technological dinosaur by all the UNIX programmers and
Client/Server programmers and website developers, etc.)
was finally getting some respect.

You see,  he'd become a private consultant specializing in
Year 2000 conversions.  He was working short-term
assignments for
prestige companies, traveling all over the world on different
assignments.  He was working 70 and 80 and even 90 hour
weeks, but it was worth it.

However, several years of this relentless, mind-numbing
work had taken its toll on Jack.  He had problems sleeping
and began having anxiety dreams about the Year 2000.  It
had reached a point where even the thought of the year 2000
made him nearly violent.  He must have suffered some sort
of breakdown, because all he could think about was how he
could avoid the year 2000 and all that came with it.

By the end of 1997 Jack decided to contact a company that
specialized in cryogenics.  He made a deal to have himself
frozen until 2001 through their totally automated (and very
expensive) process.  He was thrilled.  The next thing he
would know is he'd wake up in the year 2001; after the New
Year celebrations and
computer debacles; after the leap year, and the dust had
settled.
Nothing else to worry about except getting on with his life.

He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians
set the
revive date, he was given injections to slow his heartbeat
to a bare
 minimum, and that was that.

The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very
modern room filled with excited people.  They were all
shouting "I can't believe  it!" and "It's a miracle" and
"He's alive!".  There were
cameras (unlike any he'd ever seen) and equipment that
looked like
it came out of a science fiction movie.

Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group
stepped
 forward. Jack couldn't contain his enthusiasm.  "It is
over?" he
 asked.  "Is 2001 already here?  Are all the millennial
parties and
 promotions and crises all over and done with?"

The spokesman explained that there had been a problem
with the programming of the timer on Jack's cryogenic
receptacle, it
hadn't been year 2000 compliant.  It was actually 8,000 years
later, not the year 2001.  But the spokesman told Jack that
he shouldn't get excited; someone important wanted to speak
to him.

Suddenly a wall-sized projection screen displayed the image
of a
 man that had a striking resemblance to Bill Gates.  This
man was Prime Minister of Earth.  He told Jack not to be
upset.  That
this was a wonderful time to be alive.  That there was
world peace and no more starvation.  That the space program
had been reinstated and there were colonies on the moon and
on Mars.  That technology had advanced to such a degree
that everyone had virtual reality interfaces which allowed
them to contact anyone else on the planet, or to watch any
entertainment, or to hear any music recorded anywhere.

"That sounds terrific," said Jack. "But I'm curious. Why is
everybody so interested in me?"

"Well," said the Prime Minister.  "The year 10000 is
just around the corner, and it says in your files that you
know
COBOL..."

1. That joke went around 6 months ago. Fie on you!
2. There is NO WAY that COBOL is extropian. So there!

Real Programmers do it in HexaDecimal. Debug Thyself!

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
· Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
· Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
· Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
· Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
· Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
· Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

The anus and genitals do not have a very large representation in the
somatosensory cortex. You don't need high resolution there :-)

They are more than that. I agree that these areas might be part of the
circuit, but most brain systems are distributed over many parts of the
brain, not just one. So the same circuits most likely also contain
neurons in the frontal cortex, the association areas, limbic system
and everywhere else.

Hi all,

I found the time to put up a new section of Lem's "Summa" on my Lem pages,
"The autoevolutionary machine", which somehow goes together nicely with
the recent "extro boy seeks extro girl" discussion/thread on this list.
Enjoy.

Sorry, I accidentally sent an empty message:

I confused ctrl+x (send mail) and ctrl+c (cancel). I'd say that's
a good example of "incomplete perception": hitting keys happens completely
unconsciously - I just think "cancel" and (automatically) I hit ctrl+c
and confirm the request (are you sure you want to cancel?) with yes. This
happens too fast for reading the text, so the question (are you
sure you want to send?) didn't even get to me... only after the message
"message sent and saved..." (which remains on screen for a while) I 
realized my mistake.

If I hadn't had that feedback, I would have just realized that after 
reading my own mail on the list - if I wasn't subscribed, I would have 
never realized that.

I think one goal for individuals should be enhancing their perception as 
much as possible, both technologically and 'naturally'. The question is 
just: how far is it possible to "track" things down - without error.

With "learned automatical behaviour" it's relatively easy: I just need to 
concentrate a bit more. Analyzing the first four circuits already needs 
some "knowledge" (about that particular model) + practice (like the 
exercises in Prometheus Rising). I think it's quite possible that with 
the right knowledge and practice, experiences on other circuits are as 
well possible - but I think it gets extremely hard to understand the 
"symbols" correctly:

We don't know (yet), if - for example - precognition is just your mind 
playing a trick on you (possibly trying to make understand something), or 
if it's a clear sign that time is not "real" after all, do we?

later,
Holger

The main problem being that perhaps different experiences are frequently
confused or wrongly organized in a vertical hierarchy ,although they
are  completely different phenomena. It's interesting to notice that
Timothy Leary created the circuits theory in the 70's, and simply forgot
it during the following years (the circuits came back with "Design for
dying", but, for various reasons,  this book is atypical).
There is apparently a "rapture" experience, which can be summarized by
the loss of the sensation of body's limits. This can be expressed as an
"out of the body experience", as a disappearing of the body (yoga), or
as a fusion between the body and environment. I'm not sure this can be
categorized as a superior circuit or state of consciousness, but it's
fun , and gives certainly good results against stress and on body's
health.
The metaprogramming experience, that Leary names the sixth circuit could
be a completely different experience. I find it closer to ethological
mechanism of "insight", or, even better, to the Gregory Bateson's
concept "learning III". According Bateson, Learning I is the simple,
traditional, learning. Learning II (learning to learn) is the process
that, frequently through "insight", one can build a model of the world
based on previous experience (the monkey sees banana; the monkey sees
the rod; suddenly, the monkey has a mystical flash and takes the banana
with the rod; he just created a new model of the world, where things can
be used as tools). Leaning III (learning to learn to learn) is a more
complex experience where one's own model of the world is seen as a
relative reality, and can therefore be changed. This is the mystical
crisis, the conversion process, the Zen's satori.
The two states, the "rapture" and the "satori" are frequently confused
because the rapture experience can be so shocking that it can lead to a
mystical crisis, at least on the first time. On the other side, a very
intense satori, which "deconstructs" one's world model, can lead to a
state of rapture (because the body's limits are also a psychological
construction).
The difference between the rapture and the satori can be an explanation
of the fundamental difference between hindu and buddhic mysticism. The
first assumes that the highest rapture state (samadhi) is an expression
of reality, but buddhists claims that one can only understand reality
through awakening or crisis, rapture states being just a tool. As it is
easier to experiment rapture than awakening, the confusion between the
states began also to invade buddhism, until the "revolt" of the Rinzai
Zen masters, who chose to abandon the rapture way to awakening to use
instead a kind of shock therapy through violent or absurd behavior.

An interesting didactic review article about CYBernetic ORGanismS can be
found in: 

http://www.carleton.ca/~claughli/tutcybor.htm

As a small example, we have:

' I suggest that the cyborg process results in an inevitable transformation
of the human body itself, and eventually
the neurophysiological organization of the body's consciousness.
Eventually, in order for me to gain access to a
broader range of experiences than the limits provided by my natural body, I
may have to technically alter my
nervous system. In a sense, the endogenous systems come to replicate the
exogenous, technologically altered
patterns in the world.'   

Anyway, it needs some critical comments...

Gomes.

A suggested model to help understanding such processes is "fuzziness".
See an example in the site bellow... 

http://www.carleton.ca/~claughli/fuzzy.htm

Gomes.

extracted text:

..........
' We now know that the
relationship between thalamic nuclei and the cortical areas they
innervate is a reciprocal one.  The innervation is two-way.  Both
the nuclei and the cortical areas interact -- they communicate with
each other.  The same is the case between sensory receptor sites
and tissues "higher-up" in the nervous system.

The "experiential proximity hypothesis" tacitly recognizes that a
state of consciousness may be initiated from the exteroceptor,
interoceptor or sensorial structures (a butterfly suddenly appears
before my eyes, or I imagine a chocolate milkshake) and propagate
toward intentional processes, or it may be initiated from
intentional structures and propagate outward (I reason out a
problem, and then orient my senses and body to implement the
solution).'

Well, IMHO, these are also examples of  'virtual reallity menthal states
special effects'... (just occidentallizing...)

( in a near future will have specific CD's for simulating such effects...)

Gomes.

PS1: religions development is very based on the merchandisings of such
things....
PS2: the comments bellow are scientific and are very good to dismistify
such effects...great analisys !!!!

Fuzziness is a very natural consequence of neural networks doing
categorization, they tend to form representations that are quite
similar to fuzzy sets (although mutual inhibition can sharpen them).

What I was thinking of was more distributed representations, like
Fuster's memory models where neural nets spread across the brain
participate in storing one short-term memory. 

For example, a cell-assembly corresponding to the concept "mountain
climbing" could have neurons in both the somatosensory cortex (the
feeling of climbing), visual cortex (a standard image of climbing),
parietal cortex (where one climbs), the amygdala (a slight twinge of
unease at the danger) and prefrontal cortex (my knowledge about
climbing). Activate part of the representation and the rest becomes
active.

I wish to apologize for a previous message in which I repeated a rumour 
about A.C. Clarke. Although I noted that there was no proof of the facts 
alleged, I think it was wrong for me even to bring up the subject, 
especially on this board. For the record, I greatly admire Mr. Clarke 
(he's a brilliant thinker who does not mindlessly buy into every 
politically correct idea going around) and I think his upcoming 
knighthood is well deserved.

I have to agree that Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, but the political 
instability, hot humid weather all year round and generally low standard 
of living with a lack of reliable services would concern me. It is not 
currently on my list of "retirement havens." Has anyone on the board 
actually been there?

So I can presume from this message that there is no evidence to
support your claims.  So granted it has no scientific basis we need to
find a rational way of looking at the current situation.  Let's have a
look at current theory:

Their exists an age above which a child matures to a point where he or
she is 'emotionally ready' to have a sexual relationship.  How this
age is determined I am unsure, and you (despite repeated requests)
have yet to explain this.  But in order for there to be a way of
proving such an age exists, we need to prove the following points:

Children mature at the same rate - However, I'll let this one slide
since having a "round about" age of consent is purely for reasons of
ease of enforcement.

Emotional Readiness is not a product of social trends, it can be
proven to exist in a society that does not believe in "emotional
readiness" and it can be measured.  How?

A force other than a society that believes the 'crime' to be 'wrong'
creates emotional trauma.  If so would you mind telling me what this
force is?

If society did not believe this 'crime' to be wrong, the victim would
still suffer emotional trauma because they were not emotionally ready.
 And that emotional readiness and need for emotional readiness is not
a product of social trends.

However, there exists no evidence to prove the existence of a specific
age at which a person is emotionally ready.  There exists no research
to find the cause of the emotional trauma (a victim's emotional trauma
must, for you case to be sound, be caused by the perpetrator and not
the societal "shunning" which occurs after the crime.)  The current
theory has (from what you have led me to believe) no grounding in
science, and is purely based on opinion.

Added to this, different countries/cultures have different opinions of
the subject of emotional readiness.  Thus, the idea is not objective
and is purely subjective.  Countries that have a lower 'age of
consent' and a more open attitude to sex/sexuality generally have less
problems (emotional or otherwise) regarding sexual behaviour.  And
countries with no age of consent have no paedophilic crime at all!

So prove these right and I'll be willing to except your "current
theory" (although perhaps not as religiously as you have.)

No, *real* programmers build a Turing Machine by training three goats

 Space-filling isn't very usefull in the early stages of the pathway
I'm describing. The main goal is to produce hinges from proteins attached
at a few points to the adjacent protein or held in the right place by
dna attached to both proteins, and build "arms" with several degrees
of freedom out of this.
 Attaching small pieces of dna to proteins is a bit easier than attaching
proteins to proteins, and Bruce and Markus say they have new ideas for
doing it better (they're keeping those ideas private for now).
 There will be steps at which precise positioning of 2 proteins will
be important. The dna scaffolding should be able to provide this in the
earliest stages. In later stages, the "arms" will push the proteins into
appropriate places.

A big open question is whether and when it will be feasible to establish
such autonomous places in our solar system.  Now transportation is too 
expensive to do much of anything out there, and eventually transportation
will be comparable to transportation on earth now.  In between, early 
colonies may be so dependent on the earth economy that autonomy is still
infeasible.

Julian Simon died this past Sunday at the age of 65.

There is an excellent tribute to Mr.Simon by Ben Wattenberg in today's 
Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Simon's contributions to the extropian movement are tremendous. He 
believed in reason and optimism and continually argued against the gloom 
and doom environmentalists, always backing up his arguments with facts. 
The key insight in all of his work is that humans are the "ultimate 
resource."

I never knew Mr. Simon personally, although I did exchange a couple of 
email messages with him last year. However, I feel as if I've lost 
someone from my own family. Actually, his death is a loss for the human 
"family."

NO  :  privacy is in your head, the rest is dealing with 
          the real world. I prefer absolute truth, but I can't 
          imagine that everybody would interpret it the same way.

As I mentioned before, there would seem to be a tradeoff between
decisiveness and openness that I would want to take into consideration
drawing the line as to just how complex I want my ethical deliberations to
be.  Nevertheless I have a strong prejudice in favor of complexity.  We're
probably talking a little past one another here.  To me, "simplicity" 
taken as a value in a moral system codes usually as intolerance and lack
of imagination.  Want I want from ethical life are strategies that will
put me in a position to appreciate and thrive in as many situations as
either chance or my own design can contrive to throw at me.  What seems to
me to be wanted from ethics is richness more than simplicity.

I would distinguish an individual moral code (an esthetic/prudential style
of living and individual meaning-making), from a social or political civil
code.  I think I've mentioned before that although I pretty strongly
advocate vegetarian practices as individually broadening, I don't think
vegetarian sensitivities should be mandated at the level of law.  This is
partly for the reasons you mentioned above.  Still, even on your own terms
it seems to me that simplicity isn't a *self-evident* value here.  Doesn't
it sometimes conduce to the benefit of social stability for a moral code
to institute wiggle-room and ongoing contestation of norms?  Sometimes
it's good to make moral consensus a difficult thing to achieve.  Sometimes
its good to keep the dividing lines between the moral and immoral pretty
muddy (as when a clear "us" and "them" underwrites genocidal rages for
order and purity).

Animal rights discourse seems intriguing to me, but pretty flawed.  As a
rule I simply try not to inflict pain knowingly and unecessarily on beings
capable of experiencing it.  It does seem to me profoundly disrespectful
to recognize that the pain experienced by the beings we instrumentalize as
food (etc) is real but simply doesn't *matter*.  I want to respect as wide
a range of beings as I can.  
	One of the negative consequences of the line between human and
nonhuman animals being so obvious to most people is that it creates a
general category of beings whose pain doesn't matter to us ethically, a
category that seems to attach pretty promiscuously to other beings whose
pain we would prefer not to bother too much with.  It is a matter of
record that justifications for misogynist or racist practices often
(almost *always*) make recourse to the theme of the so-called subhuman or
bestial nature of the people it dismisses.  Muddying these categorical
waters and so depriving this rhetorical tactic of its sting would possibly
be a salutary thing.
	If I were in a position to argue with a Power who was on the verge
of using the population of Poughkeepsie as ubergoo feedstock for some
transhuman construction project, I would say that respecting diversity has
the consequence of opening up an unforseeably richer range of pleasurable
experiences (I for one don't think of my vegetarianism as a limiting or
ascetic lifestyle as many seem to), as well as providing a robust and
resilient cultural system better able to fend off dangers unforseeable to
even such a Power.  I see my vegetarianism as a dress rehearsal for Power
ethics to come.  (I'm sorry to hereby inflict the list with more "My
Little Pony" extropianism.)  Anyway, I agree with you that the boundary
does indeed seem to be one of personal choice.  I wouldn't say it is
"just"  personal choice, since this suggests that stronger injunctions are
available, when ultimately I suspect they are not.  Peter, thanks for the
very considered reply to that last post.  We seem to be interested in
similar problems even if we draw lines in different places.
	Very interesting, very enjoyable.  Best, Dale

Obviously you must be so straight and narrow that your not afraid to 
have your innermost thoughts and actions broadcast to the world.  At our 
current state of civilization, a world without privacy would give us the 
mass common denominator (read Jerry Springer and Oprah) opressing the 
rest of us deviants.  As an extropian, aren't you  already a deviant to 
the majority of humanity?  Is this tpye of oppression what you really 
want?  The United States alone is so uptight, that half the things I 
engage in in my own home would probably get me thrown in to the rubber 
room.

Until humanity is ready for it, I'll put my privacy above absolute 
truth, thank you.

Yak Wax mentioned that he could will his mind to run faster and it
eventually made it so.  I have done something similar with my senses (I
mentioned this on the list about a year and a half ago, but I think it
should be repeated, especially for new list members).  A few years ago, I
somehow got the intense desire to have better senses.  This led me to pay
more attention to my senses, because I realized that improved senses
aren't any good unless I pay attention to them, and I realized that I was
ignoring most of my sensory input anyway, and learning to pay attention
to that vast amount of information was the first key in improving my
senses.  

My exercises started first with persistent reminders to myself to pay
attention to my senses.  As the need for reminders became less frequent,
I began focusing more on noticing more details in my senses.  I would
listen to "the sounds between the sounds" and look for more minute detail
in things I sensed.  I practiced much; I would frequently go for long
walks, spending most of the time paying close attention to my senses,
which continued to become more vivid and detailed over the course of
months, and are still improving today.  I also practiced much while doing
my regular daily activities.

I think the most important area of focus when improving my senses was
learning to pay conscious attention to so much information.  And one big
key to doing that was learning to be interested in vast amounts of
information which doesn't really matter.  Most sensory information didn't
really matter to me, so I ignored it, but when I determined to pay
attention to as much as I could,  my sensory world really started opening
up, and ordinary things became fascinating delights.  I eventually
learned to see and appreciate so much beauty in my world that I simply
overlooked before because I didn't think it mattered.  Now there's so
much vivid detail in everything, even the most common-place things seem
interesting.

By learning to pay attention to more detail in a given unit of time, I
have noticed that my thinking, in general, has gotten quicker.  I have
trained myself to process sensory information faster, but it seems to
have helped me process cognitive information faster too.  It's also made
it easier to switch from thought to thought and think of several thoughts
simultaneously, since that's what I do when I use my senses; I
consciously think (to some degree) about everything I sense, and my
sensory data keeps changing, especially as I move around.  Because I've
spent so much time paying attention to my senses and continually
analyzing and interpreting them, my mind has shaped itself around those
sorts of activities.  Before improving my senses, I was extremely
intellectual, and had a hard time thinking outside of rigid categories. 
As I focused on my senses, my intellect gradually gained new thinking
styles that were more related to interpreting and analyzing the sensory
world.  My thinking became much more dynamic, detailed and powerful (it
also became more multi-tasking, switching among several lines of
thinking, rather than focusing on one until it was done).

It's been very rewarding for me to see the vast improvement I've
experienced in my senses over the past few years; rewarding because now
things look, sound, feel, taste and smell so fascinating and beautiful,
and rewarding because I was able to pursue my goal of modifying myself in
that way and succeed.  

As my senses became very good, I realized that I could probably improve
my thinking even more by learning to pay more attention to cognitive
information.  This has proved to be more difficult and elusive than
paying attention to sensory information, but I persist in working on it,
and I am making some improvements.  

I have come to believe that attention is a big key to improving oneself. 
It's basically a way of getting feedback, and without feedback, directed
change approaches impossibility.

I think it would be useful for list members to discuss the effective ways
they have discovered for improving various aspects of themselves.

I agree that something physical must be causing qualia, but we can never know 
what it is with any certainty unless we assume there is a direct connection 
between qualia and behavior.
              

        >We simply must figure out how and why this is.


I'm not saying we can't come up with theories of conscienceless, we can come 
up with lots of them, I'm saying that without behavior there is no reason to 
pick one over the other because there are no facts they must explain, all are
equally good, or bad.

And when you do I will make a sound with my mouth like this:

 "I hear the sounds you just made with your mouth and it is causing me to  
  make the following sounds with my own mouth:"

    I do feel a sensation, I've felt it before and called it "salty". You have    
    shown me detailed measurements of your brain when you claim you are also   
    experiencing a salty sensation, and I have compared them to  measurements 
    of my own brain. I see a vast number, an astronomical number,  of 
    differences in the measurements of our two brains, however because we're   
    both making the same noise with our mouth (this is salty) there must be   
    something similar in the two measurements. You have found them and proven    
    conclusively that these small brain similarities in a huge sea of 
    differences are the reasons we made the same sounds with our mouths. I 
    have no problem with any of this, HOWEVER you then make a huge unwarranted 
    leap of logic that this has something to do with consciousness. Just 
    because you and I make similar sounds is no reason to think that your 
    subjective experience is anything like mine, or even that you have any 
    subjective experience at all, UNLESS I assume that qualia and behavior 
    are inextricably linked. I have made that assumption, you have not. 
    If as you think, one part of the brain produces intelligent behavior and 
    a completely different part produces qualia, then all you've explained is 
    the intelligent part, the qualia might be made somewhere else in all 
    those enormous differences between  you and me.

   

        >The experiencer might respond with, that's not what salt tastes like

You're saying that if you already have a theory of consciousness that you 
know for sure is correct (!) then you could know for sure what somebody else 
is feeling. There are two problems.

1) The theory you came up with can never be better than the evidence, and the    
   evidence can only come from behavior.

2) Even if I knew that at the present moment you at 88.4762 on the happiness   
   scale, 23.2211 on the fear scale, and 11.0216 on the pain scale, I still    
   wouldn't know what it's like to be you, even reading a poem by a great    
   poet can't do that. At best all I could know is how I would feel if I were   
   in your situation, not how you feel in your situation. 
              

        >Are you saying that abstractly representing 700 nm light with an

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. It's not obvious to me that an array of 
transistors in inherently less glorious than a glob of gray goo.
                            

       >In order to represent any abstract information, there must be some

Correct. Shakespeare can be represented as ink on paper or magnetic spots on 
a disk or charged capacitors in a RAM chip or neuron connections in a brain,  
it doesn't matter, the meaning is the same, it's still Shakespeare.


        >Though certain physical phenomenon can model different physical        
        >phenomenon, they will never be precisely, fundamentally, like each

If so then how could I ever know for sure what it's like to be you?
                            

        >You are as smart as I am.  But if you use a drastically different         
        >sensation to represent a salty taste than I do, this  matters.  
        

I can say with complete confidence that the way your brain represents a salty 
sensation is different than the way my brain does, because we're different 
people with different brains. However, if neither of us likes a lot  of salt 
in our drinking water and both of us like a little salt on our popcorn then
that is evidence (I admit not proof) that the two subjective sensations may 
be similar
                            

        >A purely abstract machine can achieve the same ability to be aware         
        >of salt.  But again, the fact that there is no real subjective salty         
        >that is representing salt 


I have 4 questions:

1) Why is a person less abstract than a machine? 
2) How do you know the machine is not experiencing a salty taste? 
3) How do you know that I am? 
4) Most important of all, why oh why did random mutation ever come up with   
   things that have subjective experience if it is not linked to behavior?
                            

        >People think that red is something out beyond our eyes, some quality

I think you're attacking a straw man, nobody in the AI field, or anybody who 
has spent any time thinking about philosophy would believe such a foolish 
thing.

This isn't quite true, unless your definition of "behavior" includes
apparently involuntary things like endocrine responses, heart rate,
etc. -- and eventually to measurable patterns in neuron chemistry
itself.  These things can respond to perceptions like smells and colors,
and so can be used to compare internal states between subjects.

The fact that some of the arguments of the anti-behaviorist crowd
are easily debunked (such as Searle's Chinese Room) is not necessarily
a nod in favor of the strict behaviorists (though I certainly lean
in that direction as well).

I'd mind, too. I finally ordered (through the alcor.org link to 
Amazon -- Amazon's one-click ordering is _dangerous_!) and read _The 
First Immortal_ -- now I have to go to the archives and read the 
threads I skipped because they had FI spoilers!

I agree FI is a terrific read. I sucked it down, using all my spare 
time out of about 30 calendar hours earlier this week. I even missed 
some sleep for it. Found a distinct Heinleinian flavor to it at the 
end ...

IF a truth machine is possible -- and given some of the skilled liars I 
have known, I wonder -- it could be used, per Halperin, to put an end 
to at least part of politics-as-usual, and to provide assurance of good 
faith in contracts (insert digression about how to implement truth 
certificates on the Net, since many contracts are made without f2f 
contact). However, in the context of the book it felt to me like a Deus 
ex Machina -- enter the truth machine, exit the gray-goo and rogue-AI 
problems. I'd still prefer a technical solution to the former, and will 
have to remain skeptical about the latter. Halperin has it both ways in 
FI: his AIs start with no survival imperative or emotions, yet they 
evolve. To be sure those traits are never introduced, you'd have to 
prove one of two propositions:

1. That those traits can't evolve from AIs that don't start with them;
2. That a machine can recognize those traits in another machine it is 
building, so that it can choose another design approach to avoid 
introducing them.

My gut feeling is that 1 is not true and 2 is difficult. 

Further, I think emotion, or some analogue of it, is tied in to
intelligence at fundamental levels, and that Halperin's
perfectly-Apollonian AIs would have to be able to at least model human
emotion and drives to do what they do (create art and act as judges,
for two instances). (I used to have some references on this, but I
think my Labrador ate them. I apologize for glossing over such an
interesting point).

Well, the book provides a lot of food for thought. I did catch a couple
of minor technical flaws, but I will be surprised if I am the first to
see them.

I have to cut this short, being still a member of the involuntary work 
force <grin>.

Some of you might be enjoy reading my amazon.com interview, which will
be featured for the next day or two on their Home page
<http://www.amazon.com>, and which after that will be linked to The
First Immortal book page at their site. 
The final third of the interview is basically an advertisement for
cryonics!
Best wishes to all,
Jim Halperin

I have not granted that there is no scientific basis for my 
statements--they fall in line with current psychological and medical 
studies and theory, and therefore I have no need to 'prove' anything. 
This list favors opinions that are backed up in some rational manner, 
either through study, theory, or careful survey of existing 
information.  Again, I welcome such information, if you can provide 
it, but until then don't expect me to agree that your contentions 
should be included in my own extropian work.

Michael, no one has made such a contention, and I myself have stated 
that the age of consent could be lowered by many years with no real 
harm to anyone.  But, again, to move beyond that in my own work I 
would need to see some real information, like a study or a reputable 
critique, because I have already spent many hours discussing the 
issue with clinicians, known pedophiles and reading current medical 
work on it, and haven't found the information to support changing 
most of the existing child protections.

Let me try something here, because I am still wrestling with this issue.

Would it be accurate then, to model our consciousness like a very complex finite state machine with some very large number of possible states?  As our consciousness cycles through the various states, driven by sensory input, two separate consciousnesses may fleetingly produce similar/identical states given identical sensory inputs?  The paths leading to the momentary near-same states can be different as well as the paths leading out of the state (hence the inability to know what it is like to be someone else, even if you fleetingly  produce a similar state), but for a moment you would be very similar to the other individual.

Of course, this could also explain how people receiving very different sensory inputs could arrive at similar states (e.g. pleasure=pleasure vs. pain=pleasure).
It seems to me that equivalent states don't equal equivalent consciousness; rather equivalent operators/variables from which the state is produced would have to be identical (as would all subsequent inputs to keep the variables synchronized).  That is, it is only possible for two different consciousnesses to be near-identical for a very small moment, but it is possible.

Hmm... It seems that I've made consciousness look like a really complex stream function (like an RC4 PRNG).

I agree.  My greatest advantage is my ability to deal with complexity.
 I just let all the information flow in and then decide whether its
useful or not.  My senses have always been more heightened than the
average person has, and so it was the logical step to use this ability
in the same way you describe.  I think the major difference in the way
that I process information is that it flows in, I dont have to pick
it out.

I think I can safely say my style of thinking is very different
without anyone disputing that claim.  I also started to find much more
detail in the world.  Its as simple as reading between the lines
theres so much to be found when you open your mind.  This doesnt
mean Ill accept any idea that comes along, but it does mean Ill
consider them.  And although many list members complain about having
their time wasted by pointless information, for me the rational
criticism of such information has become an instant reaction and does
not consume much time.

Its a great feeling.  For me the greatest achievement has been the
shear speed increase.  For instance, while programming I can solve
problems faster than I can type them  which can become very
frustrating.  The information flow out of my mind is much faster than
I can explain it by talking or writing.  And the amount of
multitasking I can achieve at any one time means I now work in a
decidedly non-linear fashion.

I can currently  visualise and control the flow of information in my
mind, control the creation of motivational/emotional links, and what I
can only describe as feel ideas forming.  The weirdest experiences
Ive had are having emotional reactions to *very* traumatic situations
which, when I paid attention to them, I found I could control just
as easily as any limb on my body.  This isnt suppressing emotion,
but understanding the route cause and controlling it.  As I said
before, finding these causes can take along time.  And as I briefly
mentioned, changing emotional/motivational constructs can be
dangerous.  I experience a brief period of intense negativity, which
can only be described as  the scenes in Millennium where you see
flashing of images of what the killer is planning for his victim. 
Walking down the road and seeing grotesque portraits of passers-by
isnt the greatest feeling in the world (although at the time it did
have a certain appeal.)

Exactly.

I actually have a method for the cognitive changes, which involves
searching your mind for different constructs, assessing them, and
changing them.  Changing them is the part I cant describe  Ive
become so use to altering my mind state that I cant describe the way
I actually do it.

Lately I havent been so active in these changes, but Im now
considering using some more aggressive techniques to invoke further
change.

BTW, if youre wondering what I changed when altering the
emotional/motivational part of my mind.  I tried to switch most of
them off, unfortunately we seem to keep the more negative ones deeper
set in our minds (perhaps due to suppression) and that is what I think
caused the problems (either that or Im a psychopath at heart.)  The
reason I wanted them switched off was because you get a greater
speed advantage when the safetys off!

Has anyone had the chance to read Michael Duff's rollicking dispatch
of string-theory in favor of M-theory in this month's SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN?  He cross-references a couple of articles from PHYSICS
TODAY, and I wish that he had written this article for that
publication, as he might have been able to go into longer and more 
connected explanations.  As it is, he skips from supersymmetry to 
11-dimensional calculations and leaps into p-branes with very little 
transitional text.  (Also in this month's PHYSICS TODAY:  several verbal 
2x4's regarding an omission from the September article on Lise 
Meitner).  

Still, you have to love a quote like this one:  'Indeed, future 
terrestial historians may judge the late 20th century as a time when 
theorists were like children playing on the seashore, diverting 
themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of 
superstrings while the great ocean of M-theory lay undiscovered 
before them.'

Sin,

I may be speaking against the extropian principle of "dynamic optimism"
but I
think "dynamic realism" would do the faithful better. No one can
honestly
deny the environmental devestation we have wrecked on the planet, the
many
species we have driven to extinction, global warming, pollution, and
cancer.
You can't shrug that off as being "doom and gloom". It's reality like it
or not.
And as I receall, even Simon didn't say destroying Nature was a good
thing.

Yep, it's always fun to pastiche Isaac Newton.

Sir Isaac also made a famous comment about the nano gray-goo catastrophe:
`O Diamond!  Diamond! thou little knowest the mischief done!'

(If you're wondering: a dog of that name `destroyed the almost finished
labours of some years'.)

Consensus--even unanymity--is not a scientific basis.  But in the
absense of real evidence, it's a moderately good substitute.  I'm
often willing to go with consensus-based "knowledge" if I think
it's not worth the effort to find real knowledge, but in this case
we're talking about something people get thrown in jail for.  I
think it's reasonable to demand clearer, quanititative, controlled,
non-anecdotal epistemologically satisfying evidence of harm and
clearer definitions of the behavior itself when dealing with crime.
As compassionate human beings, we must demand that the lives
destroyed by the law are absolutely necessary to prevent destroying
the lives of victims, and I see precious little proof of that.

The most we can say now, I think, is that most young girls who
engage in sex much earlier than the norm perceive it as a
negative experience; similarly, recent studies show that most
young boys perceive it as a positive one (80% if I recall).  If
that's the best we have, I might be comfortable looking upon an
older man having sex with a young girl with suspicion, but I'm
not sure I'd be willing to jail him; and I'd certainly be in no
hurry to jail older women like our dear Mary Kay.

I also realize you're not actively advocating that we jail these
people, just declining to mention them in your site, as is your
prerogative.  But I do think it is too important an issue for
us as Extropians, or as human beings, to blindly accept the status
quo.

                  C57BL/6J MICE LONGEVITY DATABASE
             (Updated by Doug Skrecky February 11, 1998)

   The following database lists the effect of various treatments on
average life span of C57 black jax 6 (C57BL/6J) mice. The percent change
in average life span is listed under the %CHANGE columns, relative to
either the CONTROL group used in an individual experiment, or relative to
the Longest Lived Control (LLC) group of all the experiments listed in
this database. The LLC group was one of the control groups from reference
20, which lived an average of 34.3 months. The START column shows the age
when treatment was begun. A ~ symbol means that a number was estimated.
   For animals that were calorically restricted, the amount of rat chow
below ab libitum they were allowed to consume is indicated by the number
before the word "chow". Thus -49% chow indicates that the animals were fed
49% less chow, than they would normally consume. Some experiments which
restricted calories by feeding animals only every other day did not
clearly indicate the extent of the reduction. This is indicated by "EOD"
chow. An interesting variant on caloric restriction is to be found in
reference 19. Here the animals were allowed to eat ad libitum of a chow
that was diluted by cellulose. Strictly speaking they were not
"restricted", since the caloric intake was reduced voluntarily.
   Some caloric restriction experiments fortified their chows so that
restricted animals did not consume less protein, vitamins, and minerals
than those fed ab libitum. This is indicated by the shorthand PR+, VIT+,
and MIN+. Thus -49% chow PR+ VIT+ MIN+ means that 49% less chow (and
calories) was consumed, but fortification with protein, vitamins, and
minerals eliminated any potential confounding effects of multiple
variations in the intake of these nutrients.

SPECULATION:

   An outstanding effort (reference 26) by a research group led by Akio
Koizumi has finally elucidated the primary mechanism for the life span
increases associated with caloric restriction in C57BL/6J mice. Unlike
humans who suffer greatly from the vissitudes associated with
cardiovascular disease, C57BL/6J mice die primarily of lymphoma cancer.
Also unlike humans, these mice readily experience torpor, especially when
calorically restricted. These reductions in body temperature can be
prevented by housing the mice at 30 C. Doing this virtually eliminates
both the anti-lymphoma effect of caloric restriction, and its associated
life span increases. Stated otherwise, it is body temperature that is the
key determinate of longevity in C57BL/6J mice. (Please note that in order
to equalize body weights the mice housed at 30 C had to have their food
ration slightly reduced: -66% versus -54%.)
   The life span of the control groups varies widely, with the LLC group
living longer than virtually all of the calorically restricted groups. It
is apparent that calories are not the only factor influencing torpor. I
speculate that small reductions in housing temperature while the animals
are asleep may promote torpor, independantly of caloric intake.
   It would be interesting to see the results of chemically blocking
cancer development in C57BL/6J mice, by adding powerful anticarcinogens
such as curcumin to mouse chow.

Is this a troll or what?  
(Actually, i believe the proper word is "trawl", but this misspelling seems
common.)

I could have turned on CNN and heard what you just wrote.  You are spouting
the party line of the concensus-based "science" of the general public.
Your "devastation" has very marginal validity when evaluated rationally
(and these issues have generally been discussed in great deal on this
list).  I hope for your sake that you have a great deal of evidence to back
up your claims of this omnipresent "doom and gloom", because few people on
this list will accept it on your word or the concensus of the general
population.

> a world without privacy would show true equality amongst society.  

Equality amongst society sounds impossible to me. Society places value on 
certain skills and talents some people are going to fall outside what 
society sees as good and thus inequal amoung society. Perhaps a world 
without privacy and society would show all as equal. 

> Nothing to hide is nothing to save from the enemy. therefor all people 
> would be as one.  

In my opinion this can't be so. No privacy means our most base fears and 
prejudices are laid out for all too see. The distinctions between groups 
be it religious, racial, weight based or any one of the host of things 
that divide society now would grow if the fear and negativity was shown 
in its true form making the divisons larger. The potential is great but 
humankind would only use the power for their destruction.

Although I agree with your overall outlook James, can anyone argue that 
we have had a *gain* in biodiversity?  Over the years I've looked pretty 
hard for evidence in the literature of any new species coming into 
existence in the past 100 years. As far as I know, there is none. There 
is plenty of evidence of species lost on the other hand.

Now weather this species loss is a good or bad thing is another question 
entirely.  There is plenty of evidence to show massive species lost in 
the past, yet life has kept going anyway.  The question here is, will 
the present species loss put our own lives in jeapordy?  Probably not, 
assuming any of the major nanotechnologies come to fruition in a 
reasonable time..

We're discussing bootstrapping routes to machine-phase, right?  If yes,
then it is difficult to see how such relatively flabby systems can be of
any assistance. An engineered enzyme to generate (cagey) pieces of a
macromolecular complex, yes. Heavily crosslinked, stiff protein capable of
surviving at UHV conditions, yes. 

The only other possibility for this I can see is crude scaffolding. What
is it really meant for? Can you describe the outline of your pathway?

Your asking a question that is purely based on theory and can never 
really be answered.  Your asking if you want the golden egg or the goose 
that will ay it.  The answer is indefinate.  There is no possible way 
all privacy will ever be taken away due to our society and how we've 
been taught to keep things from people in order to strive.  True 
survival is through competition, which lies apon secrecy

IMO, it's a problem with death in general, not cryonics. The
really sad thing is that Julian's permanent death (assuming he
wasn't frozen), and that of so many others (like Leary) is so
completely unnecessary. Who's next?

	Amen.  It's constant agony knowing so many people are not
signed up and will therefore soon be dead.

	Julian has been one of my recent heros.  I remember Jarold K.
O'Neal being a hero back in my high school days.  Then one day I found
out he died.  It broke my heart.  Does anyone know if he was
preserved?

	For that matter, is there a list, somewhere of who has been
preserved?  I know this is non disclosed information from the cryo
companies, but surely there are many people which have made their
preservation public knowledge.  It would be nice to know who is on the
list of publicly know preserved people.  It seems like a cryonics FAQ
should contain such information about people who don't mind letting
others know they were preserved (or signed up to be preserved).

Yes. I'm absolutely certain we're Turing Machines, in fact, I'm not only

It wouldn't matter what the true history of the two brains were or if the 
path leading up to the merger were different, if they're in the same state 
now then they must have exactly the same memories too. And the two brains 
would remain in identical states forever, unless random factors intervene, 
but I don't think randomness has much to do with consciousness.

For me to know exactly what it's like to be you you'd have to change my brain 
into an identical copy of yours, but even then it wouldn't work because the 
person experiencing the consciousness wouldn't be me it would be you. 
James Rogers is not a thing that's conscious, James Rogers IS consciousness, 
thus I can never experience your consciousness because if I could I wouldn't  
be John Clark any longer, I'd be you by definition, so John Clark still would 
not know what it's like to be James Rogers.

In a cryptographic function a small change in input leads to a huge change  
in output, consciousness can't be that sensitive or we'd be undergoing 
violent mood swings every second.

 While this index was originally developed by the mathematician John Baez to
apply specifically to individuals with wild extapolations (or just plain
abandonement) of generally accepted theories in physics, I think several of its
provisions could be taken to heart on this list.


   THE CRACKPOT INDEX
      A simple method for rating potentially
      revolutionary contributions to physics.

1) A -5 point starting credit.
2) 1 point for every statement that is widely agreed on to be false.
3) 2 points for every statement that is clearly vacuous.
4) 3 points for every statement that is logically inconsistent.
5) 5 points for each such statement that is adhered to despite careful
correction.
6) 5 points for using a thought experiment that contradicts the results
of a widely accepted real experiment.
7) 5 points for each word in all capital letters (except for those
with defective keyboards).
8) 10 points for each claim that quantum mechanics is fundamentally
misguided (without good evidence).
9) 10 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Einstein, or
claim that special or general relativity are fundamentally misguided
(without good evidence).
10) 10 points for pointing out that one has gone to school, as if this
were evidence of sanity.
11) 20 points for suggesting that you deserve a Nobel prize.
12) 20 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Newton or
claim that classical mechanics is fundamentally misguided (without
evidence).
13) 20 points for every use of science fiction works or myths as if
they were fact.
14) 20 points for defending yourself by bringing up (real or imagined)
ridicule accorded to ones past theories.
15) 30 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Galileo,
claims that the Inquisition is hard at work on ones case, etc..
16) 30 points for claiming that when ones theory is finally appreciated,
present-day science will be seen as the sham it truly is.
17) 30 points for claiming that the "scientific establishment" is
engaged in a "conspiracy" to prevent ones work from gaining its
well-deserved fame, or suchlike.
18) 40 points for claiming one has a revolutionary theory but
giving no concrete testable predictions.

Yes, of course.  But before I arranged for cryonic suspension, I 
considered this a normal and natural fate that I would one day share. 
Now, knowing that more could have been done and wasn't makes these 
events all the more painful.

Dr. O'Neil was one my heroes as well, and sadly he was not preserved. 
Niether were Gene Roddenberry or Timothy Leary (biggest surprise of 
all).  All of them  had their ashes flown into space.

There was some discussion on this list awhile back  about why people who 
promoted extropian ideas including  immortality, succumbed to entropy in 
the end.

Actually, I do agree that extinction is happening.  However, most of the organisms marked as extinct (large higher organisms), don't seem to be terribly missed by the environment as a whole.  The disappearance of your arbitrary large animal appears to have little or no impact on the environment.  Beyond any aesthetic reasons, what serious disasters have been caused by the absence of the carrier pigeon or dodo bird?  I have the suspicion that most plants and insects would barely miss the absence of the majority of higher organisms.  I am not advocating the purposeful extinction of any animal, but I question the real impact of doing so.

SOMERS, N.Y., (Feb 13) - International Business Machines Corp. said
Friday it signed an $85 million contract to build the world's
fastest supercomputer.

The computer giant said it won the contract from the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
located in Livermore, Calif.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Federico Pena announced the contract
Thursday in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington.

The IBM RS/6000 SP, the technology behind Deep Blue's successful
challenge of chess grand master Garry Kasparov, will be capable of
10 trillion calculations per second upon its installation at
Livermore in the year 2000.

The computer, when complete, will be capable of calculating in a
single second what would take 10 million years using a hand-held
calculator.

The contract, announced under the DOE's Accelerated Strategic
Computing Initiative (ASCI), is the third IBM award in a program
designed to build systems capable of tera-scale (trillion
calculations-per-second) computing,

HREF="http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/resource/pressreleases/1998/Feb/d
oe.html"> IBM said.

These systems will enable the DOE to conduct complex modeling and
simulation to ensure the safety and reliability of the nation's
nuclear stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing.

This new technology will also offer the DOE an eight-fold increase
in simulation detail compared to what is available today.

''Banks, retailers, insurers, manufacturers, health care, and
communications providers are among the industries that stand to
benefit from technological advances resulting from ASCI,'' the
company said in a statement.

You are right that Julian Simon never said that destroying nature was a good 
thing, but who is saying that?

Julian Simon was a man who was always concerned about the facts. He never denied 
things that were true and he never denied the negative things humans have done 
(like pollution and killing off some species), but he always pointed out that, in 
general and in almost all specifics, things are getting better for human beings.

The facts are that life expectency is increasing, death rates are decreasing, 
poverty is decreasing, standards of living are increasing, birth rates are 
decreasing, prices of resources are decreasing, the forested areas of the U.S. 
are increasing, air quality is improving, etc., etc. Of course, there are 
problems, but the trends are encouraging across the board. That is reality.

In contrast, Paul Ehrlich continually insists doomsday is just around the corner 
unless we adopt all sorts of authoritarian government controls. When his 
predictions don't come true (and he has made so many bad predictions that he 
makes the Psychic Hotline look good!), he moves back the date of doomsday or he 
claims that he helped avert the catastrophe.

Why canÕt I call my broker today and tell him to sell 100 shares in my
future income stream? Economics tells us the problem is information and
incentives. Potential investors in my human capital donÕt have enough
information about my potential income, and it is too costly to monitor my
activities to make sure that I will work hard and pay the dividends on
time and in full.

As tracking, communication, and monitoring technologies continue to
develop, these problems may be overcome and a human capital market
develop. People would be interested to sell their human capital to
diversify their investment portfolio or because they have a high discount
rate for the future. While this should make the economy more efficient and
everyone better off, it could also increase the inequality of wealth in
society. One reason the level of inequality in our society now is not
higher is that the government subsides and forces self-investment in the
form of education, and the market does not allow people to sell off that
investment. If people are able to sell their human capital, then some
might be tempted to trade an expensive lifestyle now for poverty in the
future. (In some sense they can already do that with credit cards, but an
efficient human capital market would allow them to do it to a much greater
extent.)

One reason extropians might be interested in the development of a human
capital market, besides that it give people choices they didnÕt have
before, is that it may allow greater investment in human capital in a
scenario where this is especially risky. For example, suppose people
expect that there is an even chance of cheap AIs developing in the next
ten years. If that happens they will lose a lot of their income potential
as the AIs compete with humans in the labor market. If a human capital
market did not exist, this would lead people to substantially reduce
education and other forms of human capital investment in order to
diversify into (say) AI company stocks or physical resources. A human
capital market would allow the level of human capital investment to stay
at more efficient levels (although it would still be lower than if there
was no chance of AIs developing).

Others have responded to your misunderstanding of Julian Simon. On "Dynamic
Optimism" -- if you read my essay, you should understand that "dynamic
realism" is unnecessary since DO does not ask anyone to deny reality.
Optimism is not simply a neutral assessment of probability, but an attitude
and a commitment. Making a commitment to improve things also alters the
odds. Once you understand this, you should withdraw the unjustified slur
that you made by using the term "faithful". Faith doesn't mix at all with
pancritical rationalism.

Julian Simon enters the ranks of those terrible losses among whom I would
include recently Carl Sagan. I had discussed life extension and cryonics
with Julian a couple of times. In one of his letters he signed off with the
name "Senior Junior", having some fun in the spirit of adopting Extropian
names. When I talked to him by phone and asked about this, he confirmed my
interpretation that it implied he was old by traditional standards but
young by Extropian standards.

Despite this indication that he might be becoming sympathetic to life
extension, he always resisted the desirability of living longer. I wonder
whether it was due to being tired of a long struggle with depression. If
you read his book "Good Mood" you will learn that he has fought depression
for a long time. The impression I got was that he didn't take medication
for it, instead entirely relying on psychological approaches to controlling
it. This is only speculation, but I suspect that his struggle may have
blunted an interest in life extension that might otherwise have blossomed.
Certainly he was sympathetic to extropian thinking and expected the future
to be better than the past.

What can we do to try to prevent death from claiming many more of our
intellectual pioneers?

Julian Simon will always exist in my thoughts, but I wish that wasn't all.

I'm more concerned at the impact of human-introduced ecological changes
with vast unintended multipliers, like the appearance 200 years ago in
Australia of alien flocks and herds with hoofs that shockingly damage
delicate soils.  Native animals that evolved here have large soft cuddly
footsies.  So now the largest island on the planet is being ruined at
breakneck speed by erosion, salination and other horrid anthropogenic
impacts.  (Not to mention the well-known bunny problem, as they breed and
eat like... rabbits, and seem to enjoy calicivirus sprinkled on their
breakfast.)  Maybe Promethean technology will be able to reverse this
devastation, but meanwhile...

Well, shucks, I suppose in the spirit of fair play I should now do
likewise.  I don't have a site of my own, but there's a strange pic of me
doing my Shakespeare impersonation stuck on an article at

http://odyssey.apana.org.au/~terminus/iq-15.html

Of course that was a couple of years back, so I was still a mere lad of 52

You got me. I should have said "The human body has not evolved, etc."

Why are Bill and/or Hillary obligated to tell us the truth about their
private sexual lives? If they want to put on some charade for the
public, what of it? Someone once said that hypocrisy is the tribute vice
pays to virtue. My personal opinion is that the Clintons should just
respond to any questions of a sexual nature with "That's none of your
business."

<< but I  think "dynamic realism" would do the faithful better.>>

I resent this.

  For a number of reasons.  To begin with the word "faithful" implies some
kind of liberal slavish devotion to the party line.  Or a relegious fervor.  I
try to avoid both cases andattempt to  view facts logically and make a
decesion so based.  

Secondly.  Why tie it to the death of Julian Simon?  Some people are sad (I
among them) that he is gone.  It is an innappropriate time to trot out your
relegious liberal dogma.

Thirdly.  Such tripe shows that you have not read any of his works.  Julian
Simon was noted for drawing conclusions from FACTS.  Anything and Everything
he said he had document to the hilt.  Unlike the liberals he DID let mere
facts get in the way of a "warm and fuzzy" dogma.


To reply to your rant:

 <No one can honestly deny the environmental devestation we have wrecked on
the planet, 

I can ...and do.  as many on the list are aware...I travel extensively.  In
excess of a hundred thousand miles a year.  Not air miles either.  "Up close
and personal...on the ground"....I see no evidence of the oft touted
"enviromental devastation". 

Dixie Lee Rhea (former director of the Atomic Energy Commission) wrote two
books on this subject. The title of one is "Trashing the Planet" in which she
documents some of this silliness.

<the many species we have driven to extinction, >

species have a finite lifespan...perhaps you are blaming "us" ( I don't recall
driving a species to extinction personally...) for something that occurs
naturally.

<global warming,>

a political issue....based upon computer models that, given all relevant data,
cannot even accurately predict the PAST. In other words they don't even have
20/20 hindsight.  Physical data suggests that golobal cooling is more likely. 

 <pollution,>

One species pollution is another species "natural resource"...once again I
commend to you the works of the man you degrade.

 <and cancer.>  

That's pretty much of a leap of faith on your part.  IMHO cancer is as natural
as bad breath.  There is evidence to suggest that it has always been
around...and that it becomes more probable  with age.  We live longer now so
the "degenerative " diseases are more noticed.

<You can't shrug that off as being "doom and gloom".>

I can...and do.  Read Julian Simon's "Wired" article.

< It's reality like it or not.>

It is NOT !


 <<And as I receall, even Simon didn't say destroying Nature was a good
 thing. >>

At least you got that part right.


And along the same vein Paul Hughes commented.

<Although I agree with your overall outlook James, can anyone argue that 
we have had a *gain* in biodiversity?  Over the years I've looked pretty 
hard for evidence in the literature of any new species coming into 
existence in the past 100 years. As far as I know, there is none. There 
is plenty of evidence of species lost on the other hand.>

The "coming into existence" of a new species is a gradual thing.  Its
extinction is an abrupt one.

To expound.  Suppose that an accelerated breeding process is undertaken to
develope a new breed of dog.  The Doberman Pincher for example.  Over the
years it  becomes somewhat distinct from it's forebears.  .... BUT in the
short time that we've been paying attention to such things the difference is
NOT such that a new species is differentiated.  Perhaps in another ten or
twenty thousand years the Doberman Pincher (if the bloodline is kept "pure")
would become a distinct species as opposed to merely a distinct "breed" as
now.  

I suspect that the same concept applies to all species differentiation.
We've not had enough observational time to distinguish a "breed" from a
"species".  So naturally we'd not notice a new arrival.  

But I also suspect that there are many, many potential canidates waiting in
the wings...look at all the different varieties of various domestic animals.
(horses: Arabians, Clydesdales, shetlands.....cows: Holsteins, Brahma,
Hereford....Goats:Nubian, Angora.....Dogs: chihuahua, Great Dane....etc. etc.
etc.

On second thought...perhaps we ARE seeing new species. (Consider the use of
the word  "species" as used in the "Endangered Species Act"..I.e. two
varieties of kangaroo mouse (or bird..or water spider)  are considered
different species) Take the above mentioned examples.  Consider a Yorkshire
Terrier and a St. Bernard.  Or a Boston Terrier and a Mastiff.   Now think
about a German Shepard and a Timber Wolf.  The Shepard and the Wolf are
considered different species are they not?  But they are observationally more
similar than the dogs.  AND wolves and shepards can interbreed....whereas a
Yorkie and a Great Dane cannot.(True...they could be HELPED to
interbreed...testtube puppies?...but left to their own devices it can't
happen....I've seen it. At one time I owned a 200 lb Great Dane Female and a
11 lb Boston Terrier Male.....A VERY frusturated Boston Terrier)

Perhaps we're seeing new species and just not calling them that.

I could have sworn that there was a correction plate that could be called a
"lens" in that system of optics. Perhaps I was mistaken.

Human capital markets are (if I understand what you mean) possibly in
resurgence.

I'm really enthusiastic about the idea. Grameen Banks could be set up in
other parts of the word--Peru? Chiapas?

Currently, I'm facing the following problem:
Problem is that it can look like indenturement and indenturement can look
like slavery.

Let's talk more about this.

I disagree.

It is designed. I am designing my body right now. Many other people are
designing theirs, including bodysculptors.

Oh. I see; you mean the human body in general has no design. That means
that there is no detectable difference from the human body and everything
in the universe that is not the human body? No detectable structure?

Oh. I see. You mean you don't believe in a Creator; therefore there can be
no design in anything that occurs naturally. Hmm. Could you please point to
something you can find that is unnatural?

Oh. I see. You think anyone who uses the word "design" to refer to anything
that did not take the conscious effort of some human is a (perhaps closet)
Creationist/Deist/Teleological BAD PERSON, and NEEEDS to have the faith
reinstated, or a kick in the behind.

Well then, you're just plain wrong, that's all. No way I can argue with that.

:) :) :) :)

MMB

My view: Design can and does exist without a designer. A watchmaker being
blind is still a watchmaker. The blind watchmaker is the whole universe and
its laws. It designs everything. (in effect and appearance). Slooooooowly.
:) Then we come along. But we are part of it, so there's no paradox, no
need for your fuzzy headed Humans versus universe dualism. :) QED.

A friend of mine was flipping through one of my Extropy magazines, and
noticed a review of a book with a title something like "The Six Principles
of Self Esteem."  He is interested in a reading a book on the subject...
are there any suggestions as to which book (including this one) is the best
on the subject?

Thanks a lot,

Geoff.

(PO) One word:

Habit.

Observe and consider: These were all OLD GUYS (emphasis mine but kind: I'm
showing some pesky biomarkers myself). Failure of nerve becomes a habit for
most people as they grow older, and so does accommodating parts of your own
body and mind shutting down; furthermore, if you are suffering from a
wasting disease, you become habituated to the treatment given to you by the
available caregivers of today and you forget to remember that better is
possible; so you opt out. Organic disthymia is of course a contributing
factor--those sufferers become habituated to that neurosomatic state,
regardless of age.

MMB

PS: EVERY/ANYBODY: Please poke holes in this--I think I'm right but I want
a spirited discussion to ferret out my thinking's limitations.

A tape of indeterminate length is good enough, a Turing machine would only 
need an infinite tape if it was to perform an infinite number of calculations. 
That's not allowed in most models because the tape or the head would have to 
move at infinite speed, but more important, the resulting hypothetical 
machine would be able to do virtually anything and so render it almost 
useless in helping us understand how real computation works, and that's the 
reason Turing invented his machine in the first place.

Hmmmmm.   That tells me something about your attitude toward a free market
economic system.

Bill and Hillary were selling a product.  Themselves.  They laid out a set of
specifications during the campaign.  They attested that it was true.  They DID
NOT says..."That's none of your business"....

Now suppose you decide to buy something trivial...say a pizza.

The meat looks a little funny....and you ask about it...and are told "That's
none of your business"....are you going to buy the pizza?

Is the presidency more trivial than a pizza?

I just happen to have a case or two of meat I picked up off this bull hauler
friend of mine a few months ago.  Since it's "none of your business" what
condition it is in I'm sure you'd just love to take it off my hands
j....cheap..

Or...if youre a vegitarian...that's ok...I was really lying about it being
meat.  It's really soyburgers....

Thank you for the information about Julian Simon, Max.  I get the
impression that he did at least think about cryonics.  I met him many
years ago at some post-lecture cocktail thing, and he was in a
charming mood, making little bon mots about a variety of topics,
when someone asked him 'hey, what about that cryonics thing?' He
stopped for a long moment, and his eyes got serious--I thought he
was going to say something.  Then he turned to me, winked, and
changed the subject.  

The aspect of this situation that saddens me is last month's study
results that indicate that persons suffering from untreated
depression are up to 40% more prone to heart attack.  It's not just
a mental problem--it has serious effects on the body as well.  His
life could have been prolonged if only he had sought proper
treatment. 

sin,

Kathryn Aegis

My novel HOST for which I had much deeply appreciated help from several
people and organisations involved in the fields of cryonics and life
extension, has been made into a 3-hour television movie, premiering on ABC
network across the USA on Thursday, February 26th, under the title of
VIRTUAL OBSESSION.  ABC are giving it their entire prime time viewing for
that evening.

Scripted by Preston Sturges Jnr and Mick Garris, directed by Mick Garris
(The Shining and The Stand) it stars Peter Gallagher, Mimi Rogers,
Bridgette Wilson (I Know What You Did Last Summer)  Robert Vaughan (The Man
>From UNCLE) and Jake Lloyd, a terrific child actor who has a major role in
the forthcoming Star Wars film.

The novel is about a scientist's search for immortality thru cryonics and
thru artificial intelligence.  I'm over the moon with the film adaption -
it has been stunningly made and is deeply faithful to the theme I wanted to
address in the novel, that living forever is going to become a reality.

I hope everyone who watches enjoys it, and I would welcome comments.

Hit delete if you've read this before.

But there's a deeper meaning here, not just about these tactics but about

> On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview
> to the IEEE's 'Computer' magazine..
>
> Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective
> view of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language
> he created.
>
> By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had
> bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its
> contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of these
> things, there was a leak..
>
> Here is a complete transcript of what was was said, unedited, and
> unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews..
>
> You will find it interesting....

> Interviewer:  Problem?

It depends on whether you only look at genetic diversity. As humans have
opened the memetic ecology to rapid evolution, there has been a modern
'Cambrian Explosion' in the memetic diversity in the past few decades that
has inversely matched the decreases in genetic diversity. Additionally, I
think that you are talking only about 'naturally' evolved species emerging.
There have been hundreds of new species developed in genetic engineering
labs around the world in the past ten years. We now have agricultural
species which are resistant to pests and frost due to genetic splicing, we
have thousands of new species of bacteria that have been specifically
'evolved' in the laboratory for the manufacture of drugs and other products.
Likewise, we have many new species of lab animals of all sorts, from pigs to
mice, that are new species.

I think that the state of the world ecology was like that of an old growth
forest: chock full of diversity, but with no evolutionary niches left to
fill, so no new species have evolved. As evolution is an extremely slow
process, the gaps we create with our environmental stresses probably won't
be filled for at the very least several hundred, if not several thousand
years, unless we develop something to occupy that niche, or use genetic
engineering to reestablish a viable population of the original species,
though possibly altered to be more resistant to environmental stress, or to
bring in an existing psecies from elsewhere that can better survive in that
locale than the original niche inhabitants.

In the past few days someone(s) posted about how they experienced changes
in their personal living processes. As I recall they spoke of becoming more
sensory aware.

In a frantic search for more disk space I purged my email yesterday and did
not get to re-read the above mentioned post. Would someone please forward
that (those) messages to me please.

Thank you,

Roy Roberts

Congratulations!  I am so very pleased and so very excited about this!  I
loved your book, found it a riviting page-turner and look forward to seeing
such a line-up of well known actors portraying the parts of your characters.

There is a difference between design and modification.  If I take my
car to a shop and have it painted a new color or change the muffler I
can make no claim to the design of the car.  When you can "design"
yourself another liver come and talk to me...

Oh.  I see.  You want to play silly word games.  To create new
meanings for words to fit your need for an argument.  You think that
just because the definition of the word "design" in the context it is
being used here requires a designer (e.g. "conscious effort" to
attain a predetermined goal) there is no reason that you cannot make
up a new definition and then attack the original argument for not
using your new definition.

Jim:

Not word games, not "my need for an argument"--real philosophy that you may
not have considered thoroughly. Sorry to have been perceived that way. 

OK, I'll go for a counterexample--bear with me, here, and I'll avoid any
trace of irony. You have my word.

Do you know what a "Rattleback" is? It's a kid's toy. Edmund's sells them,
you can get them at the Exploratorium gift shop, etc.

It is based on (fundamentally identical to) the shape of certain water-worn
stones. It has the curious physical property that when you set it on a flat
surface, it has a preferred direction of spin.

Nature did the work of shaping the stones. Humans noticed the curious
behavior.

OK, now you tell me: 1) Who designed the rattleback toy? 2) Where did the
design come from?

One counterexample is all it takes. :) I believe this shows that a blind
watchmaker still makes watches. Please poke substantive holes in this
reasoning--if you do so, you will help me to learn to think better.

No, you miss my point--I have a high level list of things I want my body to
be able to do. I lack the technology to implement my design--but that
doesn't mean I'm not doing design.

No, see above. The question of where design comes from really matters to
me. I avoid cheap thinking on the subject. I should probably have prefixed
my comments with (po), but you may not know what that word means either. :)

Peace, Jim: I was playing, but seriously--sorry if my litany was
interpreted as me ragging on you.

Yes, of course I am talking only of genetic diversity - the very stuff 
which you and I *still* depend on to breath and eat.  Memetic diversity 
won't help us here until or unless it helps acheive the 'assembler' 
breakthrough..  Like I said earlier, we may escape the ecoloical 
instability through advance nanotechnology - either as a way to repair 
the damage we've done and/or to escape our biological ties altogether - 
in which case environmental destruction probably becomes irrelevant to 
our future survival.

You make a good point here.  Keep in mind that an ecosystem as simple as 
a praire took thousands of years to evolve through a pregressive series 
of co-evolutinary and collaborative processes - soomething which may be 
next to impossible to replicate in a few short years.

DISCALAIMER:  In the end, the Earth doesn't need saving.  The biosphere 
has proven itself to continue despite several ecological upsets and 
massive species losses.  The question remains, will humanity reach the 
level of technolgical self-suffiency (i.e nanotech) before any sort of 
possible ecological collapse takes place?

EXTROPY magazine has passed beyond its physical form, now having uploaded
and become... Extropy Online (EO)!

Extropy Online, like the original Extropy, will cover a wide,
cross-disciplinary range of topics, including anything that involves
rational, scientific, and technological approaches to overcoming human
limits. This includes:

	Artificial intelligence, neural-computer interfacing, and uploading
	Applications and implications of molecular nanotechnology
	Ethical issues of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and AI
	Life extension & cryonics (theoretical and practical)
	Effective thinking and information filtering
	Probing the ultimate limits of physics
	Extropian-transhumanist philosophy
	Extropic and transhumanist art
	Self-transformative psychology
	The economics of the future
	Experimental communities
	Understanding the future
	The future of sexuality
	Spontaneous orders
	Memetics

	Please take a look at the new articles and reviews. We will be adding new
material regularly, no longer being confined to distinct issues. We will
also add back issue material from the print version to the archives.

I'd like to thank the Editorial Team for getting the material together (as
well as what is still in the works). See the Staff page for the current
editorial team. Special thanks to Derek Strong, ExI's webmaster and layout
editor. Natasha Vita More gave major input on the pages and contributed
graphically.

If you have an idea for an article or review, please let me know.

Feel free to pass on this announcement to any lists or individuals that may
be interested.

Actually genetic diversity has rather little to do with what you
breathe and eat.  What you eat almost certainly comes from farms,
and they don't need genetic diversity to operate.  Maintaining
diversity would probably permit improvements to farming in the
future, but it's not necessary.  The oxygen you breathe effectively
comes from whatever plants fixed the carbon in the food you eat
- in other words, the same farm plants.

The other chemical cycles on this planet like the nitrogen and
sulfur cycles are run by bacteria, and they're doing fine.
The ongoing loss of genetic diversity is quite the catastophe
for non-domesticated life, but for humans and their symbiotes
it's done no significant harm as yet.  Even the total conversion
of Planet Earth to Farm Earth would only be a moderate and 
manageable problem.

Your statement strikes me as naive.  Our understanding of the complex 
web of interconnections between food chains is limited at best. It may 
turn out that there is no connection.  Howerver, our you willing to risk 
your survival on a hunch there is no connection between biodiversity and 
the *sustainability* of farming?

First, the so-called green revolution that we have had over the last 30 
years has come at a cost - the depletion of top soil.  Nitrogen 
fertilizers have helped us grow more food, but have also accelerated the 
rate at which that same land can't grow again without the introduction 
of ever greater and more potent fertilizers.  It doesn't take a genius 
to realize that this trend can't continue forever - there is only so 
much nitrogen one can add to the soil.  What is missing is the rich and 
biodiverse topsoil that must be sustained by adding to the soil exactly 
what is taken away (i.e. compost).  Suprisingly very few farmers 
actually practice this type of composting.

Secondly, the use of pesticides is a war that is slowly being lost.  
What is missing is a complex understanding of the *biodiversity* among 
the insect community that is essential for the pollination of countless 
species of edible plants.  Sustainable farmers have realized this and 
have taken great measures to eliminate pesticides; and instead foster 
the growth of certain populatons of insects who are vital to either 
pollination or as predators to those insects who find the crops 
delicious.

My point is this:  the connections between most species we have studied 
are sublte yet profound (i.e. if one species goes, so do others.)  I do 
not know of any connection between say a peruvian beatle and the human 
community.  But my ignorance of this, is no reason to gamble on their 
not being one.  As an extropian I want to expand myself *indefinitley*.  
So until I have a better undertanding of the complex web of 
interconnections that is this bioshpere, I am not going to rush out and 
kill some species that may turn out to be essential later for my long 
term survival.

Besides, the destructiion of biodiversity is not a very extropian thing 
to do as it is a net decrease in overall complexity.  Isn't extropianism 
about increasing complexity?

Paul:

Permit me to amplify with an illustration from bionics and the current push
for small (Cretaceous-period dragonfly sized and smaller) aerial platforms...

When every distinguishable element of a (system) (organism) has at least
two functions (ex.: frame stiffening, vertical tail surface, antenna all in
one), the butterfly effect is loose.

I'm rather concerned about the "race to the bottom" WRT the oceanic food
web. I've noticed that Roy and Lisa Walford's excellent book on tasty CRAN
cooking has more than one recipe that includes fish that are climax
predators or close to it: swordfish, tuna, cod, and my favorite
embarrassment, orange roughy--ehic was discovered off New Zealand just a
short time ago and has been heavily fished since then.

Oh, the embarrassment part? There are reports that marine biologists have
determined that orange roughy probably take 25 to 35 years to become
sexually mature, and may have lifespans in the wild of 125 years.

Oops.

Time to farm fish and let the wild oceans have a breathing spell, methinks.

This is beginning to be alleviated. For thousands of years, humans have
supported their agricultural habit by using their own excrement for
fertilizer along with that of their cows and horses and pigs. This practice
ended early in this century with the Progressives pushing through the FDA
acts which made such use of human waste illegal. Since that time, the
topsoil in this country has steadily declined.

However, in Texas and a few other places, this is beginning to be reversed.
Biosolids (class B types, not the toxic class C) from New York City ("NEW
YORK CITY?" the Texans decry....) are being shipped to a few towns in Texas
and being spread over the land. The land is fully capable of handling as
much agriculture as we want if we put back our wastes.... This is not being
done, instead it is being drained into the oceans.

No one here advocates purposely destroying species, but if one cannot
compete, then it must either be altered or replaced. maybe an endangered
species' niche is no longer needed (like many North American predators), or
it cannot live by more than a fragile existence. If we are to support the
laws of nature, of which evolution and survival of the fittest are the
paramount ones, then we must not make undue efforts to sustain species which
cannot survive on their own. In this we are extending our own failed welfare
policies to the natural kingdom.

Its also about improvement. If a species cannot cut it, then it either needs
to be improved or allowed to die out if it cannot, to be replaced with
another than can compete.

With the arrival of full-blown nanotech, AI, uploading and the like the ecosystem
of earth will no longer be significant to our survival. In fact, worsening
environmental
conditions might actually have a positive effect by bringing the singularity nearer.
In emergency situations, there is often more progress than usual, just look at the
Ice Age(s), the two World Wars and the Cold War. Ok, it's a gamble, but a rational
one.

I don't know whether or not it is extropian, but from a "common sense"
point of view more complexity certainly isn't *always* good. IMO, the most
important things are to survive and thrive. To achieve this, sometimes one
has to increase complexity (to make certain plants more productive, for example), 
and sometimes decrease it (like when wiping out a disease/other threat). More 
complexity = good is just a pointless dogma. Your well-being is the ultimate
goal, everything else is just a tool. Really.

I'm not sure that is the main reason, but it most likely contributes

[ I remember reading about the fertilizer trade in Stockholm during the
ninteenth century. The waste was transported to two small islands
outside of the harbor, where farmers bought it. The piles from
different parts of the city were differently priced; the waste from
the poorer southern parts were much better since it didn't contain so
much toilet paper... :-) ]

More seriously, an idea: we have problems with nutrient drainage into
the oceans, which upsets local ecosystems, causes algae blooms and
anaerobic sea bottoms. Are there some useful process to extract the
nutrient from the over-fed water? For example, a large part of the
bottoms of the Baltic Sea is utterly devoid of life except possibly
sulphur bacteria. Would it be possible to economically use the
sea-sludge for fertilizer?

This depends on your goals and values. If you value the *ecosystem* as
a whole, then there is no point in preserving non-competitve
species. But if you value the individual species and the information
they contains, then it makes a lot of sense. After all, many people
still value information and objects that have long since lost their
relevance to ordinary life or competitiveness on the market (like
veteran cars, many books, antiques and historical archives). 

Maybe there will one day be a market for antique ecosystems?

With respect, _my_ well being is not my ultimate goal. I have loftier
aspirations. I'd rather uplift the whole race than beat them to the finish
line. :)

Also, your argument about crisis driving solutions is indeed a
characteristic of human action patterns. I suggest it support's de Bono's
rubric that "the primary purpose of thinking [in terms of the mass of
humanity--MMB] is to abolish thinking [and get back to the comfort zone
ASAP--MMB]".

Trotsky and many terrorcrats agree. That doesn't make you wrong, but it
does mean that you should take a close look at who your eschatological
bedfellows are.

Me, I plan to develop the field of _Elective_ Eschatology. :)

Further comments follow.

Very well: I declare that my well-being is influenced positively by
increased diversity in my environment. Prove to me that I err. :)

I would argue that everything else is *not* a tool--it is _raw materials_;
but some of it is reserves, and some of those are raw material for
experiences that I can't have if it is destroyed (the Grand Canyon, Mount
Fuji, Jack Russell Terrier puppies, pet ferrets, potential lovers,
Barringer Meteor Crater, my wonderful nieces and nephews, etc. etc.).

If everything else is a tool, then all you are is a user.

Go ahead, prove I'm wrong. :)

Peace,

MMB

We can grow virtually any crop plant hydroponically - with nothing
but water, nitrates, and a couple specific salts.  We do indeed 
know that the plants we depend on do great in the compete absence
of any biodiversity and external biochemistry.

No, it's not that yields are dropping or are going to drop, it's
that to maintain the yields we have to keep dumping in nitrogen.
In some circumstances, our yield are approaching economic maximum
in that adding more nitrogen won't help any.  But current nitrogen
additions will keep crop yields going indefinitely, from the 
fertilizer side.  The main potential problem right now is salinization,
which biodiversity won't help with.

No, it's more about increasing value (in the abstract, not the 
economic sense).  Complexity may or may not be a good thing.

If your claim is that maintaining biodiversity is a good thing, I've
no disagreement with that.  But it's not *necessary* for our 
continued existance as a complex, interesting, populous community.

Anyone who voted for or against Bill Clinton based on his personal sexual
life is severely misunderstanding the purpose of the office of president.
I don't know why some factions want to force the office to be a shining
example of American Normalcy.  If you want a moral example, go to your
local religious establishment of your choice.  Leave moral and sexual
control out of the Government.

After you've made it safely to the finish line you can still uplift the rest,
*if you so desire*. Acts of benevolence are rooted in self-interest because
they make you feel good and/or are an investment (what comes around goes
around). Nothing wrong with that, btw, the ones you help still get the same
benefit. Btw, isn't "enlightened self-interest" (egoism with foresight ;) one of
the extropian values?

Well, if some people with bad reputations agree, so be it. I don't condone some
of the other beliefs of the likes of Trotsky, but I *am* interested in the way
things
are, no matter how sad or disgusting the truth is. If Stalin says "blood is red" I'm
not going to disagree just because I don't like him as a person.

This statement doesn't contradict any of my claims, so I don't see
any point in investigating your true feelings ;) Your highest goal is
well-being. For some (irrelevant to this discussion) reason you (claim
to) get positive stimulation from more diversity. Consequently, you
will try to prevent the loss of diversity and/or try to increase diversity.
Regardless of the broader implications, your motivation is basically
the same as that for eating tasty food: it makes you feel good.

I think we mean basically the same thing; whether you call it "tool", "raw
material", "resource" etc, it all means "stuff that allows you to reach certain
goals (staying alive & feeling ok)". I fully agree with you that it would be a 
shame to lose *certain* aspects of diversity, including nature. My point was 
that many of these things, among which biodiversity, are *not crucial to our 
survival*, certainly not once we've entered "singularity" (whatever it may be).
Also, we can only *guess* what their value is to future intelligences (hopefully
us ;) since we can only guess at how hyperminds think. 

Apart from this, I don't beleive there will be substancial damage to the world's
(bio) diversity before we reach techno-ascencion, so it's more of a theoretical
question. Once uploaded, you can virtually store/modify/delete all species of
earth, and then some. Extinct species can (almost certainly) be re-created from
the existing genepool and some general info. Piece of cake for a Jupiter brain ;)
 
> If everything else is a tool, then all you are is a user.
Is that a dirty word?
 
> Go ahead, prove I'm wrong. :)
Only if you can prove *me* wrong first ;)
 
P.s: things like the HIV virus and Jeffrey Dahmer are extra diversity too, but
surely you don't want them around too much? Therefore, more diversity is not
always good.

Same to you.

Again, how can you be so sure that it's not *necessarry*?  Are you 
willing to risk that opinion on your long term survival?  My point is, 
it is still too earlier to tell what aspects of this compexity we find 
ourselves in, may turn out to provide critical tools/clues to our future 
viability as a memetic culture.

Thats why  other extropian minded people are taking action with the 
BioArchive Project.  Please see:

Hi Kathryn

Thanx, glad the posting is of interest and of use.  I really hope that the
film will help broaden into the public arena the whole issue of life
extension, a subject so many people are reluctant to discuss - often I
think because they are unable to mentally comprehend the consequences of
not dying.

Warm regards

Peter

It seems to me that politics as practiced today has little to do with a 
free market economic system.

At any rate, it is not possible to literally sell yourself. You might 
say that Bill Clinton was offering his "services" as President to the 
American voters. He was not running for Pope.  I didn't want these 
³services,² but I'm still forced to pay for them, unlike what happens in 
a free market.

Yes, they pretended to be a model monogamous couple. But if you believed 
that, I hear the Golden Gate Bridge is for sale.

No, because I obviously have an interest in not getting food poisoning. 
I have no interest in the President's sex life. Actually, I didn't vote 
for Clinton, but it wasn't because he probably lied about various 
affairs. I don't consider this sort of lying any kind of big 
deal.(Perhaps it was/is to Hillary, but that's her problem.)

I do consider the "big government" interventionist policies of almost 
all politicians a big deal, so I don't vote for them for that reason.

Are you saying that candidates are obligated to answer questions about 
their sex lives?
 
> Is the presidency more trivial than a pizza?

The presidency is not trivial, but the extra-marital affairs of Clinton 
are.

Really, I'm having trouble following you. Because I'm not concerned

Several people have speculated that Mr.Simon did not sign up for 
cryonics because he was depressed. However, since he published a book 
about overcoming depression, you could make the case that he probably 
didn't have that problem at the time he died. Who really knows?

The fact is that there are dozens of reasons why people don't sign up 
for cryonics. Most people aren't depressed, and most of them don't sign 
up. We'll probably never know why Mr. Simon didn't sign up.

It would be interesting to do a good scientific study of the reasons 
people don't sign up. If I had any money, I'd fund it.

The point is not that youre not concerned about his affairs....neither am I.
He could parade a whole troop of girl scouts thru his office for all I care.
The point is that he lies about it.  If he lies about one thing then I expect
that he lies about other things as well.  The relevant topic at the moment
being a crying need (so he says) to bomb Iraq.

In regard to:

Campbell and Murphy (Cornell Univ., US) report
measurements of the response of the human circadian clock to
extraocular light exposure involving light pulses presented to
the popliteal region (the area behind the knee). They report a
systematic relation between the timing of the light pulse and the
magnitude and direction of clock phase shifts. The authors
suggest their findings challenge the belief that mammals are
incapable of extraretinal circadian phototransduction, and that
the findings also have implications for the development of more
effective treatments of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders. QY:

A friend comments:

The crook of the knee does seem less than
wholly dignified as the locus of our better
naychurs, doesn't it...

I replied:

The crook of the knee isn't the site of attachment for the soul (that's the
vermiform appendix), it's just a place where copious blood vessels are
close to the surface and therefore the light can readily work its fiendish
tricks.  I suspect a bright optic fiber stuck up the ass would work even
better.  We will fly jetlag-free in our special shielded undies, wriggling
slightly from time to time.  This will also be of aid to Customs in their
relentless search for contraband.

Actually, as a Libertarian,  one would hope that if one cannot have no
government, the best we can hope for is a pathetically inept and irrelevant one.

In this case, his extramarital affairs ARE my business, since Bill has made the
support of anti-smut legislation part of his campaigns. If he set the moral
standard as the occupier of the bully pulpit, we can only expect him to practice
what he preaches. If he doesn't, to our detriment, then it is our right to take him
to task.

You're really grasping at straws at this point.  Several areas on 
earth (old world civilized floodplains) have had their natural 
ecosystems obliterated millenia ago, and apart from salinization
in the Tigris-euphrates system, they all work fine.  You also
omitted my point that our current crops have been well demonstrated
to have no need at all for biodiversity.

If you're going to try for wild hypotheticals, I would point out 
that it's easy to imagine hypotheticals in which biodiversity 
brings the end of our civilization.  AIDS come over from chimps
only about 50 years ago; if there had been no wild chimps at
the time we almost certainly would have had no AIDS epidemic.
Every time a wild monkey comes down with Ebola there's a finite
chance that it will mutate to a form that readily infects humans
and that really could mean sayonara to human civilization.  No
wild monkeys; no Ebola; no risk; but it's silly to make major
decisions on wild hypotheticals, so they stay.

The host-switch disease problem is not entirely hypothetical;
unlike the hypothesized need for biodiversity it really has
happened numerous times in the past, although never yet in
a form that would truly threaten modern civilization.  Regardless
of such hypotheticals, we must act on the knowledge we have, 
and that indicates that biodiversity is neither essential
nor particularly hazardous to our continued well-being.
In terms of changing our existance in a incremental fashion
biodiversity is probably good; but in terms of major catastrophic
changes it's probably bad.

 Under most conditions when society is working well, lack of imagination
about moral codes is good because the rules tend to be close enough to
optimal that random changes are more likely to hurt than to help.

 To the limited extent that simplicity and intolerance have any correlation,
it sure looks to me like it's a negative correlation. The genealogical
contortions needed for racists to keep their rules from being subverted
by interbreeding is hardly as simple as the rule that all humans have
equal rights. Until you mention some examples of connections between
simplicity and intolerance, I will be inclined to assume that your claim
is based on inadequate stereotypes of bigots as being simpler because they
are less educated.

 You are clearly using "ethics" to refer to a much broader set of rules
than I do.

 Very few values are self-evident.
 Some more hints about why simplicity is good:
 Occam's Razor.
 Given 2 pieces of software that can accomplish the same tasks, would
you prefer the more complex or the simpler?

 Good point. I need to think some more about how this relates to my other
desires about moral systems.

 Making the ability to experience pain an important basis for respecting
rights bothers me because the difficulty of figuring out what beings
dissimilar to us experience makes it easy for people who rely on this
rule to rationalize almost any treatment of those beings that happens
to be convenient. How does your moral system handle these:
 - fish
 - clams
 - humans genetically engineered so they say they feel no emotional
 reaction to things that would be painful to us
 - uploaded humans
 - AIs
 These last three are probably the areas where different moral systems will
have the most important differences in results in the next century.

 My idea of a moral rule that can handle these better is based on the
ability to agree to respect each others rights. However, I'm still
dissatisfied with the difficulties in dealing with beings who can't
communicate well with us.

 I don't know. How likely is it that people who are open to racist rhetoric
will also be open to adopting your ethics in a consistently principled way?
 Where do racist vegetarians like Hitler fit into this?
 My impression is that xenophobic intolerance rarely depends in any important
way on classifying others as subhuman. It appears to be largely an
evolutionary adaptation for creating tribal unity that is most powerfull
when the objective differences between the tribes are smallest (i.e. when
the danger of tribe members defecting is largest). Hatred towards, say,
mosquitos, seems to be much more subdued than hatred between Catholics
and Protestants in Northern Ireland.

 That might work for some harmfull things a Power would be tempted to do,
but would be couterproductive in other circumstances. What about the
Power who wants to have fun by watching how humans respond to random
disturbances it adds to human society? A virus here, some random bits
flipped there, could give it a richer understanding of nature than
mere passive observation. I'd rather aim for convincing it to follow
a rule which implied respecting our rights.
 Also, a Power will probably know enough that the example you set by 
your vegetarianism is very unlikely to convince it to change its moral
system.

 Vegetarianism wouldn't be much of a limitation on meals I eat alone,
but when eating out with others the costs of determining which foods
meet vegetarian standards and altering behavior to follow those standards
consistently seem enough that it would take a compelling argument to
persuade me to adopt vegetarianism.

 I expect stronger injunctions for rules that I have confidence in as
moral systems. For instance, I normally demand that they be evolutionarily
stable, and that people willingly accept them.

The only one grasping at straws here is you.  I have not once said in 
the affirmative that biodiversity is necessary.  Only that our knowledge 
of its relation to us is still too incomplete to come to any firm 
conclusions.  You on the other hand, have made several conclusions 
without much evidence to back it up.  To wit:

Thats because of biodiversity!  The more biodiversity, the more vectors 
life has to fill available niches from any said catastrophe.  If it 
wasn't for the rich biodiversity that existed 65 million years ago, we 
wouldn't even be having this discussion.

The biosphere is the most complex system known, so I ask you again sir - 
how can you claim that this complex web of life is in large part 
unnecessary to our survival?  What evidence do you have?  Because until 
you examine every lifeform - including the thousands of species of 
bacteria and micro-organisms that are a part of our environment and the 
role they play  within and without our our body, you cannot claim much 
of anything.  It could turn upon further investiagtion, that our current 
ecosystem of which we are a part, might be so fragile that the 
elimination of one species would unravel enough to take us out with it.  
The bottom line is - I don't know.  So how can you? 

What I am asking for you to do, is to suspend judgement on that which 
you are ignorant.  Or are you profesising that you do have complete 
knowledge of the entire biosphere down to its most minute processes?

Yesterday I saw Max & Natasha for the first time on German TV (last part
of "Future Fantastic", BBC documentary), together with Marvin Minsky,
Ralph Merkle, and many others. Although I was a bit disappointed by the
style of presentation (which resembled a mystery series rather than a
serious report), I hope that this reached a broad audience, despite the
broadcasting time 11:15 pm, because it's a nice (and important, in this
country) contribution to the dissemination of certain transhumanist
concepts.
Anyway, I have a copy on videotape and will force everyone within reach to
watch it ;-)

Lets not get distracted by and react to only the "sex scandal" aspects of
the Clinton administration's many scandals.

The Clintons and their supporters (the vast left wing conspiracy) must be
relieved to have the media and the American people wasting their time and
energy talking about "sex scandals" among "consenting adults" or how evil
Ken Starr's methods are (please ignore any and all evidence of wrongdoing
that may be found in the process).

But, under our legal and governmental system, I think we have to care
whenever someone lies to us and lies under oath. We have to care if they
tell others to lie and advise them on how to get away with it. We have to
care if they pay others off for lying by getting them undeserved jobs
that others should have.  All that and more has to be investigated to
determine the truth. 

What ever happened to investigating the way the Clinton's persecuted
the travel office employees and illegally used the FBI and IRS to do it
(Billy Dale et al scandal). How about the misappropriation of all those
FBI files; how about payoffs by Tyson Chicken via cattle futures, or
payoffs by Indonesia, or China (John Huang) .... on an on it goes... (But
it really is "just a little sex scandal" and nothing we should be
concerned about).  

For your entertainment, further allegations (high crimes and misdemenors)
that should be investigated (to determine the truth) follow:

A quick suggestion, since I'm in a hurry..:


We could think in stablishing an extropian country...

We'll need, among other things:

1. some extropian billionaires to initial finnancial support.

2. chose a small site in, f.ex., Africa, which we could buy... ( They need
money and we need a place...).

Bye, for a while,


Gomes

The plants we use for our farm ecosystems have been studied in
the field for thousands of years with biodiversity gone, in
the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, and Hwang Ho river
valleys, and they do great.  Laboratory studies of these same
organisms has revealed the reason for this; these plants
grow fine, indefinitely, in systems in which they are the only 
things alive, as long as they are provided with an impressively
short list of nutrients.

Can you name even one organism that needs biodiversity to survive?

Extropians,

Last year I wrote an article on the Extropic Art Movement for 21C--scanning
the future.  The article, was accepted but unfortunately, the magazine went
broke, and is no longer publishing.  I've posted the article, entitled "We're
not in Kansas, Anylmore" on my website , http://users.
aol.com/salaned/writer.htm.  The article contains quotes form a number of you.
There's also a bunch of other stuff I have published also posted there.  One
is on the singularity, and several on biotechnology and the like. 

IThanks to those who helped me with "Kansas."

I would take issue with the idea that our current crops have
demonstrated there is no need for biodiversity. As I am part Irish,
I will remind you of the historical lesson of the potato famine of
1847 (remember less we repeat). The vast portion of the country was
dependent on a single strain of potato, the "lumper." When a blight
was accidently introduced the whole country was devasted, millions
died or fled. Agricultural experts around the world warn daily that
we are repeating this historical mistake.

 I share your admiration of hydroponic/nutrient film techniques
however.

 The "smart-money" is taking a different course than the one we
have been talking about so far.

Enter the new agricultural world spawned by the hobbyists known as
"heirloom gardeners." In searching for the fondly remembered fruits
and vegetables of their youth, groups of gardeners have been
searching out the varieties they seek amongst various ethnic
groups. These seeds have been contiually propagated and passed from
generation to generation, hence the name "Heirloom."

To these people biodiversity is everything. Heirloom seed
catalogues list hundreds of varieties of such simple things as
beans, corn, or tomatoes. (and yes potato's!) Not only have they
mamaged to preserve and repropagate these plants but they are
creating new varieties that self-polinate. (non-hybrid)

Where is this headed? Not only are new seed companies being
created, reversing a disturbing trend, but they are selling and
growing these varietys. Farmers, forced to change by current
economics, are turning to these techniques, growing new, and old
varietys all of which offer better taste and nutrition. Former
hobbists, the heirloom gardeners are now becoming "market
gardeners" growing large quantities under contract for specific
restaurants. Here in northern Illinois farms that were close to
being lost are expanding to meet the ever growing demand for these
products, enjoying the advantage of being close to there market,
and earning greater profits on these high value added items. 


This is a global, multicultural trend, good news all around I'd
say.

Heirloom crop preservation is a *great* idea, and I have never
understood why the major seed companies don't embrace it
enthusiastically.  There's bound to be really useful genes
that have been lost from the current crop lines, and anybody
who ends up owning any of those genes (by owning all their
remaining representatives) will be worth a fortune.

Indeed an excellent example of how biodiversity can be a boon.
However, we still grow varieties of that strain.  Oddly, although
preserved biodiversity in wild potatos demonstrably has fixes
for the potato blight, we haven't used them.

I must admit to being a little surprised, I was sure someone would
mention last nights X-files episode.

Co-written by William Gibson, the story revolved around an AI that
had been released onto the net to evolve, when it no longer
responded to it's creators summons, they try to track it down and
incapacitate it.

 It reacts predictably by defending itself, sometimes in an
ingenious fashion, sometimes in a more predictable way.

The lead character was a women (INVISIGOTH) who I would class as
definitely extropian, she was reputed to have a PHD in AI, was
extremely streetsmart, and in the words of one of the lone gunman,
she was hot!

 She reveals to the agents that her and her lover were planning on
uploading themselves onto the net, but he has disappeared while
searching for the home node of the AI.

I don't want to spoil the rest, but if you didn't see it, call your
friends and look for a tape.......

I'm looking for URLs on visionary bio-technology.  If anyone can suggest
URLs of innovative ideas about the interface between technology and our
transhuman bodies, I'd really appreciate it. (Stelarc and some roboticists'
sites exemplify the extension of the body with robotics in a dramatically
but not a representation of transhuman interfacing with technology to
*enhance or extend life.*)  I'm more interested in what science and
engineering are saying and producing that actuate the plausibility of
visionary bio-technological beings.

It becomes quite rational if lessers can become greaters and greaters
lessers, then it is obviously rational. But if the relationship is
fixed, then it becomes harder.

The pebbles and shells Newton referred to were calculus, gravity, optics,
and the other things we like to remember him for.  The "great ocean of
truth" was the exciting world of Biblical interpretation and alchemy,
topics of lifelong interest for Newton and to which he devoted vastly more
time and care.

Well, I seem to recall that Stelarc did connect the net to his muscles
in one installation, so that you could make him jerk through the web.

All excellent points.  I'm still not sure whether I think we should regard
another's pain as a kind of "rights" claim.  I think it may be disastrous
to extend the rights framework in this way.  Part of the problem with
treating pain as the ethical ground-zero disvalue is that it suggests we
might achieve utopia simply by anesthetizing the world.  Clearly, pain
stands in too complicated a relation to pleasure, achievement, and
flourishing to reject it out of hand.  Further, there is something
patronizing about carping constantly about the suffering of others,
without speaking about their capacity for joy and self-reliance.
Nevertheless, I think *indifference* to suffering is crippling to the
spirit.  Sometimes (as with medical experimentation) it may be necessary
to value the benefits of nonhuman animal exploitation over our sensitivity
to their pain -- however, I think it is a kind of blindness to the rich
range of possible values to treat this state of affairs as one without
costs both to the exploited animals *and to ourselves*.

Me too.  It is only in articulating my intuitions here that I realize how
unsatisfied I really am about these issues and how best to think them
through.  Best, Dale

I think that a prior indifference to the suffering of beings
conspicuously capable of experiencing it has a lot to do with what you
describe as the "openness" of some people to racism in the first place.
Fwiw, there is actually quite a lot of evidence that pathological
criminality is very often preceded by childhood torturing of animals.

> Where do racist vegetarians like Hitler fit into this?

Ah, Hitler.  Well, there is little doubt that Hitler's vegetarianism was a
hygenic rather than ethical fastidiousness.  I read recently in an animal
rights rag (I think it was the inaptly named "The Animals Agenda")  an
article that suggested Hitler's vegetarianism is exaggerated anyway, and
that in fact he regularly ate pork and fish.  There is also research to
suggest that the specific practices and institutional arrangements of the
death camps bore in mind "advances" in then-recent factory farming
techniques (transport, storage, hygiene, slaughter, disposal, etc.) 
Brrrr.  But the force of your point is mostly secure after these quibbles
and caveats of mine.  Yes, it's not like vegetarianism provides any
guarantees.

Really?  I am actually quite shocked how often I hear people say of their
enemies or their presumed inferiors that they are "animals".  It pays to
remember in this regard that the characteristic gesture of liberation
struggles is the demand that "we will no longer be treated *as* animals!"

This makes me think of the totemic consolidation of tribal identity, and
of how often the totem figure is a (nonhuman) animal.

Read about the Dirty Protests and tell me that the theme of the "merely"
animal versus the "true" human has no place in the maintenance and
invigoration of hatreds between the Catholics and Protestants of Northern
Ireland.

You're right.  Still, I wonder if the very things that make it seem
questionable to extend a rights framework to register claims of nonhuman
pain will render human claims to rights similarly trivial to a Power.  My
argument to the Power shoots for the double whammy of the appeal to hope
(unforseeable promise of pleasure) and the appeal to fear (safeguard
against unforseeable danger).  I'm afraid that an abstract appeal to
shared "rights" might start to cash out as inconsequential to real conduct
when power/knowledge-assymmetries start getting too large.  Doesn't this
happen already?

Well, I hope to spread the vegetarian meme as part of spreading the more
general and more important "respect diversity" meme, such that a widely
disseminated respect for beings will already infect the Power before she
or he (it, they, we) *becomes* a Power in the first place.

By which I mean to say, as much as anything else, that with all of this I

*myself* one day.

In a probably vain attent to check my tendency to speculative sprawl, I'm
going to respond to some of your many excellent points in a few
individual posts.  If this seems to you to derange the overall flow of
your argument (I don't think that it does, otherwise I wouldn't do it),
know that this was not my intention.

I see what you mean here, but I have to admit that my initial intuition is
exactly the opposite one.  It seems to me that when you have a society
that is working well -- e.g., one that is stable and affords reasonable
assurance of survival and security -- that is exactly when morality should
get more imaginative.  Survival is simple (if only because it is there are
relatively fewer states that count as healthy or functional ones for an
organism, than there are states that count as disease or malfunction), but
*thriving* is complex.  What could be simpler than that practically
hardwired ethical injunction that says:  Reject the New!  Civilization is
importantly the story of how we hacked together frameworks (capital-
formation, legal systems, codes of civility, scientific methods) which
permitted us to reap the benefits of *overcoming* that simple injunction
(even if there was a time when we would not have survived without it). 
Risk-taking, experimentalism, connoisseurship are all complex as opposed
to simple practices and attitudes.

Yikes!  I don't think that's what I think.  Strictly speaking, I don't
believe in such a thing as an "uneducated" person.  The education you get
from the "University of Life" is hardly a simple affair.  I don't know
that respecting rights, or the Golden Rule, or even the noninitiation of
force principle is really *simpler* than racism is.  Racism probably looks
pretty simple to racists, despite their silly and sad genealogical
contortions.  Even the noninitiation of force injunction produces some
real contortions when applied to actual cases (see Friedman's
_Machinery_).  No, what I meant was that the *dream* of simplicity as
applied to morality seems associated with intolerance to me.  It's not
like I think any ethical system could actually manage to be simple really.

One shouldn't posit explanatory entities beyond necessity, sure.  But part
of what we're talking about here is that the ethical has (at least) two
relevant registers: necessity and flourishing.  Two pieces of software
accomplish the same task from one angle of view, namely survival, but say
that one of the pieces of software, an ungainly highly complicated thing,
provides an incrementally less robust assurance of survival while at the
same time enabling a much more colorful mode of life.  I'll pick the more
complex one every time.

More to come.  Best, Dale

You make your case well.  But is it not plausible to say that a great
variety of design is in itself a value?  Though (as I think you would
probably agree) biodiversity is neither important enough nor determinable
enough (as you say above) to warrant interference with peoples' lives,
it is important enough in this abstract sense to warrant some degree of
shepherding.

You never know when you might need a particularly nifty solution to a
problem, an algorithm for which has already been designed in nature in
the form of some animal or vegetable problem-solving function.

        Yes, I must say that the article is the most well-written of all on
the Extropic Art Movement thus far (besides the initial manifesto.)  I'd be
more than happy to use it on the Homo Excelsior webzine, and am sure that many
sources (both magazine and web-zine) would welcome the article.

                                        Good luck!

Great, I'm enormously interested! And so are many other Europeans.
Especially because this is a good way for the ordinary public to 
get aquainted with some concepts underlying transhumanism. :->

But do you have any idea when it will be broadcast on European television 
channels (like the BBC or Dutch television) ?

If I would like to order your book, can this be done at Amazon.com ?

>it has been stunningly made and is deeply faithful to the theme I wanted to
>address in the novel, that living forever is going to become a reality.

Regrettably the most common view, also depicted in many movies and 
television series (including for example in "Raiders of the lost Ark" 
and many Star Trek episodes :-< ), is that wishing to extend your 
life span is unethical and immoral. 

It puzzles me, that the term "obsession" is used in the title of 
the movie. I hope this is not related to the wish for immortality, 
implying that such a wish is psychologically unhealthy ? 

I recently wrote to a Dutch newspaper where an article quoted a 
theology professor (member of an European ethical commission! :-< ) 
claiming that a wish for immortality is not acceptable. 

I stated that it is wrong to decide what is ethically acceptable 
based on a belief. A belief is just a faith, it has not been proven 
and can therefore be wrong. Furthermore there are many different 
believes. "When the church is going to decide what is ethically 
acceptable, we will have returned to the middle ages."

Another professor (in philosophy) suggested that immortality will 
result in eternal boredom. He supported this with examples 
from Greek gods, who according to stories did suffer from 
boredom and envied human mortality. 

Yeah, real hard evidence :-> 
I could just as well claim that goblins exist...

Besides that, he missed the point, it is always better 
to have a choice than no choice at all. I want to decide 
for myself when I'm bored and want to end my life, and 
not let nature decide this for me.

I'm sorry, but I have to laugh when I hear the "none of your business"
or "wait until he is proven guilty of a crime" stuff trotted out to
defend Clinton.

Maybe if he and his wife (and all the other politicians) left me alone,
I'd reciprocate.  But here's a guy who thinks nothing of backing drug
forfeiture laws which seize an individual's property without even
charging the person with a crime!

Who has his drug czar threaten doctors who might prescribe marijuanna to
their patients, even after the general public agrees in vote that they
want more health freedom.

I'd love for Bill and Hillary to get to say "None of your business" when
it comes to their personal life, but dang it they keep bringing 'round a
village to run my life...from raising my kids to nationalizing my health
care.

Here's a pair who've proposed to punish us if we attempt to get better
or even different medical care than our neighbors, (e.g., by spending
your own money for a covered operation), both you and your doctor will
be committing a federal crime.

Who favor Federal health-care police authorized to enter your home
without search warrants for "indoor air-quality inspections" and "well
baby" visits. If they decide you have an "unhealthy" home
environment, existing child-abuse laws authorize them to immediately
take away your children.

Their "Comprehensive School Health Education" initiatives authorize the
government to shape
your children's behavior involving "Tobacco use; alcohol and other drug
abuse; sexual behaviors ... ;
behaviors resulting in intentional and unintentional injuries; dietary
patterns resulting in disease; and
sedentary life styles . . ." [HSA, pp. 607-608]

Under Clinton's plan, your doctor would be forced to turn over all of
your medical information to a
federal computer center. Your children would be registered with the
state from birth. If your doctor
withholds any information, he can be fined $10,000 per violation,
without trial. [HSA, p. 871]

And Bill want us all to carry to carry a government-issued Health
Security Card which could hold up to 1,600 pages of information about
you.

Your mandatory ID card and government health files will make nearly
every detail of your life an
open book to millions of bureaucrats, IRS agents, and police officers.
Once they run your card
through a scanner, they'll know everything you've ever written on a
medical form or told your doctor:
your address, phone number, employer, drug history, every physical and
mental disorder,
pregnancies and abortions -- and even you doctor's personal notes.

Clinton's plan creates 105 new government agencies, and greatly expands
the power of 42 others. Hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats will
monitor you and your doctor, reeducate your children, and enter your
office and home at will.

Yeah, poor Bill Clinton, let's stay out of his private life.

                                                                Pat

Here is where I have to disagree with you. Everyone on earth has told a
a lie at one time or another. That does not mean that everyone lies
about everything or about most things, or that they will necessarily lie
about really important things. It is possible that someone could lie
about his sex life and be honest in all other areas of his life.

I do agree with you that Clinton has probably lied about important
things. But I do not base this opinion on what he says about his
affairs.

I don't really disagree with you. I just don't see how Clinton's sexual
escapades and what he says about them leads you to this conclusion.

Y'know, I've been wondering why those Project Aquarius and Millenial Project
people are not getting anywhere. Duh, they could easily be buying up some of
the hundreds of surplus oil tankers sitting in ports around the world to start
their independent communities. Oil tankers are at least 1000 feet long, the
size of a Nimitz class aircraft carrier, which houses a crew of 5000. With no
airport to support, an oil tanker based community could easily support that
many in much more spacious accomodations. link several together into a large
raft or catamaran or trimaran and you're talking real space. Using those empty
holds for starting workroom and you could get really grand. Olympic swimming
pools, huge dance halls, and indoor rain forests/arboretums.

Buy a couple Russian submarine nuclear propulsion systems  for the ships and
you're golden. I don't know if I'd trust such a large investment only to wind
power.....If they only wanted to anchor the boats, they could easily generate
all of their power needs from wave generation.

But why do you claim that carnivores do not respect diversity? By playing my role
as a predator, I encourage diversity in the animal populations, encourage the
continued practice of evolutionary pressure to maintain the fitness of the herds.
A herd with no predator quickly degenerates in a few short years into a sickly,
weak, unfit population that something as a simple bad winter can decimate, while
several cushy years encourage overpopulation of an unhealthy herd which becomes a
health and safety hazard to not only other animal populations, but also the human
population. Excessive deer breeding for example increases the population of deer
ticks, which spread Lyme disease to the local human population, and the increase
in their hoof and mouth disease quickly spreads to cattle, horses, moose, dogs
(who will often eat deer excrement), and other wild canines.

It doesn't need diversity, it just needs those particular organisms.
Any organism that needed biodiversity in the desert wold be in a 
bad way - deserts have relatively low biodiversity.

What flower is that, anyway?  I'd never heard of any that needed
more than one species of pollinator, just of ones that could 
use multiple species.

A few plankton participate in trace element chemical cycles, and
they genuinely are important.  Most, though, are like plants,
and readily substitute for each other.

Sure!  The complex designs in biodiversity, based on billions of years
of thorough testing, clearly present a large possible value.  I'm
arguing against the claim that, if biodiversity in the wild were largely
eliminated, human culture would be destroyed or even suffer significant
losses from its present and probable near-future conditions.

The scare tactic "save the wild environment or we're all gonna die!"
is bogus and, as such, will fail in the end.  Saving biodiversity
needs to be based on more substantial values, such as economic
efficiency, aesthetics, and the potential for new discoveries.
If the movement to save biodiversity is based on solid ground,
it will succeed; otherwise it's likely to get ploughed under unless
it becomes a religion.  That would bring its own set of problems.

There is a new science fiction novel that touches on the subject of a
radical reduction in ecological diversity and its potential consequences. 
The novel is Dust by Charles Pellegrino and it is reviewed here:
http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue62/books.html#du

Begin review excerpt:

The story is based on a deceptively simple question--what would happen if
all the insects in the world began to die? 

The demise of whole insect populations removes essential functions such as
pollination, fungal control and organic decay. While rivers choke with
rotting carcasses, crops wither from lack of pollination and uncontrolled
fungal growth. Eventually scientists conclude that humanity's last chance
may be to re-introduce insects by cloning the only ones now
available--those preserved in amber from prehistoric times. But time is
running out, and Homo sapiens may be next on the list of extinct species.

Exactly!  The fact that a single flower in a low diversity environment 
needs at least two other species for its survival, is testament to what 
I am driving at.  Don't forget, that those two species need other 
organisms to survive which in turn need others, which in turn need 
others.....are you getting the picture now?

I strongly encourage you to read at least one good book on ecology, 
population ecology and/or biodiversity before we continue this debate 
any further.  It's as if we are arguing finer points within Quantum 
Cosmology, without you having a basic understanding of how gravity 
works.  Besides, if in the end you still disagree with me, at least you 
walk away with a fuller understanding of the most complex systems in the 
known universe.

Paul Hughes

That makes it easy!  (I'm being ironic for those who don't know.:)

I don't like crowds.  Imagine lots of protechs in one place and a neoLuddite
with a large bomb...

But seriously, we might exhaust valuable effort in trying to attain such a
state.  Much better/cheaper to focus on recruiting new people to our
ranks AND developing better tech/science/philosophy/art in the
interim.  Don't (all of) you agree?

If it's any consolation, cryonics is far from a sure thing.  In fact,
I think realistically we have to view it as a long shot.  There are many
things which can go wrong.  Damage may occur in the hours and minutes
before death, as bodily systems are failing.  More damage will be done
after death and before the suspension, as not all suspensions occur
under ideal situations.  Then there is the freezing damage, where we
really don't know how much is being destroyed.  I have read descriptions
by cryonics workers of the appearance of brain tissue after it has been
frozen which are very sobering.  They make it sound like it's really
getting chewed up, even with the best protocols used today.

Then even once frozen there is the chance of damage, sabotage, failure
of the cryonics storage facility, government regulation, human error,
war, gray goo, collapse of civilization.  This adds up to a formidable
barrier when you are talking about many decades of freeze time.

If Julian Simon had been frozen, I wouldn't expect to be able to talk
to him at some point in the future.  I'd say there is a chance, a slim
chance, that it might be possible.  Obviously some chance is better than
none.  But sadness at his death should be tempered with the realistic
realization that even if he had been frozen, his chances would not have
been good.

Was:  The Futility of Rationalized Agnosticism

  IAN: Sorry that I missed your reply. I looked 
  in the archive but did not see it before. I
  thank you for your critique but at the same 
  time I believe it's not representative of my
  analysis: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm

  IAN: I think that misrepresent what I say.
  I've never said some part of the universe 
  "just has to be spiritual or mystical."

  Most explicity, what I've done here 

  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm

  is to carefully define what aspects of the
  mystical experience are 100% unique from 
  normal experience, then refine those experi-
  ences to a mathematical claim about reality,
  and then test that claim with the physical 
  reality that we can all observe. I point 
  out that if the mystical claim cannot pass
  that test, then it must be false. I conclude 
  that the mystical claim is valid, and is an 
  expression of a universal conservation law.

  One need not address anything unknown, as 
  you suggest, to determine if my analysis
  is right or wrong. All features of my 
  analytical test of the mystical claim 
  are within the set of the known.

  If anything, this should be called a de-
  mystification of the mystical. Indeed, the 
  run-of-the mill mystic attacks what I say,
  claiming logic is antithetic to anything 
  that the mystical experience reveals.

  I make no claim, or "leap," as you suggest 
  that I do, of any "necessity of divinity."
  I fail to see how that critique accurately 
  applies to my analysis.


>The general defense to this lack of rationalization is that 
>such divine affairs defy our abilities to rationalize them. 


  IAN: But that's the opposite of what I say.
  It seems to me that your addressing a stereo-
  typical variety of mystic oriented claim, a 
  set of which my analysis is not a member.


>If this is the case then they fit securely in the realm of

>nature unprovable. Furthermore, is it not a paradox to assert 
>that one can use logic to prove the existence of something 
>that is allegedly transcendental?


  IAN: Again, I think this simply misses entirely
  what I've presented. The application of what 
  your saying to my work would be that we cannot 
  arrive at a sum from our measurement of physical 
  phenomena that equals zero. Now for the sake of
  argument maybe we can't, but if we refine the 
  case of "is the mystical experience true or 
  false" to "does everything equal zero," which 
  is what I've done, then there are none of the 
  "transcendental" or "divine" aspects of the 
  analysis that you suggest there are.

  IAN: I think that I explain (as does Wiley) why
  zero is the cornerstone of the mystical experience:

  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/mystical.htm
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/infinity.htm

  The point is what is "mystical" what is "divine."
  It's an experience of integration with the universe,
  an experience of the dissolution of the normal 
  finite boundaries that define our egoic mind. 

  Why is this so "mystical," so "antiscientific"?
  I believe that that experience is not a halluci-
  nation but is the perfection of intelligence,
  and this super-intelligence has been locked
  away in a closet of ignorance and it's time 
  to let it out and hear what it has to say.

  I've listened to it says, and what it says is
  that the entire universe is an expression of 
  equalibrium and universal conservation law. 
  I think this understanding it key to breaking
  down barriers of space-time that will eventually
  allow for faster-than-light travel - zero travel.
  I don't begin to know how that would be achieved,
  but understanding the zero sum of space-time is
  an inherent prerequisite to such possibilities.

What I find interesting is when people dismiss his lies on the basis 
of "but nobody but fools believed him in the first place."

Might I point out that the same is true of the cigarette companies' 
lies for at least the past twenty years.  But people who offer this 
defense of Clinton won't extend the same courtesy to others.

(I'm not saying they should excuse the tobacco companies; I'm saying 
they should be consistent.)

Did anyone watch the X-Files sunday night??

A new episode, co-penned by William Gibson, confronts the SINGULARITY.

In the episode, a hacker uploads her brain into an AI matrix which lives
on the internet.

Is this the first current day mainstream sci-fi coverage of the
Singularity??

Including modern (Bismarck-Clausewitz-to-present-date) "total war" and hot
spots like the Koreas, the Tutsis vs Hutus and the
country-formerly-known-as-Yugoslavia. Your point buttresses our argument. :)

Trust me, making your enemy subhuman is also a consciously chosen and
war-college-discussed strategy for training shock troops so they'll act
with a maximum of dispatch & unit cohesion when they attack, and
ameliorating your PTS slightly after you or your troops have napalmed,
cluster-bombed, gassed, bayonetted, garroted, decapitated, silent-killed,
etc., the other side's soldiers.

Especially since the standard sentry silent kill techniques bear a close
resemblance to slaughtering an innocent pig while you embrace it (shudder).
:\ I'll spare you the details.

You can't firebomb a state of mind.

I agree.

An extropian / anarchist "state" at this point in human social evolution
and population limited to this planet, especially an obvious one with
attractive assets or a high profile in a fixed location, is what people in
threat analysis call a "target".

Yes, hypocrisy needs to be drawn up short when its practitioners have a

You don't need billionaires to buy your own island state. I've seen 
a relatively recent documentary about a bunch of English folks 
who wanted to do just this, and they could buy a relatively big island
off the coast of Panama or so for about 30.000.000 (I think dollars).
The required financial imput per perseon/family would have to be about 
a million, considering the size of the group. This is certainly feasible
for middle class folks who sell their house etc. Although this particular
attempt resulted in nothing (the moral high-horse "leader" of the group,
that wanted an island "free of criminals, drugs, child molesters etc."
turned out to be a child molester himself, but by then the project had
already failed because it lacked good organization, and the island that
was to be bought turned out to be a dumpsite for US chemical weapons)
there were some interesting things:
--several countries were very eager to sell one (or more) of their islands to 
an autonomous group, they really don't care about your beliefs as long as 
you bring money
--buying an island is not only for the super rich, a relatively small group
of normal-income folks can do it. Apart from this, you could set up a
special project to finance things (and don't use borrowed money --
it's always trouble).

Africa is a bit politically unstable and has some very nasty diseases etc.

Of course you keep a low profile, and have some defences. Nobody's going
to drop bombs on an obscure island with a couple of hundred technofreaks/
immortailsts, unless you give them a very good reason. Besides, I don't
think that the majority of transhumanists would want to move to this place
permanently. Most would just come over for visits (to have some uninhibited
fun & networking) or to die (hassle-free cryo suspensions etc.) Bombing the
island would _not_ wipe out the transhuman community, and I don't think
the luddite scumballs would even bother to get bombs and go all the way
to this resort-like place to blow it up (you need a *lot* of explosives  and
good co-ordination for something like this. It's not like posting a mail bomb).

One idea doesn't exclude another. I think we could use a place with a 
all-out extropic culture. It's fun (do anything as long as you don't harm others
against their will) and very practical (place for "controversial" research,
cryonics, safe haven in case of global war/other disaster etc.) Spreading
the risks...

Great idea! How much does such an oil tanker cost? You could also buy a
relatively worthless island (no vegetation etc.) and permanently anker your
ship(s) alongside it, and connect everything. You'd have a homeland that's
at least partially unsinkable ;) My personal favourite would be a high luxury
cruiseship the size of the biggest supertanker...kind of like that Freedom Ship
City thing, only smarter designed.

Well.....this is of course too tempting, not to respond on :-)

For sure: We could pull it of !!!   if   sigh :-)

- we can find the island/boat
- enough people with money (anybody an educated guess?)
- can found a start-up company(s) that generate income right away
   * software development
   * Internet selling/development
   * Hotels (in case of a tropical island)
   * selling art/books/music
   * research
   * etc..
- we have a modest life-style (in the beginning)
- we have practical laws
- can export goods/knowledge
-etc....

I picture a: Tropical island with a (near by) airport, since a lot of "us"
are
doing business all over the world. Hotels, research labs (I think the bio-
genetic industry, would be very interested), hospital, cryonics provider,
"learning-farms" (were people can combine their holiday with catching up
on the new stuff), self-supporting ecco systems, webbased polling systems
on deciding what/how/were. Open libraries, conference centers were
scientists from around the world can discuss everything, etc......
(well "all" share some idea's :-)

Well needless to say I would go all the way for this, if we could trigger a

critical mass of people from this list to really develop a
blue-print.........

Anyone :-)

Have a great day!

But it should be noted that in the third Indiana Jones movie both
father and son drinks from the Grail, presumably becoming immortal
even if that wasn't their reason for drinking.

But overall, the "Tithonus syndrome" is rampant in literature,
including science fiction.

Very true. The desirability of continued life is a question each
person must decide on, it can not and should not be decided by an
outside force.

Hmm, the crackpot index by John Baez lists: "20 points for every use
of science fiction works or myths as if they were fact." OK, the index
was intended for "scientific" arguments, but in this case I think it
applies.

In discussions like this it is always fun to ask why people are
attracted to the western religions with their promises of eternal
life. If you buy that immortality produces eternal ennui, then heaven
must be worse than most conceptions of hell. Many christians would
probably respond with pointing out that existence heaven is totally
blessed and you cannot by definition become bored with it. But why
can't we modify ourselves so that we do not become bored?

A basic assumption many make is that immortality means it is
*impossible* to die, regardless of how much one wants to. To be
honest, the best we could ever achieve would be indefinite lifespans
(i.e. no aging or other process making death unavoidable) with a very
low (perhaps negligble) probability of dying in an unplanned way.

When I published an opinion piece in a newspaper recently, following the
reported telomerase breakthrough, I made these points explicitly - that
critics routinely cite myths, legends and horror fiction *as if these were
reports rather than inventions*, and that the actual long-term scientific
goal is rejuvenation plus longevity.  Despite this, the comments I got back
were mostly blind to these qualifications.  Who would wish to go on living,
people bleated, when it meant eating slimy medicated gruel in an old folks'
home - forever? Who was supposed to pay for all these deathless people on
the old-age pension if they lived for 200 years?   How awful if the world
became ruled by a deathless gerontocracy of sclerosed brains in withered,
passionless bodies?  Ugh, not for me, no sirree, Bob!

I get very annoyed by this sort of unimaginative response, except that--

--after all, it's the kind of realistic extrapolation you'd be inclined to
make if you knew only linear change and hadn't got hold of the idea of
exponential progress.  And lifespan extension in this century *has* just
been of the `add another couple of years of decrepitude every half decade'
type.  Old people's homes *are* filling up with brain-ruined ghosts with
damaged bodies.  No wonder realists (as people generally regard themselves)
experience a profound anxiety about all this scary science stuff that is
making our last years a purgatory, both for the old themselves and for
those who have to watch over their suffering (and see their savings bleed
away uselessly).

Nor is appeal to myth and legend altogether as stupid as it might seem.
These *are* the distilled repositories of cultures' hopes, fears,
statements-of-what-cannot-be-said-directly...  Maybe transhumanist thinkers
need to look more carefully at Tithonus and his buddies and learn what the
implicate order of those stories might have to tell us.  (Possibly nothing.
 Maybe just outdated night terrors.  But maybe there's some stuff there we
could benefit from.)

Yes, I was reflecting on that when I wrote my posting. The Tithonus
story, for example, shows that just immortality isn't what we want, we
want eternal youth (plus it contains a clear example of why one should
think through one's wishes carefully before implementing them).

Many of the other anti-hubris stories aren't really about the futility
of hubris, but rather of the form "look out for the Powers That Be,
they don't like competition", i.e. hubris works perfectly well, but be
prepared that some people will try to stop you. Prometheus, for
example, clearly knew that the gods would punish him for his deed but
accepted that and still went along with his plan (besides, to an
immortal titan a few millennia of agony before a remote relative
(Hercules) frees him might be a rather small piece to pay for giving
fire to the humans). Gilgamesh lost his immortality because he didn't
guard it well, Phaeton didn't see the limits of his competence and
Arachne foolishly challenged a sore loser who she knew was
significantly more powerful than herself.

        Well, as the myth goes, it wasn't exactly Tithonus' choice to become
an atrophied immortal; rather, it was Aurora who "stole him away" and
pleaded with Jupiter to grant him this immortality.  This prompts the
question: had Tithonus had a choice in the matter, would he have complied
with the prospect of immortality?  Another question prompted by this
particular myth is this: if Aurora had such an immense fascination with
mortality and immortality, why didn't she simply choose another mortal to
make immortal --this time with eternal youth?

        This is wholly indicative of the mindset of the cultures which
created and conveyed these myths...that is why it is important to look at
the figures in question before their ultimate demise --the focus on "what
could have been" as opposed to what was.

        Another perspective that can be taken on the Prometheus myth is a
focus on why Zeus felt it necessary to punish Prometheus.  Was Zeus just a
greedy god, or did he want the human race to find the fire on their own...
without divine intervention?  I think that this is an important way of
looking at the myth.  Perhaps Zeus felt that if Prometheus was to give the
fire to humanity, humans would constantly be thanking the gods for the gift
rather than finding things on their own.  Needless to say, reason plays an
immensely important part in mythology; however, as the "crackpot" scale
indicates, the pure mutability of mythology makes it impossible for anyone
to treat myth as though it were fact...it simply makes one think about the
reasons and consequences for one's actions.

Much (if not all of this) is being done by various different "groups"
around the world.  Someone mentioned Freedomship 
<http://www.freedomship.com/> (was it Anders Sandberg 
who suggested the surplus Oil Tanker buy-up? -- much
more feasible technically, although I'm no ship builder!!), then
there's Laissez Faire City (currently in Costa Rica) <http://www.lfcity.com/>
and New Utopia Sea Country <http://www.new-utopia.com/>, and
of course perhaps the grandmother of them all, Oceania
<http://www.oceania.com/default.htm>  However, there is one
(less known, unpublicised) endeavour by the founder of
Investors International ( <http://www.investors-intl.com/> talk
to us if you want to join) who is already well on his way to
buying up a group of islands (Carribbean, I think) and selling
beachfront property.  The organisation already has its own
bank (class B, Lichtenstein) with online/smartcard facilities
available soon.

Apart from all that, the Sovereign Individual/PT "movement"
aroung the globe could be harmonised to a sufficient focus
on a specific project (such as this "Extropian Country") with
a workable blueprint to present.  (I heard the figure of a
million mentioned for Investors International membership with
all these people knowledgeable to a certain extent about 
Sovereignty/PT and Offshore situations which, IMO, is a 
prerequisite to achieving anything like this subject.

So........

OK.  For starters send us a private email with "Subscribe iU" in the
subject and I'll put you on the list for our *periodic email communique*
commencing soon, covering this subject and others relevant to The

        In light of a recent thread, I find it somewhat appropriate to post
this poem:


Phaëton


Through ignorance and a determined pride
The son of a god cast wisdom aside
And took on a task he could not fulfill;
Despite good intentions and no ill will,
Clymenes son Phaëton did not have the skill
To handle the chariot of the sun
As father Apollo had always done.
But, alas! how stubborn pure youth can be,
Causing foolishness and stupidity,
Making reason as blind as bravery,
Provoking insolence to fill the veins.
Unknowing of truth, Phaëton seized the reins,
And this he found out a moment too late:
It was Phaëton who would cause Phaëtons fate.

 IAN: I agree that they are not so obliged. It seems 
 to me that lies about private and consensual sexual 
 activity do not fall into the category of unethical, 
 since private means "off limits" by definition, and 
 therefore this whole affair should be off limits to 
 both the press and Starr. People going into public 
 life have to sacrifice many areas of their private 
 lives, but their sexual activity, so long as it is 
 consensual, is and should not be one of those areas. 

 That aside, of note is the fact that a few days after 
 Newsweek's Mike Isikoff reported that Clinton had an
 affair with an unamed "former White House staffer" a 
 former White House intern, Mary Mahoney, was brutally 
 executed in the infamous Starbucks massacre.

 The fact that nobody heard the 10 shots fired by the 
 assassins suggests that silencers were used, and thus 
 that it was a high-level job. What is more, no money 
 was taken from the cash register!! Mary Mahoney was 
 simply targeted for "termination." Here's some key
 excerpts from two articles on this case:


================================================
THE WASHINGTON POST (07/13/97, A1)

Coffee Shop a Fateful Stop on Three Career Paths

By Sari Horwitz and John W. Fountain

On the surface, the trio couldnt have seemed more 
different...But all three -- Emory Allen Evans, 25; 
Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 25; and Aaron David Goodrich, 
18 -- had overcome challenges in their young lives 
and landed jobs in a Georgetown coffee shop. Each 
described the job to family and friends as a 
pivotal step toward a future goal.

Instead, last Sunday night, in several horrific 
moments, those lives ended together. They were gun-
ned down execution-style in the back room of the  <---
Starbucks on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown, a 
trendy coffee shop in an affluent Washington nei-
ghborhood that is seldom touched by such violence.

D.C. police detectives still don't know what happened 
in that room sometime after 9:15 p.m. Preliminary bal-
listics tests indicate that 10 rounds were fired from 
two guns in what may have been an attempted robbery. 
But police have said no money was stolen from the  <---
store, a point that haunts the victims survivors.
...
Mary Belle Annenberg, Caity Mahoney's mother, said 
that one day Chelsea Clinton walked into Starbucks. 
Caity was thrilled. She had worked as an intern for <---
President Clinton in the White House. But Chelsea <---
couldn't find any money. Caity reached into her 
pocket and bought the president's daughter a 
hazelnut latte.
...
Caity, the coffee shop's assistant manager, was 
first shot once in the chest, police said. She had 
raised her hands to her face, possibly to protect 
herself. A bullet pierced her hands and hit her 
face. Then she was shot in the back of the head. 


========================================================

 IAN: Despite a $100,000 reward offered by Starbucks 
 for information leading to an arrest of the killers,
 the Starbucks massacre remains unsolved. There was 
 a person who offered to provide police information 
 on the murders but before he could help, he was 
 murdered (Washington Post, 11/06/97). 

========================================================

 The following is excerpted from: Strategic Weekly 
 Briefings, by Craig Karpel, January 23, 1998:


According to my sources, when Monica Lewinsky first met 
with Vernon Jordan in November 1997 she told him she 
didnt want to end up like Caity Mahoney. Jordan pro-
fessed not to know whom Lewinsky was referring to until 
she identified Mahoney as the former White House intern 
who was murdered last summer in a Starbucks. The Starbucks 
murders were big news in Washington because, as D.C. 
Council member Jack Evans put it, "To have a triple 
homicide anywhere in the District of Columbia is an 
unusual event. To have a triple homicide in Georgetown 
is extraordinary." 

My sources tell me that Jordan gently told Lewinsky not 
to let her imagination run away with her and assured her 
that she was in no danger of being murdered on orders 
from Bill Clinton or anyone associated with Bill Clinton.

And what of the unsolved murder of Caity Mahoney?

A $100,000 reward offered by Starbucks hasn't caused 
anyone to come forward.

The police have gotten nowhere. Virginia Mahoney, Caity's 
stepmother, worked for six years in the U.S. attorney's 
office in Baltimore assisting crime victims families. 
"I'm furious," she says. "If there's one thing I know, 
it's service to crime victims, and we're not getting it."

 If it were easy to see, I'd expect lots of people to be working on it.
We're discussing building atomically precise objects with several degrees
of freedom for controlling their motion, with successive generations
of designs being easier to use and/or able to build a wider range of
objects. I presume this would eventually be used to bootstrap a diamondoid
assembler at some point, but I haven't tried to analyze that step yet.

 Bruce and Markus have written down some more detailed, but still quite
incomplete, expanations of their ideas. I'll encourage them to put those
on www.nanodevices.com (nothing worth looking at there yet).

 Obviously stiffer arms would be nicer. My impression is that they will
be good enough to push proteins into postions that will enable covalent
bonds to form that would otherwise be rare. Do you have any hard data on
how the flabbiness will affect this, or are you just giving a gut reaction?

>But what is all this meant for?

Building things by putting protein, dna, and eventually other
things where we want them.

I haven't thought that about Clinton, but do think it about the tobacco
companies, which combined with the 'sin taxes' leaves me unconvinced
that the companies haven't been denied a moral equivalent of due process
and no double jeopardy.

A point, in my personal experience, if helping another involver either
nonexistent or trivial cost to me I will almost always help.
I think that it's safe to assume that this would also be the case for the
"average" >H entity. 
Given the tech base we assume for the mere existence of such I would expect
that bootstrapping others to fall into the above and therefore happen on
the "Why not?' principal.

Agreed, if we can reach "critical Mass" the need for a ghetto (which is
what it would likely turn out to be) becomes superfluous.

I'm sure that the AI just called someone and paid them a lot of money to
build it.


I loved the episode but a lot of my cyber friends found it a bit too
"Gibson."

I like the idea of the distributed network brain. Why did they really think
killing the T3 to the RV would be enough?? that's what I didn't
understand... then again... we're talking about mainstream TV.

Yes, this is an interesting question I've thought of before. Remember she's
followed around all day by body guards which look like college students. A
better question might be, when is she going to get away with anything that
they don't know about??? Sex? Dating? Drugs? She's a perfect target for
terrorists. What if someone was to dose her with MDMA or LSD or something?
What about just poison her..

Hi.

I actually have a fair idea of pricing/locale issues for islands in various parts of the world.  I've been talking to real estate brokers who specialize in islands to get a handle on costs, so I'll relay some of the knowledge here.

First, it is really quite easy to buy in island in most parts of the world.  Most countries are more than willing to let you buy islands, especially since many of the worlds available islands are owned by third world and developing countries.  

I've only looked in the Pacific Ocean, so there may be better deals/locations in other parts of the world.

For an undeveloped resort-class (white sandy beachs, palm trees, plenty of flat land for development) tropical island, the costs vary greatly depending on proximity to other popular resort areas.  For an island within a few nautical miles of an island with a significant size town/resort, the costs tend to be around US$50k/acre.  However, for an island of equal quality but a bit farther from "popular" (i.e. tourist) areas, the costs quickly drop to about US$5k/acre.  Note that the costs have less to do with the proximity to "useful" locations as they do with proximity to "popular" locations.

At the low end (which is the smarter buy IMO), you can buy a nice tropical island with a surface area of roughly a square mile for something like US$4M.


Alternatively, if you move to higher lattitudes, you will find much larger landmasses available at significantly cheaper prices.  One location that I have found attractive is the coastal islands off British Columbia.  There are many very large islands (25-250 square miles) and countless smaller ones, mostly uninhabited.  While technically owned by the state of Alaska, these islands have warmer winters than most of Europe, but cooler summers.  The reason these islands may be of interest is because several islands are owned and occupied by various secessionist or unusual groups already so what we are talking about would not likely be noticed.  Natural resources are extremely abundant and land is cheap, roughly US$1-5k/acre depending on the specifics (esp. with regards to quantity of timber).  Also, you are maybe two hours out of Seattle, and can easily get a fiber link to the North American mainland.

As a side note, when I was last in this region (last August) I learned that several Silicon Valley semiconductor firms have been considering opening fabs on some of these islands because of the availability of large quantities of fresh water (for free!), very accessible shipping facilities, and the potential for large quantities of cheap electricity, while still being in close proximity to a major tech city (Seattle).  Whether or not this happens remains to be seen, but it is interesting.

Dear all,

(sorry, no spelling checker)

I've got some questions about, if what I wrote was
just plain fun, or if I really wanted to pull something
of like this.
(freedombuilder, I signed up for the mailing list, so
 I am eager to learn more....this mail is more like 
a thought experiment)

Altough I didn't investigate all the "freedom" related
issue's very well, so I might miss some things allready
thought of, I wanted to present a vision closer to my heart.
As far as I can tell, most of them focus on the "make a lot
of money in a free enviorment". Don't get me wrong here, I
am not against making money. But it's not why I would 
become involved in a project like this. My idea would start
a bit smaller and more idealistic. I believe strongly in the
"oil-spill" effect....build it step by step:

Imagine:

A tropical island of 5000 X 4000 meters (20.000.000 m2)
(maybe you could start with a smaller one)

Price: 30.000.000 usd (based on the selling price of 
 John Wayne's  Taborcillo-island near Panama (360.000 m2) for 
500.000 dollar.

We will only use (at first) one half of the island. The rest is
for public use, and is maybe not suitable for buildings, like
the beaches, etc...

 so: 30.000.000 / 10.000.000 m2  = 3,-- usd per m2

 Double this so that we will have 30.000.000 to spend 
 on the public places.....so we sell for  6,-- us per m2

This means, if I want to own 200 m2, I will pay 1200, -- usd
I could build a small tent there in the begining....and visit
it a few times a year to help building the society we want.
People with (small) businesses will buy more m2, of 
course....... 
But I think you could be suprised by the amount
of people, who just would like to own a small part....
even students (beginners/idealists/etc....) can join...

With the other 30.000.000,-- we will build, the harbour,
the public liberay, activity-centre, web-conection,
boats, a few cars...and other tools.

Everybody can join the island IF they accept (sign)
the Transhuman/Extropy rules (to be discussed)
(the laws and penalty's...shouldn't be needed
of course....but ..well....you know...)

So, I imagine, small software start-up company's
buying a few m2, were they live and develop.
....An importer of goods/food/etc.....
....An eco farmer, who will run a small food-chain
based on new technollogy.......
........a dutch bloke :-) running a camping for students....
tents allready there, for low prices........
....Biotech start-ups, expirimenting with new techniques
...etc..etc.....


It's a democtratic -webbased deciding/rule system.
You can vote for everything concerning the public
space of the island (for technical or difficult, things
you have to do an "exam" so you will vote educated)
Something becomes only a problem when one drops
it in the "discussion group" and asks for a vote....
e.g: a biotech firm, wants to expiriment with some
dangerous viruses....then they first have to convince,
the group that what they do will be save......

When the island becomes to crowded, you could think
of expanding to the sea with the suggested "oil-tankers"
(how far do you own the sea ?)

Of course among the first businesses I would 
expect the Cryo-firms.....you can die in peace,
and you can be freezed as perfect as possible,
this alone could generate some money, together
with the "low-budget" tourism actions.....
Just imagine a tropical island, with net-access,
a lot of very interesting people, knowledge
centre's.......and the fun of vacation.
If I rent my tent to people for 100 usd a month,
I have earned my investment back, within a year.
...and I can start thinking of real house :-)

At first it's a lot like starting a camping site.....
But once, people come more often, actually 
build new things, companys start selling goods,
etc.... it will grow step by step.....
Get more scientiffic conferences. Have leaders
of other country's visiting us, to see what we are doing
(a new vision on the goverment) etc......

:-)   OK....I will stop now with my idealistic (naive) 
day-dreaming....
Still.....I am looking forward to other idea's, because
it could be done :-)

For the list-member, who think this is pure noise,
I suggest that we use THC (TransHumanCountry), so you
can delete it right away.......

Have a great day!

Greetings,

Berrie

Direct democracy with no limits on the powers of government???

The premise is good, but...  Why not try eliminating public areas, and
instituting a system of permanent (unchanging) minimalist laws?

Also, I'm dubious that Transhumans from around the world would come and
live on the island for fun.  Frankly, if I were to start an island like
this, I would expect that the main source of immigration would not be
biotech firms or a camping industry; but rather those thought to be
criminals by authoritarian governments.  Simply by making it publicly known
that the island is a permanent political asylum whose laws are strict but
minimalist, a community may emerge from those who simply have no place else
to go.

We may even supplement this by building the harbor and the airport first;
making the private choice (not the public policy!) to send out boats and
planes to those places desperate to escape from their homeland and bring
them to the island.

Thoughts on this?

In a message dated 98-02-16 20:49:38 EST, you write:

<< 
 It doesn't need diversity, it just needs those particular organisms.
 Any organism that needed biodiversity in the desert wold be in a 
 bad way - deserts have relatively low biodiversity.
  >>

But not microbiologically low in biodiversity.  Anyway. . . Now _you_ also are
placing limits on the range of biodivertity and I think that is exactly what
your argument opponents are also saying--so you both agree.

Curt, you seem to be arguing a moot point--increasing biodiversity from simple
to complex lifeforms has already _caused_ the abundance of life on Earth by
adding more and more life in hostile environmental niches. 

And evolution is self-perpetuating the biodiversity, whether the _rate_ of
biodiversity is increasing or not.  

<<The scare tactic "save the wild environment or we're all gonna die!"
is bogus and, as such, will fail in the end. >>

It _is_ IMNSHO a scare tactic.  There is no evidence that humans will have
desire to, are now, or ever will _be_able_ to decrease or increase (i.e.,
control) biodiversity to any statistically significant extent.  When you pull
on it here, it stretches there.  And I am _not_ talking just about life on
Earth!

 (In a way, our own human bodies are biodiverse, each cell type doing it's own
function.) 

There are however some 80,000+ parasitic/symbiotic triad interactions that
seem to need (if not "biodiversity") at least each other to complete their
life cycles.  The ones I work with are plant-mold-insect triads.  The plant
needs the mold to process nutrients and the insect carries the mold to the
soil where the seeds then germinate.    Many of the triads are used to
colonize adverse environmental areas.  It is a big mistake to do what
classical microbiologists do--"isolate" microogranisms from there biological
help-mates many can't not survive at all then.  

For instance it is (so far) impossible to repair many kinds injured cells
without the correct pre-formed peptides from other species.  It is possible to
synthesize the peptides if we knew which ones there were, but right now we
don't.  It is biodiversity that helps this microbiological research, by
showing us how problems were already solved by nature.  Biodiversity will help
humans live in a greater array environments because of this--already has, e,g,
cold weather survival technology,  deep sea survival are both based on animal
and plant survival strategies.

_Listeria_monocytrogenes_ in a nutrient starved environment, can not repair
damage nor grow without specific deuteromycete (a group of mold species) by-
products.  

If fleas would die--birds would go blind because the fleas clear fecal matter
from baby bird's eyes.

If the Eucalyptus trees die--the Koala dies because that is all their enzyme
systems can digest.--an old kid's school example.

If you kill off all bacteria in humans--the humans die because _Candida
albicans_ colonizes the humans and kills the humans.  This is called
"competative inhibition."

If you kill off the nitrogen cycle microorganisms--the plants die and that
kills off the rest of the food chain, including humans.  Same for the oxygen
cycle and the carbon cycle.

If you have only one species left--say humans--and a virus like AIDS invades .
. .  the only salvation is in that specie's own genetic "biodiversity."   In
our case that is not much protection since probably 99.9999999% (9 logs = in
the billions) of the human population is susceptable.  I wish humans
themselves had more genetic "biodiversity."

My first thought about this - as with James' useful report - is that I
wouldn't wish to pin all my hopes and investment on a tropical island in an
era when global warming (if it's a reality) threatens to submerge or
regularly inundate quite a few of them.  How galling to be frozen and then
thawed by salt water...

  mailto:illegalart@detritus.net (http://www.detritus.net/illegalart)

           RTMARK FINDS BUCKS FOR BECK RIP-OFF 
           Group channels money for subversion, 
       hopes to spark dialogue on corporate wrongs 


RTMARK is pleased to announce the February 17 release of a new Beck CD:
Deconstructing Beck. 

Recording artist Beck might be less pleased.  Why?  Because it isn't
really his work.  Deconstructing Beck is a collection of brilliant but
very illegal resamplings of Beck, produced by Illegal Art with the help of
$5,000 gathered by RTMARK from anonymous donors. 

Deconstructing Beck is the latest of more than twenty successful sabotage
projects made possible by RTMARK since its beginnings in 1991.  RTMARK's
aim is to further anti-corporate activism by channelling funds from donors
to workers.  Other recent and upcoming acts of RTMARK-aided subversion are
documented on RTMARK's web site, http://www.paranoia.com/~rtmark. 

According to an anonymous RTMARK spokesperson, RTMARK was first approached
by Illegal Art last November. "Using artwork illegally helps fight the
stranglehold that corporations have on our lives, and that's what we're
all about," the spokesperson said.  "We weren't sure about this project at
first, since RTMARK usually targets the crassest of mass-produced items.
But while Beck may be a superb artist, his lucrative persona remains just
another product that others get rich from, and one that we need to
subvert." 

Philo T. Farnsworth, the pseudonymous main force behind Illegal Art, says
his label exists to provide "an outlet for artists interested in exploring
an illegal palette.  Corporations invade our lives with product but forbid
us to use it--in our art, or in any way they don't want.  This just
doesn't make sense." 

What does makes sense, given the corporate climate, is that record stores
won't touch this CD.  It is available only from Illegal Art
(mailto:illegalart@detritus.net), and costs just $5, including US postage.
Illegal Art was able to keep production costs low by packaging the CD in a
plain white box and putting its liner notes on their web site.  Even more
importantly, the cost of the CD reflects a markup of only 100%, instead of
the industry-standard 800%.  (The page with the liner notes,
http://www.detritus.net/illegalart/beck/, also features 30-second
RealAudio(tm) clips of each track.) 

Illegal Art's email and web service, incidentally, is provided by
detritus.net, an internet site dedicated to the artistic reuse of
pre-existing culture.  "We're happy to be helping out with the Beck
project," said Steev Hise, Detritus webmaster.  "Copyright laws are too
restrictive, and they're counterintuitive.  These laws in their present
form are there just to funnel money to corporations, not to protect
artists.  As artists we need to fight that."

Which is why I'm hot on the tanker idea (which I brought up btw). In the age of
global warming, one profit center will be ferrying refugees off islands that
are sinking..... Or using the tankers as construction bases to build
floating/underwater communities for these people. Since most people through
history don't move much, if something happens, they just build on top of the
wreckage, I predict that global warming will foster the beginning of the
colonization of the oceans. Being the architects and contractors  of this new
fronteir could be quite profitable.

James, have you any info on the current market prices for slightly used surplus
tankers...?

Oh, there is more to it than that, if you take the Bible literally.  
The description in Revelations (if I remember correctly) of how well 
illuminated Heaven is, can be fed into some fairly standard 
calculations.  And the conclusion that is compelled is that Hell 
absolutely must be *much* cooler -- because sulfur is a liquid, not a 
vapor.

Unfortunately, I don't remember where I came across this little 
trivia point.

There is the question of whether all the sexual activity is 
consensual, or whether some of it constitutes abuse of authority -- 
with the proviso that if one of these ladies *wanted* to have sex 
with the President, that wasn't Clinton's fault; what I am concerned 
about is the potential for suggestions (ranging from extremely vague 
hints to blatant declarations), coming directly or indirectly from 
Clinton, that sex would be rewarded or refusal punished.

I would point out that exactly the same concerns arise in regard to 
lying about sex, though.  And it is moderately well established that 
Clinton himself *did* instruct, in an employer-to-subordinate mode, 
one of his staffers to lie about certain meetings with one of his 
alleged mistresses.  That is enough in my mind to establish abuse of 
authority.

And for that matter, "None of your business" would have won Clinton a 
*lot* of sympathy *without* being a lie.  Clinton chose an 
unconvincing lie over a convincing truth.  On his head be the 
consequences.

Unfortunately, in spite of all that, I find myself compelled to 
support him and hope he survives the scandal -- for as long as Gore 
is next in line.

I have similar reservations as to putting a large investment into a
tropical island.  Many of the tropical islands have very little elevation
above sea level.  Any number of natural occurences (large storm surge,
tsunami, oceanic meteor impact) could have devastating consequences.
Additionally, most of the smaller islands are not much more than
sand-logged coral reefs with only marginally substantial foundations.
While fine for a tropical bungalow, I would be more hesitant to build a
really large structure on top of it.  Tropical islands with solid volcanic
or tectonic origins *are* plentiful, but tend to be significantly larger
(i.e. expensive) than their more affordable and smaller reef-based brethren.

This is why I would seriously consider the Alaskan/Canadian coastal
islands.  These islands are built of some of the oldest, hardest rock*(see
below) on the planet, and many are more than 1000 feet in elevation.
Additionally, this is one of the calmest coastlines on the Pacific Ocean;
the water is *glassy*.  Plenty of fresh water, lots of timber, all the
seafood you can catch/eat, and a very mild climate (similar to Washington
state).  I initially visited the area only after my parents moved there
(for a scant two years) and immediately fell in love with the place.  

Of more interest to many on this list is that there is no practical force
of law in these areas.  Local laws are, for all intents and purposes,
absolute.  Visiting the local communities is a real-life demonstration of
how this can be very good or very bad, depending on the constitution of the
particular community.  In areas where strong self-discipline is the social
norm, these islands are nearly a libertarian mecca; you can do whatever you
want as long as you don't harm anyone else.  However, there are some
islands that are essentially malevolent oligarchies/dictatorships, with all
the usual bad things associated.  As an odd twist to the normal state of
affairs, the Alaskan government has more money than it knows what to do
with (oil revenues; there are no taxes in Alaska) and will gladly fund all
sorts of schools/ventures/projects just to spend it for the benefit of
improving the image of the state.  One of their latest greatest projects is
to spend their excess funds on wiring the entire state with fiber and
high-speed switches in the attempt to turn Alaska into something resembling
a high-tech state (even if they *are* missing the tech people).  Quite
frankly, there is a decent possibility that Alaska would sell you an island
"pennies on the dollar" if you promised to bring a whole lot of high-tech
expertise with you.  As I said, the southern coastal islands are *not* bad
places to live, if a bit underdeveloped.

If I was to consider a permanent location for an Extropian country (per
se), this would be my best choice based on what I know.


*INTERESTING ASIDE:  In this region is an island known as Annette Island
(385 km^2) that contains small hill of yellow rock that is much older than
the very old volcanic rock that surrounds it.  In fact, this little hill is
one of the oldest rocks known.  The interesting thing is that this rock is
also one of the toughest substances known.  Diamond is the only known
substance that can cut this rock without rapidly destroying the blade of
the cutting tool.  This rock eats tungsten carbide/nitride alloys for
lunch.  Once considered to be an asset worthy of export, the cost of
cutting it proved to be too high to make the extremely hard rock a
commercially viable building material.

I don't know yet when the film will be screened in Europe - I'm going to
the US this week and if I get any information on dates of European
screenings, I will let you know.

In answer to your query of why the title VIRTUAL OBSESSION, I have to put
my hands in the air and say "not guilty!"  The choice of title for Mick
Garris who directed has always been HOST, but ABC in their infinite wisdom
decide this was stronger.  They could be right, who knows?

You ask if this title implies that the search for immortality is an
obsession in the story, and yes, it is, but almost every scientific
breakthrough in the history of man has been the result of an obsession,
frequently in the face of heavy criticism.  The bigger the breakthrough,
the heavier the criticism - look at Gallileo and Darwin as two examples.  I
think it is right that there should be criticism over man's search for
immortality.  I wholly believe that we are right to challenge the dominance
of Mother Nature and to take control of our world and our destinies, but
there are all kinds of issues that need to to be addressed, and which will
be addressed for sure over the coming decades as we move closer and closer
towards it.  But it is also a hugely exciting issue.  We are at a giant
frontier - but who knows - in a few decades time we could be at yet another
frontier, when we discover totally new dimensions, that may make our search
for immortality puny by comparison....

How often have you helped the birds, the fish, the ants in distress? We

I was hoping to find an overlooked point, as to why an entity should show
restrain (or even do 'good') towards one significantly less powerful/smart
than itself. Alas, apart from Ander's pretty pathological case (open
descension/ascension hierarchies, with persistance of the identity (is
such a thing at all possible? -- I thought it was a function of
rerecognizing agent history of _nonnegligeable_ interactions)) there seems
no positive return on such an investment. 

I do not see the present reason for such human actions beyond of
anthromorphic perception artefact ('aw, let's help the poor blighters'),
which >H systems are quite unlikely to inherit.

However there is a fundamental problem with gravity shielding, 
it could be used to construct a perpetual motion machine thereby violating

There's a big distinction between low biodiversity and low biomass.
Polar seas have low biodiversity, for oceans, but are extremely
productive during the summer.  Our own farms are exceedingly low
in biodiversity, but breathtakingly productive nonetheless.

The biomass we survive on comes mostly from our own farms.  The only
major sources of wild biomass for food we still have is fish, and
it appears that is rapidly coming to an end and being replaced by
fish farms.

Do I really need to cite the over 67 Medline studies that show 
substantive harm or effects of treatment?  Medline doesn't even 
include psychological studies, which number in the hundreds.  I'm 
really surprised to find such statements on a list that so actively 
supports the sciences. 

Opponents of such diagnoses as Gender Identity Syndrome and
intersexual syndromes have been developing strong cases based on
medical evidence, and they are gaining the support of influential
researchers--where is the same for pedophilia?  If one of you would
bother to spend five minutes in a database such as ERIC, MedLine,
WorldCat, NIH, or FirstInfo and dig up something substantial, I'll
listen.  Otherwise I just don't see the point in continuing this
based on claims of a lack of evidence in the medical community or an 
opinion that psychology itself is bogus.

Sin,

  IAN: That's a valid argument. Also, as I understand,
  military code states that adultery is grounds for 
  dishonorable discharge. That would mean that such
  activity is by law a proper area of concern for 
  military personnel -- wether it should or should
  not be. Since Clinton is the Commander in Chief, 
  the supreme leader of the military....

  IAN: Of course being the conspiracy type, I think
  this is all a calculated diversion from the real
  issues, being the real crimes of the Clinton 
  administration, such as mass murder in Waco, as
  evidenced/proven by FLIR video, links to the OKC 
  bombing, to the TWA 800 coverup, and to the deaths
  of many people. The theory would have it that the
  "real planners" are getting Clinton out before 
  other far more devastating news comes to light. 

  But of course the Establishment (GovtMedia) has
  done a pretty good job of preventing justice so
  far, I also can't see why they cannot continue 
  to do so. So the current affair is strange. But 
  suffice it to say there is far more serious mis-
  conduct connected to Clinton than telling a staff
  intern to deny that she sucked on his penis. Ulti-
  mately everyone knows everyone else does something 
  sexual, but to know that leaders willfully engage
  is murder and mayhem is detrimental to the con-
  tinuation of the current state of leadership.
  So he get's nailed for the "acceptable."

Forgive me, I've been reading too much Deleuze &
Guattari (lost in _A Thousand Plateaus_) and find
oracles of bifurcation and destratification leading
to singularity, as epitomized by the classic story of
Oedipus Rex, somehow relevant for the possible
Posthuman Child's blind relationship to His human

As for "open descension/ascension hierarchies, with

describing our reliance on the subhuman critters and

somewhat like "The Machine at the Heart of Desire:

Better yet, glance at this bit of inspired
gobbledygoop for a burst of what I'm bubbling about:

< Thought is molecular and olfactory. Thought is the
absorption, penetration, filtration, and
configuration of particles and molecular chains

our history we began to emphasize the secondary five
senses as if they were primary. This was a step of
alienation, as it created a sense of distance between
ourselves and the world, when in fact all perception
is molecular and we are literally homeopathically
bathed in the world on a constant basis. We are in
chemical communion with the surrounds. [CUT]
Essentially the brain is a networked, highly
differentiate, and electronically accessible storage
center of various chemicals; in other words, the
brain is not an electronic computer, but a

allow the rest of the body through the nerves to
activate molecular memories and assemblages. In other
words, the viscera runs the brain and not vice-versa.
The brain is not the master control center, but a

There's much more about the "ongoing battle between

how "the sensicality of the molecular realm is

gopher://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/0R2950-11214-/pubs/listservs/spoons/deleuze-guattari.archive/deleuze-guattari.9712

To try and veer this back toward "Intra-Entity
Ethics" (especially in light of your Long Now URL for
Danny Hillis's essays), here's the conclusion from a
book review that didn't make the cut for EO 1.0:

< George Dyson leads up to the end of DARWIN AMONG
THE MACHINES by citing his namesake grandfather who
developed modern grenade warfare while also being an
accomplished musician. This leads into Connection
Machines founder Danny Hillis's 1988 memetic fable
about the coevolution of apes and song.

The final chapter also presents the ancient fable of
Roger Bacon's (13th century) Brass Head as a metaphor
for the development of computers, AI and the global
communications network: "we stand transfixed, like
monkeys given a mirror, by the novelty of our own
image reflected in the surface of the web. When the
smoke clears and the master wakes, the computer as
disembodied head will have disappeared, replaced by a
diffuse tissue enveloping us in nebulous bits of
meaning, as neurons are enveloped in electrolyte by
the brain". >

Hmm, that depends on what version of the story you hear. I have the
impression the feelings were mutual, but Aurora was slightly careless
when asking Zeus about immortality. But the graeco-roman gods and
goddesses were never big on informed consent anyway...

An interesting interpretation. "Aww, now you spoiled the whole
fun!". Maybe Zeus gave Pandora her box to make the game a bit harder
for the humans, now when Prometheus had made it too easy.

Here's what my TV Guide has to say about it:

Thriller 3:00 Virtual Obsession: "A scientist and his family become the
targets of a vindictive young woman who downloadas her brain into a
supercomputer and stalks them after having her heart broken."

Hmm... just from this, it doesn't sound like a happy ending for the
extropian.  Is this movie really going to open people's minds to the idea
of uploading/extropian ideas, or just make them associate it with
"vindictive young stalker women"? (or can you answer that question without
giving way too much of the plot?)

The Soul

The complexity of our minds must at all times exceed our understanding
of our minds.  If we understand (and control) our minds fully, then
our minds have no necessary function.  A popular definition of the
soul is "that which we can never understand, that which makes us what
we are."

I don't want to give too much away of the plot and spoil the (hopefully!)
entertainment and enjoyment for you, but I can honestly say that there is a
very upbeat denoument for extropians - in fact there are some terrific
pro-extropian arguments throughout the film, and in particular one fine
scene when the hero, scientist Dr Joe Messenger pleads desperately with the
religious bigot father of his dead girlfriend to allow her last wishes of
being cryonically suspended to be carried out.

The "vindictive" woman referred to in the TV guide is indeed the dead
girlfriend, but she makes a truly wonderfulpro-extropian speech (written by
Preston Sturges and Mick Garris, not me, so I can say that!)  that is going
to make anyone who watches this think about the subject.

The problem here is what "understanding" means. I understand a glass
of water pretty well, but I do not know every molecule in it or the
detailed micro dynamics. I see no problem with understanding how the
brain produces the mind in general, it is just that we need to chunk
the information in order to make it useful ("the visual cortex
processes information in this way, and sends it to the following
areas..." instead of "neuron 34848493311 sends a spike to neuron
3478348674 and 3476421111..."), even if we could in principle look at
the system at lower levels. It is a matter of what scale we decide to
use - at a very high level the human mind becomes a single chunk, at a
very low level it becomes impossible to see for all the details. We
cannot keep a 1:1 model of ourselves in our minds, but that would not
really be understanding either. Understanding means we can think about
something on an useful level, so that we can extract relevant
information from it and predict its behavior well enough.

> A popular definition of the > soul is "that which we can never
understand, that which makes us what > we are."

I prefer the definition of my soul as the object class of which I am
an instantiation.

For additional information:
George Getz, Press Secretary

===============================================

Do you have any privacy left when Big Brother
can spy on you from space -- or through your walls?
        WASHINGTON, DC -- Spy satellites. Gamma ray scanners.
Thermal-imaging devices.
        It's not science fiction -- it's a list of the exotic,
high-tech surveillance equipment the government now uses to monitor,
track, and arrest American citizens, the Libertarian Party pointed out
today.
        "Yesterday's science fiction has become today's political
reality," said Steve Dasbach, the party's national chairman. "High-tech
military equipment that was once used against foreign armies is now
being used against American citizens on a routine basis."
        As a result, the Fourth Amendment's protection against
"unreasonable search" is under technological siege, he warned -- and
government agencies are rushing to take advantage of this new power.
        "Most people don't realize it, but law enforcement agencies are
now spying on us through the walls of our houses, taking
high-resolution photographs of us from space, and conducting drug tests
based on trace elements of chemicals in the air," said Dasbach.
        Paranoid fantasy? Not at all: Such high-tech surveillance
equipment is becoming an increasingly common tool for law enforcement,
according to reports in USA Today and the Wall Street Journal.
        Here's a sampling of how state and federal agencies are using
this terrifying technology to spy on Americans:
        * In North Carolina, county governments use high-resolution spy
satellite photographs to search for property improvements that might
increase property tax assessments.
        * On the Mexican border, police use a "gamma ray scanner" to
check tanker trucks for contraband, scanning right through the
vehicle's metal sides.
        * The Naval Surface Warfare Center has developed an "ion
sniffer," a metal box that analyzes the chemical makeup of the air --
and can detect, for example, traces of cocaine through the skin days
after drug use.
        * In Georgia, the state's Department of Revenue will start
using NASA satellites to examine the state's 58,910 square miles for
illegal timber cutting.
        * In New Jersey, California, and other states, police use
thermal imaging devices to scan houses for unusual heat sources that
could indicate indoor marijuana growing operations. Houses can be
scanned while police sit in their cruisers on the street.
        * And in Arizona, the state's Department of Water Resources
uses spy satellite photographs to monitor 750,000 acres of state
farmland, and compares the images to a database to discover which
farmers don't have irrigation permits.
        Even worse: The federal government will spend another $4.5
million this year to develop even more intrusive surveillance
equipment.
        Currently under development by the Justice Department: A "super
x-ray" -- combining traditional x-ray technology, ultra-sound imaging,
and computer-aided metal detectors -- to reveal items hidden under
clothes from up to 60 feet away.
        The courts are currently wrestling with the implications of the
new technology, debating the limits of the government's power to
"search" individuals from a distance with high-tech gadgets. Several
contradictory court decisions have already emerged, for example, about
whether thermal-imaging searches are Constitutional.
        Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic politicians continue to
look for new uses of the technology -- with some government officials
already talking about using satellite surveillance to track items as
small as backyard porches to check for zoning violations and
construction permits.
        "In the name of fighting crime, politicians seem eager to
obliterate the protections against unreasonable search, with equipment
that Americans used to only read about in Tom Clancy technothrillers,"
said Dasbach. "It's time for the American public to wake up and realize
that Big Brother is here today -- and he's got a gamma ray scanner in
his hand."

While I agree that the kind of absent-minded foresight exhibited by Tithonus
dominates the thinking of most people when they are formulating their opinions
on immortality, I believe there are some fairly sophisticated concerns about
the idea of immortal humans.  The most obvious question is what effect would
immortality have on human society?  Some effects would appear evident but I'm
not so sure.

Immortality would:

"be the downfall of religions":  I think this underestimates the concept of
religions and the grip they have on the general populace.  Religions do more
than just offer a solace from that "death thing".  Religions give people a way
to get along in an otherwise incompehensible (from their point-of-view)
universe.  In my opinion, religions are also some of the most powerful memes in
existence and "mere" immortality would not spell their end.  It would be more
interesting to speculate what the effect immortality would have on the
evolution of memes.  Immortality might intensify the competition between memes
since they could no longer rely on the historical amnesia of ephemeral humans
to forget problematic pasts.

"allow humans to achieve higher levels of understanding of the universe around
them":  I'm not sure about this one either.  Aged people are not necessarily
more enlightened than younger people.  Most revolutionary concepts are born in
the minds of the young not the old.  Older people are considered "wiser" but
not necessarily "enlightened".

I'm not a memory expert but without memory augmentation, immortality might not
be a big advantage.  To the extent that our memories and experiences (to the
extent we can recall them) represent who we are and how we relate to our
external surroundings, immortality would only benefit it us to the extent that
it allowed people to utilize the memory capacity of the brain to its maximum.

Additionally, old people are generally rigid in their beliefs and outlooks.
Perhaps they've tried lots of lifestyles but eventually they settle on a few
beliefs and they become very set in their ways.  Imagine trying to change the
mind of a 400 year old codger.

I contest the notion that we cannot keep a 1:1 model of ourselves in our 
minds.  It is obvious that by 1:1 you do not mean "an exact duplicate, 
not merely enough information to produce an exact duplicate", since it 
is obvious that no physical system can also be another physical system 
(i.e. our brain cannot also be our brain & our body).  And it is also 
obvious that a system can keep within it enough information to reproduce 
itself, and some more information.  This is obvious since living 
organisms and computer viruses do this all the time.

So while it may (or may not) be physically impossible for a human to 
know enough to produce an exact duplicate of themselves, it is certainly 
not provable that no mind can know enough to produce an exact duplicate 
of itself + some more information.  As a matter of fact, the opposite is 
very strongly indicated, since other information systems produce exact 
duplicates of themselves all the time (computer viruses and living 
things that reproduce asexually, to within a small margin of error).

Please show me the flaw in my reasoning.

Regards,
Bobby Martin

Good points. However, the main problem in establishing an Extropian
country (as I'm sure you know) is not finding some suitable land one
could buy (there are a number of islands on the market, and many more
could be had with enough cash) , but obtaining sovereignty. You might be
able to buy an island in Alaska, but Washington is not going to let you
form your own country, even if you are Bill Gates. One might be able to
buy sovereignty from a smaller, poorer country however.

Although you might consider the climate on the coast of Alaska "mild," I
believe a tropical location would have much more appeal to most people
despite the problems you mention. Hurricanes could be avoided by picking
an island near the equator. I agree that a coral atoll would be a bad
choice, but why not investigate decent volcanic islands in the tropics?

Um, economics does not say this.  Economic theory offers us many possible
theories which might explain the lack of direct human capital markets.  The 
explanation above is only one of many.  I think a more likely explanation
is that no one has paid the start up costs to try to get a market like
this going.

Huh?  I would expect this sort of market to increase equality, by allowing
people to insure against the largest risk they face: uncertainty regarding
their future earning potential.

I'd say the more important benefit is to allow people to avoid poverty after
an upload or AI transition.  Post-transition, their wages would be worth
much less, but if they've sold some of those wages for non-wage capital,
they'll suffer less a hit on total wealth.

I would think that successful religious memes in an era of immortality would be
ones of great evangelical fervor, that would look on the world as a physical
culmination of the prophesies of long ago. That we did it ourselves will not matter
(God helps those who help themselves). What will matter will be the seeming
establishment of the long promised New Jerusalem. Once Lamarkian memetic
propagation becomes the predominate evolutionary force, people will less and less
beleive in the 'obsolescent' theory of darwinian evolution. (If its not on TV, it
ain't true). Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.

But if people are young in mind and body forever, or at least for a much longer
period, would they not retain this youthfull imagination and enlightened viewpoint?

Rather than looking at that 400 year old as a wrinkly shriveled codger, imagine
someone who looks 25 but is actually 400 years old.

Only if it is an over unity system, which I would doubt. A machine could be
made to move perpetually, but so long as the sheild is energized. I would
expect that conservation of energy would mandate that the energy required to
sheild x amount of gravity would be more than the e/t that could be generated
from the bias in the field, thus it would still need an external source of
additionally energy to keep from running down. Also, keep in mind, that if a
gravity sheild is to use any kind of what is termed 'exotic matter' then there
are physical loopholes for conservation in the presence of such matter.
Hawking has shown that causality is highly discombobulated in the presence of
black holes....

It is effectively impossible to buy sovereignty, so as long as people are
stuck on this planet, you have to look for the best choices under the
constraints given.  The Alaskan coastal islands are a pretty good match.
Advantages: lots of resources, sovereignty of a relatively benign
government, proximity to high tech, virtually no force of law (you really
have to go there to believe how far this really goes), and a reasonable
price.  You may not get your own country, but what you do get is damn close
for all intents and purposes and no one is going to mess with you.

While you may be able to obtain "sovereignty" from some small, poor
country, it is unlikely that your sovereignty will carry any weight and
will almost certainly be contested very strongly (i.e. it could be
retracted at will by the granting country).  Short of
coopting/buying/overthrowing the dictator-of-the-month of some banana
republic, you have no real options for obtaining "legitimate" sovereignty.

The coastal islands *are* mild, with a seasonal temperature range of
20-80F; much better than most of the continental US (unless you've been
spoiled by California weather ;^).  Tropical volcanic islands are usually
already well populated, since this is where most of the usable/farmable
landmass is in the ocean.  Additionally, there is the nasty problem of
volcanic activity (consider Montserat), which appears to be considerably
more frequent for island volcanoes, most likely due to their proximity to
active subduction zones and tectonic seams.  You would be much better off
buying an island that has been created by plate crumpling around subduction
zones; these are usually found in proximity to island volcanoes, but around
the rims of the ocean.  Unfortunately, essentially all of these types of
islands are owned by countries that would never consider selling you
sovereignty.  Tropical would be nice, but most islands worth considering
are not equatorial; in fact there are few islands in the equatorial regions
and virtually all of those are atolls.

Curious - this is pretty much the way I recall the storyline and overall
tone from my reading of the novel several years ago.  Apologies to the
author if he's reading this, but it certainly struck me as pretty lurid,
Gothique and downbeat. I was quite taken aback when I heard that Mr James
is an extropian, and that Max More and others on this list regarded the
novel as supporting such views.

Um, later - Peter James writes:

`The "vindictive" woman referred to in the TV guide is indeed the dead
girlfriend, but she makes a truly wonderfulpro-extropian speech (written by
Preston Sturges and Mick Garris, not me, so I can say that!)  that is going
to make anyone who watches this think about the subject.'

Good news for the film, but might not bear on the book, so I guess I should
stand by my remarks above.

One of the cleverest tricks Larry Niven ever came up with was his
realisation that old rejuvenated people would be readily detectable - by
their almost supernatural grace and effortless physical poise.  They've had
hundreds of years training in not falling over things, after all.

Whether we'll be memetically fluent with 400 years of algorithmically
compressed opinions reinforcing the same neural attractors - I would guess
not.  Many sf writers have posited a regular (once a century, say) purging
or rewriting of the memories and habits, leaving just enough to retain some
measure of continued consistent identity... assuming you wish to be
`essentially' the `same person', which most transhumanists appear to doubt.

If that last case turn out to be true, immortality would be a sham!  
Unless *something* of my self survives the ravages of time, by 
definition and simple logic, *nothing* of my self survives.  If nothing 
of my self survives, then *I* am not immortal.  If anyone disagrees with 
this conclusion, then I would counter then that you are already at least 
11 billion years old, since all of the matter and energy that composes 
your current self has existed for that long. (The transmutation of 
lighter elements into heavier nuclie during nucleosynthesis not 
withstanding).

Only moderate amounts of wine are good for your health, the French are 
overdoing it. Also, greasy food and too much sex could be contributing
factors...and maybe France just depresses the hell out of people.

So what people are really talking about is a "force field" rather than
a gravity shield. I have tried coming up with a "reasonable" gravity
shield for some science fiction games, but it stumbles on the fact
that once you set up such a shield you could put in as many
gravity-driven devices (like a wheel with one side lighter than the
other) as you want and extract an arbitrary amount of energy from the
shield, even if they are very remote. 

I'm very sceptical of this area, I don't see how it could be made to
fit with what we know of general relativity.

Partially because the "reduces death by all causes" is a wild
exaggeration, it was only good against cancer and cardiovascular
disease (good enough, of course). I seem to recall that the number of
traffic accidents in France are unfortunately very high (anybody who
has a list of french mortality statistics?).

Personally I'm a bit sceptical about this news. It is just the kind of
meme that a lot of people want to hear because it defends their
drinking (even if they are far outside the healthy range), so it gets
spread around and exaggerated. I would bet more on the mediterranean
diet instead.

That sounds about right. We and our memory are in a constant flux. THe
further we go back in time, the less we can remember. It will stay this
way until we are redesigned for total recall. 

One more reason for Uploading. Instead of dying the million little
deaths of memory loss.

Here's how I see it:

If you upload your mind into a computer by means of copying brain 
waves,(I don't know how, it just seems like that work) or however else 
you would do it, you'd still have a hard copy of your mind inside your 
body.  My point is, the mind in the computer would be a seperate entity 
that just thought like you do.  It wouldn't be you inside the computer, 
just a copy.  You'd wouldn't control the computer, the thing controlling 
the computer would only be similar to you.  Anyway, I'm just a student 
and probably am way out of my league, but it sounds like a load of crap 
to me.  Please reply.

Ahh, the "copy paradox" again. 
We seem to inevitably run into this when discussing uploading. IMHO, it
cannot be resolved with our present knowledge, since we seem to arrive at
different conclusions when deciding if the uploaded mind is "you" or
"someone else", depending on how (by which criteria) we distinguish "you"
from "anybody else". See the mailing list archive for threads on this
topic.

Bye, 
         F.P.

P.S.: Lem (who else could it be :-) has already discussed this in his
"Dialogs" as early as 1961. Can't remember, however, at what conclusions
he arrived, have to re-read it.

--My thoughts on the subject are fairly simple-minded.  

As you're uploading, and for the moment when the upload is completed, 
the copy 
IS you.  The nanosecond you have a dissimilar experience from the copy, 
you 
are separate entities.  

So in this case,  the "you" and "someone else" are both correct, 
depending on 
the time frame.  

And yes,  I do believe this was discussed earlier with a 'jumping into a
volcano' 
dialogue on cloning.  I could be wrong.

Yes the article mentioned that, and the supposition was that
the effect being seen by this shield apparatus must be some
kind of "macro quantum" effect, whereby the whole superconducting
spinning disc acts together in a single state. Or anyway 
something like that, I'm not up on quantum or even regular
physics much :-) At any rate, they think that if this is
real then general relativity will need to be modded for quantum
effects.

That is why, after all, we printed the magazines:  to establish a record on

The article mentions the average French diet consisting of large amounts of
saturated fat.  Despite this diet the French still enjoy relatively long
lifespans when compared to other regions that have comparable diets.  For
example, the average lifespan in the southeastern United States, where the
average diet is high in saturated fat, is lower than that of the French.

Then again, it was a French scientist that did the study.  Maybe its a
clandestine plot to boost the wine market. :)

I interpret "young in mind" as being open-minded and memetically malleable.
Aged people are generally not young in mind.  This is not because they are not
young in body though.  I do not see any basis for correlating a person's
open-mindedness
to their apparent physiological age.  A correlation does appear to exist because
of the way our bodies age but in an age of immortality, that correlation would
no
longer be present.

My concern was what would be the effect on society and the pace at which new
ideas are
adopted by society if there were extremely ancient (not in body) individuals
walking about?
Progress has often come when some particularly strong leader or group has died
out.  That
may no longer be an option in a future where people could be immortal.  Think
of the advantage
someone who has had a thousand years to establish contacts, networks, and a
power base
would have over someone just arriving on the "scene".   Imagine if someone like
Lenin or Stalin
or Roosevelt or Genghis Khan had been immortal?  What effect would that have on
the course
of history?  My first impulse is to say it would impede progress.  That may be
oversimplifying the
effects, but I think its an important issue to look at.

So let's assume that someone is uploaded while being in a state of
unconsciousness (to prevent any new experiences to both the original and
the copy), and after that the original is immediately destroyed. Now the
copy is in exactly the same state as the original. But *IS IT* the
original? What if the original is not destroyed? Of course it remains to
be defined exactly what the above "state" reallly means. I think this
leads to nothing as previous discussions have shown.

I don't think we will be able to resolve it with any amount of knowledge.
It is a philosophical problem, and fundamentally a matter of definitions.
Do you choose to define yourself in terms of a pattern of activity
(consciousness, memory, emotions, etc.), or do you identify with the
specific instance of that pattern which is located in your brain?

Essentially, this is a matter of taste, and no amount of evidence or
testimony will be sufficient to change some people's minds.  No matter
how fervently an uploaded person claims to be the same as he was in his
original body, those who define him to be a different person will simply
say that he is mistaken.

What I do expect is that as the technology develops, belief in
the effectiveness of uploading will become more common simply as a
matter of pragmatism.  People who accept that uploading (and similar
transformations) preserve their identity will have more options available
to them, and so they are likely to be more successful.  As time goes on,
this should encourage more people to adopt this position.  In the end,
we will have a minority who are committed to their original bodies, others
who follow some very "safe", gradual forms of uploading, but the majority
will view uploading as no more troublesome than a form of transportation.

Actually, I was disappointed with the episode.  Of course, I loved
seeing an episode written by Cyberpunk authors.  I enjoyed seeing
similarities with their previous work.

INVISIGOTH was rude to Scully, saying that she was too dumb to
understand the network.  Unfortuneately, she didn't really get to
demonstrate any great skill in the episode.  She didn't do anything
special or figure anything out to solve the case.  She just stated that
she was a superior intelligence without demonstrating it.

The hacker friends of Mulder quoted ancient history in Computer Lore and
then seemed to approve of INVISIGOTH because she was "hot".  They didn't
analyze how great her work was, except in the vaguest of terms as being
"very advanced".  I wish they would have demonstrated more to the
audience.

At one point they needed "someone in the Government" to track down the
T3 connection.  Shouldn't the network/hackers/cyberpunks have been able
to do that?  This probably was a plot device to allow Mulder to track
down the chicken-farm trailer and get there first, but if a non-network
government man can trace a network connection to its source faster than
the cyberpunk/chic who wants to upload and live in the net, then it
doesn't show a superior knowledge of the network.

I also wish the street-smart attitude was explained as resulting from
hiding from the government and/or avoiding industrial espionage. 
Without a proper background explanation, INIVISIGOTH appeared to be a
homeless corporate drop-out living in a box and surfing the net all
day.  She also didn't appear very street smart to me, just tough and
rude.  She played her music so loud that Mulder and Scully could zoom in
right to her box, etc.  She had no defenses and could be completely
taken over by Mulder and Scully with a handgun.

I also wish there was more technology being used by the cyberpunks. 
Except for their connections to the Internet and their taking-over of
other people's computers and satellites, they didn't seem to have much
of their own personal stuff.  I wish they would have faught back more
via the computer and network, and relied less on guns, handcuffs, and
FBI agents to respond.  When the satellite was zooming in, I wish they
would have faught back on the computer more.  I wish there were more
weapons than the telephone calls in the beginning and the satellite.  I
wish the network entity could track them by credit card purchases,
cameras in stores, records in the FBI, or anything more than just
tapping their phone line.  As long as they stayed off the phone, the
network entity was helpless, which is unrealistic given how much of our
lives are recorded by computers.

I know I'm being picky.  I loved the episode for personal reasons. 
However, as a tool to educate the public, I don't expect nonExtropians
to have learned much if anything from this episode.  It didn't
demonstrate or prove any points.  It just alluded to most things that
only insiders applauded with all their ramifications.  Outsiders just
watched with little interest.

Of course as Dennis Miller says, That's just my opinion...  I could be
wrong...  (Maybe I'm just greedy and want more, more, more!)

This is the great delima. Where do you stop and say, "most people don't
understand the logistics of this, so lets dumb it down, simplify it??" I
think that the X-Files does this A LOT. There are actually only a few
episodes where I think they demonstrate complex plot devices. In fact, the
only real episodes seem to pivot on goverment conspiracy plot devices. I've
always thought that the non-related episodes were somewhat weak.

I'm not disappointed with this episode when you contrast it to previous
episodes from the "non consipiracy" category. Do you remember the first
murderous AI episode?? PURE STINKY TRASH.

But that's just my opinion..

Hi Extropians,


I'm new here. I've decided this issue will be my first 'jump' into a
transhuman discussion. I've been lurking about for a while.


This subject seems to contain some curious facets to me. :-)


The term 'mind' as used in the various arguments appears very squishy to
me. If indeed <bold>memory stores</bold> exist within the geographic
substance of the brain/body in a manner analogous to a computer hard
drive, then solving software/hardware issues would seem a fairly straight
forward physics problem. Once solved, copies of stored memories could be
duplicated in a familiar manner. The result would likely resemble a
computer based autobiography. Of course just moving memories about
doesn't seem to me to address the identity issue. We'd have to also
transfer decision making abilities, response patterns, beliefs and etc.
One difficulty I'm considering here centers about the remote sensory
sites geographically located within the physical body such as the nerve
endings in the skin, visual receptors, taste buds etc. We can pretty
quickly notice that in responding to some strong stimulus in the physical
world our bodies act as feedback mechanisms. We for instance
<bold>experience </bold>fear, anger, joy, love and etc. in many more
places and in many more ways than simple intellectual algorithms. You may
remember such an experience in detail and notice many physiological
elements.=20


Many of us have watched the pathos of 'Mr. Data' on Star Trek. His
struggle to understand the responses of 'humans'. It appears to me that
the 'human' manner of experiencing emotion in our bodies contributes
significantly to our human abilites. The 'hunches' that lead to 'eureka'
and facilitate discovery, breakthroughs and paradigm smashing don't seem
to have a place within the algorithmic functioning of pure intellect. Do
transhuman aspirations include leaving behind this 'sensory' or
physiological aspect of continuing consciousness?


Some may initially suppose that unemotional existance would be
desireable. But so far I know of no examples, or models that suggest the
human ability to 'jump' beyond logic to a 'break through' kind of event
can be duplicated or simulated by simple number crunching. And medicine
and/or science has not to the best of my knowledge been able to locate
memory storage sites or consciousness locations within the bits and
pieces of the body/brain. The tissue and fluids at best seem to exist as
'processors' of information and response mechanisms, not the location of
storage or the actual generaters of thought or action.


So my thinking and experiences ask for more clarification about this
uploading stuff. One of my grad school profs, many years ago, suggested
that there existed an FM component about understanding our conscious
functioning. FM here means F---ing Magic. We haven't yet found the
location of 'ME'. Our mindbody so far seems to exist much more
analogously to the Mars Rover ( remotely operated robot ) than to a
self-contained sapient entity.


<bold>If </bold>the Mars Rover analogy more accurately depicts our
functional existance within this 4 (at least) deminsional timespace
continuum then perhaps looking for a software/hardware solution to
uploading consciousness to a new location is misdirected effort???
Perhaps we might direct some effort towards identifying and interacting
with the remote signal origin. This 'Houston Control Center' may already
have the information that at some point we will need alternatives not
apparent to us. Conversly they may <bold>not</bold> have that information
and expect us to send that information back to Headquarters so they may
take action.=20


I do not suggest this as a pun or in any 'spiritual' frame of reference.
I simply think that the idea's I have seen so far on this list don't
address the reality of science as I understand it today.=20


>>>... IMHO, it cannot be resolved with our present knowledge...


Yes. And perhaps because the search for <italic>whatever</italic> has
been directed off course?


>As you're uploading, and for the moment when the upload is completed,=20

>the copy IS you.  The nanosecond you have a dissimilar experience from
the >copy, you are separate entities.=20


If we were able to transfer 'hard data' from one location (our body) to
another (our clone body) the resulting transfer would likely create
dis-belief for both 'individuals'.  Our experiential data recorder would
not be recording the other sites data. Even going into the process aware
that "I" was being uploaded "I" would not believe in the success if "I"
could not access the experiences of the clone. Nor do I believe the clone
could accept the 'sameness' of its origin. So now we have two individuals
which want their continued existance... =20

>

>So in this case,  the "you" and "someone else" are both correct,
depending on=20

>the time frame. =20

>

I would change this statement to read "...the "you" and "someone else"
are both confused..."


But if our essence resides outside of a remotely controlled robot body
duplicating reciever sites might create new issues. :-) Or if the control
signal has a very tight focus perhaps not.


For those who have made it this far, thanks for reading my wonderings and
wanderings. I will be interested in different viewpoints.=20


Thanks,


Roy Roberts, 1998

If you're immortal (preferably in some kind of uploaded form) and able
to create/do about anything you wish, then what's the rush? The only
reason why progress is so important *right now* is because we're still
such limited, *mortal* creatures. Gods, on the other hand, can afford 
to chill out. If there are no significant changes to your identity for a
long time, that is no problem as long as you're enjoying yourself and
your safety is not infringed.

P.s: I assume that biological "immortality" (no aging) and uploading
(in whatever form) will arrive at about the same time, so that there
will never be a real era of immortal "plain humans". Everyone who's
anyone will probably upload a.s.a.p, once the technology is refined.

Why, do you collect used cigarette butts??? Is there a market for these

Considering the direction the cigarette industry is taking, this might be a
good time to begin bin diving in earnest.... ;)

All of the above is very useful, but not a substitute for an autonomous
extropian nation. You might be relatively "free" while surfing the net,
but you still live in the real world where you're pretty much at the
mercy of the often whimsical government and "society". Furthermore,
virtual networking is nice to chat and make initial contacts, but if you
*really* want to get something done you'll still need get togeter 
IRL. Besides, a new nation is *adventure*, an energizing inspiration to 
all, a great service (refuge from persecution) and a potential source
of considerable income (something this movement is in dire need of).
Founding a new nation gives a sense of direction to transhumanism,
and it's an useful drill for the next logical step: migration to space.
This should be possible if all pioneer groups interested in this combine
their forces. Differences can always be settled once we're offplanet.

 Abstract ideas aren't very compelling without some personal incentives
to back them up. Without knowing what a power can forsee, it is hard to
tell whether the incentives you've identified will work.
 I don't agree that power/knowledge-assymmetries neccesarily makes shared
rights unreliable. I think mutual respect for property rights is a kind
of right which, once firmly established, essentially all participants have
an incentive to defend the system, and adding mechanisms to discriminate
between entities that want to use it would detract from the system.
 Particularly in the case of digital storage space (which will almost
be equivalent to life for an upload or AI), the obvious ways to respect
rights involve creating a neutral set of rules that don't include any
way of measuring how intelligent the actors involved are.
 See <a href="http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html">The Agorics Papers</a>
for some hints about how a computational ecology could evolve under which
an entity as dumb/powerless as a random number generator would interact with
humans on essentially equal terms.

 The "respect diversity" meme is one of the reasons I'm biased against
vegetarianism - I want diversity in my food.
 I don't see how valuing diversity implies giving plants a different
status than animals.

I find the view of some extropians that Host the novel had a downbeat view
on life extension and therefore is negative to extropians, to be rather
disturbing, because this was never my intention.

I wanted to make the point that immortality through science will happen
whether we like it or not,and to make people realise that yet another
development in science for which we are totally unprepared, is only just
around the corner.   Science constantly gallops ahead of our ability to
comprehend the issues it raises.  In Host, the scientist, Dr Joe Messenger
is determined to replicate human consciousness in a computer, with the
ultimate aim of humans being able to download (or upload...) their brains
into it and live on either in a virtual state, and ultimately be uploaded
back into new biological bodies.

However, without giving too much of the story away (although the film
ending is very different) although he achieves his aim, he is concerned
that the human race is not yet ready to live forever.  I don't think this
is so very different from Darwin holding back his theory of natural
selection for thirty year, or from Einstein's quandry about helping to
develop the bomb.  Surely it is a good thing for writers to creat
characters who do have a moral consciences.  Joe Messenger is a decent guy.
He realises he has achieved something that is too big a step for humans
right now.  Surely this what writers should be doing?  Examing the issues
of our times?

When the book came out, in both is paper and electronic forms, I did over
three hundred interviews, many on national television and radio in the UK
and opened up a huge debate on the whole topic, one which up until then
many people (often very eminent ones)  have chosen to ignore. I cannot in
my heart belive this did anything but good for the extropian cause.

Personally, I don't think a truly liberal community should be too close to,
let alone within, the main territory of an existing nation, especially a big one.
Sooner or later there's bound to be trouble, like with the Goa hippy community
in India. In an emergency situation, you *might* be able to smash an offensive 
banana republic, but *not* the USA, India, France etc. Btw, aren't there any
islands left with no claims on them?

Absolutely, it's better to start from scratch on your own terms. Otherwise,
you'll just switch one suppressive bureaucracy for another (and possibly a
worse one).

What *are* in your opinion the major strengths and pitfalls of a "private
community"? Is money the biggest problem, or personal rivalry, governments
etc? Maybe some others with personal experience in this field could join in, 
that would be very interesting...

Income from what, taxation?  Unless you plan to engage in plunder
nation building (indeed almost all forms of political action) are
huge resource drains.  If you want income learn a useful skill
and/or start a business, save, and invest.  Say FAR away from
things political (unless you need to engage in rent seeking to
pursue a money making opportunity).

Founding a new nation would be a horrible direction for 
transhumanism and an awful drill for migration into space.  I
want nothing to do with nations in space and/or as a posthuman.

Nations suck, please don't start another one!


Nonetheless I find these discussions somewhat interesting, not
because I thinking founding an extropian state (sounds like an
oxymoron) is a good idea, but because thinking about locations
and strategies that would maximize my freedom in this reality
is fun and perhaps will be useful someday.

In this spirit I find James Rogers' suggestion of the southeast
Alaskan islands interesting.  One other nice thing about this
location is that it seems to be seismically inactive relative to
neighboring regions.  See
<http://www.ei.gov.bc.ca/geosmin/mapinv/surfical/quake/eq3.htm>.

I'd guess that the southern islands of Chile may be another
good location to investigate: relatively nice climate, relatively
benign government.  They aren't near a major tech center, but 
they are far from the U.S., which could be useful.  Apparently
it is possible for foreigners to buy large amounts of land.  I
read recently that one of the founders of Espirit (the clothing
company) raised the ire of some Chilean businesspeople for 
buying a huge amount of land -- not because he is a foreigner,
but because he plans to give the land to the government for
a national park, thus closing it to development.

Is it? Of all possible discoveries, "immortality" must be about the *least*
threatening one. People just stop dying of old age. That's hardly going to
bring about the end of civilization, IMO. On the contrary, life might start 
to get valued some more once death is no longer an absolute certainty. 
I don't think it would be moral to withhold such an important invention, but 
rather extremely *immoral* because millions of lives are lost in the "waiting 
period", only because the scientist(s) in question *assume(s)* (in his/their 
limited wisdom) that others are too stupid to deal with extended
lifespans. Personally, I'd rather risk suffering and death as a result of 
my own decisions, than to be coerced "for my own good". In the case 
of immortality the choice is easy...let's have it NOW! :)

> Surely this what writers should be doing?  Examing the issues
> of our times?
I agree, but they can also help to shape history by presenting important
technologies in a very *positive* way (like Jim Halperin does with cryonics 
in The First Immortal) instead of the usual doom & gloom moral high horse 
stuff.

Cloning technique allows bones
to regenerate after cancer, fractures 
 
 
 
By Charlene Laino
MSNBC 
 
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 15  Scientists are nearing the day when they will be
able to regenerate bone in people who suffer fractures, lose bone due to
cancer or are disfigured by facial defects. And while the day when they can
mend a broken heart is still years into the future, researchers predicted
Sunday that cardiac tissue will also someday be regenerated, redefining old
age as we know it. 
 
     
 The technique makes the current methods of transplanting bone tissue from
either a cadaver or from another part of the body seem barbaric, one
researcher said. 

         THE NOVEL APPROACH involves using cloned genes and smart grafts to
foster bone regrowth in the area of injury, said Cato Laurencin of
Allegheny University Hospitals in Philadelphia. 
       Known as tissue engineering, the technique was made possible by the
cloning of genes that produce a natural growth factor that allows bone
cells to sprout where only dead tissue had been before.
       So far, the new strategy is working, growing new bone in injured
rats and rabbits within a matter of weeks, Laurencin told a scientific
meeting in Philadelphia. Human testing is expected within five years.
       The technique makes the current methods of transplanting bone tissue
from either a cadaver or from another part of the body seem barbaric, he said.
       And within a decade or two, he said, similar methods will be used to
repair muscle, heart and other injured tissues. As we move into the next
millennium, tissue engineering is going to revolutionize the repair,
restoration and regeneration of all types of body tissues.
       
STIMULATING BONE GROWTH
       The simplicity of the system is particularly noteworthy. A disciple
of what he calls the Volkswagen approach, Laurencin said, You dont need a
very complex system to stimulate blood vessels and bone growth. What we
need is a graft for all the people. 
       The scenario, he said, would be something like this: First, some of
the patients healthy cells are removed by a simple needle biopsy. Then,
the cells and the cloned growth factor genes are implanted together into a
graft whose appearance he likened to a crouton.
       As the cells begin to divide, the cloned genes begin producing the
growth factor protein needed for healing. Each time the cells divide, more
growth factor is produced; the process is allowed to continue for several
days before the entire complex is transplanted into the area of injury.
       Once transplanted, the grafts, grown on a scaffold composed of smart
materials that biodegrade in the body in a matter of weeks, continue to
release the growth factor, sprouting blood vessels at the injured site. The
blood vessels, in turn, provide nourishment to the stem cells that are
constantly being produced by our bone marrow, Laurencin said, and bone
cells proliferate.
       A patients graft is made from any of three compounds of varying
strengths that form a continuum from materials like those of the newer
sutures that dissolve in the body in a few days to smarter compounds
similar to the Kevlar used in bullet-proof vests. 
       A person with a simple finger fracture, for example, needs a less
durable graft that would dissolve in the body within six weeks, Laurencin
said, while a broken hip would require a graft that would last six months
or more.
       
LESS PAIN, LESS RISK
       The method is not only associated with less pain and fewer
complications than methods now used to treat bone loss, he said, but solves
the problem of supply that now limits them.
       Currently, a person with a crushing arm bone injury, for example,
has two choices: painful surgery in which a bone graft is taken from the
hip or a graft from a cadaver. The former often leaves the patient with an
agonizing limp, he said, while the latter can transmit viral diseases. Both
are in limited supply.
       All these problems are obviated through tissue engineering,
Laurencin said.
       But even more exciting, said fellow engineer Thomas Budinger, is the
possibility of using bioengineering to regenerate heart tissue.
       Even if not stricken by a disease such as cancer or a heart attack,
a person eventually dies due to old age  his heart tissue simply becomes
too old to function, said Budinger, of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. 
       But if heart tissue can be rejuvenated, he said, the healthy elderly
could expect to add decades to their lives.

Helping paraplegics to walk 
 
Scientists work on device that would bypass spinal cord 
 
By Charlene Laino
MSNBC 
 
PHILADELPHIA, Feb 17  A small device implanted in the brain that sends
signals to the arms and legs, bypassing the spinal cord, may soon allow
paraplegics to walk. A patient would only have to think, I would like to
move my leg forward, and the device would do the rest, a California
researcher said. 
 
          
      
     
            
       
From:   http://msnbc.com/news/144413.asp

 "On the Cutting Edge" front page


         THE DEVICE, which would look rather like the head of a toothbrush
 a mount with electrodes as its bristles  would work similarly to a
cellular phone, sending signals to other electrodes implanted in the
patients nerves or muscles.
       A new understanding of brain circuitry is allowing scientist to
develop the device, said Dr. Richard Andersen of the California Institute
of Technology.
       Similar prostheses are already being used to help people who are
deaf, he said. By stimulating different auditory nerves, the smart brains
are helping patients to lip-read more easily.
       The new device for paraplegics is growing out of Andersens work on
the physical organization of the brain.
       Using imaging scans called MRIs to record blood flow in the brain of
monkeys, Andersen pinpointed the part of the brain that codes for
intentions. In contrast to previous beliefs, he found that movement and the
intention to perform a movement are controlled by different parts of the
brain.
       To make sure human brains work the same way, his team then tried the
experiment on themselves, hooking themselves up to brain tracing devices
and MRIs. When they only moved their eyes, they were able to detect an eye
movement area  signaling intention  in one particular region of the
brain, he said. Similarly, when they reached their arms out, they found an
area in the brain that corresponded to the intention to move their arm.
       Thats what gave them the idea for the brain prostheses for people
with spinal cord injuries, Andersen said at a scientific meeting here.
       As the California researcher envisions it, a 6mm by 3mm array of
electrodes about the width of human hair would be implanted under the
brains surface. The wires, which are attached to a transmitter, would send
radio-type signals to other electrodes implanted in the muscles and nerves
of the arms or legs. Normally, the spinal cord carries such signals from
the brain to the rest of the body.
       Were only talking about crude movements, Andersen said, but its
better than any system that has been developed to date.
       Animal tests are about to begin, with human testing just years off.
Were over all the major hurdles, Andersen said, explaining that the time
is needed for development.
       The prostheses are being developed in conjunction with the
Huntington Memorial Research Institute in Pasadena.

It is more-or-less, and also a lot easier to implement. It can also be a
testbed for nonvirtual Extropia (which, for the record, I must consider a
yet another (and powerfully distracting at that) dream). Me, I'd just be

I think the idealist escapist in you makes you gloss over the rough edges
far too easily. Unless a full-blown neoludd witchhunt is on (then
presenting an easy target is definitely not a good idea), the interference
of state can only be considered a minor (albeit definitely
resource-draining) nuisance. Yeah, it's not pretty, but it won't hinder
your plans enough to prevent the altogether. If yes, your plans may not
have been that robust after all.

Does distributed project coordination, a focused newsfeed (time is money!) 
and digicash transfer strike a vein? The importance of _direct_ matter
manipulation may be further diminished if we consider minimal telepresence
capability expected to become available in the next two decades, or so. In
any case you could purchase the services desired, albeit efficiency might
suffer. Of course this is a just another sterile Geekonia dream. So sue
me.

Also, it is a great resource sink, and just an invitation to having you
all conveniently extinguished (yes, chronic paranoia _can_ become a
lifestyle). Btw, anybody having a wager when we will see the first
(sub)tactical nuke use, and by whom? Similiar bets as to bioweapons'?.

Judging from the cryonics movement (at least two instances?) and
Scientology dogma can be a great motivation for individual finance
resource accretion. Being a personal success beakon will make extropy look
like more than a yet another weird Californian cult. Imho. (And having ExI
not permanently teetering at the edge of bankruptcy (feel free to correct
me) should also help to increase the memefection rate somewhat).

By the time we are supposed to get hit by that fabled Singularity I'd
expect only a few 10 k persons in (mostly, cislunar) space, if at all. A
malignant Singularity will thus have an easy time to having your systems
perverted, when looking for minimax paths into space. Autistic fugitives
at the periphery ought to have a fairly good chance, though. Call me

There's a cool thing:  Abstract: It is argued that the blanket view of
religion as a disease, advocated by Dawkins, is inconsistent with the
principles of parasite ecology. These principles state that vertically
transmitted parasites evolve towards benign, symbiotic states, while
horizontally transmitted parasites increase their virulence. Most of the
world's established religions are transmitted vertically, from parents to
children, and are therefore expected to be benign towards their hosts.
Yet, certain horizontally transmitted cults, such as the Aum Shinrikyo,
seem to effectively exploit their hosts in a way similar to an infectious
disease.

Problem is, depends on who's doing the considering. Saddam's supposed
capability is not being viewed as a deterrent; it's being viewed as a
ticking time bomb that requires him being taken out. I absolutely agree
that deterrence is a good thing. But where WOMD, especially infectious
agents, are suspected, the hysteria that big states ("You can't trust
Blaupunktstein, but you can trust US") can whip up is pretty daunting.

And for a deterrent to be effective, it has to be known far enough in
advance that adversaries are given pause. To quote from _Dr. Strangelove_
(re: the SU Doomsday weapon), "...Vy DIDN'T you TELL ze VORLD, HUNH?!?"

So my conclusion is that it's not subject to a clean analysis in the
present Weltpolitik milieu.

I was referring to _bulk_ nano, not smart/sophisticated nano. Bulk nano, as

Kevlar or synthetic sapphire do.

My comment was WRT the recurrent "let's start an island nation" theme--vide
the title of this thread. Your points mirror mine. You are obviously a
great thinker. :) Plus, I hear you and I share some opinions about deeply
embedded systems and threaded interpretive languages. (big :)

The chiefest trick in getting through the cusp, I suspect, will be not
scaring the horses overmuch.
The next most difficult is fostering/following the (Biblical; so sue me!
:)) precept of not binding the mouths of the kine that tread the grain. My
personal emphasis is on figuring out how to inoculate the 2 billion plus
souls (_pace_ atheists (:)) who have never even seen a TV with the cultural
ideals of self-government. But there are still a lot of oppressed people
out there (and even around here), with old old grudges.

Distracting from what, exactly? Everyday life?

Unless transhumanists get somehow organized the chances that any of
us will make it past singularity are close to zero; the powers that be will
crush us all like worms. Only (some of) the rich and powerful are going to
make it.

A lot of small nuisances still can make life miserable. Instead of enduring 
decades of paying taxes, filling out forms for every stupid thing, waiting periods,
legal injustice, petty crime and all the other crap that's related to our societies,
you can focus on one major effort, and reap the fruits for many years to come.
A private nation is an investment that can ultimately save you a lot of money
and frustration. It's the embodyment of personal freedom and responsibility.
Of course things can go wrong, but then again you can also lose your job
and be unable to get another one, for example. Life is a risk, no matter what
you do.

Aren't all kinds of virtual activities best conducted from a safe haven with your
own sandy beach and waving palms? ;) For some very lucrative business like
new designer drugs (the "grey area" kind that's not yet universally recognized
as illegal) and virtual porn (apart from kids just about anything goes) and
world lotteries and other gambling activities (virtual or otherwise) a distant
retreat is highly recommended. Money & fun in the sun, what else could
you want?

I think you're a lot safer on your private island than in a big city, for example,
and *should* someone try to bother you (which is unlikely if you keep a 
reasonably low profile) you have at least the means to defend yourself 
(your budget is the only limit).

I think Israel's gonna see some action within the next five years or so.
The former USSR is also a likely candidate, of course, and it wouldn't
surprise me if some US city got a taste of home-brewn chem/bio before 
the end of the century. All very predictable...

How do autistic fugitives get access to the first body enhancers/upload devices?
They don't (unless they somehow build such a machine by themselves, which
is unlikely at best). Athough money will lose it's value in the singularity, it will
be crucial to have plenty of it to get a good starting point. Whoever gets hyper-
enhanced first, wins. The rest might very well die, because the greatest
threat to a superpower is another superpower, and since all humans are potential
superminds they will need to be neutralized (and killing is probably the most
efficient way). Not pretty, but nontheless a reasonably likely scenario for the
"singularity" if rich criminals and governments get this technology first.
Isolated cybergeeks don't stand a chance against these forces, but an 
organization might pull it of (construct an "uploader" before anyone
else does).

That doesn't mean the model of religion as disease is bad, merely that
biological "disease" is a broad area, including both pathogenic and 
non-pathogenic diseases.  Also, those principles are just general, not
absolute; rabies transmits quite well vertically, while nitrogen-fixing
bacteria transmit only horizontally.  

Certainly I'd agree that vertically-
transmitting religions are in general much more benign than horizontally
transmitting ones.  But some of the vertically-transmitting ones get
involved in nasty religious wars (hardly benign); while there are plenty
of fairly benign cults, especially here in California.  In this sense
religious memetic disease closely resembles biological disease, so the
proposed disease analogy is indeed quite apt.

</bigger></color></underline></center></italic>

Recent Scientific breakthroughs suggest that the manipulation of the genetic instructions passed to our children is much nearer than previously assumed.  It is time for scientists and ethicists to take a fresh look at the possibilities human germline manipulation may bring, and the challenges it may pose.  This symposium, by providing a realistic scientific assessment of the technology's potential over the next twenty years and reflecting on these possibilities is meant to serve as a foundation for the approaching public-policy debate.

</bigger>Welcome and Introduction</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>-</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>Gregory Stock

</color> 	An evolutionary perspective on germline engineering and the interplay between human biology and technology.


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>A Vision for Practical Human Germline Engineering</color><color><param>8080,0000,0000</param> </color><color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- John Campbell

</color>	Germline engineering may enable us to obtain the benefits of a century of genetic science. We now have the capacity to develop techniques to reliably and safely introduce DNA constructs into germ cells and could begin to conceive and design genetic therapies to ward off diseases and improve the quality of human life. This talk discusses how a program for human germline engineering might be structured and some of the technical hurdles it would face.


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>The Human Genome Project, Launch Pad for Human Genetic Engineering</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- Leroy Hood

</color>	Our ability to manipulate our genetics will be profoundly extended by the successful completion of the human genome project. What therapeutic enhancements to our genes might be feasible two decades from now? How close might we be to constructively altering the genes for our immune system, our development, and our nervous system? What role might biotechnology companies play in generating the knowledge and technology for human germline engineering and making it broadly available?


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>Ethics and Safety</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- Daniel Koshland, Jr.

</color>	Efforts to engineer the human germline need to satisfy appropriate ethical and safety requirements. What level of testing should be required before germline procedures are used with humans? How do the individual and global risks from human germline engineering compare with other medical and reproductive risks? Should guidelines be developed to regulate the methods by which the human genome is manipulated or merely the types of genetic changes allowed?


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>The Genetic Engineer's Tool Box</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- Mario R. Capecchi

</color>	Various procedures have vastly expanded our ability to manipulate the genome and further advances can be expected during the next two decades.  This talk examines the techniques used to engineer genetic changes in various organisms and considers their technical potential for refinement into tools for safe, reliable germline engineering in humans. The potential scope of human germline manipulations in coming generations is also considered.


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>A New Front in the Battle Against Disease</color><color><param>8080,0000,0000</param> </color><color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- W. French Anderson

</color>	Introducing healthy genes into diseased somatic cells is becoming an established medical practice. How big a step would it be to extend such therapy to germline cells? For which categories of disease might germline engineering be superior to such alternatives as somatic cell therapy, embryo selection, and traditional medical treatment? What new approaches to disease diagnosis and treatment might germline engineering offer us in two decades?


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>Aging: a Target for Germline Engineering</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- Michael Rose

</color>	Aging is multifaceted, affected by individual genes, interacting gene complexes, and environmental influences. This talk reviews our current understanding of the genetic factors which affect aging, considers how this knowledge may increase in the next two decades, and assesses the prospects of germline engineering both for ameliorating the degenerative changes that accompany aging and for retarding the aging process itself.


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>In-Vitro Fertilization:  From Embryo Selection to Genetic Design</color> <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>- Lee Silver

</color>	In-vitro fertilization will soon offer many possible new twists to traditional human reproduction, from chimeric babies and children born to their grandparents, to detailed screening of individual embryos.  This talk explores these possibilities, looking at how sophisticated such technologies as embryo screening might soon become, and how they might relate to germline engineering.


<color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param>The Road Ahead: Human Germline Engineering and Society

</color>	This panel discussion moderated by Gregory Stock will consider the technical, social and ethical issues raised during the presentations.  Panelists will include <color><param>0000,8080,8080</param>Andrea Bonnicksen, John Fletcher, James D. Watson</color>, and the symposium speakers.

Subject: $200 for a good book title...


[Note From Matthew Gaylor:  Jim Bovard for those who don't know is one
of the best writers of governmental abuses.  He is a frequent
contributor to the Wall Street Journal, The New Republic and American
Spectator.  I highly recommend his books-  Two titles worth reading
are:  <italic>Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty</italic>
and <italic>How the Gov't Screws You: From A to Z</italic>.  I'm
keeping my title suggestion secret, because $200 is well... $200) 


Matt:

I mentioned when we talked a week or so ago that I would be trying to

hustle up a new book title. If you could pass along this post, I would
be much obliged. And if you have

any suggestions - that would also be appreciated!


Thanks,

Jim



*	*	*	*	*

St. Martin's Press will be publishing a political philosophy book

of mine this fall.   Marketing experts at St. Martin's nixed the

book's tentative title so I am scrambling to find a strong

replacement. I am searching for a title that will capture the

book's potentially very broad appeal and would appreciate any and

all suggestions.


The book will focus on the nature of government power, the meaning

of freedom, the delusions of democracy, the moralization of Big

Government, sovereignty & political slavery, and the forgotten

value of freedom.


I am looking for a very hard-hitting title, similar to the short

titles I have used in the past (Lost Rights: The Destruction of

American Liberty, The Fair Trade Fraud, The Farm Fiasco, Shakedown)

$200 will be paid to the winning suggestion upon acceptance of the

-book name by a publisher.  


Thanks for the help!

Remember that since your mind is copied into the computer, the computer
would actually think it is you; it would have all your memories, your
disposition, your beliefs.  It would in fact be you, from it's point of
view, and the body of flesh and blood would in fact be you, from it's
point of view.  They would both be instances of your mind supported by a
physical configuration of matter.  From your point of view in the
computer, you were in the meat-brain, and now you are here.  From the
point of view of you in the meat-brain, you were subjected to the
scanning device, and that's it.  You in the meat-brain would have doubts
about whether you are also in the computer, but you in the computer would
have no doubts about that, although, you may wonder if the copying
process did something to the meat-brain, so that it's not really you. You
would't be controlling the meat-brain, the thing controlling the
meat-brain would only be similar to you. It's simply a matter of
perspective.

I understand the romantic appeal of Extropians having their own physical
country, but I don't understand why Extropians would want to limit
themselves to a small land area.  Aren't we *beyond* thinking of
countries in terms of land area?  Is't it more realistic to think of
countries in terms of organization, communication and resource movement? 
There is no reason a country must have all of it's regions physically
connected, either.  So, all the Extropians around the world could say (if
they wanted to) that all the land they each own will be considered a sort
of distributed country.  Or we could all say that the whole world is our
country, which happens to be full of other people playing their own
political games and dividing up the land in their own way.  We just need
to work around them and with them to achieve our goals.  In my opinion,
"countries" are for the mundane, for people who can only think in
simplistic terms.  I see the idea of a "country" as a relic from a dying
age, as global economics blurrs and erases national borders.  I think the
idea of a country is becoming less relevant to the modern world. 
Extropians don't need a country of our own;  I see little advantage in
this.  We will have a greater impact on Humanity if we are distributed
throughout the world than if we are concentrated in one small area.

I propose that two foci for extropian communities, which already seem to be in the
embryonic states: the California Enclave, focused on technology, and the Washington DC
Focus, emphasizing the cultural and political, be recognised as necessary for further
development of extropian goals.

I think that the main reason why we would like our own country isn't just to
have someplace to get away to, but to be able to travel the world as citizens
of a country we can actually beleive in, which does not make so many of the
things we would like to do illegal, and which does not confiscate such a
large percentage of our productive capacity to no measurable benefit. Another
point is to be from a country that isn't hated by so many people. While the
US has fairly high positive ratings from people in other countries, more so
than most, it also has high negative ratings, meaning that people in other
countries tend to be 'firm' in their opinions of the US and Americans.

Still another is to be able to go through your life without having to carry a
wallet full of identification just to make it through an average day
(paraphrasing Robert Heinlein's standard of a rotten society). Another
standard that our society currently fails is that one feels as though you
need body armor to get through the day, but are not allowed to carry that or
anything else you might defend yourself with.  To quote Christian Slater,"
Its better to have a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have
it."

Working for the company I currently consult for, I have gained a much greater
understanding of the amount of personal information that many companies have
on each and every person who participates in our consumer economy. I'll bet
that if I wanted to, I could in one hour or less, find out a significant
amount of information about any American on this list, that you would
normally consider to be highly private information. Probably at least some
information you would normally think it would be illegal for me to gain
access to.  This is the sort of big brother society that has been warned of,
but everybody is so absorbed in their own consumer satisfaction that they
have no idea of how much of their privacy they have given up.

For example, my mother and sister have at times used the services of Weight
Watchers, and purchased dietary aids. Two of my company's customers, that are
in the mail order business, which both sell clothing for large women,
recently added my mother and sister to their mailing lists. Since I am on a
first name basis with the system administrator at one of these companies, I
asked him how they could get both of them on their mailing list. He said that
they get information from retail drug store chains and from Weight Watchers,
which they cross reference to figure out who the overweight people are. They
also sell this information to the other mail order company.

The Transhuman World Culture InfoMark located at http://www.transhuman.org
is now UP!  

You might ask: "What is the Transhuman World Culture InfoMark?"

While a landmark acts as a prominent identifying feature (land structure or
marker) telling us that we are at some *important* place, the Transhuman
Culture InfoMark is an information marker presenting many aspects of the
culture of transhumanism. 

The InfoMark stands out as a beacon drawing people to the vital new part of
the world cultural landscape - transhumanity. Our emerging culture - as any
culture - is comprised of  socially and memetically transmitted ideas,
actions and education, arts and sciences, institutions, organizations, and
all other products of transhuman work and thought. 

The Transhuman World Culture InfoMark is a resource of transhuman cultural
characteristics such as style, sex, technology, history, fashion (bio-tech),
transhuman 911, transhuman 411, glamour, >H & <H, links, books which will
allow viewers a glimpse into who we are as well as lead viewers to other
targeted transhuman sites for more detailed information.

Available on the home page is an animated gif InfoMark for you to copy and
place on your site to link to the site!

Ah, a.k.a. the First and Second Foundations, eh?  I should warn you that
the Third Foundation is located somewhere in Australia (`at a right-angle

Extropians don't need geographic boundaries just for the sake of Extropian
nationalism.
What we probably will need is a safe haven where we can perform
physical/mental enhancements etc. without state interference.  How about
just a large biomedical facility dedicated to transhuman augmentations?
We can make up somekind of administrative BS to pass for official 
residency even though the only people who would actually live there are
the people who work at the facility.  Go back to the HomeLand and get your

As per previous discourse on hemp, a.k.a. cannabis,
the February 21 issue of New Scientist, the world's 
leading weekly science and technology magazine, 
highlights the health debate over cannabis:

http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980221/contents.html 

With a strong editorial position that states "claims 
about the evils of cannabis have been exaggerated,"
and sides favorably with cannabis decriminalization:

http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980221/editorial.html 

The main feature cites a World Health Organization 
report confirming the relative safety of cannabis:

http://marijuana.newscientist.com 

All well worth the read-time and valuable additions
to the overwhelming body of evidence supporting the 
relative safety and medical benefits of cannabis.

I wonder what that makes us in Sweden? We are also at a right angle to
everyone (fourth foundation?). But obviously the US east coast sprawl
is Trantor. :-)

I don't know about you, but many of us have chosen their goals quite early
in life. I cannot claim speaking for the others, but my interest in
certain technologies, physical/chemical sciencies and computer modelling
has certainly not been caused by reading Diamond Age. In fact it goes back
to the early childhood. Many influential movers & shakers (just to name
Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, Drexler, Merkle, de Garis, ...) share our memetic
set, whether formally or de facto. Their 'everyday life' is certainly
having nontrivial impact. I honestly cannot assess how much the
Extropians/transhumanists as a bulk can contribute to the bleeding edge in
science/technology/memefection, but yes, it does seem like a worthwhile
goal to pursue.

Having a single friend High Above should suffice. (And a little redundancy
won't hurt).  Becoming one of the rich & powerful should thus not be a
minor point on the transhumanist agenda.  If you are so smart then why
ain't you rich? Why, indeed?

The Exclave is the best model we currently have (and no, I don't know
anything about it). If the synergisms due to physical interactions are not
mythical, they should be observable there. But: with a realtime broadband
channel even socializing shouldn't suffer too much.

What have they gained by it? What focuses have they neglected by gaining

be successul? See?

Tell that Gelernter, who has had his hands blown off by the Unabomber. An
insignificant moron who is also a fairly competent molecular virologist is
not longer so very insignificant in terms of the damage. A petty terrorist
taking out 50 leading ExI heads + guest speakers by a fertilizer/fuel
carbomb is not so very petty anymore, I am afraid. Even if the risk be
small it is not zero.

> hand...

Organized crime is not that a large problem as I have learned from most
recent observations (caution: sample size bias). (Interesting enough that
the same picture painted by your favourite lillywhite monopoly always
winds up such a bugbear). Street thugs are not a problem, a minimum of
streetsmartness assuming (Btw, I am not armed for the police is a
significantly higher danger here), and higher echelons are
indistinguishable from state.  They are interested in milking, not killing
you. Remember, the state _is_ the mafia here.

Sorry, I believe you that you believe that, but it does sound a lot like
propaganda to me. You obviously do not see the simple virtues of careful
realism. You wouldn't believe how many things how soon a bunch of
energetic bright individualists can scrogg up. This _can_ be rewarding

I am not particular to sandy beaches & waving palms. From what I know I

I am unlikely to find myself at the receiving end of a tactical nuke or a

way too dangerous/expensive/polluted to remain enjoyable on the mid run

Use of large vessels as the basis for some sort of extra-national entity is a
recurring idea.  One often encounters questions about costs in such
discussions, but little data.  A quick web search this morning turned up an
excellent article discussing the current economics of oil tanker ownership and
operation:

	OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF OIL TANKERS
	IN THE POST-OPA'90 ENVIRONMENT:
	An Analysis of Costs, Profits and Complications
	N. Shashikumar, PhD

		http://www.rigos.com/suny1.html

Shashikumar discusses the current capital and operating costs for the four
standard classes of liquid bulk carriers.  Below is a list of those classes
and their sizes in "dead weight tons", the standard measure of ship size (a
measure of the weight of water displaced by the vessel without cargo):

	"Very Large Crude Carrier" ("VLCC") (295,000 dwt)
	Million Barrel ("MM Bbl") (130,000 dwt)
	Suez-Limited ("Aframax") (80,000 dwt)
	Product Carrier ("PC") (30,000 dwt)

To get a common sense impression of the size of these vessels, a PC is pretty
much the size of a standard break-bulk cargo ship, while VLCCs are the largest
true vessels afloat, dwarfing aircraft carriers.  Presumably VLCCs are what
utopians have in mind when envisioning "floating free zones".

Shashikumar's article provides the following figures for the cost of such
vessels.  The following table displays rounded figures extracted from his
article, expressing the cost of a 1995 newbuilding, the projected resale value
of such vessels in 2000 and the cost of such vessels in terms of their
lifetime capital and operating costs:

			95 NB - 2000 Resale - Break-even

	VLCC:	$100MM - $78MM - $140MM
	MM Bbl:	$73MM - $56MM - $100MM
	Aframax:	$49MM - $28MM - $62MM
	PC		$40MM - $18MM - $50MM

The following table displays a rough rounding of Shashikumar's calculation of
projected mean daily and annual operating costs over the next 5 years for such
vessels in terms of capital and operating expenses:

	VLCC:	$46,000 - $16.8MM
	MM Bbl:	$34,000 - $12.4MM
	Aframax:	$24,000 - $8.8MM
	PC		$21,000 - $7.7MM

A couple of things pop out of Shashikumar's numbers.  First, these boats are
EXPENSIVE.  Second, there are some serious diseconomies in building them these
days, despite the figures he presents showing the very healthy state of demand
for them.  Accordingly, the glut of tonnage most writers seem to be
remembering when they say "Let's get one of those surplus tankers for our
start-up enclave" is a thing of the past.

Without looking for numbers from an equally well-researched and analyzed paper
as Shashikumar's, I can relate that the market for non-vessel platforms is
equally bad for the would-be utopian.  Mobile rig demand relative to supply is
at an all time peak right now: About six months ago I attended a seminar where
figures were presented showing that essentially the entirety of the world
fleet of so-called jack-up rigs was booked up for the foreseeable future.

Fixed platforms present a different picture.  Those currently working do so
because they are still paying out for their present owners and are therefore
not available at prices that don't reflect the underlying economics of
hydrocarbon production.  Thus any would-be utopian must compete with the likes
of Shell and Exxon for purchase of a working platform.  Abandoned platforms
are a different story.  Unfortunately the world's coastal states are all
following the lead of the U.S., requiring owners of platforms to remove them
at the end of their useful lives.  Such structures are either cut free and
floated to scrappers or are reduced to artificial reef status by the use of
some pretty spectacular explosives engineering.

The real world of maritime and energy markets therefore points to the
possibility of rescuing an abandoned platform from the scrappers or the fishes
as the only remotely realistic alternative.  Such structures are usually not
that large, although they are STOUT and could conceivably support more of a
superstructure than they already do, if clever engineering were brought to
bear, and could also serve as a base for further expansion.

Unfortunately, all such structures of which I am aware are within the 200-mile
"Exclusive Economic Zone" ("EEZ") defined by UNCLOS, the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Under UNCLOS, the coastal state has the
exclusive right to regulate the economic resources of the EEZ and fixed
platforms situated in the EEZ become, for all practical legal purposes,
territorial islands of the coastal state.  Accordingly, one searching for an
escape from the legal regimes of current nation states won't do so on existing
fixed ocean platforms.

A couple of years ago Tom Morrow cryptically wrote to me that he had searched
maps of the world's oceans and had located at least one promising geographic
area of relatively shallow water outside the EEZ of any existing state.  I've
not tried to reproduce this discovery but, if a terrestrial physical base
beyond the reach of national sovereignty will be important in transhumanity's
future, this "last free place on earth" could be very important.  As far as I
know, this "lost horizon" does not lie above any known hydrocarbon deposit, so
the oil companies won't be building structures there that, once abandoned,
might form the seed for an ocean enclave. Extra-national colonists will
therefore have to foot the bill themselves for building anything on such
submerged territory.

ha. Well, as a typically arrogant American, I naturally considered the US to
be the entire galaxy, while everywhere else is merely part of the megallanic

cultural foci in those areas anyway. Who says there can't be a small, little

Gaia).

 It would allow people to achieve that equalizing effect, but I suspect
that the people most likely to be poor without such markets are also the
people least likely to have the foresight or intelligence to realize the
benefits of such markets.

 This is an important reason why such markets would increase inequality
- the people who can take advantage of this are the minority who are
most aware of the future. Once the average person realizes that most wages
will drop significantly, this market will dry up.

 I suspect the season of heavy rain lasts too long (something like 7-8
months) for many people.
 I'd be interested in moving there if enough other interesting people
would also moved, but I don't see any way to get such a movement started.

|____________________________________________________________________
|
|Government spending is going through the roof in western countries.
|All technological and other advance is proving vain, for government
|spending is growing so fast that its proportion of total output is
|becoming a crushing burden. In Western Europe thirty years ago,
|government spending averaged out at about 25% of output. Now it is
|about 50%, and rising fast. If this trend continues economic advance
|will be so undermined that economic collapse will occur.
|
|PUBLIC CHOICE
|
|Why is this happening? The popular answer, among libertarians, is
|the Public Choice Theory answer that groups of people - "special
|interests" - benefit a lot per head from a particular item of
|government spending, whereas the general population are not hurt
|much per head.(1)
|
|If one hundred men benefit to the tune of one thousand pounds each
|from the building of a warship, they have a big incentive to
|campaign like mad, in public and by private lobbying, for this
|warship. But the tens of millions of voters are hardly hurt at all
|by the few pence each voter is forced to spend on this warship, so
|they have no incentive even to find out that the money is being
|spent, let alone to stop it being spent.
|
|So people press for the government spending that benefits them. The
|concentrated interests win at the expense of the diffuse general
|interest.
|
|At first sight this seems a very good description of political
|activity. I remember from University days the antics of small groups
|of people which it was not worth the trouble of most students to
|oppose, as, per head, the demands of each group cost them little.
|And in local and national politics one seems to come across nothing
|but an endless series of groups asking for more money for their
|particular activity.
|
|However, I believe the Public Choice view to be fundamentally
|flawed. It does not fit the facts. For if Public Choice Theory is
|true, why do some items of government spending fall as a percentage
|of output over time, and others rise?
|
|In the United States in 1960, defence spending was 12.1% of total
|output and federal welfare spending (pensions, unemployment benefit,
|etc.) was 4.8%. In 1980 defence spending was 7.3% of total output
|and federal welfare was 12.6%.
|
|The wholehearted supporter of Public Choice might say that this is
|because more people believe that welfare spending will benefit them
|than believe that defence spending will. But the whole point of the
|libertarian economic case is that such things as the surge of "Great
|Society" welfare programs benefit no one with the possible exception
|of the people who administer them, that such spending increases the
|very poverty it is supposed to reduce.(2)
|
|BELIEFS
|
|If we are to believe that the reason welfare spending went up and
|defence spending down was that more people believed that it would
|benefit them, this begs the question of why the welfare bureaucrats
|and their allies were more successful than the defence bureaucrats
|and their allies in persuading people that more spending was in
|their interests. There is no evidence that the vast majority of
|voters in the U.S., let alone the politicians who actually voted for
|them, believed they would ever use any of the Great Society welfare
|programs (it is different in the case of 'Social Security' pensions
|of course) they were voting against their interests.
|
|I know of no western country, over the last thirty years, which had
|large scale defence spending where its share of output has not
|fallen and I know of no western country where welfare spending share
|of output has not risen and is not continuing to rise. In the United
|States the defence burden is less and the welfare burden is greater
|than it was in 1980. Overall Federal spending in the United States
|is now about 35% of output. In 1928, it was 3% of output.
|
|Such things as the road spending burden, by contrast, show no
|tendency to increase over time, in spite of having large scale
|interests behind them, who are able to make plausible (however
|false) claims that the mass of voters, as well as special groups of
|voters and campaign contributors, benefit from such spending.
|
|Government transport spending, subsidies to industry, agriculture,
|the arts, whatever you wish to name none of these show the dramatic
|rise that welfare spending does in every western country from the
|day welfare schemes are introduced.
|
|Partly, this is because these schemes increase the number of poor
|people, which in turn leads to even more welfare spending. It is
|like the rolling of a snowball down a steep slope.
|
|But it is not just this. If government spending on health,
|education, child care, the old, and so forth, is perceived as
|helping the poor resistance to it is fatally weakened.
|
|"Conservative" election victories are no counter argument
|"Conservative" governments increase welfare spending. (As British
|Prime Minister John Major said: "We have spent more than Labour even
|promised to spend.") Even if we assume that, for example, in the
|1992 British general election everyone who voted Conservative
|opposed higher welfare spending (which is nonsense) 57% of the
|voters supported a rise in the welfare state burden. And Britain is
|without doubt the least pro-welfare state country in the EEC.
|
|WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
|
|I do not believe politicians (at least, British Conservative Party
|politicians, who are the only ones I know) to be in the main the
|vote obsessed figures of Public Choice Theory, nor do I believe that
|the main problem is that they are deceived by special interest
|groups. Politicians have beliefs. The trouble is that their beliefs
|are the same as those of most other people. The politicians believe
|that the ever growing welfare state is morally good - 'holy', if you
|will.
|
|Well, we could try to persuade them that it is morally bad. I
|believe that part of what Michael Oakeshott tries to do in some of
|his writings(3) is to show that there are different traditions, and
|that by an unthinking acceptance of the planning, state activist
|tradition, of which the welfare state is part, we more away from the
|tradition of "civil society", which he believes that we also value.
|Ayn Rand tries to show that the dominant welfare state is against
|the whole nature of man.(4)
|
|The trouble is that neither of these approaches, of arguing that
|government welfare spending increases poverty, and arguing that it
|destroys civil society, has worked, or shows any sign of working.
|There is one approach left, which is to point out and ram home again
|and again, by all the means we can find, that the ever growing
|welfare state will lead to economic collapse. And I do mean true
|collapse. Eventually, unrestrained welfare spending will lead to
|mass starvation.
|
|Many have pointed this out, notably Rand. But in her case, this
|argument was part of a whole philosophy.(5) We have never had the
|simple message pounded away constantly. Now is the time to do this.
|Over the next few years the great slide will become clearly
|apparent, and the longer genuine action is put off the greater the
|horror will be, as there will be more and more poor people. As the
|economy slides, so, I believe will civility. There will be demands
|for 'emergency action', which will of course only make things worse.
|But if just one major country manages to turn its back on welfare
|statism, it will become an example.
|
|The failure of welfare statism will at first probably lead to more
|welfare statism, decline to more decline. But if we talk and write
|enough, we may be listened to. The hangman's noose concentrates the
|mind wonderfully, and with things visibly falling apart we will
|never have a better chance.
|
|If we succeed, then human beings cooperating together, free of

Me?  Cryptic?  Heh.  Well, to alleviate at least a little bit of mystery, I've
finally posted "The Last Free Place" on the web, available off of my homepage
at: <http://members.aol.com/T0Morrow/T0Mpage.html>.  You'll find the shallow-
water location that I'd mentioned to Greg, the Mascarene plateau, described in
the paper's footnotes.

For now, at least, my longer essay, "Extropia," remains in editing.  The legal
and geographic details in "The Last Free Place" will, however, probably make
it of more use to would-be nation builders than the philosophical musings of
"Extropia."

I've corresponded with government officials in the vicinity of the Mascarene
Plateau about just that question.  But on that count I will for now remain
cryptic.  It's less a function of cloak-and-dagger stuff than of time
commitments, however.

This is the most rediculous figure I have ever seen!!  I am falling out of my
chair right now with laughter!!  Annual spending in 1980 on defense was
approximately $250 billion.  Are you actually telling me that over a quarter
of a trillion dollars was spent on welfare during the same year?  Unless of
course you do consider all the subsidies that corporations get (i.e.
corporate welfare) as part of this welfare figure.

And this isn't the case for the military-industrial complex who has reaped

I'll agree with you here.  Over the long haul welfare does nothing but
increase dependency and decrease innovation both in peoples lives and that of
corporations who are not truly competing in the free-market.

My only contention to the argument against welfare though, is we need to
consider humanitarian alternatives for peoples lives as the become
increasingly superfluous in an automated high-output economy.

What's the evidence that enhancements are likely to be suppressed?  Many
people seem to assume that anything useful but weird will be attacked
and banned.  They're probably right on the attack, but banned?
Possibly, but can it be said to be certain.

What enhancements are banned now?  A problem seems to be that there
aren't all that many genuine enhancements.  There are a bunch of drugs
which make the user happy; while I don't agree with the war on drugs,
and want to see legalization, most of them are in fact addictive, AFAIK.
The most useful seem to be caffeine, which is legal, and marijuana,
which causes frothing insanity in prohibitionists.  I posit that if MJ
was legal now it would remain so, and that the pressure on it comes from
it having become illegal in the past and a perception that if it is
rescured other drugs might be as well.  "No surrender, no retreat."  How
practically useful MJ is to people not suffering certain types of severe
pain is scientifically unclear at the moment.

The usefulness and dangers of LSD and peyote I'm not sure about.
Certainly they don't seem useful in a normal economic sense.  Even if
they're safe, possibly the war on drugs is, as above, as much about
protecting a current fief as about a generic desire to ban odd things.

In vitro fertilization and surrogate pregnancy caused great horror and
religious outcry, but are useful and legal.  I suspect genetic testing
will not be touched.  Gene research has trouble in Germany but they live
under the Nazi shadow.  (An argument against Euro-unification, similar to
Diamond's thesis of why Europe eventually surpassed China: multiple
countries make it harder to stupidly ban something.)  Genetic engineering
may go under the ban, but at the moment I think any attempts to modify a
human embryo would involve a good deal of risk to the resulting human;
our knowledge is not that great.  Whether parents should have the right
to take such risks with their children is debatable.  The growth of full
clones seems likely to be made illegal, which I can't justify with any
sophisty I take seriously; on the other hand, I can't get that excited
over it either.  The technical cloning of growing cell lines or new
organs from an adult, which would be very useful, seems to have a fair
chance of surviving, if it ever actually happens.

Steroids are clearly useful and clearly risky, AFAIK.  Their prohibition
in sports is just part of the rules of the game.  Their general
prohibition is part of state maternalism; again, I don't like it, but
they do have a point, and I'm not dying to take the things.  My point,
if it isn't clear by now, is that I see no reason to assume that
economically useful and fairly safe enhancements will be banned.
It violates sense, and has little precedent.  New but useful
technologies have survived; banned things are in the large genuinely
dangerous, for all that I feel individuals should be allowed to take
their own risks.

Refutation?

Subject: Corporate Socialism Model
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com


I was recently introduced to a very interesting variation of socialism that
many people on this list may find interesting.  From what I have been able
to determine, this model fixes several of the most disagreeable aspects of
the traditional socialist model.  As an extra bonus, this model has been
very successfully implemented in the United States (though not under the
auspices of the US govt) for the better part of a century.


The model is essentially the application of commercial corporate entities
as social welfare agents.  The history of the specific example I was
introduced to is as follows (regretfully I can not remember the specific
names of many of the entities involved):

Earlier this century, a community received a large windfall from the
federal government.  But rather than spending the money, the community used
the money to form a commercial corporation with the intent of doing
business.  Every member of the community was given a single share in the
corporation.  Every child born to a member of the community was also given
a share, but the share was not vested until the child became an adult,
iirc.  Additionally, since new shares are issued to every generation, when
a person dies, their share is voided.  The community made a conscious
decision not to start issuing dividends for 10 or 15 years after the
initial formation of the corporation.

Anyway, the bottom line is the corporation in question (the name escapes
me) is currently a large multi-national and issues dividends of $20-30k
(and growing) annually to every adult shareholder.  The corporation is for
all intents and purposes the local government for this community.  The
corporation "donates" a significant amount of resources to its community
(which doubles as a benefit and a tax write-off), but only so far as it
doesn't damage the bottom line of the corporation.  However, unlike most
governments, the corporation does not give preferential treatment or
employment to members of the community (it *is* a commercial business),
regularly employing qualified outsiders.  


There are a number of interesting ramifications and aspects of this as a
model of government.

First, because payouts to the community are based on the profitability of
the corporation/government (not on tax distributions), it is in the
interest of the community to minimize plundering as this leads to
short-term and long-term cuts in payouts to the individual shareholders.
This is especially effective because every member of the community has an
equal vote; any special minority interests are strongly out-weighed by the
community at large because there is no real means under corporate law by
which any small interest could gain any significant advantage in this
scenario.  Additionally, because payouts are not linked to taxes, there is
far more interest in minimizing the expenses of the corporation rather than
trying to recover taxes already payed.

Second, because government/corporate payouts are issued as dividends rather
than "programs", this allows members of the community to take customize
their benefits to their wishes.  Any public benefits given by the
corporation are only done when optimal i.e. allowing the community to use
resources of the corporation at no significant loss to the corporation, or
as a long-term investment in future profitability of the corporation (like
making useful donations to the local schools to build a better employment
pool).

Additionally there is the obvious benefit of government without
politicians.  If a employee of the corporation or board of directors
doesn't do their job, it shows up in the profitability (something the
community feels directly) and incompetent individuals can be replaced
readily at any time.  The only way an individual can make a career at this
is if they do a good job (people are not hired based on ideology).

The key points here are that there is more accountability in this type of
government, although there isn't a whole lot of governing going on;
everything is driven by the economic self-interest of the community.  Also,
with a profit-based government there appears to be something of a virtuous
cycle that develops as opposed to the vicious cycle of a taxation-based
government.  And while this model looks similar to socialism in many ways,
it leaves a lot more to the choice of the individual rather than the
"government knows best" attitude of traditional socialism and distributes
resources much more equally without leaving anyone out or taxing the wealthy.


I thought this might be an interesting topic of discussion.  As I mentioned
at the top, this model has been applied very successfully on at least one
occassion (I actually learned about this from my father, who knows a couple
people who are shareholders of this corporation).

Comments?

If you think this is funny, look at social security spending. Those that claim
'entitle'ments are increasing and reproducing, and the bureaucratic overhead to
administer these programs is likewise expanding. Yet at $250 billion, we can
barely afford to launch a short term campaign against a rather minor threat
(Iraq).  In any event, if social security taxes weren't confiscated by the feds
and substituted with treasury bonds, we would still have a $300 billion deficit.
With the earned income tax credit acting as a front end welfare measure,
basically exempting any one with at least one dependent if they make less than
$30,000 from paying anything, there is a significant amount of anti-productive
influences in the tax system today. Really James, I am surprised you've bought
the welfare establishment's con about 'corporate welfare'. If the government
wants to pay me to conduct research and development for technology or equipment
they want, nobody is giving me anything for free. Welfare is when you take money
from someone and give it to someone else. Failing to take money out of my pocket
that I earned fairly is not welfare, it is my money. When are people going to
gripe about the bureaucracy welfare, which is the keeping of millions of useless
people in unproductive government jobs, merely to keep them from going postal on
their neighbors or congressmen.

Some VLCC's are larger than 500,000 dwt, but the economics are even worse  
than what you say. For their size supertankers are the cheapest ships on the 
sea, partly because they're poorly made and designed to last only a few years, 
but mostly because they're nothing but floating oil tanks. To convert such a 
hulk into a ship capable of carrying lots of people could easily cost 10 
times as much.  If you were low on machine guns and thus expected people to 
make the ship their home voluntarily then you'd have to make it somewhat more 
comfortable than a slave ship, and that would cost at least 100 times as much 
and probably much more.
    
Even if these economic problems could be overcome we'd still only exist at 
the whim of the superpowers, if we were not good little boys they'd send a 
torpedo up our ass and sink the ship so fast it'd bounce off the bottom.

As national borders of those nations that willingly give up sovereignty to some
nebulous international order, all this does for the average person is make it that
much harder to tell who is trying to screw you. Call it political luddism, or what
you will, but it would be nice for a change to have one bureaucracy that was
responsible to you, and couldn't pass the buck up or down or round and round until
you just gave up and bent over.

Recen'ty here in Lebanon, a gentleman who was having difficulty registering his
car with the local busybodies simply said in frustration,"I'm suprised that that
shooter didn't start his spree here. I would." (this was a month after the Carl
Drega shooting spree in which a property tax protester finally went postal on the
corrupt judge who assessed his property at 3 times its actual market value, such
that his property taxes would be so high that he would have to move out of the
community.)  In no time at all this average citizen was tracked down and arrested
for assault. Now the local gov't busycrats want guns to be banned in all public
spaces. I say turn it around. Make it legal for any citizen to give a bureaucrat
who is giving them a hard time a good smack up side the head. At the very least
allow the average citizen to issue citations to bureaucrats for stupidity,
obfuscation, and inefficiency.

I dunno, John, maybe you enjoy spending an entire day of your working life in the
DMV, trying to get the legal fabrications of a few states off your record just so
you can drive to work. I don't. Fact is that the current system needs a good
razing. As this doesn't seem likely, starting from scratch somewhere else is a
more cost effective solution.

I for one would like to hear something abt this Heinleinian Nest (or so it
sounds).  Anyone care to post some first-hand reports? Or relevant urls?

As you said body cloning especially body transplantation  as performed by
neurosurgeon Robert White, MD, Ph.D. (CWRU) [See
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webbio1.htm] is *VERY* likely
to be banned.  As proposed by Paul Segall, Ph.D., one could generate
anencephalic clones that are "brain dead" due to telencephalon removal at 6
weeks gestation.  (If abortion is legal, why shouldn't this be as well?)  The
benefit of the Atlantis Project (See http://oceania.org/)
and maybe the Millennial Project (See http://www.millennial.org/ ) is a
separate nation-state or - city state like Singapore - is the libertarian
foundation that would be built into the Constitution of such a venture.  Of
course, it is more practical to just go to a tropical/Carribean  island  that
wants American dollars and doesn't care where they come from for now but in
the long term a floating artificial city would be a great testament to human
ingenuity and achievement, a showcase of transhumanist ability to create and
posthumanist culture as well.

This might be an opportunity for the kind of nuclear 'insurance policy'
that Erwin Strauss wrote about in 'Basement Nukes'; someone sets up a
nuclear-armed insurance organisation and the ship-owners pay an annual
fee so that if a nation does attack them, the insurance company will nuke 
the capital of the attacking nation.

Obviously they must be decentralized enough that the nation can't nuke
them back, but that's not too hard compared to the problems of defending
a nation (see the difficulty of finding and destroying Scuds in Iraq).

Heinleinian Nests are fun!  

You might want to check out the "Phoenexus" (play on nexus) of extropian
cryonicists (they number 5 people + 3 cats.)  The are probably the most
clearly cut extropian-type community where people live.  They have wonderful
parties and open their home to friends.  But this is no different, actually
than other extropian orbs, such as "Exorbs" (play on orb) that cluster around.

I think Max More can give you a synopsis of extropian Heinleinian Nest-type
living arrangements.  He has created several himself, and did live with the
Phoenexus extropians while they were still called the "Nexus" while living
in Riverside, California.  I remember the Nexus parties where filled with
cryonicists and an Heinleinian, or better extropian atmosphere of heightened
value, interest and meaning.

Other extropian habitats have sprung up over the years.  The exclave --
vis-a-vis extropian Dave Krieger (who was visiting our extropian orb
Saturday evening) -- the exclave is a play on enclave and the dictionary
gives it an island type of meaning, "a part of a country that is isolated
from the main part and is surrounded by foreign territory."  Not quite a
sovereign territory.

Here are some other extropian plays on Heinleinian-type nests:   Exone
(zone), Exiron (environ) .....

Yet, extropians have not designed an architectural model for the type of
community being discussed here.  The initial concept of Extropia, as T.O.
Morrow mentioned, is a great lead in and excerpts of it can be introduced in
the conversation.  

All the nests discussed above are more like mobile living arrangements where
extropians share similar philosophical views and work-habits.  We do not
have a definitive extropian community that actually exists to date.

Bruce Sterling's Closing Speech / Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
Conference '98

CFP Closing Speech, Austin,  Feb 20, 1998

 Literary Freeware -- Not for Commercial Use

        Hi, my name's Bruce Sterling, I'm a local writer and a CFP
 veteran.  I'm grateful for this chance to once again bring you
 the fabulous benefits of my freelance pontifications.

      When I first got involved in the computer civil liberties
 scene, it was 1990.  We'd just had a Secret Service raid here in
 Austin that had shut down a science fiction publisher.  This was
 a strange and rude intrusion in my daily life, this was an advent
 calculated to waken me from my dogmatic slumbers.   The more I
 learned about this computer crime raid, the more peculiar and
 significant it seemed.  I ended up writing an entire book about
 it.  I was hoping the book would encourage some informed debate,
 and maybe the deeper political issues behind the computer
 revolution could somehow all be put straight.

       Now, eight years later, almost to the day, we have these
 four hundred interested and relevant parties all meeting here in
 Austin to get together face to face and thrash some of these
 things out.  And you can even earn legal credit for it.  This
 gives me a warm sense of closure, a very fulfilled feeling.

       There's plenty of thrash at CFP.  There's always a lot of
 thrash.  Very interesting thrash.

      Not a lot of permanent legal results, though.  If you glance
 back over the past eight years and examine the whole enterprise
 to date, what you see is very remarkable.  In the world of
 computers, privacy, and freedom, crises go in and out of vogue,
 but they are very rarely settled in any permanent legislative
 way.  The only real permanence is the thrash itself.  I'd go so
 far as to call this a new status quo.  Permanent technological
 revolution.  Permanent thrash.

     I was very intrigued by the remarkable presentation of our
 first keynote speaker, Mr. Kahin.  It was a very congenial and
 gentle speech:  "modest" was a word he used a lot.  I don't think
 I've ever, ever heard an Administration science and technology
 expert describe the aims of American government as "modest."
 This was a remarkable confession this gentleman was making.   In
 so many words, he said that policy development is cyberspace is
 just plain too hard to do.  There are too many competing values
 to achieve a workable political balance.  The Administration is
 simply too overwhelmed by all this random electronic thrashing,
 all this buzzing and bleeping.  So they'll simply modestly step
 back and let the mighty forces of technology and private
 enterprise thrash the situation out on their own.  And maybe
 twenty years from now, when things calm down and get safer for
 elected American politicians,  we may see some actual laws
 passed.

      Well, of course this statement is very good news for the
 techno-libertarian post-industrial contingent.  Really, there
 ought to be corks popping in the offices of WIRED magazine over
 this keynote speech.  The Bay Area WIRED folks are very into all
 this:  emergence, and market power, and bottom-up
 entrepreneurism, and the sublime beauty of nonlinear network
 economics that are profoundly Out of Control.   And let's face
 it, after that stinking Decency Act debacle, a hands-off policy
 smells terrific.

       I think you can make some good arguments that there are
 aspects of reality that governments should be very modest about.
 Our keynote speaker pointed out that the real nodes in the World
 Wide Web are words.  Hotlinked key words.  So this isn't merely
 chips and wires that we are talking about.  This is language.
 When government tries to regulate and police the structure of
 language,  this is generally considered to be double-plus ungood.
 There's a long tradition of restraint and modesty here.   The
 First Amendment may be a local ordinance, but it's clearly served
 us rather well, and the First Amendment says, "make no law."  Be
 modest.  Make no law.

      But point of view is worth eighty IQ points.   From another
 point of view, to say that American government should be modest
 in a flagship technology is a very weird thing to say.   I have
 never before heard a federal official confess that some aspect of
 industrial development is simply beyond the mental grasp of
 government.  That it just plain moves too fast to figure out, so
 we might as well throw up our hands and step back out of its way.

       This is a radical admission to make.   It's very out of the
 ordinary.  Rocket scientists are said to be pretty smart people,
 but that didn't lead the federal government to declare that NASA
 is impossible to manage politically, so that rockets should be
 best left to Westinghouse and General Dynamics.  I don't think
 there are many Congressmen who fully grasp quantum
 chromodynamics, either.   But you would never see the
 Administration say that quarks are too complex for government,
 and that relativity and subatomic physics should be left to the
 greater wisdom of the private sector.

     But that's the Internet policy.   No actual government.
 Some form of emergent self-regulating governance.   To me, that
 was the core message of CFP 98.  They really are just plain
 giving up.  That was the mellow, birdlike sound of the twilight
 of sovereignty.  The era of big government is over; the era of
 puzzled, shrunken, benignly indifferent government is at hand.

      It's the giant sucking sound of abdicated responsibility.
 So what fills the power vacuum?  I would argue that it is already
 being filled by a different and more modern political
 arrangement:  not bureaucracy, but ad-hocracy.

       I believe that the best known ad-hocracy, the classic
 version, and certainly the one that gets the most admiring press,
 is the internet engineering task force.  These guys get plenty of
 ink for their wonderful, cooperative, networking,
 non-governmental, emergent, non-hierarchical way of organizing
 their enterprise.   They're a role model, a paradigm even.  And
 that management model seems to work pretty well on the Internet.

     What do ad-hocracies look like in other contexts?  Say, a
 business context.  I would argue that Silicon Valley is a giant
 ad-hocracy.   You see a particularly virulent aspect of this, in
 weird, market-bubble, casino-economy, Silicon Valley IPOs.
 Esther Dyson wrote a quite good article about this in the New
 York Times recently, in which she pointed out that many Silicon
 Valley companies are basically digital paper-tigers.  They don't
 actually develop and sell products.   Not even software, not even
 ones and zeros.  They simply pitch high-concepts, sell stock in
 the vaporware, cash out for the venture capitalists behind the
 curtain,  and then they are acquired by larger firms.  If you
 look for an actual industrial enterprise,  something with
 deliverables and a cash flow, there's simply no there there.

       Hollywood film production companies are long-established
 ad-hocracies.  Show business has always been good at this.  The
 entertainment industry.  The military-entertainment complex.
 You're pitchforking a bunch of freelancers together, exposing
 some film, using the movie as the billboard to sell the ancillary
 rights, and after the thing gets slotted to video, everybody just
 vanishes.

      But in the political realm, I would argue that America's
 most famous and powerful ad-hocracy is that nebulous entity that
 our First Lady refers to as "the massive right-wing conspiracy."
 And here we find our flagship industry giving an odd little
 lurch.   That's the grating sound of a postindustrial iceberg
 hitting us below the waterline.   It's not pleasant to have the
 established order  seriously menaced and frightened by their
 sense of a covert conspiracy.

      I don't believe in conspiracy in the grand Joseph McCarthy
 paranoiac tradition, but I do believe in a real and powerful
 right-wing ad-hocracy of Clinton's political enemies.  I think

 it's self-evident, it doesn't challenge my credulity.  I think
 these right-wing activist people are basically very much like
 CFP.  They're all on each other's Rolodexes, they're all on each
 other's mailing lists, they all know each others' funding
 agencies, think tanks and industrial backers.   And when
 anything, no matter how far-fetched or bizarre, comes up that
 might conceivably harm the President, that information is
 disseminated around the country and around the world at lightning
 speed.  It's data-mined, and catalogued, and embroidered, and
 re-cycled, and re-circulated endlessly, and spun and spun and
 spun.

      The "massive right-wing conspiracy"  is what our friends at
 the infowar contingent at RAND corporation like to call a
 "segmented, polycephalous influence network." It's a loosely
 linked, leaderless enterprise which is constructed rather like an
 art movement, or a literary movement.  It doesn't have elections,
 laws, bylaws, a code of ethics, a code of morals, or any kind of
 brakes.   It can't be defeated militarily any more than Russians
 could defeat Afghan guerrillas or Americans defeat the Viet Cong.
 And this isn't merely a theoretical exercise.  The thing is as
 real as dirt.  It has real power.

      You don't have to stretch too far to perceive this as a
 menace to democracy.  It's certainly a real and visible menace to
 the established order, because it can throw sand in the works at
 any of a hundred different points, and there's no headquarters
 where the established order can hit back.  When the established
 order hits back, it hits back with another, rival ad-hocracy.

     You may have seen James Carville -- a very interesting and
 significant postmodern figure -- appearing on television to
 publicly declare war on the Ken Starr investigation.  I noticed
 some pundits scoffing at this declaration -- "Carville thinks
 he's in the bunker!  Carville thinks he's an army!  The Cajun's
 off his rocker!"  This scoffing has a  very hollow sound to me.
 It reminds me of Stalin asking how many divisions the Pope has.
 The Pope doesn't use divisions, Comrade Stalin.  But the Pope
 knows the ground in Poland, and he can put a stake through your
 undead heart with no problem.

     James Carville has never been elected to any office.  As far
 as I can see, James Carville has no legitimate or constitutional
 role in our society whatsoever.  All James Carville possesses is
 a deep knowledge of the media, a gift for spin, a big Rolodex,
 and a lot of people who owe him favors.   Oh, and a law degree,
 too, somewhere at the bottom of the list.   But when the Clinton
 Administration goes to the mattresses, this guy is the *first*
 guy they call.

      You're not going to see James Carville declaring large areas
 of American reality off limits because they are beyond his mental
 grasp.  You're not going to see James Carville declaring that he
 ought to be modest, and let the info-pundits and the venture
 capitalists decide what to do with digital media.  The guy will
 do with digital media what he does with *all* media, bend it to
 his own uses.

     This is what ad-hocratic political power looks like in a
 heavily mediated and thoroughly networked society.  I don't know
 what you call that form of power, but it sure doesn't look like
 anything I recognize from a high-school civics text.

        And it's not unique to the United States.   Prime Minister
 Blair has proved that it works great in Britain.  If you want to
 see how it develops in another social context -- a deeply
 non-American  context -- take a good look at postmodern Russia.
 Yeltsin's campaign manager is a man named Anatoly Chubais, the
 Carville of Russia.  This man is basically running the entire
 Russian government off of his laptop.

      I happen to have a very warm and kindly feeling about
 literary movements.  I'd hate for the government to think that my
 cyberpunk literary ad-hocracy was some kind of organized menace
 against civil order, and that we should all be grilled in
 Congress by an unAmerican activities committee.  It might be kind
 of an honor -- for a Texan writer it would be quite an honorable
 thing to walk down the trail of tears with John Henry Faulk and
 J. Frank Dobie -- but I don't think this would be a political
 plus for the American Republic.

       But I think it can be demonstrated that ad-hocracy can be a
 living menace to civil order.  Let's take the Lewinsky
 wiretapping business.  For eight years I've been to CFP, and for
 eight years I've heard the law and order contingent tell us that
 wiretapping is the only sure weapon against mafias, dope runners,
 terrorists and child pornographers.  I don't remember
 Presidential sex partners being on that list, but it's getting
 pretty clear to rest of us that they are way, way up there as
 targets of opportunity.

      Here we've got a wiretapping development that may bring down
 an Administration, annul two elections, and plunge our country
 into years of debilitating public shame and trauma.  You know, if
 terrorists or dope dealers did us a grievous harm like that, we'd
 pursue those evil sons of bitches to the ends of the earth.  But
 instead it's our Justice Department, in league with a networked
 rabble of oppo research freaks with a sick need to monitor and
 surveill people's sex lives.

      Hey, thanks a lot, Mr. Law-and-Order Body-Wire.  I'm sure my
 two innocent daughters will sleep a lot safer in their beds after
 you've ritually sacrificed the nation's chief executive in a
 neurotic orgy of national sex panic.  After this gratifying
 experience, I'm anxious to see your wiretapping powers expanded
 radically, so that more American women, and their mothers, can be
 turned into felons for lying about their sex lives.  You guys
 need more plug-in jacks and headphones, it's important for our
 nation's safety and stability.   So after you clean that prurient
 filth off your tape heads, tell me just one more time why you're
 so eager to have Digital Telephony.

        It's very much a pattern.  National moral sex panics have
 definite political advantages.   Ad-hocracies specialize in this
 sort of agitation.  The Christian right specializes in provoking
 reflexive loathing for homosexuality.  For years we've seen law
 enforcement trumpet the terrifying menace of child pornography on
 computer networks.   If a rightist adhocracy can checkmate the
 king through a mini-Profumo scandal, it's going to be open season
 on politician's sex lives for as far as the eye can see.

         What is all this about, what's the commonality here?
 It's a profoundly undemocratic process of shutting down informed
 debate by cynically exploiting sexual hot-button issues.  We're
 supposed to be so  panicked and stampeded by the specter of
 kidporn that we somehow miss the fact that the FBI is installing
 a Walkman jack in our phones.   You see, it's just plain too
 complicated and technical for us to make up our minds about!  So
 let's just panic!  At least we can provoke some vigorous action
 that way.

       There's a flipside to the government's public abdication of
 competence to regulate and judge.  It's the unspeakable,
 invisible, national-security underworld.  Wired Power without the
 inconvenience of democracy.   The taps, the tapes, the dossiers,
 ECHELON, the secret war against crypto -- none of this is
 remotely democratic.  This is a frozen Cold War underworld
 accountable to none.  If we can't regulate ourselves in an open,
 above-board fashion, spooks traditionally expand to fill the
 power vacuum.  I would argue that in a true information society,
 private spookdom is bound to flourish.  We all take on a mild
 flavor of spy.   The walls between spy, journalist, pundit,
 spin-doctor, guru, opinion leader,  and political operative
 become ever more vaporous.   Don't believe me?  Look around
 yourself.

       The day may come when powerful ad-hocracies abandon the
 pretence of legality, and simply crush public figures to death
 with the raw pressure of surveillance.  In much the same way that
 Princess Di and her scandalous boy-toy were bloodily crushed to
 death by the sheer pressure of tabloid harassment.

      Or it may be that ad-hocracies will display some real
 benefits for real-world public order.  We might see ad-hocracies
 for sewage lines, or ad-hocracies for railroads and highways and
 electrical power.  People have been talking electronic democracy
 for quite a while now.  It looks good on paper, or maybe it would
 be more accurate to say that it looks good glowing on a screen.

    But where's the demo?  I've yet to see even the smallest
 American town, or the smallest unit of actual functional
 government, becoming fully electronic.  Virtual communities --
 they don't seem to be living up to their hype.   They seem to
 work just about as well as other traditional American intentional
 communities.  Pilgrim pioneers, hippie communes, Amish
 barn-raisings... these things are hard work.  Most Americans
 prefer TVs to quilting bees.  Most Americans want to kick back in
 the suburbs and have entertainment piped in.

        And virtual communities have never worked out their bad
 apple problem, their free rider problem.  Spam has damaged USENET
 in ways that malicious hackers could only dream about.  Network
 ad-hocracies are very good at forming a hostile overlay over the
 deeper infrastructure.  They don't seem to be much good at all at
 forming structures themselves.  Because ladies and gentlemen,
 real political structures have *structure!*  They have laws,
 regulations, rights, grants of citizenship, constitutions, true
 faith and allegiance.   It's hard to fake all those things with a
 Rolodex, an email list, and a starry-eyed sense of
 techno-optimistic benevolence.

     You know, the computer revolution really loves itself.  It's
 all about publicity really, it's about moving data fast and
 cheap, so maybe it's only natural that it gets entranced by its
 own hype.  But you know, this isn't the last technological
 revolution that you and I are going to witness.  When I turn my
 eyes to the future, I really have to wonder what kind of
 precedent we're setting here.  What kind of precedent are we
 bequeathing to the organizers and attendees of "Biotech Freedom
 and Privacy?"

        Because you can smell that one on the wind.  You got the
 medical priesthood under seige by eager entrepreneurs, tremendous
 market demand, bathtub genetic sequencers, cheaper and cheaper
 equipment, cloned sheep on the front page, activists like
 Kevorkian and Richard Seed all ready to jump out of their
 basements and carry out a propaganda of the deed....   And we
 already know what outlaw pharmaceuticals look like.   These cats
 aren't like computer outlaws, guys who are nine-tenths teenage
 ideologue. These dope people have revenue streams bigger than
 countries and they play for keeps.

      I would also point out that this very week the FBI did us
 the favor of busting a couple of biowar militia freaks.  There's
 often some kind of loudly trumpeted FBI action during Computers
 Freedom and Privacy.  Usually it's a computer bust.  This time
 it's anthrax.   You can take that little chunk of data and make
 of it what you may.

      But maybe the next techno-revolution won't play out like
 this one.  It may be that there is something unique and special
 about the world of computation.  We can't seem to build permanent
 structures; so maybe we're not a permanent problem.  Come the
 year 2000, we may well find that some large percentage of the
 planet's installed computers simply cease to work.

      Computation may be America's flagship industry, but when you
 see how people live in computation, they're not like the settled
 aristocrats on the first class deck of the Titanic.  They're a
 lot like the post-iceberg Titanic.  They have a raft called the
 IBM mainframe, and then another raft called Apple II, and then a
 raft called Macintosh, and then they make a frantic leap sideways
 to Windows 95, dropping heaven only knows how much precious data
 in the transfer.  And those who somehow fall overboard, end up
 stiff and pale and bobbing in the chill dark waters of technical
 obsolescence.   Maybe that's what we have to offer to the future
 here at CFP.  Pundits destined to sink without a trace, our
 solemn pontie all take on a mild flavor of spy.   The walls
 between spy, journalist, pundit, spin-doctor, guru, opinion
 leader,  and political operative become ever more vaporous.
 Don't believe me?  Look around yourself.
     
       But you know -- I can live with that.  I prefer evanescence
 to catastrophe.  When I think about all the scaremongering, and
 alarm stories, and gloomy predictions about computer crime that
 I've had to absorb over the past eight years, I feel very proud
 of the American republic.  I think we've done an incredible job
 of assimilating this technology.  When I went to CFP One, that
 event was a total freak scene.  There were convicted criminals
 and their arresting officers buying each other drinks in the bar.
 In newpaper stories of 1990 you had to define the word "modem."
 But here we are eight years later and websurfing is a genuinely
 popular enterprise, it's like Monday Night Football or country
 line-dancing.

       I can live with hype, as long as we have a chance to keep
 making new mistakes.    Sure, we've got ad-hocracies scurrying
 around in the woodwork destabilizing the American democratic
 process, but let's get real.   This is America we're talking
 about.   It's seen hard times and hard, hard tests.  Slavery,
 civil war.    Machine politics, the Tweed Ring, Tammany Hall,
 Chicago in the 20s.  Jim Crow.   Watergate.   Texas state
 politics.  Louisiana politics, for heaven's sake.  The railroads,
 the steel mills, the robber barons.   The military industrial
 complex.  We survived all that.  We look good now.  We have
 resilience.  We toughed it out.  We have hope as a culture, we're
 not afraid to reinvent ourselves.  We make ludicrous spectacles
 of ourselves that cause civilized people to wonder if we've lost
 our minds, but there's nothing new about that.  It's what
 Americans always do.

       Let's look at the general situation here, the big picture.
 Stock market at an all time high.  Balanced federal budget,
 practically kind of.  We even have patches of deflation.
 Deflation!  I'm a middle-aged man and I never in my life saw
 deflation, I thought it was a mythical beast.   And there's jobs,
 even!  They may be burn-out jobs in the high-end sector, with
 burger-flipping service jobs at the low end, but hey, at least
 there's work around.  The computer industry is a very strange
 flagship industry to have, but Dell is headquartered in Austin,
 and Dell just set a bunch of new sales records.  It's an
 industry!  The Texas oil industry smells really bad.  The Texas
 cattle industry has screwflies, brucellosis and droughts.  I'm
 down with this Texas chip and computer thing.  It's working out
 down here.

     In fact, I really suspect that this historical moment may be
 a little Golden Age for our community.  Compared to what else has
 been going on, and compared to what else may be coming, this
 seems like a little Belle Epoque.  We're no longer so eccentric
 that we seem freakish, and yet we have not yet settled down quite
 so much that we've become wallpaper.  The electronic frontier is
 no longer a howling wilderness, and it hasn't yet matured into a
 decaying rust-belt slum.  We've really got it good!

     When it's all said and done, my primary concern in the year
 1998 is that we ought to be enjoying this more.  I think the
 computer community just plain works too hard.  We're all wrapped
 up in the eighty-hour weeks, and the piles of mounting email, and
 the constantly bleeping cellphones.  We need to learn to kick
 back.   We need to live less like galley slaves and more like
 human beings.  We may never have it this good again.

      That's why I've made it my personal goal at this CFP to try
 and buy everybody a beer.  The con's over now, our beloved CFP
 ad-hocracy is shutting down for another twelve months.  There's
 one important thing about ad-hocracies, a charming quality they
 have.   If you just get them outside of the video surveillance,
 and away from their podiums and microphones, and add a little
 social lubricant in the form of a couple of beers, they
 spontaneously disintegrate into parties.  And I don't mean grim,
 committed, political parties.  I  mean good old-fashioned
 yahoo-style parties.

      When you come right down to it, virtual communities are a
 pretty thin and cerebral parody of actual communities.  But I can
 slap a patch on that problem right now.   You're in my home town.
 This is Austin.  Slackerville.  Berkeley on the Colorado.   Come
 on out of the public spotlight, let's mosey on over to my house
 and let our hair down.  It's not a black-tie do, it's very laid
 back and Texan.   You're gonna have to twist off your own beer
 caps and nibble your own chips and sandwiches, but at least you
 can wear whatever the hell you want.  Expectations are low, and
 the entry barriers are nonexistent.   Nancy and I will be glad to
 have you.  Let's get actually communal, let's have a little
 life-affirming celebration.  Let's tie one on.

      So I dunno about you, but I'm outta here.  Last guy out of
 the building has to log off and shut down!

No...  It means that if either A or B are true, then both are true.  This
is distinctly different from A is B.

My weight presses on the floor.  The floor exerts a normal force on me.
Both are true, but they are NOT the same fact.

	Abstract:

	By proving (a) that the nature of the identity
	of the number one is binary and as such is com-
	posed of two symmetrical attributes the sum of
	which equals zero, (b) that all numbers derive
	their primary identity by relation to zero, (c)
	that all non-zero numbers are subsets of zero,
	and (d) that the source and the sum of all num-
	bers and of all difference between all numbers
	is zero, it is proven that zero is the supreme
	number, the Alpha and Omega, and the universal
	constant from which there can be no deviation.
	Zero-sum law expresses universal equilibrium.


	    YOU CAN NOT GET SOMETHING FROM NOTHING


	    (-)--  THE ZERO-SUM OF IDENTITY  --(+)

	The primary identity relation forming the basis
	of all mathematics is the  relation  of 0 and 1.
	The number 1 is the symbolic arising of identity
	establishing the foundation of difference, rela-
	tion, and identity. To understand logic and the
	truth we must first understand the 0,1 relation.

	If there was no difference between 0 and 1, then
	there would be no number 1, thus it follows that
	the identity 1 is the difference between 0 and 1
	and the difference between 0 and 1 is what 1 is.
	The difference between 0 and 1 is  symmetrical ,
	and thus 1 is 1 more (+1) than 0 and 0 is 1 less
	(-1) than 1. Here's that symmetrical difference:

	         The Difference That Is One

	                 0--->1 = +1
	                 0<---1 = -1
	                 0<-->1 =  0

	      1 is 1 from 0 and 0 is -1 from 1
	         The difference that is one
	              is zero in total

	The double arrows express the whole 0,1 relation.
	As we can see, the difference between 0 and 1 is 
	symmetrical, and therefore, as the identity of 1 
	IS this difference, the number 1 is  symmetrical.
	The difference that is 1 is not more +1 than -1, 
	it is equally both, and is therefore symmetrical.
	We may also prove the 0,1 symmetry as follows:

	          The Identity Matrix Shows
	        The Difference Between 0 and 1
	        (found at their intersections)

	                     0  1
	                    ______
	                 0 | 0 +1 |
	                   |      | = 0
	                 1 |-1  0 |
	                   --------

	             0 is -1 relative to 1
	             1 is +1 relative to 0

	As the difference between 0 and 1 is symmetrical,
	the 0,1 relation simultaneously defines + and -1.
	The identity of 1 is this symmetrical difference.
	Proving that 1 is the  symmetrical relation of 1 
	to 0 is the fact that in the identity matrix the 
	intersection of 1 and 1 is 0 (and when  the iden-
	tity matrix is expressed as logic functions, the
	relation of 1 to 1 yields a null function), this 
	proves that 1 derives no identity attribute from 
	the relation of 1 to 1.  The number 1 exists ex- 
	clusively within the 0,1 relation, and therefore
	is nothing but that entire symmetrical relation.

	The number 1 is, like a coin that has two sides,
	a binary entity that is composed of equal yet op-
	posite components (1,-1) the sum of which equals 
	that from which 1 arises,  which is 0. This para-
	dox may be referred to as the "nonarising of 1." 
	As 1 cannot escape 0, the number 0 is absolute.

	 YOU CANNOT GET SOMETHING (1) FROM NOTHING (0)

	        0 = (...-1 <-->0<--> +1...) = 0

	The number 0 gives us 1 and takes it away. Where
	"1" is something and "0" is nothing, we can say,
	in light of the nonarising of 1, that you cannot
	get something (1) from nothing (0). So identity,
	like energy, is conserved -- and as we will see,
	this conservation law is the universal constant.

	THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH


	    (-)--  THE HOLISTIC NUMBER ONE  --(+)
                                             -  +
	If the identity of 1 is symmetrical (0<-->1) yet
	our notation of 1 implies only an asymmetry that
	expresses either +1 or -1 but not both, then our
	notation of 1 expresses only  half of the actual
	and  true nature of the difference that is 1. If
	half of the truth works for us, that's fine, but
	should we decide to express only the whole truth
	and noting but the whole truth, then logic dic-
	tates that we must express BOTH of the sides of
	the symmetrical coin that is the identity of 1.

	          1 = (difference) = (+)+(-)

	So the notation that  expresses the whole truth
	about the number 1 will express the symmetrical
	1,-1 structure of the difference-derived iden-
	tity of 1. Let that notation simply be "1h."

	                 0--->1 = +1
	                 0<---1 = -1
	                 0<-->1 = 1h

	             1h = (1 + (-1)) = 0

	+1 expresses 50% of the symmetrical difference
	that is 1, and -1 expresses the other 50%, but
	only 1h expresses 100% of the  difference that 
	is 1. Expressing the  Whole Truth about the na-
	ture of identity requires that the 1h notation
	replace all instances where "1" and "-1" are 
	denoted. Here is such a uniform conversion:

	 Conversion Of Half Truths To Full Truth
	 Via Uniform Holistic Number 1h Conversion

	 HALF Truth:  1 * 2 + 1 = 3  
	 convert to 1s
	 HALF Truth:  1 * (1+1) + 1 = (1+1+1)

	 convert all 1s to 1h and sum to 100% truth

	 FULL Truth:  1h * (1h+1h) + 1h = (1h+1h+1h)
	 100% Truth:  0 * 0 + 0 = 0

	Notice that because 1h = (1+(-1)) and because the 
	definition of 1h logically (and as such properly) 
	defines every instance of the numbers "1" and "-1"
	to be expressions of the whole difference that is 
	the implicit identity structure of each and every 
	instance of the number 1 and -1, it follows there-
	fore that by definition, the number 1h implies an 
	infinite series of conversions of each 1 and each 
	-1 to 1h within the 1h statement itself. Thus the
	holistic number "1h" defines the existence of an
	infinite series of self-similar entities within
	itself. The holistic number 1h expresses a spon-
	taneous universe. 1h defines an entity that is
	simultaneously all of 0, 1, -1, and infinity:

	 Infinite Series Of Definition-Dictated
	 Replacements Of The 1 and -1 Within 1h

	 where ( => ) = (implies)

	 IF +1 => 1h, and
	 IF -1 => 1h, and
	 IF 1h = (1+(-1))
	 THEN (1+(-1) => ((1+(-1))+(1+(-1))) =>
	 (((1+(-1))+(1+(-1)))+((1+(-1))+(1+(-1))))
	 unto Infinity....

	 ERGO: 1h <=> 2h <=> 4h <=> infinity(h) = 0

	The infinity of the universe arises only because
	something can come from nothing IF it = (1+(-1)),
	which shall be proven by universal conservation.

	          - <---------0---------> +

	      YOU CAN GET SOMETHING FROM NOTHING

	   IF AND ONLY IF THAT SOMETHING = (1+(-1))

	        - <-----------0-----------> +

	Expressing the holistic structure of the number 1 
	while describing his multiverse theory (which pos-
	tulates a multitude of universes emerging from no-
	thing), the theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku 
	states in the May '96 issue of Astronomy magazine:

	    "Creating universes out of nothing may 
	    seen to violate cherished conservation 
	    principles, until we realize that it 
	    takes no energy to create a universe.  
	    If the universe is closed like a bubble,
	    then the energy content of its matter 
	    is positive, while the energy of its 
	    gravity is negative. THE SUM IS EXACTLY 
	    ZERO (because it requires positive en-
	    ergy to lift an object out of its grav-
	    itational well, the object's gravita-
	    tional energy is negative). Thus it 
	    takes NO NET energy to create new bub-
	    bles, which are constantly being creat-
	    ed in the sea of nothing. Universes 
	    are for free." [1] [ emphasis added ]

	We can express the zero-sum of a universe, and
	in so doing express the nature of 1h, as such:

	             Pre-Universe = 0 
	            Universe = (1+(-1))

	               Pre-U = U = 0

	In harmony with Kaku's multiverse theory, the
	holistic number 1h simultaneously describes the
	zero sum of each universe in the multiverse and
	of each  entity found in every single universe.
	The holistic number 1h defines  everything for
	every universe is the  infinite series  of 1h;
	a self-similar fractalized infinity that = 0.

	        - <-----------0-----------> +


	 (-)-- RESOLUTION OF ALL NUMBERS TO ZERO --(+)

	None of the many varieties of numbers, such as 
	rational,  irrational,  imaginary, complex, ect,
	constitute a deviation from the zero-sum law and
	the  conservation of identity simply because all
	number varieties are  founded  upon the primary
	unit that is the identity 1, even the fractional
	numbers, for the number 1 itself can be thought
	of as a 1/10 (.1) fraction of the number 10. 

	Imaginary numbers are based upon the square root
	of -1, an operation that might be said to exceed
	the one-to-one relational  symmetry of 0,1. That
	proposition fails, however, because the holistic
	number 1h  logically  replace all instances of 1
	and -1 due to the symmetrical nature of 1 and -1,
	and the square root of 1h is 0. Yet this doesn't
	mean we cannot construct a system of imaginary 
	numbers, for it is simply a useful invention.

	If we express the system of real and imaginary
	numbers using the Argand diagram which displays
	the real numbers along the x axis and the imagi-
	nary numbers along the  y axis of a  Cartesian
	coordinate system, we can see the symmetrical
	relations of 1 and 1i (imaginary 1) to 0:


	               y axis

	               |
	            1i ^
	               |
	          (1hi)|
	               v (1h)  1
	               0<----->|-- x axis


	A complex number (which is a number containing
	one real and one imaginary number) contains the
	symmetrical relation of each of those numbers to
	0 (as we can see above), and thus the sum of all
	complex numbers will equal zero. So to sum this 
	up to the conclusion: logical dictates that no 
	number-type or expression can deviate from 0

	because...

	(a) all numbers are naught but multiples of the 
	numbers 1 or -1 or of the fractions .1 or .-1, 

	(b) the entire nature of the identity-superstruc-
	ture of each one of the numbers 1, -1, .1 and .-1 
	is expressed logically as a numeric symmetry that 
	contains both (1 and -1) or both (.1 and .-1), 

	(c) that symmetrical-identity structure equals 0,

	it follows that...

	(d) the sum of the identity of all numbers must 
	equal 0. (Heretofore, the  real numbers  are to 
	be representative of all varieties of numbers.)

	        - <-----------0-----------> +



	  (-)-- ALL NUMBERS ARE SUBSETS OF ZERO --(+)

	Every number attains its primary identity attri-
	bute, which is itself (such that the primary id-
	entity attribute of 4 is 4), by relation to the
	number 0. Yet 0 is the only number that attains
	its primary attribute by relation to itself and
	thus is the only absolute number. 0 is not only
	the source but the  sum of all numbers  and the
	sum of all  identity attributes  of all numbers.
	These facts, which shall be proven below, prove
	that all numbers are subordinate subsets of 0.

	          The Identity Matrix Shows
	        The Difference Between 0 and 1
	        (found at their intersections)

	                     0  1
	                    ______
	                 0 | 0  1 |
	                   |      | = 0
	                 1 |-1  0 |
	                   --------

	By relation to 0, number 1 attains its primary 
	identity attribute, which is 1, yet 0 attains a 
	secondary identity attribute -1 by relation to 1.
	0 attains its primary attribute of 0 from itself.
	This means that 0 can precede the existence of 1,
	and thus 0 is an absolute, not relative, identity.

	0 = that which attains its identity from itself.
	And the identity attribute all numbers attain by
	relation to themselves (as the matrix shows) is 0.
	Because 0 attains its identity from 0, and both 1 
	and -1 attain their identities from relation to 0,
	it follows that all identities are derived from a 
	symmetrical relation to 0, and thus: (a) 0 is the 
	source of all identities and (b) zero is the end
	sum of all identities = Alpha & Omega. Proof:

	                     Alpha              Omega
	                   beginning             end
	                     source              sum
	                        |
	  add all  ... -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3...  =  0
	           <------------|----------->


	As we can clearly see, zero is the source and the 
	sum of all numbers. Here is still more proof that 
	also reveals the relational structure of identity 
	and how and why all numbers are subsets of zero:

	--------------------         --------------------

	All numbers listed vertically below a number along 
	the top are the identity attributes of that number 
	as derived from its relation to the numbers listed 
	along the side, outside the matrix box.  So number
	-2 is an identity of the number 4 because number 4 
	is 2 less than number 6. In the same way, -2 is an
	identity attribute Mr. Jones if and only if Jones 
	is 2 feet shorter than Mr. Smith or anything.

	As the identity matrices above clearly show us, the 
	primary identity attribute of each number, which is 
	itself, is derived from its relation to 0, and thus 
	0 is the source of all numeric identities, which is 
	also expressed by the fact that 0 is the beginning: 

	                   beginning
	                       |
	              -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3
	               <-------|-------->

	As we can also see, all the numbers listed in the
	matrices, and by  extension all numbers, are iden-
	tity attributes of 0, and thus 0 contains all num-
	bers as attributes.  We can conclude that all num-
	bers are subsets of the absolute number 0 because:

	 (a) 0 precedes all other numbers,
	 (b) 0 is the only absolute number,
	 (c) 0 is the source of all numbers,
	 (d) 0 is the sum of all numbers, and
	 (e) 0 is the sum of all identity attributes.

	It follows thus that 0 contains all numbers and 
	thus all numbers are subsets of 0 and 0 is thus 
	the superset that contains all numbers. The set
	of all numbers is 0:

	         0 = {1,-1,2,-2,3,-3...} = 0

	       0 = {the set of all numbers} = 0


	              - <-----0-----> +

	In addition to the algebraic proof that the dif-
	ference between any two numbers equals 0, we can
	also prove the same by the rules of set theory.

	The definition of "difference between two sets"
	is: the difference of sets A and B is the set of
	elements which belong to A but don't belong to B.
	[2]  The definition of an "identity set" is: the 
	identity set of A is  the set that  contains all 
	the attributes of the identity of A. An example:
	-2 would be a member of the  identity set of Mr.
	Jones if Jones is 2 feet shorter than Mr. Smith,
	and also of the number 4 if 4 is 2 less than 6.

	To determine if two numbers, for example 1 and 4,
	are different we must identify all the members of
	the identity set of 1 that are not members of the
	identity set of 4.  Because every number contains
	every other number as an  identity attribute as a
	consequence of its relation to every other number
	(as the identity matrix proves), the identity set
	of every number is equivalent to the identity set
	of every other number. For example, where "--" 
	expresses the set notation for "difference":

	    The Identity Sets Of Numbers 1 and 4

	    1 = {0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4,5,-5...}
	    4 = {0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4,5,-5...}

	    ERGO: 1 -- 4 = null

	So logic dictates that there is no difference bet-
	ween the numbers 1 and 4. This is consistent with
	the zero-sum of their difference, in which 1 is 3
	less (-3) than 4 and 4 is 3 more (+3) than 1. How
	can this be? Obviously 4 is somehow unique from 1.

	The difference between 1 and 4 is simply a product
	of their sequential location, 4 comes after 1 and,
	as an example, 1 attains its identity attribute of
	-2 from 3  but 4 attains its identity attribute of
	-2 from 6. These differences do not, however, con-
	stitue any deviation from zero-sum law, since all
	components of these differences are symmetrical.

	(-)-- ZERO: THE UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL CONSTANT --(+)


	The Law Of Space-Time-Motion Conservation:

	Every unit of forward (+) space-time-motion corre-
	sponds to a symmetrical unit of backward (-) space-
	time-motion such that net space-time-motion always 
	equals zero.

	Just as the numeric unit 1 contains both +1 and -1
	a unit of space-time-motion contains both +1 and -1.

	          Logical & Physical Symmetry

	                  0--->1 = +1
	                  0<---1 = -1
	                  0<-->1 =  0

	How is this physical symmetry so?  The relativity
	of space-time motion. If object X moves forward 1
	unit of space --> relative to a coordinate system,
	it is also and simultaneously true that the coor-
	dinate system moves backward <-- -1 unit of space
	relative to X. The sum of the net motion equals 0.
	Since we  measure space by motion  across it, all
	our measurements (when  all aspects of the motion
	are summed) must equal 0. For a more comprehensive
	review: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-space.htm 

	      net space-motion = (--> + <--) = 0
	      net space-motion = ( 1  +(-1)) = 0

	The very same symmetry holds for time motion. Our
	motion forward in time is forward motion --> only
	relative to points in time,  such as this moment,
	moving backward <-- into the past.  Those moments 
	in time that travel  backwards  into the past are 
	the  hash marks on the  ruler of time relative to 
	which forward time-motion is measured as the for-
	ward time-motion that it is. Without the backward
	motion of moments in time into the past, the mea-
	sure of forward motion toward to the future would
	not be possible.  Therefore, just as the number 1
	is symmetrical, time-motion is  symmetrical, and 
	thus the measurement of net time-motion equals 0
	such that the complete calculation of time is:

	 We have just advanced one (1) second into the

	As we can see, the structure of space-time-motion
	and of the logical entity number 1 are identical:
	each primary unit of space and of time are, just
	like the primary logical unit, composed of two
	symmetrical components the sum of which = 0. 

	Showing an identity between the structure of the
	primary logical unit 1 and single units of space-
	time-motion is a critical aspect of proving the
	validity and universality of the zero-sum law.

	Additional to the zero-sum of space-time-motion,
	as we read in the quotation by physicist Michio 
	Kaku, the net sum of all energy in the universe 
	equals 0. Indeed, 0 is the universal constant.

	All logical and physical structures, however com-
	plex and  seemingly asymmetrical, are invariably 
	built upon the symmetrical structures of the pri-
	mary 0,1 identity relation and space-time-motion,
	and therefore nothing can deviate from zero-sum.

	0 = (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) + (1+(-1)) = 0

    LONDON (AFX) - PPL Therapeutics PLC shares were sharply higher after it
announced it has successfully cloned a calf.
    At 9:56 AM, PPL shares were up 12-1/2 pence at 192-1/2 after the company
said its U.S. operation had produced 'Mr Jefferson', a healthy 98-pound
Holstein.
    Analysts said the birth of Mr Jefferson will help quell some
reservations in
the scientific community about the company's earlier success in cloning
sheep. 
    Other researchers have not been able to reproduce the success of PPL
and its
associated scientists at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, and some doubts had
been
raised about the veracity of the cloning claims.
    PPL had produced Dolly, the first cloned sheep, and Polly, the first
cloned
transgenic sheep. 
    PPL specialises in the production of human proteins in the milk of
transgenic sheep -- animals which have had human DNA incorporated into their
DNA. 
    The company has said that cloning could represent a more cost-effective
way
of producing transgenic animals. Animals said cloned cows could provide
greater
production volume for the human proteins, which the company is developing for
the treatment of haemophilia and cystic fibrosis.

   Cannabis: UN report leaked

   By Tim Radford, Science Editor

The Guardian   Thursday February 19, 1998

   United Nations health chiefs suppressed a finding that cannabis is
   safer than either alcohol or tobacco, according to a report today.

   A World Health Organisation report published in December was to have
   concluded that even if cannabis was consumed on the same scale as
   cigarettes and whisky, it would probably still be safer than either,
   but the passage was scrapped at the last moment, says the magazine New
   Scientist.

   The comparison with alcohol and tobacco, the suppressed passage said,
   was made "not to promote one drug over another but rather to minimise
   double standards that have operated in appraising the health effects
   of cannabis".

   The disputed passage was leaked to New Scientist after it was
   withdrawn, reportedly in response to pressure from the US National
   Institute on Drug Abuse and the UN International Drug Control
   Programme. It says: "In developed societies cannabis appears to play
   little role in injuries caused by violence, as does alcohol." It also
   says there is good evidence that alcohol can harm foetal development,
   while the evidence that cannabis can harm foetal development is "far
   from conclusive".

   The WHO report does admit that, like heavy drinking, marijuana smoking
   can produce psychosis in susceptible people. It also says chronic
   cannabis smoking may contribute to cancers of the aerodigestive tract.
   But one lung disease researcher, Donald Tashkin of the University of
   California at Los Angeles, found that volunteers who smoked three
   joints a day had much the same lung capacity and function as those who
   smoked none.

   However, dope smokers must inhale deeply and hold the smoke in the
   lungs, so they got a large dose of potentially damaging tar.

   The leaked UN report comes at a time of renewed pressure to think
   again about drug policies.

No, not for certain, but there is cause for alarm and I believe the
consequences such bannings are not to be taken lightly.  Much of my
concern stems from recent public attacks gene engineering and clonning.  I
know people have reacted negativley in the past to tech that eventually
was accepted and proved very useful.  However, I think that in most
poeple's minds, the notion of quelling pain with anesthetics is not as
"unnatural" as more permanent tamperings like clonning, genetic
engineering, or implants that make you smarter than the avergage
constituent.  Especially when politicians adopt such issues just for
fun/polical gain and feed the paranioa.  

I suspect that the outcome of the current cloning and gene engineering
debates will set a presedent for future "ethicly troubling" technologies,
both from  entrepeneurial and legislative stand points (Who wants to
develop technology likely to be banned?  Who wants to develop technology
for just a small band of futurists somewhere in the middle of the ocean?
We've banned similar technologies, we might as well ban these as well)
If these current rages pass without criminalization then I will be much
more optimistic about future developments gaining acceptance.  I agree
that much of the reasoning for keeping drugs illegal is b/c they were
illegal and I expect that attitudes will be no less yeilding to clonning,
genetic enginneering etc. once, if,  they are banned.  I suspect we will
have a good idea of how willing the legislative bodies of the world are to
accept enhancing technologies before the Extropia Sovereinty Fund is rich
enough to build/buy political refuge.  It might not be a bad idea to start
saving now, just in case.

My general outlook on the question whether transhumanist ideals will gain
enough acceptance to grow more or less unhindered (except where prohibited
by physical law) is a cost benefit analysis. Which is more trouble:
Establishing a physical space of refuge, terrestrial or otherwise, or
fighting/subverting political barriers.  Tough call.

Talk of "ideal" Extropian communities sounds weird to me. How is that
different from "the ideal Extropian job?" Surely what works best will vary
from individual to individual and group to group. For that reason I would
say there is *no* ideal Extropian community, nor will there ever be.
Another reason is that "ideal" is a suspiciously Platonic notion. It's like
companies advertising their products as the "ultimate" X. They don't really
mean "ultimate", but merely "the best you can find today".

So, rather than talking about ideal Extropian communities, I suggest we
talk simply about Extropian communities, or even "optimal Extropian
communities", since I take "optimal" to mean what is contextually the best,
rather than best in all situations for all people.

NEXUS: 
Traditionally (if I can use that term in an extropian context!) living
spaces inhabited by Extropians have been referred to by the term "nexus". I
first applied that term to the house on Burlington Avenue in Los Angeles
where I lived with several Extropians -- Dave Krieger, and Adam Mackler.
When I moved to Riverside and lived with Derek Strong, Ralph Whalen, Tanya
Jones we had another nexus.

MODEL GROUP NEXUS: If you want to know about how this kind of Extropian
community works, you should know that the largest nexus that I know of is
what used to be called the Pheonexus (since it was in Pheonix, AZ), but
which moved to northern California and grew to five people (plus a sixth,
Dave Krieger regularly visits). I suppose today it might be called the
TransNexus, since it made a transition from AZ to CA. Or maybe: The ExNex.
(Derek, what do you think of these? Or have you already come up with a new
name for the moved Pheonexus?)

Another Nexus, one where much frivolity, dancing, fun, sex, and other
pleasures (including "the tent" -- say no more) is the Freeland Nexus where
Extropy Institute has held a couple of fantastic parties.

To return to the faulty idea of an "ideal" community, I should point out
that a bunch of individuals living together, while great for some, will not
work for others. For some couples, and for families, other models will
often work better. There are several Extropian family Nexi/Nexuses, such as
that of the Heward Family (which, when everyone is there, includes four ExI
members, with the two youngers potential Extropians....)

Finally, to me the term "Extropia" refers not to an ideal society, but to
an evolving, open-ended process or framework for experimentation.
Extropians are not utopians in the sense of trying to bring about some
static, unchanging, "perfect" or "ideal" society or community.

I see problems with this approach, even if you make the unlikely assumption  
that the identity of the country that shot the torpedo and sunk the rust 
bucket could ever be determined. It's clear that if the directors of this 
nuclear insurance company are sane then their statement that they'd 
incinerating millions perhaps billions of people with H Bombs to avenge their 
late clients can be nothing but an empty threat. The success of the deterrent 
would hinge entirely on whether the directors were great actors or not, 
whether they could convincingly pretend to be insane. 

On the other hand, if they were sincere in their threat then they'd really be 
insane and so render contracts made with such a company problematic at best.
                               

        >Obviously they must be decentralized enough that the nation can't

The head of this insurance company would have to be a very brave man, and 
he'd have to buy life insurance from his own company because nobody else 
would sell him a police. He certainly wouldn't have to worry about the 
infirmities of old age, I'd give him a half life after the nuclear attack of 
about 3 hours.

Portable telephones have become so cheap that I recently decided to get one

    There has been some speculation that caloric restriction might be able
 to retard the rate of aging, and extend maximum human life span beyond
 120 years of age. (For example see the book "The 120 Year Diet" by Roy
 Walford)
    Recent evidence indicates that the anti-aging effect of caloric
 restriction, which has been documented in rodents, is not operative in
 humans.
    A low body-mass index does have a positive association with reduced
 mortality rates in humans. However recent research indicates that this is
 due to a negative association between BMI and physical fitness. After
 physical fitness is accounted for, there exists no further effect of BMI
 on mortality. See the following table from (International Journal of
 Obesity 19 Suppl: S41-S44 1995.

                     All Cause Death Rates
    BMI                    Fitness
                   Low     Moderate   High
    <27            52.1      28.6      20.0
   27-30           49.1      29.8      19.7
    >30            62.1           18.0         (moderate & high together)

     While the above data indicate that the body mass index itself is not
 a primary driving factor for mortality in humans, the case it makes
 against caloric restriction exerting an anti-aging effect is not
 air-tight. What is needed is a false prediction from a postulated
 anti-aging effect of caloric restriction that could then be used in turn
 to falsify that hypothesis. I believe there exists one such prediction.
     Lower BMI is associated with reduced mortality in young and
 middle-aged humans. If caloric restriction retards the rate of aging and
 extends maximum life span in humans one must expect that a lower BMI
 would be significantly associated with reduced mortality in aged humans.
 If such an significant association is not found then caloric intake is
 not operative in modifying the rate of aging in humans and life spans
 beyond 120 will not be possible by reducing caloric intake.
     In humans over 84 years of age BMI has not been found to exert any
 significant effect on mortality. (New England Journal of Medicine 338:
 1-7 1998 & Arch Intern Med 157: 2249-2258 1997) Therefore since no
 association has been found between BMI and mortality in aged humans, then
 caloric restriction is not operative in modifying the rate of aging in
 humans.
     The fact that caloric restriction dramatically extends life span in
 mice, but not apparently in humans requires some explanation. Here is
 one. In mice caloric restriction is associated with torpor, which can act
 to reduce tumor growth. In C57BL/6J mice blocking torpor, by increasing
 housing temperature to 30 C reduced the increase in average life span
 associated with caloric restriction from 47% to just 4%. Since humans
 neither experience torpor, nor suffer from cancer to the degree that mice
 do the effect of caloric restriction in mice can not be generalized to
 include humans. For example in human centenarians only 4% die from
 cancer. By comparison cardiovascular disease accounts for 63% of deaths
 in those aged 95 and over. (Epidemiology 8: 501-504 1997) Thus it is
 cardiovascular disease and not cancer that is the major longevity
 limiting factor in humans.
     It is possible that potassium intake may be a major dietary modulator
 of human longevity. A high potassium intake has been found to reduce
 stroke associated mortality to zero. (New England Journal of Medicine
 316: 235-240 1987)

 "Physical Fitness as a Predictor of Mortality Among Healthy, Middle-Aged
 Norwegian Men"
 New England Journal of Medicine 328(8): 533-537 1993

   Here's some good news for smokers. High physical fitness can reverse
 most of the adverse effects of smoking on all causes of mortality. The
 following table is from the above research report.

I've been noodling around in an extremely strange but just barely possibly
epoch-making revolutionary former Oz inventor/GUT theorist named Dr Randell
Mills, of Blacklight Power, Inc, whose url is

http://www.blacklightpower.com/

and who claims to have constructed a classical replacement for QT that as a
side-effect yields a strange new power source from hydrogen that he's
patented in Oz and is building gadgets from in the States.  Almost
certainly a crackpot or scamster but one never knows - he seems to have an
impressive track record.   A garbled but interesting interview with him
appeared in the Dec 97/ Jan 98 ish of that odd/loony magazine *Infinite
Energy*, edited by cold fusion guru (sigh) Dr Eugene Mallove.  If some of
the physicists here have a gander at Mills's site, it might be nice to hear
an informed assessment.

  IAN: I received several interesting

  agree with the example you cite. If 
  X exerts force upon Y, then Y will 
  exert an equal but opposite force

  fact. In short, Newton's third

Great point.  

The TransNexus of Ralph and Tanya is very flexible, and this is what I
really like about their extropian community, as well as Freeland Nexus (the
"tent" surely will stand out in history as being the extropian fun wild
party alternatives of the late 20th Century!)

One of the joys I experienced over many years of traveling was the different
types of communities I lived in. I think the ones I really learned the most
from, and had the most fun were the communities where there was a sense of
respect for others' views. 

Thus the poem that Michael Butler posted a couple of days ago is noteworthy:
to enjoy liberty, but not at the expense of another.  When we think of
models for living arrangements, an important ingredient is not only the
world-views of the individuals, but also the manner in which they interact.

I agree wt\ith you on this.  There is no certianty for the prohibition of
transhuman/advanced technology, BUT there are two general
sentiments at large which threaten us, and merit some attention.  One
is technophobia, whether directed at all technology or at a particular
set of technologies -- automobiles, genetic engineering, nuclear
power, computers.  We've already discussed this one, but I've yet
to see a clear plan or set of plans to combat it.

The other is the desire to seek centrally planned solutions to any
problems, real or imagined, from poverty to cloning.  This creates
a culture in which people who fear technological progress or
certain technologies often have the power to prevent others who
have no such fears from using or advancing those very same
technologies.

Of course, another alternative is to present faits accompli.  Clone people
in huge numbers, then foist them upon society, for example.  (Sounds
like a good idea for a science fiction story: a society where clones
outnumber nonclones...)  In this way, political barriers can be ignored.

Fastforward to the future!

  and when eaten, the drug works more efficiently. A large portion of the drug
is wasted when vaporized (and water filtered) then even more when you exhale
after a smoke..


on the other hand, does anyone really trust that New Scientist story?? I've

While the original posting made the exaggerated claim that it was the
most respectable scientific journal around, it is still
respectable. It is not a peer-reviewed research journal like Science
or Nature, rather it is about science for scientists, a kind of
"semi-popular science" not unlike Scientific American. In general it
holds a fairly high class.

Newton's Third Law covers both facts.  In this case,
it is much simpler to talk in terms of Newton's Third
Law, instead of mentioning both forces.  However,
the case in point can be split into those two forces.
The fact of them is no less real because of this,
no more than we can talk of a house being made
of wood or of atoms.  Neither is false; both are
true.  Nor does one contradict or exclude the
other.  Both are true, but both are not exactly the
same.

The evidence you site doesn't seem to me to provide strong support for
rejecting caloric restriction for human life extension. Two reasons:

(1) Simply comparing BMI (Body Mass Index?) to death rate can be
misleading. There are millions of people who die of cancer and other
wasting diseases who lose weight and die with a lower BMI. It doesn't seem
like the study allowed for that.

(2) Apparently smoking cigarettes reduces appetite. I would expect smokers,
especially heavy smokers, to have a lowe BMI and to die earlier, on
average, of heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.

(3) I suspect that most or many of those who have a low BMI and who don't
live as long, may not have maintained the high nutrition diet specified by
caloric restriction advocates. Low calorie intake with low nutrient intake
is not claimed to extended life.

Thoughts?

Natasha and I will certainly be going, and I'm sure other Extropians in the
LA area.

Did my post about the conference make it to the list? I got a bounce from
the Transhuman list, which I don't understand, but I thought it made it
through here.

Eating cannabis can be tricky, though, because it's tougher to control the 
dosage this way and you might get a bad trip (or no trip). Vaporizing is a 
much quicker and more controllable way to get high (vaporizing tends to 
get you high, while smoking has a more "stoned" effect), although it's true 
that if you want a truly profound, smooth trip Shiva Bhang balls (small balls 
of cannabis mush and some other herbs - an Indian specialty) are probably 
better than vaporizing. Another advantage of these balls, that are chewed a 
bit and then swallowed, is that they can be used discretely (unlike smoked 
pot, that can be detected from a mile away...)

  >>

Actually it's the other way around, vaporizing is the most efficient method,
as you can inhale 100% of the THC, whereas with smoking only 20-50% is
inhaled, the rest is incinerated.  Eating is even less efficient than smoking,
you need about 3 times as much material. The high is also different with each
of these methods.

Today's WASHINGTON POST Health section focused on the role of 
hormones in longivity, the first time that they have devoted such a 
large section of newsprint to a life-extension topic.  The articles 
focused on DHEA, melatonin and growth hormones and include interviews 
with doctors who have begun to prescribe these to patients.  The 
attempt to move beyond the hyped claims of 'forever young' is 
laudable, but some of the criticism is aimed at serious efforts to 
utilize these substances to maintain levels of health.  The 
suggestion that one should have blood levels checked prior to 
beginning a regimen is dismissed as an unreasonable expectation that 
the patient should be taking some responsibility for obtaining health 
information. 

Some useful information appears, however, including the news of
studies on fluasterone, similar to DHEA, that is not converted to
testosterone or estrogen in the body.  The National Institute on
Aging has given eight grants for the purpose of studying the role in
growth hormones in the prevention of tissue degeneration in the
elderly.  If these studies bear out, then the FDA may approve growth
hormone treatment for the healthy elderly (at present, it is
approved for use in AIDS patients).  Nevertheless, HGH Corporation
reports that over 200 physicians have signed up for their program to
supply growth hormone through several injections a week to their
patients, at a cost of about %5,000 per year.

  It's so typical for this so-called planning system to start
handling the situation after it has developed into a very
obvious crisis, that I don't even find it funny anymore...
However, this may be very symptomatic - I suggested this very
scenario to my friend yesterday, with the hope that the
quickening progress of technology will destroy justifications
for at least some restrictions on personal liberty.

Maybe, this is a first step on making highly skilled labor
a globally privileged elite, as the recognition of their
importance, scarcity and exterritorial nature of their work.
(Nature doesn't apply the same territorial restrictions to
tigers and fungi; the governments, so far, have)

 High-tech Firms Seek To End Cap On Foreign Workers

 By Deeann Glamser

 SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft and other high-tech companies,
 which say they face a critical shortage of programmers and
 engineers, this week will ask Congress to eliminate the hiring
 cap on foreign professionals.

 "This has slowly built to a crisis situation this year," Brian
 Raymond, domestic policy manager for the American Electronics
 Association, a trade group representing some 3,000 technology
 companies, said in a recent interview.

 At issue are H-1B visas, allowing non-citizen doctors, computer
 programmers and other professionals to work in the United States
 for up to six years. The visas are used to fill shortages of
 skilled workers, or are for people with extraordinary talents.

 This year, the annual limit of 65,000 H-1B visas is expected to
 be hit by June, with no more issued until Oct. 1, the start of
 the next federal fiscal year.

 Last year, the allotment was gone by September, the first time
 the limit was reached.

 The Senate Judiciary Committee has a hearing scheduled for
 Wednesday on H-1B visas for high-tech workers.

 Microsoft, Texas Instruments Inc. and Sun Microsystems officials
 will testify in favor of repealing the cap.

 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, the

 leading U.S. professional group for electrical and electronics
 engineers, wants to retain the current limit.

 Visa information is sketchy, but 44 percent of pre- application
 certifications -- the requests companies make to the Labor
 Department as a prerequisite for applying for an H-1B visa -- in
 fiscal 1997 were for computer occupations, up from 25 percent in
 fiscal 1995.

 The next-largest category in fiscal 1997 was physical therapists,
 at 26 percent of requests.

 The Information Technology Association of America, a trade
 association that also opposes the cap, says companies with 100 or
 more employees have 346,000 openings for programmers, systems
 analysts and computer engineers, or 10 percent of the nation's
 3.3 million information-technology jobs.

 Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments hires about 150 H-1B visa
 holders a year, 10 percent to 15 percent of its annual technical
 hires.

 Most are graduate students at U.S. universities and become
 residents here. The majority are from Taiwan and India.

 "These employees are critical. We depend greatly on electrical
 engineering talent to build our products," said Stephen Leven,
 Texas Instruments director of worldwide human resources.

 Intel also wants the cap repealed. It hires 300 to 400 foreign
 design engineers a year, almost a third of the design engineers
 it hires annually and about 4 percent of the slightly more than
 10,000 people it hired in 1997.

 As at Texas Instruments, most are graduate students sponsored by
 the company for residency.

 Visa-limit proponents say more U.S. students are enrolling in
 engineering and computer sciences as job prospects surge, and
 older employees can be retrained for the changing job market.

 "We really believe there is a sufficient amount of people to
 satisfy needs in the U.S.," said Paul Kostek, a Seattle- based
 consultant and president-elect of the Institute of Electrical and
 Electronics Engineers-USA.

 Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of
 California at Davis, said companies exacerbate the worker
 shortage by requiring very specific skills for each job and
 preferring males in their 20s and 30s.

 "They want them young, and with the latest, hot technology, "
 Matloff said. "For experienced programmers, learning a new
 language is no big deal."

 He said visa workers earn less on average than their U.S. peers
 and are unlikely to leave a company sponsoring them for permanent
 residency.

 Microsoft has not released its H-1B figures, but says a mix of
 cultural backgrounds is critical in a global marketplace.

 "It's important for us to hire the most appropriate workers to

 compete," said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.

I'm sure this has probably been mentioned before, but if not... 
   
    I was perusing the skeptic's dictionary just now, and found
the Extropy Institute to be among the list of topics to be covered in 
the future. Not all of the articles on there are incredibly scathing, 
and I would imagine the cryonics entry (also on the to-be-done list)
to appear as nothing more than an thin article saying "there is no 
evidence it will work" ... but it's interesting to see these there.

"True freedom requires a life without boundaries."

So read the advertisement I saw on the Tube the other day for the re-styled
Royal Automobile Club, which now looks more like NASA. I'm not a member,
and I don't need to be from a motoring point of view. But that
advertisement struck me like a Millwall supporter, and I 'phoned the
number. Needless to say, the person on the other end of the telephone tried
to sell me a membership.

But what are "boundaries" anyway? Show me a boundary, and, unless you show
me the event horizon boundary caused by the limit on the speed of light, I
will probably be able to show you your imagination.

We know from our early physics lessons that everything around us affects
everything else. What you feel, smell or see is affected in some small way
by the very action of you perceiving it. There is little to distinguish a
tool that I make from a tool that I am born with. They are both a part of
me, different only in the degrees to which they are useful and easily
replacable. There is no stark boundary around me. There is only an
extensive, fuzzy zone where I blur into my surroundings.

So, imagine that I am seriously injured, and have been rushed to hospital.
But all the surgeons are having a Christmas party. "Send him away," they
clamour. "We're having fun here!"

I die.

Did the surgeons cause my death? Obviously not: they merely failed to
prevent it. Or did they? Where is the boundary surrounding the set of
events which caused my death? How does one distinguish an event which
CAUSED my death from one which merely FAILED TO PREVENT it? I challenge
anyone to produce a satisfactory criterion. Again, there is no stark
boundary. There are only differences in the degree to which one event
contributes to another.

The introductory message to this list claims that Extropians may have an
interest in "rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)". This
must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more
libertarian view of ethics. Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to
do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those
people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else". Every
action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.
You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can
do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for
one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.

Which brings me, finally, to the point. 

Someone you know, rationally, carefully and thoughtfully, decides that it
is time to end their life. Such an action has a number of easily
identifiable anti-Extropic effects.

What is the right thing to do? Do you give the person their liberty, or do
you exercise your "ethics for survival and flourishing" and forcibly remove
it?

Regards,
Darren

Alexander's e-mail just reminded me of something I heard about the other
day: MAI (or Multilateral Agreement on Investment)  From what I've read, it
seems this agreement will limit OECD countries' ability to legislate
barriers to movement of capital or workers.  This "global constitution"
will, IMO, create a much freer global marketplace, and will disallow
governments to pursue their political agendas by restricting the flow of
capital.  Here are some of the goodies found in the MAI:

1. Countries will be required to treat foreign investors at least as well
as domestic ones(regardless of the local economics situation)
2. Governments will not be allowed to create or enforce laws that require
investors to invest locally, or hire locally.
3. Restriction on the movement of capital between countries will be banned.
4. Corporations will have the right to sue countries if they violate this
agreement (ie. countries get treeted like private legal entities) 

Apparently, the details of this treaty have been hammered out for the last
3 years in secret meetings in Paris.

Has anyone else heard of MAI?  Any comments?

Geoff.

I don't find Dr. Mills' credentials or his theory very impressive.

He's a medical doctor, with no degree in physics.  He has created a theory
that says that the electrons in hydrogen atoms can drop to lower than
the standard lowest-energy orbital, when interacting with a "secret"
catalyst that he has invented.  This releases heat, so he is trying to
get people to invest in his mysterious energy-production technology.

He runs these chambers with hydrogen gas and his catalyst.  He has to
input heat to ionize the hydrogen, but when he measures heat output it
seems like more is coming out than was going in.

This is very similar to the cold fusion story.  Doing calorimetry
(measuring heat in and out) accurately is much more difficult than
non-specialists realize.  It is easy to get false results by not
accounting for all the changes properly.  There is also the possibility
that some chemical reaction is occuring with the hydrogen.

The hydrogen atom is the most thoroughly studied in physics.  The chances
that some chemical interaction can cause electrons to take up orbitals
forbidden by quantum mechanics, but that nobody else has noticed it before
this MD did, seem impossibly small.

The secrecy, the attempts to raise money by claiming a virtually
inexhaustable source of energy, setting up a business rather than doing
conventional scientific research, all point to it being a scam.

This is a recurring argument between the engineers and industry, about every
five years or so, whenever things get good economically.  the IEEE takes the
predictable stance for its constituents.

Interesting, the thought of high-tech workers becoming a "Global Privileged
Elite", though I'm not sure I like the sound of "Privileged Elite".  Global,
that's good enough for me.

The reason high-tech companies have a shortage is that they don't want to pay
more for us geeks if they can avoid it.  Despite record low unemployment for
engineers and programmers, except in certain specialties and areas (the SF Bay
area, ASIC design), wages have hardly increased for years.  There may be a
shortage, but not enough of one to increase the $incentive for students to
choose a high-tech career over other options.  Or even for experienced
engineers to remain engineers.  Elite? Hardly.  And who can say that they
should make more than some foreigner of equal skills?  I can't justify a
foreign hiring cap even though it's to my short-term benefit.

There has never been a talent shortage, just a shortage of cheap talent.  No
shortage of cheap, crafty businessmen.

I would say the problem is rather that too many countries have
central authorities.

Please, let's distinguish:

	nation (maximal self-identified distinct set of people)
	state (monopoly of legitimized coercion)

I've had PPP access for a few days now.
One thing I tried was AltaVista on my own name:
does anyone besides me find me worth mentioning
or quoting?  So far, I don't know.
The first match was a list of authors:
	...
	Robert Anton Wilson
	Sherwood Anderson
	...
And the next several dozen were from the Extropians archive.

obviously, I don't know much. I suppose I made this assumption because when I eat
hemp it lasts SO long. I assumed that the body matabolized it better. In fact,
eating it always seems to produce a slightly different experience.

well, I stand corrected.

Darren -

Although your logic is very sound, you are IMHO missing the other side of the
equation.  Yes, everything I do in the long run effects everything else.  I
know for a fact that my actions and anyone reading these words will be effected
by it - even if it is just taking the time to delete this posting.  Since we
have a global constinuency on this list, my actions in turn affect people all
over the globe.  Within a few years, probably all 6 billion people, except the
most isolated are in some way effected by me.  The same goes for everyone else.

Therefore,  even my so called "good" actions could *indirectly* get someone
killed.  I could for example decide to spend a little extra time at home
kissing my wife.  Had I not chosen to do this, I would have driven down main
street 3 minutes earlier, where I would have forced an otherwise speeding
driver to slow down, because I was in front of him.  Instead, I wasn't there,
so he was able to speed through the red light where he killed two pedestrians.

My point:  If you try to contemplate the full ramifiactions of your actions you
will wind up in a rubber room and miserable.

My advice:  Do anything you want - have fun -lighten up and realize you have as
much right as anyone else to be on this planet and have fun.  Not only is it
easier, but in the biger scheme of things you will bring more joy and happiness
to yourself and the people around you, than you other alternative.

Best Regards,

Paul Hughes

	I have thought about this a lot.  I think even a broader question is
appropriate: when is right to intervene when you think someone is mentally
ill?  Suicide is a subset of this case.  How do you know that this is not
the direction your friend wishes to take?  Again, a difficult question.  I
have come up with only one answer: each person needs to tell at least one
other person those things that would signal for them "mental illness." 
Presumably, this would also include what exactly to do, including the
possibility of temporarily limiting freedoms.  Maybe this can be made into
a legal contract?  I'm not sure I would be totally averse to signing a
contract that stated as soon as I try to commit suicide, stop me by any
means!  It definitely beats the state deciding what defines mental illness
for you.
	Of course, there is one glaring problem: misinterpretation of the
contract.  You'd have to be pretty specific about your symptoms of mental
illness, and it would probably be prudent to revise the contract every once
and a while.  For example, the statement "Through me in a straight-jacket
if I ever move to Siberia" might need to be revised if global warming turns
Siberia into a tropical paradise.

John, I think this is a terrible confusion, although one that many people
hold to.  Freedom of choice for humans does not mean acting at random like
the Dice Man; that would be psychosis, not freedom.  I think your model
doesn't imply that anyway, but rather that our consciousness or ego is a
module (either executive or interpretative) with very restricted
information about the full state of the self.  This means that when we opt,
we do so from many more `unconscious' motives and after many more
`unconscious' or `non-conscious' combinatory and analytical moves made in
parallel than can be registered by the conscious self, except via some kind
of sampled/gestalted `feeling tone' of satisfaction, flow, frustration,
confusion, guilt, etc.  But most free choices, and the satisfactory feeling
that goes with acting in ways that are not plainly constrained to our
disadvantage, *do* have the characteristic of being consistent with our
acquired values.  True, some of those values function as meta-values, so
that we can try to rewire others lower down the hierarchy, or debug values
and templates that were ported into us before we had enough nous to
evaluate and reject or modify them.  But I think that the more we make our
values `our own', the more free we feel - that is, against your claim that
we would feel like robots.

I guess.

I'm looking into whether GTE will give one a phone w/o requiring your SSN.
I know PacBell will--they'll ask for a (possibly huge) deposit,

The data and hypotheses as you state them only say that CR qua CR doesn't
help.
No reputable CRAN proponent leaves out the AN (adequate/optimum nutrition)
part.
Show me human work that controls for the presence or absence of AN throughout 
the life of the subject, and I may be willing to concede the study has some 
applicability. As it stands, all you're saying is that starvation doesn't
help.

Well, duh.

FWIW, my BMI is way higher than I want it to be. I'll chance the
possibility that 
CRAN may make my life (including exercise) more fun, even if it doesn't
extend it.

YMMV.

<rant>
To survive and thrive (to be free of suffering, and full of joy) are the only things
that really matter, they are the core of any rational ethics system. Ultimately,
we all are motivated by discomfort-minimalization and pleasure-optimalization
(unless the brain blows a fuse). Whether we like it or not, "it's like that, and 
that's the way it is". If everyobody stuck to pure rational ethics, this would
ultimately benefit all, because helping others/not damaging them often pays
off in the long run (or instantly). We don't need christian or socialist values
(which *force* you to share, help etc.) to create a pleasant society; self-interest
with foresight has largely the same positive results, minus the bad ones
(sanctimoniousness) that are inherent to so many other memetic systems.
Holier-than-thou beliefs/philosophies ultimately only cause moral decay,
because virtually no-one can live up to their standards. A great example
of the resulting sanctiomonious behaviour are the folks who one hand hand
oppose the death penalty because it's supposedly "barbaric", while on the
other hand they don't give a damn about the situation in prisons, where rape,
beatings, extortion & murder are commonplace. A rational system would
be exaclty the opposite: there would be capital punishment (preferably

standard, just in case), and the prisons would be clean & safe, with no
(involuntary) physical contact between inmates, video/audio surveillance all
over and highly automated (human guards are nothing but trouble) so that
they no longer are a place where the least-guilty suffer most, and bad guys
get even worse. Of course, this is just one example of rational ethics in
action; the effect on the whole of society would be profound.

If you want to follow rational ethics, than you only have to worry about the
most apparent damage done to others (or, more specifically: can I get away
with it?) "Not damaging others" should not become a mindless dogma/taboo, 
that wouldn't be rational.

to the mentally ill, IMO, just like it doesn't apply to small children. The only
rational reason why someone would want to die is unbearable (mental or 
physical) suffering. If this can't be cured by today's medicine, euthanasia
and cryonic suspension are in order. If the person in question is revived
at some point in the future, he will be cured of all his physical and mental
disorders, *and* he'll be hedonistically engineered so that satisfaction is
guaranteed. And on this day, he will surely thank you from saving him
from himself.

Apropos the question that came up about the credibility of New
Scientist, I have begun to worry about Scientific American. I have
read it for as long as I have been able to read texts in english
(actually longer, I learnt some of my english from trying to read my
father's copies as a child), but recently I have begun to feel there
is a downward trend in quality. The new, glossier format with larger
and more colorful pictures is just one sign. Then there were the
infamous article about nanotechnology, and now history seems to be
repeating. Apparently the pro and con articles on the merits of animal
use in biomedical research were judged on different criteria (in favor
of the con side), allowing some unsubstantiated claims with no
opportunity for the opponents to respond. See
http://biomednet.com/hmsbeagle/member/1998/25/people/op_ed.htm for
their response, published in HMS Beagle.

Are there any others who are disturbed by the trend in Scientific
American? Are we loosing one of the in the past best popular
scientific journals to a mere journal of opinion?

I am no fan of immigration quotas, because I'm a big believer in the free
market.  However, the so-called "high-tech labor shortage" is more horseshit
than reality.  The basic fact is, most high-tech managers can't accept the
fact that their "underlings" are actually worth more than they are, and
therefore are unwilling to pay them what they're worth.  That's the
foundation of this "labor shortage".  These clowns (managers) are just
looking for cheap labor, so they can pay them less than they're worth, and
they're worth a lot more than them.

This is one of the shining examples of why management is looked down upon.

My business partner and I just did this recently while testing a web
search function we were setting up.  The results were astounding. 
Between us, we are cited in no less than a half-a-dozen FAQ's for
various newsgroups.  His movies and my writings are permanently featured
on dozens of web pages.  We had no idea that we were "public figures." 
I encourage everyone to do a search for their own name and see what
turns up.  You might be surprised!

Nonsense.  Surely the very essence of capitalism is for companies to
try to minimise the costs of production.  That means you and me.  It
also means opening up the global labour market so they can try to
import talent on the cheap.  (& I'm speaking as one of the 65000
just imported on the H1B, from London to Chicago.  Hi to anyone in 
the area!)

True, except that it wouldn't even be psychosis because even insanity has a 
cause, it would just be convulsions. I agree with the previous poster who 
said in effect that first we must define what free will is, then we can 
debate if human beings have this interesting property or not. 
I gave my definition:

 A man, animal or machine has free will if it can not always predict what it 
 will do in the future even if the external environment is constant. A third 
 party might be able to make such predictions but that's irrelevant, the 
 important thing is that the person himself can not know what he will do next 
 until he actually does it.

I maintain that this definition is clear, internally consistent and produces 
no contradictions when used with most everyday uses of the word "free". 
I've never heard of another definition that could do as well.  
                

        >our consciousness or ego is a module (either executive or         
        >interpretative) with very restricted information about the full

I agree.
                
        >This means that when we opt, we do so from many more `unconscious'         
        >motives 
                

I have no argument with Freud, there are factors in our mind that we aren't  
conscious of, but there are other things that effect our behavior that aren't  
even "unconscious", they are not in the brain at all because they have not  
been calculated yet. I think this is intimately related to Alan Turing's
discovery that a computer program has free will, that is, it can't understand 
itself, that is, it can't (we can't either) predict if it will ever stop. 

Let me suggest a thought experiment; a man is walking down a road and spots a 
fork in the road far ahead. He knows of advantages and disadvantages to both 
paths so he isn't sure if he will go right or left, he hadn't decided. Now 
imagine a powerful demon able to look into the man's head and quickly deduce 
that he would eventually choose to go to the left. Meanwhile the man, whose 
mind works much more slowly than the demon's, hasn't completed the thought 
process yet. He might be saying to himself I haven't decided I'll have to 
think about it, I'm free to go either way. From his point of view he is 
correct, even a robot does not feel like a robot, but from the demon's 
viewpoint it's a different matter, he simply deduced a purely mechanical 
operation that can have only one outcome.   

But is it really a purely mechanical operation, what about the uncertainty 
principal? I don't see how it effects matters one way or another. It says 
that some things can happen for no cause and thus are truly random, but 
happenstance is the very opposite of intelligence and even emotion. Things 
either happen because of cause and  effect or they don't and if they don't 
then they are by definition random and have nothing to due with volition.
Those who claim that this is the  source of the will must also believe that a 
nickel has free will when you  flip it. This topic muddies the question but 
does not change it.

In my example the demon did not tell the man of his prediction but now lets 
pretend he did. Suppose also that the man, being of an argumentative nature, 
was determined to do the exact opposite of what the demon predicted. Now our 
poor demon would be in a familiar predicament. Because the demon's decision 
influences the man's actions the demon must forecast his own behavior, but he 
will have no better luck in this regard than the man did and for the same 
reasons. What we would need in a situation like this is a mega-demon able to 
look into the demon's head. Now the mega-demon would have the problem.
               

        >I think that the more we make our values `our own', the more free we

My claim was that self knowledge would make us feel like robots but we don't  
have to worry about it because self knowledge is impossible, I don't see what 
that has to do with deciding we like a value and adopting it.

Let's simplify things to their essentials. Imagine a world in which the 
environment was so simple it could be predicted with complete accuracy. 
Doubtless we would find such a place boring and unpleasant but I don't think 
we would feel like robots. Thus the origin of the sensation of autonomy can 
not be external. What does it mean to "feel like a robot"? If you could 
always forecast your own behavior and thoughts with complete accuracy then 
you would feel like a  robot. Subjective (not objective) uncertainty is at 
the root of freedom and  choice.

  IAN: This issue goes right to the nexus 
  of my theory of holistic identity in it's 
  physical expression. I think that it would 
  be proper to say that Newton's 3rd law defines
  1 fact that has 2 components, or that it de-
  fines one set (F) with two elements, or two 
  subsets, such that F = {+,-}. Obviously, ex-
  pressing the conservation of force, the sum 
  of those two symmetrical elements equals zero.

  It seems illogical to me to separate the two
  components in this force symmetry because you
  could never separate them in fact; like two 
  sides of a coin, they are two and yet one. 

  That's the core of holistic identity. That's 
  the principle upon which I propose that the 
  number 1 is a single concept that poses two 
  attributes, 1 and -1 relative to 0 -- and 
  0,1 is the primary identity relation. Such a
  unity of symmetrical components is, I believe,
  the central structure of identity, as it is 
  expressed both logically and physically. It
  is expressed here in the 0,1 identity matrix:

                     0  1
                    ______
                 0 | 0  1 |
                   |      |
                 1 |-1  0 |
                   --------

  Just as force is 1 fact with 2 elements, 
  the concept of the number 1 is 1 fact
  with 2 symmetrical elements and 0, which
  is also the sum of the elements of force.
  I see a beautiful correspondence of logical
  holistic identity and physical reality herein.

There are some of us who have considered it a liberal propaganda
rag for years...just pick any article on health care policy over
the last few years.  It wouldn't surprize me a bit for them to
come out with an article on the dangers of cloning.

The one thing it's still good at--and the one reason I still
buy one now and then--is that they have damned good writers, and
can make the basics of new technologies understandable and
interesting to those outside the field.  But that's really
entertainment, not science.  SO if you consider them to be what
they are--a polular entertainment magazine--they're fine.  But
a rigorous scientific journal they are not.

I agree SciAm has, for years now, tended to produce less and less
fact and more and more fashionable opinion.  I find it now more-
or-less on a par with Discover, while SciAm used to be much better.
It's still not bad in general, but it's a pity I now have to
check the evidence in each article to see if it justifies the
claims and opinions.  The trends are definitely in the wrong direction.

It's a small world, exactly the same was true for me, I  have every issue of 
Scientific American from 1966 to today. I still read it but It's only a pale 
reflection of its former glory. The really odd thing is that they started to 
dumb it down just about the time the magazine was sold to the same company 
that publishes Nature. Go figure.

This practice is called "ego-surfing", and does occasionally

I think this definition is a good step towards understanding free will.
In particular, it helps address the question of whether the fact that a
system's behavior is predictable from outside, or simply deterministic,
means that it does not have free will.

However by itself the definition is too simple.  There has to be a
specification of some minimum predictive ability, otherwise the definition
is satisfied vacuously by systems simply because they can't predict at
all.  Cars, inclined planes, and knives all appear to have free will by
this definition, because they can not predict what they will do in the
future.

One possibility would be simply to add that the system must be concious
before we begin to address whether it has free will.  This would still
leave the definition useful for the cases we are interested in, without
having this distracting loophole.

I have been noticing this very phenomena for well over a year now, and
even wrote about this very issue in a rebuttal article about their now
infamous
nanotechnology piece, which I subsequently published in the November 1996
(Vol. 7, No. 4) issue of Midnight Engineering.

Scientific American was actually purchased by a German publishing consortia,
one of the senior corporate officers of which I met recently at a trade show /
conference.  My sense is that, after some bit of conversation with this
gentleman,
they were hoping to gain new marketshare by converting S.A. into more of
a "popular science" kind of publication, injecting more tabloid style "fringe
science"
types of articles, etc.

What they have really done is alienate their traditional reading audience, who
at one time (including myself) held S.A. in the same esteem as peer reviewed
scientific journals such as Nature, or Science.  Now, however, they have
thouroughly
alienated their core constituency, while not gaining the market demographic
they were theoretically targeting.   

How very sad indeed.    I think these foreign publishing investors just didn't
"get it" then, and still don't.  S.A. is now a shell of its former self,
floundering,
searching for a new identity.

Such is the fickle nature of the publishing business . . . I should know, as
this is
a world with which I am all too familiar

sincerely

I would just like to highlight the opposition made by Anders, which denotes
a very important phenomenum of actual days:

People, in general, nowadays, have much more access to mere opinion
informative vehicles than to serious (and credible) knowledge... So their
minds are influenced (and even formed !!??...) by journalists, TV etc,  than
by scientists or even teachers f.ex.... >>> and, after that, they go
exercising their democratic rights... at the same level of those who have a
greater culture >>> it is, at least, SOCIAL IRRESPONSIBILITY... but for just
getting votes from the majority...

Yes, certainly. I salute the effort of all those who directly contribute to
progress,
and I'm not suggesting that they should drop everything in order to pursue some
elusive dream...BUT some of us who aren't great scientists, writers, artists etc,
might find it useful and fulfilling to contribute to transhumanism by, for example,
building a totally free safe haven. For fun, mutual stimulation and just in case...
The failure of this (low profile) project would hardly mean the end of
transhumanism,
just like the failure of the Oceania project didn't wipe out libertarianism.

Well, for starters, I *don't* claim to be smart. I'm just an ordinary guy who's
not really good at anything. Other people on this list *are* smart howerver,
yet most of them aren't astronomically rich afaik, which is strange. With
all this brainpower "under one roof" it should be a piece of cake to become
a rich & powerful movement, but as we all know, this hasn't happened so
far. That's a shame, certainly when you see all kinds of bullshit cults
like scientology swimming in cash. Imagine what all that money could
accomplish if it was used on for example cryonics, biotech and uploading

It's true that most autonomous communities are/were far from ideal, but that's
mainly because the freedom-seekers are/were carriers of less-than-optimal 
memes. There is no precedent (as far as I know) for a transhuman autonomous
region, so there's nothing to compare to. The only way to answer your questions
is to go out and do it. The only thing that *is* sure is that since other groups
of people have apparently succeded (or failed for trivial reasons), nation building
is a real possibility.

Aren't these arguments actually supporting the autonomous nation concept?
Lone nuts like the Unabomber (a relatively rare phenomenon) can easily
single out and maim/kill isolated, unorganized and thus vulnerable targets
like scientists, and yes, extropians. A low-profile, distant and relatively
well defended (no gun laws etc.) island is a *very unlikely* target for 
terrorists (they probably won't even know it exists), and thus the place of
choice to do "controversial" research and the like. Besides, if someone
really wants to kill extropians, he'll just hit an Extro gathering as you
already suggested. Piece of cake compared to taking out a whole
island nation.

The fact remains that on an isolated private island the chances that you'll
be the victim of (violent) crime are close to zero, while in "normal countries"
(especially the cities) these chances are a *lot* higher. Increased personal
safety is of course just one of the many advantages of geographic isolation 
and private law. And, believe it or not, the mafia and the state are still pretty
much two separate entities in most western countries, with their own 
agenda's of killing and milking.

Sure, all idealists, politicians and used car salesmen sound alike...;)
So what? Regardless of pompous-ass language the point still stands:
there are great advantages to having your own nation. Relaxed living,
no (or very low) taxes, no (or hardly) bureacracy, greater personal
safety, optimal suspension conditions, unique business options
(all the things you can do on for example the Cayman Islands and
then some -- after all, *you* are the law) THE place to have parties
& conferences, enjoy an extropic vacation, meet people etc. Yes, yes,
I know, it sounds like another advertisment...but it's true!

No-one is forcing you (or anyone else) to join anything. I understand that those
on the list who have a good job, and/or are doing major scientific work have
better things to do than nation-building. If you are still young (at heart), and no 
up-and-coming rocket scientist on the other hand, this might be a worthwile 
and fun project.

Right, you'll be hit by a car or mugged instead. Great! Again, the chances
that anyone will attack your island (with nukes for chrissake??) are absolutely
minimal. People just don't care about this sort of thing, as long as you don't
start to blatently export dope, kiddyporn etc. Most banana republics that *did*
get invaded were in fact US pawns "run amock" (took more than their fair share 
of CIA drug money or whatever).

Yes, way too unspectacular for a transhuman ;-) And, more importantly, risky.
You'll be hardly in a better position for the Singularity than Jack the Lad,
and Jack's chances *are not good*.

By the way, oil tankers may be too expensive/cumbersome for nation
building, but some smaller passenger vessels (maybe previously used
as floating hotels or so) might be more practical and affordable. You
buy the ship, and sail it to (or have it towed) your uninhabited island
where it's ankered permanently. Buildings etc. can be added later,
but this way you have a relatively comfortable (and more or less mobile)
place to live. Since you only use fuel (you could even use sails) for the 
(one) trip, costs are relatively low compared to the moving oil tanker 
scenario. On location solar/wind/wave energy can be used for your
power needs, that's mostly a one-time investment; running costs can
be low.

| I am no fan of immigration quotas, because I'm a big believer in the free
| market.  However, the so-called "high-tech labor shortage" is more horseshit
| than reality.  The basic fact is, most high-tech managers can't accept the
| fact that their "underlings" are actually worth more than they are, and
| therefore are unwilling to pay them what they're worth.  That's the
| foundation of this "labor shortage".  These clowns (managers) are just
| looking for cheap labor, so they can pay them less than they're worth, and
| they're worth a lot more than them.

I agree here.  The responses are predictable by the law of supply and demand.
Microsoft wants to increase the supply of labor so they can pay them less.
Let's face it -- if the US gave a green card to every programmer in the world,
MS would still claim there is a labor shortage.  IEEE, representing labor,
wants to limit the supply to labor to increase its costs.

The following generalizations are based on my experiences at several companies
over a long period, and the experiences of many of my associates.

1. Many managers underestimate the flexibility of engineers to learning new
   skills.  This is especially true in the "Human Resources" departments.
   For instance, if a company is looking for someone to program in language
   Z, a CS major who knows A, B and C, but not Z, is going to have trouble
   convincing the suit that he can pick up Z quickly, even though A, B, and C
   are similar to Z and most programming languages have similar concepts.
   The suit doesn't know any better, and can't tell whether the interviewee
   has a valid argument or is just B.S.-ing to get the job.  After all, if the
   suit knew enough to know the difference, the company would move him over
   to the programming groups (after all, there *is* a "labor shortage,"
   remember?).  The suit will probably say, "sorry, we're specifically
   looking for someone who knows Z, and you don't know Z."

2. Let's say Z is new, and the market has decided this is the new "hot"
   technology every company just *has* to have.  Existing employees probably
   don't know Z, because they started working for the company before Z
   became "hot," or even before Z was invented.  The managers won't take
   the engineers aside, throw them a few good books on Z and tell them to
   take a week off and learn Z, because that would divert them from their
   current assignments, which are probably behind schedule (because of the
   "labor shortage," no doubt), and also because of point #1 above.
   Instead, they whine that their current employees are useless because
   they don't know Z, and they need to look for the lucky percentage of
   New College Graduages (NCG's) who happened to learn Z in their class,
   rather than X or Y.

Very well.  What interests me is the extent to which a general (in fact,
nearly ubiquitous) lack of regard for nonhuman suffering plays a part in
the memetic facilitation of other kinds of disregard.  Why else would
justifications for racist, misogynist, and other unattractive behaviors so
often make recourse to the trope of equating the object of their
disrespect with an "animal"?  Is this move really one you have never
encountered?  I'm not interested in insisting that drawing an ethical
distinction between human and nonhuman animals has a *foundational* role
in maintaining other social hatreds (tho' I do think that the ubiquity and
absolutely underquestioned status of the distinction makes it sometimes
appear improperly foundational), but I will say that it stands in a
mutually reinforcing relation to these attitudes, and deserves to be
interrogated for that reason alone.  Not to mention the obvious analog of
the human/animal relation to the Power/mehum relation that set this
discussion off in the first place (for me, at least).

Possibly.  What is interesting about the classification "animal" (as
opposed to say "shit") is that it is a being whose suffering registers
simultaneously as *real* but as suffering that nonetheless *does not
matter*.  Shit is not imagined to suffer in the first place.  This is a
difference that makes a difference when the thing the classification is
enabling is *making some body suffer* or *not minding when one realizes
that they do*.

I'm not sure that I see what you're asking for here.  Since it is part of
the deeply ingrained common sense of many societies that there is a
self-evident irrelevance about the suffering of the nonhuman, I don't know
that I am particularly surprised to find that these assignments are made
carelessly.  Best, Dale

Of course.  Surely, every little bit helps.  I wonder: Do you think the
injunction "Respect rights" is less abstract than "Respect diversity"?

Do you agree that an historical case can be made for the claim that
massive power/knowledge assymmetries often *have* permitted or even
encouraged systems of rights to perform less reliably?

 I think mutual respect for property rights is a kind

Isn't the problem that what will constitute "respect for property rights"
(think of state "takings" or urban squatting, etc) is always open to 
interpretation, and in the face of the kinds of *massive* power/knowledge
assymmetries we're talking about when we're talking of Power/mehuman
"relations", it's a safe bet just whose "interpretations" will stick.
No, I've come to agree with you even more than before about the near
uselessness of merely abstract guarantees against abuses.  It seems the
thing that best buttresses security and stability is a plurality of
competing Powers no one of whom can do too much damage without stepping on
toes that matter.

As do I.  Vegetarianism questions your prior assumption of the
appropriateness of designating "animals" as "food" in the first place.
Not to suggest that there aren't obvious differences in play here, but I
scarcely imagine you feel the diversity of your diet is challenged by a
refusal of cannibalism?

> I don't see how valuing diversity implies giving plants a different 
> status than animals. 

Part of valuing diversity is respecting sentience and the forms it takes
in the world.  That animals are sentient and plants are not is a
difference in status that isn't exactly arbitrary to take note of, surely? 
What you go on to do after noting it is up to you.  Best, Dale

Here are a few one-sentence suggestions (in descending order of personal
attractiveness):
1. Be a Power myself.
2. Facilitate the proliferation of competing Powers.
3. Undertake memetic engineering to spread some such injunction as
"respect diversity," "respect rights," "abhor unecessary suffering," etc.
4. Befriend the right Powers.
5. Lay low.

I said that whenever I hear someone claim that simplicity is important to
a proper moral outlook, I think of purity, closemindedness, intolerance. 
You thought that this would be because I associated the value of
simplicity with a lack of education.  Again, I don't think this is so.  I
just think the word "simplicity" (whenever it takes on an ethical
register)  sets off different associations for me than it does for you. 
If I had any stereotypical figures in mind here they would be evangelical
Christians of the fag-hating Darwin-bashing kind or flamebreathing Randian
objectivists.  Neither of these figures are necessarily uneducated in my
view, tho' both seem to think that ethical truths are plainer and simpler
by far than I do.  I don't know that this clarifies my reasoning
particularly, but surely it will make you less confused (were you really?)
about where I'm coming from.  Best, Dale

I feel the same in the sense that I do not think these opinion-type articles
have any place in a journal that touts itself as a scientific resource for
sophisticated layman.  Many SciAm readers lack of the scientific proficiency to
separate author opinion from scientific consensus or fact.  SciAm should be
especially vigilant in reviewing the content of its articles.  Several articles
(including the nanotechnology article and the value of animals in medical
research) reminded me more of the dogmatic presentation of facts you see from
politicians, not scientists.

SciAm was definitely called out on the carpet regarding the nanotechnology
ordeal.  What the editors were thinking when they allowed that article through
is anyone's guess.  However, I think that as long as readers continue to hold
SciAm accountable for what it prints, we can keep SciAm from becoming a journal
of opinion.

Er, yes, but it's not quite that simple, is it?

1) Cryonic suspension costs $30,000 - $100,000 dollars or more. 
   Do you have that kind of money lying around?

2) Euthanasia is illegal in most countries in the world, and is 
   expensive and takes a long time in places where it isn't. If 
   you're suicidal for purely psychological rather than 
   physiological reasons, you likely don't want to wait around 
   whilst a judge signs you off.

In practical terms, when a real, every-day person is rational but suicidal,
I think you either have to let them go, or lock them up. I wondered whether
the group would favour me in imposing my will on someone else because I
don't want them to die.

A tricky question. My basic view is that everybody should have control
over one's life - if we cannot decide if to live or die, then we are
fundamentally limited. So if somebody wants to end his or her life for
rational reasons I see no point in interfering, other than offering my
advice pro or con.

This might appear to be a loss for the total diversity of the universe
(which forms my usual ethical-ruler), but one has to weigh the loss of
one individual to the risks of placing control over our lives in the
hands of others, which might cause even greater loss of diversity in
the long run. Of course, this is by no means obvious, and I would be
surprised if others did not reach different conclusions based on their
evaluations.

Nevertheless:

No, but I do have +- $450 a year lying around to pay for my suspension
contract and life insurance. Unfortunately, not everybody has the foresight
to do this, although a lot of people have life insurance that might be used
to pay the approx. $ 30.000 required by Cryonics Institute. Of course
their relatives would have to co-operate and all, but if you know that someone
is going to kill himself in advance, some of these matters might be settled.
Another possibility would be freezing them yourself (with the aid of local
cryonicists) and storing at least the brains in a small liquid nitrogen dewar,
or in dry ice. I don't know whether or not this is legal in England (it isn't
in Holland), but things like this can be done in relative secrecy if no other
options are available. Maybe you could work out a settlement with a cryonics
company later (raise the $30.000 over a couple of years), and have the 
remains transferred to a professional facility. All very difficult, but worth a
try if you really care about someone.

Well, the good thing with suicide is that you don't need anyone's
permission to do it. Personally, I wouldn't bother to get the state's
blessing to kill myself if I felt like it; I'd just do it (and it wouldn't
cost a penny). Btw, euthanasia is almost legal in Holland, so come 
over here, smoke a joint and than kill yourself, if you still feel like it ;-)

Try every available (and affordable) therapy (Prozac?), and if this fails only let 
them go if there is no way you can get them into a dewar in time. Saving 
someone so that he may experience perfect health (and more) in the future 
can never be immoral, but then again that's just my opinion.

If one assumes a huge difference in power between Powers and humans, how
does competition among Powers increase the security of humans?  Humans
who were the favored pets of Powers would be safe from others, but
by the same token humans in the sphere of a non-benign Power would be
left to its devices.  The security and stability buttressed is that of
the Powers (assuming competition works to such an end at all).

Yes, but what is your point? If it's that my idea gives almost everything  
free will and thus the value of such a definition in helping us understand 
how the mind works is virtually zero then I enthusiastically agree, but that's 
still a vast improvement because other defenerations have a negative value, 
they provide confusion but no enlightenment. My advice is if you want to 
study the mind forget about free will, most ideas involving it are so bad 
they're not even wrong.
	     

	>It's clear and internally consistent, but I'd hardly call what it

Can you think of an example where my definition of freedom would cause a 
contradiction with the everyday use of the word? I can't.

I don't see how somebody else accurately predicting my behavior would change 
my feeling of freedom, that would only happen if I made the prediction, but 
let that go, even with your more restrictive definition an electron would  
still have free will.

What I find interesting, is why haven't IT workers, especially 'Microserfs' formed
some kind of union or protection scheme to save themselves from increasing
exploitation and possible termination?  One thing is for certain, there has never
been a more prosperous or intelligent workforce as exists withing the IT
industry.  You would think that as soon as Microsoft proposes to eliminate
overtime pay, that 20,000 workers would then go on strike and essentially shut
down Microsoft - wouldn't this be crippling?  After all isn't there a severe IT
shortage that we all keep hearing about?

I think we should not forget to focus on the fact that the "freedom to do
what you like so long as you don't harm anyone else" also means that
everyone else has the freedom to take measures to prevent inadvertant ill
effects of someone elses actions.  Call it the freedom to take 
responsibility for ones own safety.

On the assumption that one of the things these competing Powers compete
about is the proper handling of mehums.  My point was that no abstract
framework (whether a system of property rights or an ingrained injunction
to respect diversity or whatever) would be robust enough on its own to
police a massively more powerful Power, but that a proliferation of
competing Powers very well might.  One Power who sees the likes of us as
ubergoo feedstock may check the impulse to act on that assumption if she
knows that others of her rank would take that as a violation of their own
understandings of rights, respect, civility, or even the dictates of
prudence (the unforseeable pleasure/unforseeable danger criterion).

Yeah, if I had to be a Power pet I'd sure rather my Power incline more to
the model of a Banksian Mind than that of a Vingian Blight.  Yikes!

There is a rapid growth of salary levels for high-tech/computer
professionals, and a growing number of positions that companies just can't
fill at any reasonable price.  This is what makes this market very different
from that of, say, janitorial services.  Companies are greedy, of course,
nut there are good reasons why they are exercising their greed in this
domain rather than any other.  Another point is the exterritorial nature
of high-tech jobs.  Janitors, manicurists, etc. work for the local market;
there is no sense in collecting all of them from all over the world, to
work in U.S.  However, if all developers of frontier information technology
immigrated into U.S., they would still serve the same - global - market,
but enrich American corporations, American government, and local businesses
with results of their work, taxes, etc.

 predicament. Because the demon's decision influences the man's actions
 the demon must forecast his own behavior, but he will have no better
 luck in this regard than the man did and for the same reasons. What we
 would need in a situation like this is a mega-demon able to look into
 the demon's head. Now the mega-demon would have the problem.

There is no need for an infinite regress of ever-more-intelligent
demons. Let's say the man, although he doesn't know it yet, will
decide to take the low road.

If the original demon is able to determine this with 100% certainty,
before telling the man its prediction, then why can't the demon also
account for and predict the man's subsequent reversal in response to
learning of the demon's prediction?

The demon can simply lie to the man, saying "you will choose the high
road", when he knew the man was actually going to choose the low road
based only on his original brain state. The man does the opposite of
what the demon predicts, but the demon, although having lied to the
man, still correctly predicted the man's behavior from its own
perspective.

Of course, the man could be aware that the demon is aware that he will
do the opposite of what the demon says, and the demon is aware that
the man is aware that the demon is aware of this... etc. ad infinitum.
But you don't need to invoke anything smarter than the original demon.
The demon's ability to accurately predict the man's apparently free
will is limited only by the superiority of its intellect. If it is
only a bit smarter than the man, an third observer will find the demon
to be consistently lucky, but still only slightly better than random
chance.

This all seems somehow analogous to our understanding of quantum
uncertainty, and also oddly similar to a scene from _The Princess
Bride_. Or maybe I just need to get some sleep.

I have pondered with great interest some of the recent postings on the singularity
and post-humanism.  One of the passages that caught my eye was by den Otter posted
to the list on Feb 21.  It reads as follows:

'Unless trasnhumanists get somehow organized the chances that any of us will make
it past the singularity are close to zero;  the powers that be will crush us like
worms.  Only (some of) the rich and powerful are going yo make it.'

I have to say I can't argue with this - this seems liek a *very* real scenario.
Does anybody see it differnetly?  And if so, how and why have you come to a
different set of conclusions?

What disturbs me most about this scenario, is that it suggests that the future of
life on this planet will primarily descend from 'criminals' that make Chairman
Mao, Stalin or Hitler look like silly sand box bullies.  Worst still, if this is
in some way the most common result of natural selection, then it also suggests
that any other life that may populate the universe is also descended, or in fact
*is* of the same "evil/criminal" mindset.

**Please understand that I am trying very hard not to label such acts of global
human genocide as evil in the traditonal moral sense.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this?

considered mentally ill.  I still have freedom of choice, just like
everyone else.  Although, when I'm psychotically manic (which doesn't

because one is "mentally ill" doesn't mean they should be treated like
children are.  Sometimes they should be, but each case is different and
must be evaluated separately.

I would prefer to say there are *many* ideal extropian communities. I
certainly believe that my current community (or family, or nexus) is ideal
for me, and I know many who feel the same.  What's interesting is that what
is ideal not only varies from person to person, but also varies for the same
person over time.

This quite obvious name was first quite obvious to Jay Prime Positive
(innovator of innovators). Thankfully, Jay thought to mention it to us, so
that it could then be quite obvious to us, as well.

Well, it's funny you should ask. Surprisingly, there is some sentiment among
us not to rename at all. We kind of like Phoenexus. There do remain some
marginal parallels between our story and the mythical ash-bird. Okay, so we
didn't burn up into ashes in Phoenix, but it was pretty goddam hot. And we
spent a good number of years there at Alcor dealing with death (and sure,
the hope for rebirth, if necessary) in as direct a manner as humans ever do.
And naturally, the death-avoidance business being as lucrative as it was, we
were pretty damn poor. So getting real jobs and real incomes in an area with
real weather was a little like "rising from the ashes of our earlier life,"
or something. (None of this is to say that we had a bad experience there.
Quite the contrary. Our time at Alcor and in Phoenix was for all of us the
most rewarding experience we'd ever had, and the long term benefits to us
individually for having been there are only just beginning. We're now
happily intertangled with so many of you wonderful extropian types
specifically because of our advantage of position (being at the center of an
important hub of extropian activity). What a gift to know so many geniuses
and beautiful people so early in life.)

Oh, and also, we're all "formerly burnt dead birds that recently rose up out
of some ashes which were probably our own," as the saying goes. (Like I
said, the mythical parallels are marginal.)

The more compelling reason we might not change our name is simply that
Phoenix is where this particular power-quintet first coalesced, so the name
retains its historical meaning at the very least.

However, there has indeed been talk about what we should change it to if we
do change it. (Max -- your ideas aren't bad. I like ExNex better than
TransNexus, but I also think the name we choose should have something more
personalized and us-specific if we're to change it.) The best of this
ongoing conversation was a message (read: brainstorm) Kip posted to our
in-house mailing list back in November. I'm forwarding that message (with
permission) to the list separately under the "HUMOR" meta tag. (We've always
felt that hilarious brainstorming is the most productive brainstorming.)

We might consider having a Nexus Naming Contest, if people were game. Maybe
we'd offer some money (or something) to whomever comes up with a name we
decide to use.

My usage of the word "family" has definitely changed since living in a
nexus. And my understanding of the word "mate" has morphed as well. I think
it's quite natural that extropians would regard these notions as inherently
subjective and individually determined  And indeed, that is probably the
most valuable aspect of this kind of arrangement for me: the opportunity to
explore the boundaries of human relationships with other bright, extropian
minds. Being single and (more or less) hetero, I've had motivation to
discover which of the good things in life that are normally reserved for
mate relationships can be had by the likes of me and other single
transhumans.

It turns out, much to my surprise, that *most* of the elements of
relationships normally reserved for mates can be had platonically. I'm
talking about hand-holding, hugs, back rubs, massages, and my personal
favorite, head rubs. More generally, I'm talking about reciprocal love
and/or affection, and about being committed to someone else's happiness
(reciprocity again being the key) over a long period of time, and getting to
reap the long term benefits of that commitment.

I will say, the nexus isn't for everyone. Being an "extropian" can mean a
lot of things, but it does not guarantee compatibility. I'm fortunate enough
to have latched onto to 4 people who are *extremely* similar in terms of
values, modes of living, preferences for entertainment, and day to day
passions and habits. Philosophy is only part of that equation. Attitude,
sense of humor, and personality are much more important.

However, that is not to say we don't draw the line with some matters of
principal. We are all Alcor members in good standing, for example. (I'm not
sure if there is any other single household with as many as five bracelets.
It might be a record.) And of course we are all dedicated hedonists. (I
won't say which of these life necessities we rank as more important, only
that both are mandatory.)

We even started on a list of Phoenexus Rules, but never finished it
(probably due to the overwhelming bureaucratiphobia from which we all
suffer).  It started like this:

1) Absolutely, positively no dying.
2) Clothing is permitted.
3) Thou art God (or something like that).
4) But so am I.

Rule 3 & 4 were never agreed upon (I think they're why the making of the
list broke down), but the sense of the nexus was that there should be some
similar sentiment about self-ownership and self-direction.

I think Damien and possibly some others here said they wanted to know more
about the Nexuses (Nexi?). Was there something specific? Or just generally
wondering how we like it and how feasible it is to shack up with other
transmutants? If it's not clear from the above, I guess I should clearly
state that each of us here gives both thumbs up to nexus life. (That's 10
thumbs, and probably a few flippers and fins.) As far as I know, I've never
met a person who lives in a more supportive environment than we do. (I would
LOVE to hear of other's good experiences, though. I think happiness contests
are win/win.) That didn't happen for us overnight. It took multiple
extropians dedicated to seeking long term growth, aided by informed empathy,
understanding, and insight. (And, oh yeah... talent and brains and skill,
too. Or is that part assumed in the "extropian" label? One would hope so.)

And time.

If you have the opportunity, definitely give it a try. As always, your
mileage may vary!  (Always wanted to take my turn saying that here...)

I couldn't agree more. By mentally ill I meant those who are permanently
deranged/those in the midst of a fit, not people who are otherwise perfectly
sane but are classified as "mentally ill" by bureaucrats. I suffer from mild
depressions myself every now and then, but this can (sometimes) be alleviated 
by smoking cannabis; the worse I feel, the better the effect. Usually, a single
hit does the trick, maybe because if replenishes an acute shortage of
the body's "natural" THC variant. Also it allows you to look at problems in
an emotionally detached fashion (or more precisely: you can think about
a traumatic event while feeling quite happy & lighthearted, an interesting
experience). It's a primitive way of hedonistic engineering (but probably not 
recommendable if you suffer from a serious mental disorder, which it could 
make worse, although one can never know for sure).

Btw, carnitine also has some anti-depressant-like effects, probably because
it boosts your energy levels (more testosterone). I'll be doing a carnitine-DHEA
combination therapy soon, this might have some interesting results. Has 
anyone else tried this?

Essentially it was a inaccurate and biased story claiming
nanotechnology was cargo cult science, with very little support. See
http://www.foresight.org/SciAmDebate/ for a complete overview and
comments.

The response of the Foresight Institute was admirable.

superintelligences is doubly unpredictable. Engineering the Singularity to
make it more benign may well be a dream. The Singularity itself may well
be a dream. Get real.

I don't think that this community is capable of making a major difference. 
(Please prove me wrong). Don't forget, the whole industrialized world is

Instead of 'criminal' I'd say 'incomprehensible'. Do you feel like a
monster just because you have made the clay autoreplicators, or a world of
lithobacteria impossible? It's lonely, at the top of the food chain.

_Should_ it be unavoidable, being disturbed is not exactly constructive. 
Just lay back, and think of England. If it happens at all, it will be over
real quick.

I think this is true.  The whole argument about people who do the opposite
of what you predict doesn't shed much light on free will, in my opinion.

Imagine a computer program which outputs a 0 or 1.  You are supposed to
type in your prediction of what it will output, and then it prints out
its choice.  Now write the program so that regardless of what you input,
it prints out the opposite value.  This is a trivial program, about three
lines long.  Most people would agree that it does not have free will.

Or, imagine an even simpler system, a pendulum which swings from left
to right in one second.  Back and forth it goes.  You are supposed to
predict where it will be in one second.  If you think it will be at the
right, you "tell" the pendulum this by setting the bob to the right,
and similarly if you think it will be at the left.  But, it appears that
your prediction is wrong, because whichever side you set the bob at,
after one second it is at the opposite side.

This does not reflect any true inability to predict the future of these
systems.  It simply means that the system has the property that when the
prediction is input in a certain way, it affects the output.  Even quite
trivial systems have this property, and it doesn't have anything to do
with free will.

Exactly, and that's my point. Free will is not some exotic mysterious property 
that only humans posses, it's a humdrum attribute everything has. Because 
everything has it free will is not important (importance requires contrast) 
and we can afford to forget about it.

I had a very telling and frustrating experience with the
Soviet "mini-singularity".  There were lots of people
who were putting tremendous effort and lost more than
can be rewarded, to bring the system to the breaking point
- only to see all the opportunities seized by existing
power structures, both official and shadow, that in the
turmoil removed the ties of the previous laws, turned
the control they had into more explicit form, wiped
out the populations' savings and even the small social
guarantees they worked so hard to earn from the
previous regime, and legally acquired enormous wealth
and the right to use it.  The power guys, from party
officials to the military, industry, and mafia, were
much better positioned to take advantage of the change
that the kamikaze dissidents worked so hard to bring.

The next echelon of beneficiaries were smaller scale
folk that used to be the backbone of the communist
regime - smaller officials, grocery store managers,
etc.

The people who actually brought all this change,
were not rewarded in any way, or even thanked.
Most of them are busy trying to earn some salary
from serving the new elite.  Some escaped to lead
more protected, but usually very mundane lives
in the West.

I managed to engineer a little personal singularity
by using the events to escape to the _frontier_ of
the opened world.  I wouldn't swap my position with
that of any of my former peers, but the transition
was extremely costly, lonely, and uncertain.

Now I have less motivation to expend my effort for
common Singularity.

Cool.  But does this cover all future income, or just income earned via 
this corporation?  And is this a percentage of gross income, or only after
certain "expenses" are deducted?  And could you contractually commit to
retaining at least say 60% of your income shares, so buyers have reason
to believe you will work hard?

Unfortunately, bankruptsy is a bit too easy.  And people might reasonably
fear that you were offering them this very unusual asset because you know
something unusually disappointing about your future income prospects.

Every explanation will suggest these sorts of further questions.  And of course
the plausibility of an explanation depends on how plausibly such questions are
answered.

Agreed.

I know that there is lots of research, but I'm not really up on it.
I will say that time discounts are probably not as good an explanation of 
differences across times, nations, or states than they might be across 
neighborhoods or within a family.

If such markets for exchanging wage shares are begun well before there
is a substantial risk of such a big shock, and for other reasons, then
this is not such a problem.  Fortunately I can see benefits of such markets
independent of insuring against an upload shock.

Did the magazine itself ever publish its intentions

- I think it would be fair; not telling means treating

profiting from deceitful exploitation of their

The whole set of issues arises from packaging of all

I do not believe anyone, regardless of their power base, will be able to
effectively prepare in such a manner as to increase their survival chances at
and after a technological singularity event.

If a singularity event were to occur, life would be extremely different.  I am
not saying it would be necessarily incomprehensible to those who were around
after the event.  But my guess is we can not imagine the changes a singularity
would cause before it occurs and thus we would have a hard time effectively
planning for such an event.

Vinge's idea of a technological singularity looming in the future is based on
the exponential tendecies of technological progress over time.  In mathematics,
a singularity is a point where mathematic modelling no longer works.  I think
the best way to view a technological singularity is as a mathematical
singularity.  In this sense, I view a technological singularity not as a point
where technological progress becomes infinite but as a paradigm shift.  Our
conception of technological progress can not comprehend the environment at or
after a singularity event.  Thus when we attempt to graph it or manifest it in
some way we come up with "infinity".  The singularity event where a black hole
is formed is equally incomprehensible to our current conception of the laws
that govern the universe.  Many theorists believe that to fully understand what
takes place at the black hole singularity (and at the possible singularity that
existed near or before the point where the universe was the Planck time in age)
requires a dramatic shift (paradigm shift) in our understanding of the universe.

Would I survive a technological singularity event?  Maybe, but not without
being changed by it.  Perhaps the lithmus test will be whether people can adapt
to the post-singularity environment after the singularity occurs.  Perhaps
we'll need drastically enhanced intelligence, mental resources, or other
characteristics completely strange to us now.

About concerns of a holocaust, I made a post a month or so ago about what
meaning transhumanism had in a future where the Strong AI hypothesis ended up
being true.  I think a technological singularity could produce similar
concerns.  Every method Vinge proposed to get us to such an event involved
drastic changes in the way we are now.  I am not saying this would necessarily
be a "bad" thing.  But it would serve as a virtual holocaust of the way we are
now.  Terms such as transhuman imply some residue of humanity surviving.  Its
possible the future will result in a posthuman era where whatever you define as
"human" is no longer discernable in the resulting lifeforms.  But all of this
hinges on factors we have no real control over.  If a holocaust of humanity
resides in the future then there is little we can do to avoid it.  Such a
holocaust, if it is to happen, will ride in on the apparently inexorable tide
of technological progress.

The more I think about this "Human Capital Market", the more I'm
convinced that we already have exactly that, and have had them for
years--they're called Visa and Mastercard.  What's the difference
between Grameen Bank's lending a man $100 to improve his farm, and
Visa lending me $300 for that new hard disk?  Both have made an
investment in my future productivity, Visa just didn't ask as many
questions.

Theoretically it should be /more/ efficient at encouraging the kind
of speculative ventures that make big gains, because the person
receiving the loan has nothing to answer to except the payments--if
he wants to waste it on vacations, that's fine, as long as he makes
the payments.  That's just more money in the pockets of that
industrious poolboy saving up for his delivery truck.  It amounts
to the same thing--Visa is lending money to people to do whatever
they want, and left to their own ingenuity, people often like to
make more money.

Personal unsecured credit is essentially the same thing as a loan
on future income.  We've all heard stories about entrepreneurs
being turned down for loans and starting businesses on their credit
cards.  The movie _Hollywoord Shuffle_ was financed entirely on
Townsend's cards because no studio wanted it, and it did well.

Not to take away the good things Grameen does, but Mastercard did
it first, and does more.

There are two questions here that needs to be answered: what do we
mean with the singularity, and what social dynamics will we see around
it. Unless we answer the first the rest of the discussion will be just
a loud waste of bits. All too often the singularity becomes just
another name for the rapture, some kind of techno-escaton that is left
conveniently undescribed and magical.

What we know is that a lot of growth curves are nearly exponential
(interestingly no longer the population curve, if the new figures are
to be believed) and that it seems possible that they can get even
steeper (vide Hans Moravecs discussion of Moore's "law"). Will they
all become asymptotically vertical in a finite time (the Vinge
singularity), have an inflexion point and then settle towards a very
high but finite level (the sigmoid singularity) or does the
singularity mean no predictions about the future are possible (the
horizon singularity?).

If we speak about the horizon singularity this discussion is fairly
pointless; den Otter's exhortation is still a good idea for a number
of reasons, but we cannot discuss what we need to do to survive the
singularity since it is by definition unknowable. Boring.

If we speak about the other two singularities it becomes clear that
change is the keyword here. Can we and what we enjoy survive
steepening change? That is a very good question.

One of my favorite devices is "exponential change makes differences
grow exponentially". If I have good intelligence amplification, then I
can use it to earn enough to buy or develop better IA equipment, and
so on. My neighbor, who isn't quite as bright will still improve, but
will lag after more and more while I soar towards transcension. The
same can be said about various economies: many poor nations are
actually doing reasonably well, but compared to us they appear almost
static. And guess who will afford the scientists, engineers,
businessmen and other people who will make growth even faster?

There are equalizing forces too. Many of the results from expensive
and time-consuming research appear openly in journals and on the net,
making it possible for others to leapfrog. Technology spreads, and
rich groups can and do give some of their surplus to others
(voluntarily or not). The problem is of course: are these forces
enough to keep the differences finite? I doubt it. 

I will try to model this like N coupled differential equations,
where the solutions Y_n(t) are growing exponentially but linked by
diffusion terms. Something like

Y'_n = k*Y_n + l*(sum Y_i - N*m*Y_n) = (k-lmN)Y_n + l*sum Y(i)

If l is large enough, then every Y_n will tend to
approach each other, and we smaller differences over time. This
corresponds to strong diffusion where sharing costs you m (this is
essentially growth with redistribution). If the cost m is zero (like
in broadcasting it on the net), then the solutions do not approach or
diverge, their internal differences remains but do not grow. In fact,
if you look at the derivatives of the differences you get 

(Y_i-Y_j)' = (k-lmN)(Y_i - Y_j)

which shows that if m is low or zero, then the differences will grow
regardless of how much help the advantaged give the disadvantaged;
just helping others wont bridge the gap, you need to slow down
yourself to do that (and that might put you at an
disadvantage). Sharing is also more likely when m is small than when m
is big. The N term is however a bit hopeful, the more players there
are, the more differences will be averaged out and the overall support
from others will become dominant.

m seems to be decreasing rather than increasing in an information
society like ours, k is already fairly high and l has obviously not
been high enough in the past to lessen differences. N might be
increasing, though, as new players enters the global arena.

(I actually wrote a small MatLab script to play with this while
writing this article, I have appended it at the end. Nothing special,
but useful for thinking graphically)

So it seems likely that differences will grow rather than shrink as
the singularity or any other period of fast, self-supporting change is
approached. Now, given the human tendency for envy and fear of anybody
who get's too powerful, this suggests that tensions will increase long
before the truly transhuman stage (no need to invoke the Powers). Even
if most of the have-nots profit from the haves, there will likely be
some who resent them for various reasons.

How these tensions are released is a tricky question which depends on
the relative power of the haves and have-nots. If the have-nots
cannot seriously hurt the haves, then nothing will likely happen
except that the haves will grow ever stronger (faster than the
have-nots, who will still grow) with plenty of mutual ill
feelings. It is not given that the haves would want to stomp out the
have-nots if m is low or zero - as long sum(Y_i) is larger than m*Y_n
they will profit from the occasional useful idea from the other
side. It is once m*Y_n becomes larger than the sum the situation
becomes improfitable, but then it is just easier to break contact
(aha, the economic reason for transcending?) (cost: 0) than remove the
have-nots (cost: finite).

So this scenario contains one part of humanity transcending, leaving
the rest (by now fairly advanced) in the dust. This part can still
transcend, and we might even get a multipart singularity. The long
range fate of everybody depends a lot on tricky questions about
resources: are the have-nots economical as feedstock? do the Powers
need to struggle for resources in the solar system? It should be noted
that if the sigmoid theory of technological growth holds, then the
Powers will reach a point of diminishing returns where k and l will
begin to decrease (say like k0/(1+Y_n)) and the differences will
eventually start to decrease again as everybody eventually reaches the
same technological ceiling. At this point ordinary economics likely
takes over again, there is no real point in struggling with each other
since it is more profitable to wotk together at solving the remaining
problems.

The other scenario involves that the have-nots can hurt the haves, say
through terrorism. In this case it will be in the interest of the
haves to either grow so fast that they become invulnerable (this
assumes they can beforehand figure out that "at tech level X nothing
the others can do could hurt us", a doubtful assumption, especially
since the others are learning from the haves), decrease the
likeliehood of terrorism or neurtralize the have-nots. The problem
here is that the more powerful technologies appear in the world, the
easier it seems to create a terror weapon (the shields are not keeping
pace with the spears - it might be interesting to ask under what
circumstances this could change). Since there is a finite chance that
somebody somewhere might use a terror weapon, the situation becomes
less and less stable as technology advances (unless a Cold War
standoff can emerge, which requires *strict* control of the relevant
technologies by *few* groups). So even if the haves are spending
resources on goodwill, there is always a chance that somewhere in a
remote corner a lunatic could be building a weapon of mass destruction
using fairly old tech (fertilizer, anybody?). Goodwill just lowers the
risk, it does not remove it (this is true regardless of the
differences between haves and have-nots, it seems to be a general
problem for sufficiently advanced and violent civilizations). So the
obvious solution would be to neutralize the have-nots. Traditionally
this has been done using extinction, but that might not be ideal (the
have-but-not-so-muchs just below the haves might get paranoid, and
since both sides understand this they might not want to start a trend
that could spell the doom for both of them) and other possibilities
could be used: deliberate steering away from dangerous technologies
and ideas, gnatbot police or even subtle brainwashing. This comes at a
noticeable cost, including loss of useful help from the have-nots
(remember that they are still useful up to very high differences) and
the risk of being discovered and attacked (once you have become
paranoid, you cannot stop - it is a memetic cancer). 

So a lot will hinge on the exact distribution of
power/knowhow/extropy/whatever between the players. At present the
distribution has a noticeable tail in the positive direction (my guess
is that it is some form of x exp(-x) curve). As this distribution
evolved, it will become broader, carried along the dynamics discussed
above. If we make the oversimplifaction of seeing it as roughly
exponential, then the distribution f(x) at time 0 will become
f(exp(tx)) at time t. Even a fairly narrow distribution will become
broader and develop a tail. 

If there exists a continuum of players between the foremost haves and
the last have-nots, then the strains will be more distributed and
every player would have to deal with both greater, lesser and equal
players. This might be stabilising, since no single player would
easily be able to control the whole system - there are players at
least of equal power and a significant number of less powerful players
that could ally against it. Even the most powerful player would have
to deal with the total mass below. Only if one group could separate
itself significantly from the others would it be possible for it to
neutralize the others, and any such separation moves would naturally
be keenly watched by others. This suggests that the possibility of
secretly planned jumps ahead as a powerful destabilizing force - if
they are possible, then it might be possible for a player to become
dominant before anybody can react. If these jumps really are possible
is both determined by technology/physical law (e.g. could a dominant
technology such as (say) workable brainwashing nanites be developed?
Could espionage become soo good that it forces openness?)  and policy
(do the leading players demand openness from each other?). It seems
that the "weapon of openness" is quite cruicial here. Since nobody
wants to become neutralized and have everything to win by cooperating
with the others, a mutual openness policy would be desirable for all
players, unless they have reason to believe such an openness could be
subverted.

Will the haves remain cohesive? Their internal differences would have
exactly the same dynamics as for the others, and since they would be
growing the fastest, the strains would be largest. It is rather likely
this model does not work identically on the smaller scale of such a
group (e.g. the constants k,l and m are different in groups than
between groups). This could lead to cohesive groups diverging from
each other (potential for inter-group conflicts) or that groups loose
cohesion. If the growth dynamics is dependent on the size of the
groups (for example, due to the need of specialization in a complex
field), then this loss of cohesion would also act as a limiting factor
on the growth of the have's, enabling the have-nots to catch up
slightly. On the other hand, as I have discussed above, there is no
reason much more advanced individuals could not work together with
less advanced individuals if both profit from it due to their
different specialisations. This requires further consideration (a
first rough model might be to decrease k and l inversely
proportionally to Y_1, which would make the model identical to the
sigmoid model mentioned above. However, the response is likely more
nonlinear).

Conclusions: 

It seems very likely that the differences between different groups of
humans at least on some scales will grow exponentially in the near
future. Traditional solutions to lessening differences
(redistribution) fail when sharing becomes cheaper (as in an
information society). The appearance of a large number of interacting
players might make the growth period easier. The growing differences
are likely to cause strains forcing the leading edge to either speed
ahead to a safe region, attempt to control the situation or neutralize
the threat of the have-nots. Only the first alternative appears to be
completely stable, the others have noticeable risks. The leading edge
will suffer from the most intense differences, and might be hampered
in its growth for these reasons. Openness seems to be one of the best
ways of handling the risks of "jumping ahead" and gap formation, as
well as allowing the have-nots to assure the haves that they have no
evil plans in store.



Well, this got a bit out of hand (I had only planned to write a simple
response), but I hope this response shows why I remain optimistic
about the future but at the same time think it will become much too
interesting for us to like :-)

There is one equalizing force that I think is very powerful: the market
economy.  A relevant example is the growth of personal computers.  One might
argue, even mathematically, that a company or individual with more MIPS will
make more money off of that computing power, and therefor they will earn more
money to buy more MIPS, and before long, most of the MIPS are in the hands of
one entity.  Some thought that there would never be a need for many
computers. 
The opposite happened.  Most of the MIPS are in the cheap computers.

Design effort is paid for by sales, and this will apply to improving humans
and
our minds.  There is a market of billions of units for cheap human
improvements.  These billions, growing exponentially in thinking and buying
power, remain richer in total than any individual.  Remember also that we are
talking about a market situation that would drastically alter the value of any
particular group's currency, which tends to keep everyone trading amongst each
other.  For instance, think of an incipient Power, temporarily getting
ahead of
the game and finding that the possessions and services of the mere Humans were
especially cheap.  She would also be too expensive for the Humans to often buy
from.  Over time, this trade imbalance would shift what I would call the
"personal currency" balance back, and the Mere Humans would catch up to some
extent.

Bringing "up" the world with you is a selfish act, resulting in faster growth
for you.  And a much more interesting world.

Ouch.

But if you, Alexander, grow in power, unchanged at the root of your
personality, it is good for all of us.  I believe selfishness in the case of
intelligent, sane people can be to our common benefit.

On the other hand, there is the saying "power corrupts, absolute power
corrupts
absolutely."  I have personally seen how science-minded people who originally
started out working together openly, for altruistic reasons, change the moment
there is money to be made.  It is like a phase-change from liquid to frozen,
each individual suddenly different than before.

Virtual Obsession

by Bill Harris 

On February 26, ABC airs "Virtual Obsession," the imaginative thriller from
Director/Producer Mick Garris ("Stephen King's The Stand", "Stephen King's
The Shining"). Peter Gallagher ("While You Were Sleeping") and Mimi Rogers
("Someone to Watch Over Me") star in what is being called a "romantic
thriller." 

Dr. Joe Messenger (Gallagher) is a happily married man living with his
wife, Karen (Rogers) and his young son, Jake (Jake Lloyd). Messenger is a
brilliant researcher in the fields of artificial intelligence and
immortality. One of his projects is an AI super computer that controls and
monitors much of Salt Lake City, where the Messengers live.

Messenger's team seeks a means by which a human personality may be uploaded
into a super computer. One of the members of his staff is Juliet Spring
(Bridgette Wilson), a brilliant, beautiful young woman. Messenger and
Spring begin a torrid extramarital affair, complicated by Spring's terminal
medical condition. Knowing she is going to die, Juliet proposes to be the
test subject for Messenger's work. 

Joe realizes that his affair could cost him his family, and breaks off the
affair - or at least he tries to. Juliet succeeds in uploading her mind and
personality into the super computer. With nearly limitless power at her
disposal, Juliet seeks to eliminate all that stands between her and Dr.
Messenger. Imagine Glenn Close in your PC. Yikes!

Human neuronal transplantation (non feotal neurons) is a useful 
treatment for stroke.  More interestingly, freezing & thawing the 
neurons before transfer doesn't seem to impact efficacy.  Admittedly 
this is likely a small tissue sample and retaining efficacy in treatment 
of stroke doesn't necessarily indicate a possibility of reconstitution, 
but still...

Here's the news posting:
http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/transneuro-rat.html

Anyone know if this actually indicates that the implanted neurons are 
functional and retain something of their previous state?

Thanks,
Bobby Martin

I hold no brief for Dr Mills, and certainly not for `cold fusion'
claimants.  As I mentioned when I posted these urls, I think it's likely
that he's either a crackpot or a scamster.  But I find Hal's line of
argument interesting, given the views common on this list.

Mills claims to have a `secret' catalyst, and hopes to make money out of
it, eh?  Suppose he *had* cracked the fabled Shipstone secret (a Heinlein
reference for readers of RAH) - what should he have done?  Given it to the
world for free?  Patented it?  (He says he did, in Australia, although I
haven't checked that out.)  Then one might use a less prejudiced and
melodramatic term than `secret' - `proprietory', perhaps?  But people here
such as Lee Daniel Crocker regularly inveigh against this path, asserting
the merits of an agoric economy.   

He claims `a virtually inexaustible source of energy', does he?  Well, in a
way - but he doesn't say it's free, or can be harvested using two wires and
a piece of rubber.  And proponents of solar, tidal and hot fusion energy
also promote their favorites by pointing to their inexaustible supply.  So
this, too, fails to make Mills a crackpot.

He probably *is* one.  It's pretty unlikely that `classical' revisions of
QT will solve the outstanding problems of the inconsistencies between QT
and relativity (but *something* will have to).  But I think we need to be
careful about the kinds of arguments we adduce in deciding not to look
through the new instrument.  (Just more routine rhetoric - no, folks, *I'm
not asserting that Mills is the new Galileo!*)

Of course, here in Australia, that's the *standard* use of `mate' - which
might, if we can wake the sun-drenched buggers up, might make Aussies the
perfect launchpad for transhumanism... [`buggers' is another standard use,
with very little connection to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras even now
winding flamboyantly though the streets of Sydney - but then again...]

When I was 15 and 16, I lived in a monastery (I was planning to become a
Catholic priest).  I was glad to return to the outside world, but there
really was a genuine win-win, meditative quality in that life which I think
the busy-busy world could learn from.  Pretty quickly I moved into one of
the earliest of the urban campus communes in Australia (in the mid-60s),
and for years after that lived, on and off, in such households.  They fell
apart when couples had kids, went professional, got jealous over sexual and
affection issues.  For years now I've lived alone, despite periodic
entanglements.  It has very many merits - but ah, those head rubs...!
(Damien sobs quietly for a moment.)

Thanks for the terrific post, Derek.

The error in logic here is that the writer assumes that all influence one has on others
is harmful, and that harming others is some sort of capital offense. It is not, it is
more a recommended practice, more of a cultural boundary issue, than one of criminal
action. It does not prhibit it, but does expect you to pay damages if the one harmed
feels that would mitigate the situation.  Like wise, not all influence on others is
harmful, and much may be highly beneficial, and usually educational. Of course,
busybodying yourself with somebody else's life is also considered by those who value
their privacy to be rather rude, and in rare instances, the death penalty seems rather
appropriate. ;)

Sorry, the last thing I would want any do gooder to do is save me from myself. A drunk
or addict cannot get sober solely through the actions of others, but only through the
personal will to do so, nor should a person who has decided to end their lives be
forcibly saved and then brainwashed by the shrink establishment into thanking people for
doing so. Just as the freedom of speech means that one has the freedom to NOT speak, the
right to life guarrantees that the individual has the right to decide when NOT to live,
otherwise, it is no right at all.

Um, how about one of those shoulder rubs? 
I don't have any new name ideas right off, but Phoenexus (sounds
like penises) beats ExNex (reminds me of ExLax) ...

BTW, I am fresh from a massive cleanup of my home page and the nanotech
sub-page. I was pretty embarrassed by the dead-link density. I noticed
I don't have much explicit Extropian content, so next time I go in
there I will at least drop in a link to ExI.

On the one hand, nanotechnology renders traditional economic models obsolete until
another (transient) resource limit is hit.  The "haves", having reached a high
degree of self-sufficiency, would have no 'economic' reason to keep the
"have-nots" around, as the they are not only potential competitors for shared
resources but also possible future threats to their power.

On the other hand, you suggest a good point about keeping the "have-not" majority
around to provide a more interesting world.  This is certainly the case when it
comes to memetic complexity, novelty and diversity.  Imagine what kind of world
the nobility of England in the 16th century would have, had they achieved
self-sufficiency and killed off the rest of Europe.  There would be very few left
to tell new stories and perform and write new plays. The impact that the
renaissance had on england would have never come to be. With few other creative
entities still alive, a very boring world results.

Thus, the technologically superior may have reason to keep the rest of the
"have-nots" alive, if for nothing else than as a memetic resource to be tapped for
their own pleasure and entertainment.

One might argue, by saying that the same techno-elites could just as easily
achieve sufficient AI running a genetic algorithmic 'difference' engine.  This
engine would  mutate, create and engage them in a continuos stream of novelty and
complexity, which through direct neuro-feedback, could increasingly tailor its
stream to the maximum pleasure of the user.  The ultimate narcissist (wire head).

In response to Anders' comment of shields not keeping pace with spears,
there seems to be two ways this could change. One is anonymity as defense,
as in Vernor Vinge's _True Names_. They can't get you if they don't know
where you are. The other possibility is nano-defense. (Too bad bobbles
don't seem to be a physical possibility.)

Which will be widely available first, personal nukes, or personal nuclear
defense?

Our LA ExNex is a revolving door of intellectual stimulation and exotic
ambiance.  What I appreciate the most about creating this hub here in LA is
that it draws to it some of the most fascinating transhuman I have ever met.
It is not only my and Max's desire to build a lift-off environ for friends
to relax and feel at home, but also a place inspire others. From our many
dinner parties, meetings and extropian festivities, it seems that our LA
ExNex is in perpetual extro-motion.

>That didn't happen for us overnight. 

Nor for us either, Derek.  It took some foreplay and then a few more dates
and then meeting each other's biological families, then extended families,
checking linens, crystal patterns, etc.   ... -:)

The gradual slide in quality at _Scientific American_ has much to 
do with its decline in readership, increased competition from cutting 
edge technology publications, and the proliferation of online sources 
of information.  It survives by virtue of its past reputation for 
providing both scientific information and commentary, a combination 
that has not yet been achieved in other sources.  

The general American's  interest in science stems from the
perspective of 'how does this affect my life, or my family's
life?'--thus the emphasis on editorial essays.  I see a strong
opportunity here for someone in ExI to write a compelling essay for
_Scientific American_ that relates our optimistic perspective on new
scientific developments.  Or at least a few letters to the
Editor--people do read them!  Editors are beginning to pay attention 
to us--I've got a few sniffing around my stuff, if I can get some of

I watched the first two hours and then turned it off. I should have
turned it off sooner. IMO, Virtual Obsession conveys negitive memes

I agree that it does show many negative things about uploading, though
the cryonics/life extension stuff was not really attacked directly in the
movie.

My biggest complaint was that the acting was awful.  The protagonist
was too wooden.  His wife and son were almost nonentities.  That
could have used some polish, as well as some of the dialogu...  To
be sure, it was a made for tv movie.

Anyway, it is good to see the ideas taken seriously in a prime time
movie.  Now we can go out there and start a wider discussion of
the issues.

Cheers!

Yep.  The choice seems to lie with the first scientist (or, more
likely, group of scientists) who develops the single major 
breakthrough (e.g. MNT?).  If there are a series of equally
important advances, many of us are likely to be not too far
behind the most wealthy or powerful, so the only danger is
if one single advance is most important.  I think that this is
the case, but that the people who develop it are no more 
likely to be evil than any other random group of scientists.
Given an assembler, able to replicate in (say) an hour, for 
the first generation, why would the researchers who 
developed it be inclined to turn it over to the military, the
government, or even their bosses, since money and
most military power is suddenly pointless?

I find the opinion that SciAm is "one of the best popular scientific 
journals" rather sad -- and even sadder is that it's probably true.  
The problem is that I have had a very low opinion of SciAm for quite 
a few years, shortly after I noticed that on *any* controversial 
issue the scientific articles published in this magazine would weigh 
*heavily* toward that side which could be most accurately summarized 
as "give the government greater control of the economy".

On issues where that isn't relevant -- for example, the debate over 
the relationship between dinosaurs and birds -- SciAm has seemed 
pretty good.

But IIRC this magazine was about the first "scientific" publication 
to inform us that there is a solid consensus among relevant experts 
that human-caused global warming is a problem and we must do 
something about it.  At that time, judging by articles and letters in 
peer-reviewed scientific publications, the apparent vote among the 
relevant experts was 25% against, 15% for, and 60% insufficient 
information.

We started losing it 20 years ago or more.

It's a pity, but I think it's a fact.

Just for the heck of it, I tried this.

First I used the name that appears on my driver's licenses.  Of the 
first 20 entries, only the 13th was me: a newsgroup article I had 
posted, in an archive of a newsgroup I hadn't noticed I was 
crossposting to.

Then I used the name that appears on this message.

Of the first 20 entries, 19 were archives of this mailing list.  The 
other was an artifact of the fact that Altavista has a good indexing 
engine but no index-cleaning engine at all.

I examined the documentation of the university experiment out of curiousity.

In short, the experimental results are worthless.  It's been many years
since I last stepped into a chem lab, but the individual inolved clearly
has only rudimentary knowledge of laboratory processes and a laughable
grasp of the chemistry of the reaction he is observing.

In this particular case, they were using hydrogen gas as the hydrogen
source and KNO3 as a the catalyst source ( potassium is supposed to be the
catalyst ).  

1.  He only considers the formation of water and the formation of ammonia
as sources of chemical energy.  This is clearly wrong.  First, ammonia
can't be appreciably synthesized under the conditions the experiment.
Second, the formation of water is not the most energetic reaction that
would be occurring, yet he disregards the other highly exothermic reactions
in the mix.  I might add that nasty nitrogen bi-products are very likely to
be present in the instance that the experiment is actually working as
advertised.  This is clearly not the case (mostly likely N2 in his
experiment, which he doesn't mention despite the extreme exothermic heat of
formation).

2.  Platinum is well-known to catalyze all sorts of exothermic reactions in
the presence of a hydrogen gas.  I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention
at the time, but I distinctly remember a lecture during one of my former
chemical engineering classes where the professor discussed at length the
importance of keeping your gases clean/pure when doing platinum catalyzed
hydrogen reactions.  In the experiment described, the experimenter appeared
to be more concerned with whether or not he had hydrogen in the mix rather
than the fact that he had a lot of other gases in the mix.  Stupid.

3.  Knowing nothing else, if I was going to do the experiment, I would use
solid potassium hydride in an extremely low pressure sealed system.  Not
only would this eliminate a lot of interfering molecules, but would provide
much more detailed and useful results.  KH also ionizes easier than KNO3.
KH in a sealed very low pressure system would eliminate the probability
that other chemical reactions were taking place.  

(Note: This point alone makes me highly suspect of his claims.  The
industrial synthesis of KH should have generated anomalous results if what
he says is true.  The people who do industrial synthesis are maniacal
energy accountants and would have noticed something awry a *long* time ago.)


4.  A rudimentary chemical analysis of the resulting mix would almost
certainly be enlightening.  Interestingly, there is no indication that they
did any analysis of the residues or gases.  This is important, especially
if they don't know what type of reaction is occurring.



There are a lot more nit-picky things and lots of bad lab technique, but I
think it is clear (at least to me) that these "experiments" were half-assed
at best and in no way demonstrated anything.  After reading the lab reports
of the experiments that supposedly verified his claim, I have to disregard
him as being either a con-man or delusional.

"Patience Luke!"

Since you didn't watch the whole thing your opinion hols no weight.

Had you stuck through to the end, it has a very positive ending - when we see
the "complete" birth of the first post-biological being - the guy in the
wheelchair.  Since Juliets copy was somehow corrupted in the upload process, we
see the the more primal and lower level emotional desires dominated her
construct.  Your impatience was your loss my friend.

Not to argue with your other points, but on this one, I have often heard some
people stating similar beliefs.  I can't agree.  First, as far as I can
see, no
one has ever paid the earth for yielding up its raw materials.  All money goes
to paying for labor and for turning over ownership of materials currently
owned
by someone else.  In a nanotech world, labor is spent on software and for the
creation of other information, and this labor is not free.  This resource
limit
is the main limit in today's economy (finite brains), and I don't see a change
coming.  A nanotech future contains a *lot* of software, and massive
complexity.  It will take tremendous work to achieve some of the advancements
we want.  This is not completely different than the present economy.  In many
areas of technology, an exponential increase in brain power is needed to
make a
linear increase in product complexity.

Apparently transplanted neurons often do not need to be very
functional, as long as they produce neural growth factors making other
neurons sprout. This is likely a major influence on why embryonal
neuron transplants work as they do.

As for retaining their previous state, that is the big question right
now. My bet is that they do, but we do not yet have the
information. Let's hope the Prometheus Project gets there with the
frozen hippocampus slices.

Aha, now I recognize Mill's ideas. If he really claims potassium can
act as a catalyst for moving hydrogen to a lower energy state, then he
must explain why seawater (which contains potassium) has not decayed,
as well as why most stars still contain hydrogen since they also have
trace amounts of potassium.

One should judge claims on solid evidence, but in choosing what claims
to judge given finite time and energy it is usually a good hint to
look for the "mad inventor style" and put such claims low on the
list. This style is surprisingly consistent between cases (there is a
psychological paper waiting to be written on this subject, that seems
certain).

No, nothing to do with that. I looked it up, but couldn't quite tell what it

nothing to do with cohabiting extropians.

Umm... "mate" I'll take, I guess. "Buggers," I'll probably have to pass on.

My first time was in the Army. Ralph Whelan and I were barracks roommates,
and I found that really valuable when I started shifting toward extropian
ideas (and away from the mainstream). The combining of the resources was
something I valued right at the beginning. I didn't start getting the love
and other fuzzy stuff until later.

I lived with Ralph and Tanya for about 3 years before spending a year away
from the nexus with a girlfriend. She was definitely worth moving out for,
and I'm glad I spent that time, but ultimately I knew I was better off in
the nexus, without kids (a big problem for me -- I'm a less than stellar
step-father). And there is certainly the possibility that another similar
relationship will come along and get me to do the same thing (leave). But
I'm not really expecting that right now. I'd much prefer the new person to
be someone who joins rather than someone who takes me away. :-)

Of course. But what if you really aren't yourself at that time, i.e. in some kind of
fit that has blocked out your "normal" consciousness? Maybe the libertarian
solution would be to make a deal with others while fully conscious that allows
them to act on behalf of your primary persona during a fit or longer period
of insanity. There are however some problems with this, like what are people
to do during your first fit (no instructions), or what about strangers who see
you running around a busy highway naked and screaming etc. Sometimes
coercion can be really for one's own good (but I agree, it should be kept to
an absolute minimum).

Maybe this is more or less true at the moment(?), but I suppose that future medics
will
be able to correct any mental problem, whithout requiring your co-operation.

Well, if you assume that there are in fact multiple personalities, of which one (or
more)
want(s) to live while the other(s) want(s) to die, then at least a part of that
person will
be truly grateful for saving him from the alter ego(s) that hijacked his mind. The
only 
problem could be: which one of the multiple personalities is the "real" one? Or:
who's
rights should be respected? Maybe forcibly curing the person isn't such a bad idea
after all, because this is in fact the only way to please *both* personalities: the 
suicidal one gets removed (his deathwish is granted) while the other, non-suicidal 
one stays alive.

I agree, but with the mentally ill things are somewhat more complicated (see above).

This would seem to depend on the flavour of the Singularity, wouldn't it? 

If it was a full-blown DIY Blight, we won't have any chances at all. A
typical scenario of the Blight would seem the sudden emergence of one or
several malignant/indifferent Powers as a result of Web transcending, or
of a supercritical ALife experiment. I'm just rehashing the FAQ here, of
course.

Otoh, the Singularity may be benign/slow, so there are traversable
continuous persona space trajectories. Of course anybody not following is
endangered even on the short run. And of course many will choose not to
follow. 

On the third nanomanipulator, there might be no Singularity at all.
Bummer :(

If their reality representations was faulty, they would't remain around
for long. Darwin would seem one of the very few constant factors
throughout the Singularity. Then maybe I'm using an invalid extrapolation.

As we are on the outskirts of the Singularity already, trying to keep
himself _very_ informed while accreting personal wealth (=a richer set of
possible future ego trajectories) would seem a pretty good strategy. Of
course being part of the team about to transcend would be even better ;)

But physics itself does not know infinities. With the possible exception

There is no way how flesh would be able to persist even halfway through a
Darwinian Singularity (does anybody disagree?). I even do not see how
uploads are hoping to survive virtually unchanged (as there are
conservative cryonists, there are conservative upload researchers) in a
world rushing towards the new equilibrium (which might well be a Red Queen
equilibrium). 

Several mails upstream, Randal Koene of MURG cited several buckytube
theorists who recently estimated (before you ask, I have no idea who it
was, which reference values for the human equivalent they used, and
intuitively, their estimations would seem totally off) that about three
bottlefulls of buckytube nanocircuitry would eclipse the combined wetware
crunch of the whole planet. Even assuming one person/waterglass-grade
circuitry (certainly achievable with autoassembly-constructable molecular
circuits), one cubic mile of it would seem to be able to do a bit more
than just to walk the dog.

Hmm, keeping informed, accreting wealth and understanding transcension
- sounds a lot like what we are trying to do on this list. Maybe we
should start the transcension team :-)

Yes, I of course disagree (being the resident conservative :-). Sure,
a period of fast, turbulent change with nanotechnology around would be
very risky for biology. But it doesn't follow that it would
necessarily be replaced with something else. For example, the Earth
might simply turn out to be too inconvenient and cumbersome (too
little energy, too much gravity and oxygene) for the godlings, so they
go out in space to gobble carbonaceous asteroids instead. We simply
can't estimate if there will be a carnevale or not right now.

Depends on how large percentage of the mass you want to have as
information processing elements. I have no problem imagining
planet-covering forests with brains linked by root networks, or even a
biological nanotech jupiter brain. Not likely, but possible in
principle.

I'm happy to announce that my AvonEOS science fiction novel, The White
Abacus, a book with certain posthuman characteristics, has tonight won the
Aurealis (jury) Award for Best SF Novel of 1997.  No, I know you've never
heard of the Aurealis - it's an Aussie prize for Aussie books.  But I
managed to beat Greg Egan's Diaspora (which of course ought to have won),
so I'm feeling both pleased and guilty...

This assumes weapons that cannot seek you out (like a targeted
disease, which is benign for everybody but deadly for you) or weapons
of mass destruction that can strike in your general neighborhood and
wipe you out.

But the overall idea is sound: if it is not obvious where you can be
found, then most weapons have a hard time getting at you.

Nanodefenses are good at nanoweapons, but not against
macroweapons. And vice versa.

Quite probably the first. We are not that far from universal nuclear
proliferation (not entirely likely, but some bombs may already be
adrift), and it is very hard to defend yourself against a blast unless
you know it is coming. The kill radius is so much larger than the
detection radius if the bomb is hidden (say in a van).

I found "Virtual Obsession" extremely disappointing, actually it
breaks down like this:

1st hour: okay, this might be cool.
2nd hour: disappointment, why did they do this?
3rd hour: absolute disgust, but I forced myself to watch the 
          ending.

The ending was completely predictable, I thought a better ending
(for our interests at least) would have had the guy in the
wheelchair uploading, and everybody lives happily ever after.

Cryonics (initially made to look good) was made to look
ridiculous....

The ludicrous science versus religion fight.....

How long do you think it will take to lose the "exploding frozen
head" meme.

Thank goodness extropians and nanotechnology were spared....

Very good points.  In our case it only covers current income for our
S-corp.  This is pretty standard.  I think that any of these other
desires could be contracted with the purchase of the stock, or written
into the Corporation.  It is possible to contract a non-compete
agreement so that all my income must go through this Corporation.  I'm
not sure how to avoid the bankruptcy issue, because any business can
fail at any time.  Generally, I think anything you want can be hammered
out by lawyers and defined in contracts the way you want.  My point is
that an S-corp is pretty close to a personal corporation with limited
ownership in which you can sell profit-shares to others.

I thought some parts were quite funny, actually.  The scene where they cut
off the girl's head was bizarre.  "Looks like it's about to come loose,
grab hold of it, will you?"  Holding the wrapped head with his bare hands,
hair dangling out of the wrapping, the cryonics tech tries to put it into
the container.  It doesn't fit very well, and he kind of has to really
jam it in.  It reminded me of something out of Plan 9 from Outer Space.
I almost fell on the floor laughing.  Someday this will make ideal fodder
for a Mystery Science Theater.

The problem I had with the whole cryonics aspect is that the girl was such
an unsympathetic character.  From the very beginning she was presented as
a home-wrecker, a conniving, manipulative person.  Creepy music played
when she was on the screen.  Her attraction to the researcher was never
presented as an honest human emotion, she was just a symbol of temptation.
So it was impossible to feel sympathy for the prospect of her losing
her cryonic preservation.  We can't root for her, so when we see people
working so hard to save her, it just seems stupid and pointless.

Both instances of cryonic suspension mentioned end up tragically.  The
researcher's father had been thawed when his cryonic company went bankrupt,
and of course the girl got her head shattered.  This may further promote
the image of cryonics as something that will not work.

Philosophically, the movie did not strike a unified tone, but lurched from
position to position.  We had speeches about the benefits of immortality
and post-biological man, but then there was the one about how uploading
can not work because you leave the spirit behind with the body.  Finally
we have the apparently positive ending, which is inconsistent with what
we have just been shown.  If the girl lost her humanity by uploading, why
won't it happen to the guy?  Do we need the body, the soul, the spirit,
or don't we?  The movie doesn't address these questions, so the ending
just looks tacked-on to give something happy.  It doesn't make any sense
in the context of what had been presented before.

It would have worked better if, after the speculation about the need
for a body/soul/spirit which is lost by uploading, the other character
had challenged that explanation, saying that the girl had never seemed
too stable to begin with, and that the changes relating to uploading
had simply been too stressful for her to handle.  He could argue that
the basic idea was sound, but that you need the right person as a subject,
someone with a positive mental outlook (namely, himself).  This would have
at least made the ending coherent.

Dear all,

If you plan to visit Europe in June, drop a note......
Everybody is invited of course :-)

-------------------------
exi-europe  post:
-------------------------

Hello all,

Ok......enough of these lengthy discussions on exi-euro,
I wonder if this list can stand all these mails :-)

******************************************************************

Let's get together in JUNE 1998

The First:  European Transhuman/Extropian/Cryonics Gathering.

--- please drop a mail on this list, if you intend to come.
I will check for a location, near Amsterdam.
A cheap Hotel, with some space to gather. 
Let's say a weekend........fly/train/bus/car in on Friday evening and
go back on Sunday evening/afternoon.

If the date is set, we can start to think of some "presentations" or 
actions. But above all.......I think it should be an informal meeting,
with some drinks&snacks.......nothing really fancy....we save that
for next year......when the WTA is up and running :-)

Eager to learn all your opinions !! :-)


Greetings,

Berrie

http://www.seraph.org/Trans/SKMbooks.html
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Art/johnson.091792.txt
but they are not specific *posthuman*. Maybe we should begin one. Here
is my suggestions:

Greg Egan: Permutation City, Diaspora (+ some short stories in Axiomatic)
Vernor Vinge: A Fire Upon the Deep (some posthumans in the background)
Charles Stross: Scratch Monkey

Depends on what you mean by "flesh".  I don't see any good substitute
for enzymatically-driven reactions in an aqueous medium.  At the same
time, I don't see collagen as the final word in structural components,
either.

Because the demon won't know what the demon will predict so he can't account 
for the demon's prediction.

Well certainly, but that's virtually equivalent to my original thought  
experiment where the demon did not tell the man of his prediction. 
         

        >The man does the opposite of what the demon predicts, but the demon,

But not from the perspective of the man or any other third parties.

I think it sheds as much light on free will as the subject deserves, 
damn little.

It seems clear to me that is does restrict your ability to predict this  
system, unless you keep it secret, and if you do that the prediction isn't of 
much use.
         
        >jase1@uniserve.com        
        >Well, certain -justifications- for a criminal justice system would         
        >be things of the past.
         

Yes indeed, that's the point. In the matter of criminal law the general  
public, and lawyers in particular, have some strange ideas about the purpose  
of punishment. They seem to feel that if someone has derived pleasure in an 
evil way it is the law's duty to somehow balance the books by making the 
lawbreaker suffer. The clich about man being responsible for his own actions 
is merely a rationalization for sadism. This leads to endless convoluted 
irrelevant arguments reminiscent of the medieval one about pins and dancing 
angles. What was the mental state of the lawbreaker? Did he grow up in a good 
home as a child? Did he undergo a lot of strain as a adult? Is there anything 
physically wrong with his brain? Was he in full control of his faculties? 
And even a question that philosophers fight about to this day "does he know 
the difference between right and wrong?". Little wonder that the legal system 
is hopelessly backlogged.               

The only logical or moral reason for punishing a wrongdoer is to prevent a 
similar crime from happening in the future; it's the difference between 
justice and vengeance. Making an evil person suffer just for the fun of 
seeing him in pain is pointless and cruel, after all a bad man suffers just 
as intensely as a good man.
         

        >It could certainly no longer be seen as a means of prevention or         
        >rehabilitation.          


Huh? If the state of a serial murderer's brain causes him to do evil things  
and you change its state so it no longer does evil things, then the brain has  
been improved and is obviously a good thing to do. We can do that right now 
in about a minute with 10 amps of current at several thousand volts.  
Someday there will be methods that are somewhat more subtle.            


        >It fact, it wouldn't really be justice, it would just be a means 
        >of retribution.  
         
I don't follow that at all.
         

        >Or more like societal screening.  Get rid of the 'bad ones' 

Exactly. Getting rid of the serial murders seems like a wise policy to me.  
What does that have to do with retribution?
          

        >Granted, a flipped coin is incapable of predicting its behaviour,         
        >but insofar as it is incapable of acting upon its state, it clearly         
        >is not 'free.'


Part of a coin is its momentum, the coin's momentum acts on its state and  
determines what side it will land on. Part of you is your desires, your 
desires acts on your state and determines what job you will accept.
          

        >Free will is the ability of a system to make choices which         
        >ostensibily allow it to alter it's "fate;" 


OK, but the initial conditions of any system will always alter it's fate.
          

        >In order for this system to be able to 'choose' among these routes,         
        >it cannot be contrained by any internal or external pre-determinism.          
        

Then our actions have no cause, when somebody behaves strangely it's 
pointless to ask "why did you do that?" because there is no reason, no cause, 
all our actions are random.
          

        >The key then to free will lies not only in the unpredictabilty of a         
        >system's behaviour, but it's internal ability to choose it's        
        >behaviour.  This is not an observable trait!  
          

If free will is an unobservable trait then logic can not help us and there is 
no point wasting valuable brain cells thinking about it. I'm not interested 
in unobservable traits, that's why the tooth faire, the soul, Peter Pan, God, 
or devil demons from pango pango bore me to tears.
          

        >It appears to me that I have free will.     
          
Me too. According to my definition there is no doubt, I do have free will.               


        >I feel strongly that -I- am 'choosing' to type at this keyboard         
        >right now.  I feel this way because I am aware of the possibility of

        >anything 'forcing' me to type at this keyboard. I can  test this         
        >belief very easily. I can stop typing.  I can continue typing.  

          
I've talked about free will before and somebody always includes a 
demonstration. Usually someone picks up an object and drops it from one hand 
to the other and says "This proves I have Free Will, I can hold it in my hand 
or I can drop it. If I drop it it's not because anything made me, in fact I 
could have held on to it but I didn't feel like it". When I ask why he didn't 
feel like it the only answer I get is "I just didn't!" as if that explained 
everything. If I point out that I was the cause of the demonstration by 
bringing up the subject in the first place, anger sometimes results. 

To say "I can chose to do what I want to" is not an expression of absolute 
freedom but a severe restriction on it for the clear implication is "I can't 
choose anything I don't want to".
          

        >I am possesed of the experience of free will.  But does this mean         
        >that I do indeed *have* free will?
          
Yes. If you feel free you are free.


        >can we have free will independent of our perception of it?
          

As I've said many times, you need to tell us what free will is, and do so in  
clear consistent unambiguous language, then we can debate whether people  
have it or not. I've done just that with my definition, I haven't seen  
anybody else do the same.

Grameen Bank *isn't* an example of a human capital market.  The 
difference is between equity and debt, which affects the allocation
of risk.  As any finance text will explain, the difference is real
and it matters.

I applaud Sanders for trying to grapple with important questions, but 
I'd like to remind him and everyone else that none of these questions
are beyond "ordinary economics", and that economists have done an 
awful lot of work trying to model economic growth processes.  
I strongly encourage anyone seriously interested in addressing such 
questions to read this literature, and to start modeling future growth
using straightforward variations on standard economic growth models,
rather than just making up functional forms.

More concretely, see the Journal of Economic Literature, section
"O4 Economic Growth and Aggregate Productivity."  Or browse:       http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Economics/Growth/ 

One of these days I plan to learn this field better, but I sure wish
some extropian type would beat me too it :-).

Follows is a snip of conversation Anders and I were having regarding the
possibility of creating a demo or program to help us simulate and play
out various scenarios:

[[That could be very interesting.  I would love to see a full-blown
simulation
game (similar to the war games played on supercomputers by the USSR and
USA)
online where different parties could play together and/or against each
other
on all varieties of nanotech scenarios.  As thousands of games are
played out
we might begin to gain a fuller understanding of the most likely
scenarios to
develop.  In fact, I'm surprised that the Foresight Institute, now
moving
beyond the mere propagation of nanotech, hasn't come up with such a
program.
Since the Institute is always looking for money, you would think they
would
hook up with Maxis to develop an in-depth "Sim-Nano".

Paul Hughes]]

Does anybody on the list have the necessary skills or time to develop a
Demo?  Until then, I don't think we are ever going to reach any kind of
consensus of what are the most likely scenarios given certain intial
conditions and parameters of play.

Thanks, and I agree with you. I'm just an amateur in this area
(although I do try to learn a bit of economics when I'm not busy with
transhumanism, neuroscience or complexity :-)

Hey, you're the economist! I take care of the memory enhancements, you

Very well put Hal.

Yes they clearly had Juliet playing the femme fatale bit, if you
remember she supposedly had broken the encryption on the AI's
experiencial database before uploading, and was spying on the
couple via the bedroom mounted camera.

She was warped before uploading, then apeared to experience the
"absolute power corrupts absolutely bit."

Good review Hal

You actually made it to the 3rd hour?  I bailed for a very
good episode of /ER/.  I do agree that it was pretty silly
and predictable, but I think the ideas of uploading and
cryonics did fare a little better than you imply, and the
ideas did get out there, so I'd have to give it a net plus.

Good show, Damien, old chap! (I'm trying not to lose that English accent.)

I found Diaspora disappointing compared to Egan's other novels. Given my
tastes, it would be hard to beat Egan at his best. I confess I haven't read
your novels yet, but I will definitely pick up The White Abacus next time
I'm visiting the local SF bookstore.

Congratulations, and do have something in the works to win the 1998 or 1999
Abacus?

If you'll look more closely you'll see that I am essentially in
agreement with Vinge's comments in that interview.  Instead of
envisioning a technological singularity event as some technological
rocket ride spiralling towards infinity, one should view the
asymptote of a technological progress time line as a paradigm
shift. As you pointed out above, such a shift can be sudden or
gradual.

Red Queen equilibrium?  What is that?

Genetically?  Sure.  But what happens when you achieve the status
of a "Power" (as described by Vinge in "A Fire Upon The Deep")?
You can enhance yourself in such a manner so that all the measures
we use to gauge isomorphism could be radically altered to the
point of nonrecognition.  If it begun with the human genome, a
superintelligent agent might send the genome through rapid iterative
vicissitudes until no measurable isomorphism remained.

Optimism has no relevance in the face of inevitability.  We could be
optimistic about entropy increase.  However, that would not change
the second law of thermodynamics.

There is of course an extraordinary amount of technophobic and mystical
muck churning out of Hollywood and its analogs, and yet I've been thinking
lately that Robert Zemeckis may take the cake as the most conspicuously
anti-extropic film-maker out there these days.  You could make a case for
saying "Back to the Future" was reasonably extropic (despite its major
dreck factor) with its whole self-responsibility message, but the latest
three films all strike me as curiously and actually *insistently*
anti-extropian in their themes.  In "Death Becomes Her" Zemeckis exposes
a group of immortalists as grotesques, and expresses the theme that death
is a kind of blessing rather than a curse.  In "Forrest Gump" he suggests
that simple values are adequate to a misleadingly overcomplicated world
(interesting characters who actually make difficult choices in the face of
real complexities are killed off).  In "Contact" he urges that science and
faith are more or less equivalent.  Of course, Isabella Rosellini is so
fabulous as an immortalist in "Death Becomes Her" that she nearly steals
the show away from the deathist fest it amounts to, just as Jodie Foster's
Dr. Arroway (sp?) is so luminously moral that the film seems as much an
indictment of mysticism if you squint when you watch it as it is a
eulogy for secularism by apparent intention.  It is because Zemeckis
zeroes in on real extropian values and issues before he subverts them that
makes his films seem more dire than the run of the mill technophobia out
there.  Thoughts?  Best, Dale

the Extropy Institute are operated.  Its intent is not
to flame.  After writing it I realized that it might invoke
strong reactions from some people.  Its intent is to
represent constructive criticism.  ]

I'm guessing that the the Skeptic's Dictionary won't hold
the Extropy Institute ("ExI") in too favorable a light.
Whether that treatment will be deserved is another matter
altogether.  I admit I do not completely agree with (or maybe
I just do not understand) some of the thinking I see at ExI.
Extropy is a nice synonym for self-improvement with the added
kicker of transhumanism as an ultimate objective, but I don't
see what all the fuss is over the concept?  Esfandiary should
probably be credited with whole concept.  What substance is
the act of coining a term for a concept that someone else
created?

Don't get me wrong, coining terms is great idea since it can
help to improve commmunication.  Take a concept that would
otherwise take a sentence or two to trigger the reader's
mind and encapsulate it in a word.  But I see a lot of people
patting themselves on the back for simply coining a term.

Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the
significance of art by people who actively strive for
transhumanism.  I am not saying it has no significance.  But
how significant is it in the grand scheme of things? Granted,
it may have some peripheral value.  But does such a concept
warrant the allocation of resources it has been afforded?
Aren't there other activities these funds and efforts could
be directed towards to further the ideas of extropy?  Exempli
gratia, subsidize publication efforts, produce more information
on the Extropy site, etc.  I enjoyed my visit to the art site
but could help but wonder what other ways the time and effort
expended to create and maintain that site could have been more
effectively utilized.

Extropa-groups (or whatever the living communities are called).
My wife and my children as a unit, we strive for self-improvement.
We actively seek to prepare ourselves for the future.  But we
do not feel the need to use embody our "community" with a term
to illustrate this.  What point does calling a group "extropa-
something" serve?  More on this below.

Sex and fashion.  I visited the transhuman.org site (which I
must profess looked more like an excuse to lock up a site name
than a substantive information resource).  These two subjects
were major subject areas.  I just do not see the relevance of
even addressing sex or fashion in the same context with
discussions about nanotechnology, AI, uploading, Singularities,
etc.  Like art, maybe these subjects have some peripheral value,
but elevating their status makes me wonder whether its a vision
of the future thats trying to be emphasized or just an iteration
of alternative subculture (such as goth, cyberpunk, etc.)

New ways of thinking are very vulnerable to being viewed as
cultish nonsense.  Nonsense in the vein that people seize ideas
that resemble salvation from present circumstances. Designated
groups, name changing, questionable commitment to the real issues,
it sounds like a cult more than an intellectual critique of the
future (and more importantly how we can get there while also
performing the trick of survival).  Drexler himself said that
if you do not want to imperil funding sources for the various
technical people who will be needed to make the breakthroughs
that would harbor the future we speculate about here then:

     "please keep the level of cultishness and bullshit down"

Since several people on this list  stated that "Virtual Obsession" was a
net loss for extropianism, I couldn't *disagree* more.  VO did more to
promote and spread the idea of indefinite lifespans in 3 hours, what
Star Trek has consistently failed to do in over 30 years.  In Star Trek,
despite the fact that they *already have* the means to extend life
indefinitly (transporter tehnology), continue to treat life and old age
as normal, natural and worst of all as "the way it should be".  With the
exception of other races, humans continue to live not much longer than
100 years.  Anyone who knows anything about longevity should see this as
completely absurd.

VO on the other hand did what I call 'conservative infiltration' - which
is the practice of validating to some degree what another is saying
before you slowly manipulate them into your own way of thinking.  Had
the show not taken 'religion' at all seriously and instead been
completely extropian, then it would have lost much of its intended
audience.  Keep in mind that more than 70% of Americans still beleive in
god in the traditional sense.

My point:  **This was not a show for the converted (us).**  Its purpose
was to show the rest of the country that immortality, artificial
intelligence and uploading are right around the corner.  In that regard,
I think it did a very good job.

If you have felt lately that the world was just moving 'too fast'
for you, you have company throughout the universe, according to the
High-z Supernova Search team, which reported a set of startling
measurements in today's _Science_ journal (for information on this
journal, see below)  The team, working with Serl Perlmutter of the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Brian Schmidt of the Mount
Stromlo, Alex Filippenko of the University of California, and
astronomers on the three largest continents, have been tracking
variations in the brightness of distant supernovae as they travel
further from Earth.  They utilized the Hubble telescope and
observatories in Chile, Australia and Hawaii to conduct their
observations, and their measurements show an accelerated rate of
dimming, leading them to believe that the rate of expansion of the
universe has actually increased since its inception.  Of course, to
account for an increase in the speed of expansion, a force must
counteract gravity, and the team has proposed that a countervailing
force that they are calling 'antigravity'.  They stressed in a press
interview this morning that by the term 'antigravity' they do not
mean a force in exact opposition to gravity, but rather a force that
counteracts the effects of gravity.  

ABOUT THE JOURNAL SCIENCE:  _Science_ is published by the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science and is available in print 
form through membership in AAAS or in most American libraries.  An 
online version of _Science_ was inaugurated this year, and portions

=============== Introduction  =======================

The following announcement has been send to me through one of the
(L)egalize!-Mailing-Lists. Personally, I consider the drug-war a perfect
example of how "terrocrats" try to force a certain behaviour on people -
allowing certain (mind-numbing) drugs and declaring war on others (that
is: war on the people using those other drugs).

Besides, in order to justify this war (which is basically just a big
waste of money), research is done with weird motives:
In Germany, for example, only research trying to show harm of (illegal)
drugs is supported by the "government" (and due to the drug-war there's
not much economic interest in that kind of research unless you belong to
the mafia). If such research reveals postive effects those drugs may
have - or even less negative effects than
expected, it may not even get published (such a case just happened
recently with a study on marijuana). Personally, I think this looks very
much like an (successful) attempt of utilizing science for propaganda -
making *serious* research extremely hard.

A more rational drug-policy may help making a more rational drug-science
a lot easier!

later,
Holger

       The 1998 Global Days against the Drug War !

                     June 6, 7, 8

                      Events in
      New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Dallas,
 Stockholm, Brussels, Colville, Tallinn, Eugene, Texoma, ...
                   
                 Join the Coalition !

As you probably know, the United Nations will hold the first-ever
Special Session of the General Assembly on Drugs, from June 8th
to June 10th 1998 in New York.

This session was originally conceived as a critical examination
of worldwide anti-drug policy. The focus of this session has
now been narrowed. According to the new guidelines, only the
expansion of existing policies will be open for discussion. The
United Nations aims to escalate current drug repression tactics
in a catastrophic quest towards a 'drug free' society. In terms
of crime, economic and financial damage, and social and personal
harm, this policy is turning into a worldwide crisis!

It is of great importance that alternative proposals are heard
at the onset of this UN session. A clear statement must be made
that what is needed is not escalated repression, but reform
policies aimed at reducing the damage currently done.

To this aim, a number of organisations have recently united to
form the "Global Coalition for Alternatives to the Drug War".
They have written a declaration that will be published widely.
You can join the coalition by co-signing the declaration; see
the contact info below.

Members of this coalition are also invited to participate in the
"1998 Global Days against the Drug War", which are held Saturday
June 6th, Sunday June 7th, and Monday June 8th. This international
event will feature discussion forums, seminars, publications, 
press conferences, demonstrations, street parties, concerts, and
other types of events, in many places at the same time. At this
moment (February 17th), eleven events have already been announced!
A 'grand finale' is planned to take place in New York on Monday 8th.

You can help make the 1998 Global Days against the Drug War
a success! Make sure your city is part of this event. If you
are a member of a group or organisation that can help, contact
us. Otherwise, you can join one or more of the participating
groups and organisations, or set up your own group. See
the contact info below.

Early spring of 1998 we will issue press releases with the names
of all the groups and organisations that have joined the coalition.
Groups and organisations are invited to plan their own version
of the 1998 Global Days against the Drug War, under their own
identity and name. Note however that participation in the coali-
tion does not itself imply endorsement of the individual events
taking place.

Organisations wishing to join the coalition can send mail to
alliance@legalize.org. Individual activists please visit the
web site at http://www.legalize.org.

The Coalition for Alternatives to the Drug War currently consists of:

The Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet), the National Orga-
nisation for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), Coordina-
zione Radicale Antiprohibizionista (CORA), the November Coalition,
Transnational Radical Party (TRP), Common Sense for Drug Policy,
the Legalize! Initiative, the Media Awareness Project (MAP),
the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of Hemp (CRRH),
HANF! Magazine, and other organisations.

  Participate in the 1998 Global Days against the Drug War !

I had much the same feelings while watching "Contact", but 
after thinking about it, I don't think that the real message of
the film was that science and faith are equivalent.  If it were,
the point could have been driven home much more surely
by simply leaving out the scene in which we find out that 
x number of hours of blank recording exist.  I haven't seen
"Death...", but perhaps Zemeckis is only too subtle?

ABC's "Virtual Obsession" that aired Thurs. night, 2/26/98, dumped fresh
particulates into the kultursmog.  How did the producers, writers, and
sponsors all let such a contradictory, jumbled mish-mash of special effects
images and half-baked moralizing reach the air?  Well, they can't think
straight themselves, compost-modernism has done them in.  In addition,
those older guys in marketing who might still be able to think straight
probably figured that with all the contradictory moral assertions, they
were probably pretty much covering the highly fragmented market. 
Certainly, the movie took for granted that there is no consensual moral
polity left anywhere on the horizon; there is no more "one nation, under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."  Divide-and-conquer
has succeeded wildly.  The movie took for granted that the viewers are
sheep, incapable of sustained objective moral logic, only capable of
entertaining jukebox ideas of the moment.  The disrespect for the viewers
shown by serving up truly atrocious acting is obvious.  But why shouldn't
they disrespect viewers who are merely machines?  The machine view is
clearly predominant, in that no human character gets developed beyond a
stereotypical cartoon level, but the special effects - machine art - get
all the sophisticated development.  This has been Hollyweird's trend for
many moons.

The male scientist is, as usual, morally crippled; stereotypically male in
that he only thinks with his hormones and is incapable of anything more
than an adolescent "gee whiz, ain't that cool" response to the greatest
scientific achievement in history.  The model is probably the producer. 
The husband is a dork and so is the wheelchair guy.  Their interaction is
dork factor nine.  The female scientist is, as usual, morally crippled;
stereotypically female in that she is a slut who only thinks of
manipulating men to her own evil ends and turns sociopathic when her vain
will is thwarted.  The model is probably the producer's mistress.  The wife
is a painful caricature of what Hollyweird thinks of domestic bliss.  A
clinical psychologist who says she's going to leave and then doesn't?  A
wife who left a brilliant career to stick her head in washing machines and
toilet bowls nonstop?  A brain who's a dud in the marital bed and looks
like a Midwestern wreck of a woman, apparently unaware of the existence of
the cosmetics industry?  But, hey, gee whiz, those computer effects were
cool, y'know?  The overnight ratings amongst Generation Duh were quite
respectable.

Part of the contradictory manipulations is due to the inherent tension
between the very large neo-luddite contingent in Hollyweird and the very
large special effects technophile contingent.  The word-bursts (I can't
bring myself to use "plot") alternated between muddled semi-religious
jargon about souls and the sacred, and irrational claptrap about humans as
machines, the mind as a computer.  The writers probably go for the
mind-as-a-computer schtick because they write on a word processor, but why
mention anything religious at all?  Are the neo-luddites vaguely aware of
the unknown precipice we all stand on, as we begin to technologically
twiddle with other human's volitional freedom?  Is the mention of religion
a form of Pascal's wager, just in case we need something to guide us
through the labyrinth of political decisions that lie ahead?  Certainly the
father of the slut is the most cartoonishly developed of all the
characters, muttering half-baked dogmas in a rigidly wooden monotone.  The
writers clearly lack religious imagination and knowledge, yet feel
compelled to say something religious, covering their bets.  The casting of
the Man From U.N.C.L.E., an actor previously pigeon-holed into cold-blooded
hired gun roles, as the token theist, was not credible.  Nor was it
credible that such a morally absolute man would give a rip about a slut
daughter.  Oh well, at least the writers quickly and bloodily killed him
off, lest anyone think they might *really* give credence to his
semi-religious utterances.

Speaking of killing off, the writers at least are well attuned to one area
of the zeitgeist, the cheers heard throughout neighborhoods all over the
country when the judge fell down the elevator shaft were amazing!  Take
note, Hollyweird, there's gold in them thar hills...

Along the lines of the contradictory, allow me to be a bit technically
nit-picky.  Everyone knows that due to the dendritic properties of calcium
in the skull, frozen heads bounce like bowling balls, they don't shatter
like ice cubes.  The lamebrain writers must've been thinking about that
scene in "Terminator II" where the broken liquid nitrogen tanker shatters
the motorcycle cop calcium-less terminator.

Furthermore, to be in the hologram, the wheelchair must've been downloaded
into the computer, also.  Did it die along with the dork?  What about
non-coercion and wheelchair rights?  I mean, if humans are machines, so are
wheelchairs.  How could one machine have more intrinsic value than any
other (excepting my microwave oven, of course)?  If the aneurysm killed the
slut scientist because it was downloaded, how could the ADA dork stand up,
since the brain is contiguous with every scrap of neural tissue in the
body?  The brain's motor-cortical global maps are intrinsic to volitional
consciousness, how could they be summarily lobotimized without the
downloaded entity ending up vegetized like Ted Kennedy's sister?

It would be easy to view this as a morality tale where technology is the
villain when attractive psycho-sluts get downloaded but the hero when
harmless dorks get downloaded and can leave their wheelchair, an electronic
version of Benny Hinn's TV faith-healing.  The real moral has to do with
Hollyweird's obsession with the perfect body:  it's better to be dead than
to be halt, lame or blind - I mean, crippled (or is it handicapped, or
differently abled, or physically challenged; whatever the anointed's mascot
is called these days).  This is standard 'culture of death' morality, any
entity less than perfect - in fact, less than comfort-inducing - is
preferably terminated; abortion, euthanasia, genocide all are
fellow-travelers on this bus.

The final analysis is that Hollyweird strung together contradictory
snippets about religion, sex and death from a standard recipe, but they
forgot the amount of the ingredients and the order they are supposed to go
in.  The producers, writers and sponsors let it go out in that incoherent
form because they think incoherently themselves, they figure they covered
bases in many fragmented markets, and the special effects were, like, cool
and stuff.  They all think, "whatever," because they share the machine view
of humanity, the brain as computer processor, and why ought anyone care one
whit about one machine over another?  They're all equally disrespected. 
They disrespect themselves or they couldn't have placed this junk in the
public square.

No idea of significance is very original.  FM-2030 may have
taken the ancient idea of transhumanism to a new level, and
I think various extropians and others have taken it much 
further.  Besides, sometimes repackaging an old idea is a
stroke of genius.

I don't get extropic or transhumanist art either.  Maybe because
I love art because I love experiencing art, not because I'm
looking for an ideology booster.  Maybe because I haven't seen
any attempts at multimedia or high tech art that did anything
for me.  Maybe because I can't believe a transhuman culture could
possibly agree on a representative art -- I'd expect incredible
diversity instead.

I find extropic communities very interesting.  Social and family
life are extremely important to most people.  If this part of
life can be improved through conscious design and experimentation,
why not?  That's not to say that a traditional family unit (define
however you want) can't be extropic.  This has little to do with
extropian nexi, but I do think that the most extropic thing for
millions of people to do would be to get out of violent and
demeaning relationships and families.

Fashion: see art, mostly.  I personally feel that wearing
Nike, Calvin Klein, etc. logos is equivalent to wearing a sign
that says "I am utterly stupid and boring".

Sex: I don't know what extropic sex could be other than safe and
satisfying, but sex is a driving force for most of humanity, and
I certainly think that undestanding this major part of your life
could be considered extropic.

"Amen".  Actually one of the things I find attractive about
extropians is that most are very hard nosed realists.  The signal
to bullshit/crackpot/fantasy ratio coming from extropians is
incredibly high.

The WTA associates list is now up and running. It is intended for 
people who want to actively participate in the WTA. Discussions 
should be very practical and action-oriented: propose things to be 
done; offer your skills and/or resources; take responsibility for 
tasks that need doing; evaluate and give feedback on projects that 
are pursued.

Those who have already contacted me or Dave have been added to 
the list (or will be within 24 hours). Other people who want to 
become WTA associates and are willing to make some kind of 
contribution can do so by sending a message to 
transhumanism@delysid.ontech.net with the Subject set to 'subscribe'. 
See you there!

I have nothing against this because it is more realistic/believeable
anyhow.  The kind of Roak vs. Toohey stuff (a la _The Fountainhead_)
is too much like a caricature, though the father of the dead girl in "VO"
was a bit like a kook -- well beyond your average American.

I think it has stylistic flaws (bad acting, predictable plot, so so dialog)
and was a bit too long, though, yes, it did, hopefully, introduce a lot
more people to the ideas in a fashion they could accept.  A full blown
transhumanist presentation would have turned off some but would
have been taken less seriously by most.

Let's hope it is not the last word but the opening statement in this
more public discussion.

Cheers!

_nexus_ is fourth declension, so the nominative plural is 
(you're not gonna believe this) _nexus_ with a long /u/.

one common meaning of _nexus_, says my pocket Latin dictionary,
is enslavement for debt.

A targeted disease would only work if the attacker has your genome, so
that should be carefully protected.

I can imagine some nanodefenses that would be effective against
macroweapons. How about an exoskeleton made of cooperating nanomachines?
It would block attacks when possible and move you out of harm's way when
not. Such armor can reduce the kill radius of a nuclear bomb by protecting
the occupant against thermal radiation and blast effects, and repairing
damages from ionizing radiation.

Nanotechnology can also help detect nuclear weapons by making sensors
cheaper. Eventually every city will probably have a nuclear detector on
every street corner.

My wife can't stand "Forest Gump", for much of the same reasons you list.
In fact, she gets very upset whenever someone mentions it.  She really
hates the idea that this idiotic guy has everything come out so well
without doing anything to control his own life.

In Contact, the ending was changed from the earlier book by Carl Sagan.
In the book, the reality of the experience was questioned only for a
short while.  The fact that the erased recordings showed a long elapsed
time came out pretty quickly, and was made public.  Also, the aliens had
hinted about some numeric patterns buried in PI, and eventually these
were confirmed, further giving credibility to the experience.  This
totally changed the thrust of the ending.

Actually, I didn't think the movie version made a very clear point.
It was not trying to equate science and religion.  No one ever said that
personal and mystical experiences could serve as a basis for science.

Rather, it seemed to be a more personal comeuppance for the Jodie Foster
character, who had scoffed at the unreproducible nature of religious
revelation, only to be given an unreproducible experience herself.
However she was consistent in that she recognized that there was no
evidence of the reality of what she had encountered, hence she eventually
came to view it in purely personal terms.

It would seem that eventually there would have to be some additional
contact with the aliens, since not much happened on the first contact.
Probably they want to break it to earth gradually and give people time
to adapt.  But eventually they would want to do more.  Hopefully at that
time Foster's character will feel some personal vindication.  Maybe a
"Contact 2" is in the works.

OK, I should have watched the whole thing, my mistake.  The first two
hours seemed to play out the technophobia themes that are so common in
TV and movies.  I get upset with plots that promote the sense that the
average individual is being suffocated by computers and technology.  The
elevator and escalator scene for example.  The idea that computers/AI
can and will reach out and destroy any decent person's life, and there
is no escape!  I know that wasn't the point of the movie, but that is
what turned me off.

Well I can't speak for the last hour, but from what I watched, the
general public was left with idea that cryonics is a joke because,

1. the cryonics company will go broke and you will end up a rotting
corpse in some warehouse, which was displayed very graphically in the
movie
2. your family will go to court and have you planted anyway  
3. the cryonics company will readily hand over your frozen head to some
one unqualified to maintain the suspension equipment
4. the equipment will break down and you will end up in a basement
freezer next to the ice cream and frozen fish, or worst yet, out on the
street

For Extropians, these aspects of the movie are silly and we ignore
them.  But how will the general public view this?

Some transhumans are artists.  Their work, as professionals or as hobbyists,
is very dear to them.  Their art provides them with a venue to explore and
expose ideas -- a means to express their views of transhumanity.

What is the significance of science by transhumans?  What is the
significance of developing technologies by transhumans?  What is the point
of writing transhuman science fiction, or transhuman non-fiction?  What is
the point for designing healthy foods, or working out?  What is the point of
living, for that matter?

Extropic Art site is not a part of Extropy Institute. That is stated on just
about every page of the site.  Interesting that you should comment on the
cost of labor on this Web site.  Frankly, every hour working on it was worth
every dollar, especially because it came out of my pocket and has brought me
the greatest reward - a sense of accomplishment.

Regarding your comments on technology and sex; uploads and bio-technological
fashion; the Singularity and creativity:

The future of sex is integral to our future. Technology and sex are
intertwined and becoming more so.  Fashion (bio-tech bodies) and technology
are intertwined and will become a major domain for engineers/artists. 

By the way, the transhuman.org site is co-sponsored by FM-2030.  He is very
interested in sex and technology.  Style, and art. Also, the fashion of
Bio-technology.  He is also very interested in culture. He also loves
glamour and the idea of avatars.  He should also be credited for being the
strongest advocate of transhumanity. He did author the first book about
transhumans, explicitly, which I consider to be the foremost book about
transhuman values. He is also my colleague who I respect.

(I'm not offended by your post.  Frankly, I'm a bit amused that someone
could be so inflexible about what is and isn't transhuman, that you, sir,
make me want to rally around all creative thinkers who dare to produce
creative projects that reflect transhumanity.)

Art and the Singularity?  I think Vernor Vinge would strongly disagree with
your assumed notion that the Singularity is not affiliated with the
creative.  He is an artist, you know.

Oh, and by the way, Eric Drexler himself is quite stylish and frequently
displays the art of humor.

What use is humor, in the grand scheme of things?

They eliminated overtime pay for contractors making more than ~$27/hr.  As
a former contractor myself, I don't see what the big deal is.  Here in
California I never got overtime pay as a contractor.  Realize though, that
if I chose to work a full year, I can pull in between US$150k-200k a year
on a W-2.  While I think the cutoff point should be higher in this
particular case (say, $40/hr) this would create a condition where you could
make more money earning a theoretically smaller wage.  I actually
disapprove of overtime pay in principle.

Why does a person's labor become suddenly more valuable after 40hrs/week?
As far as I can tell, it doesn't and therefore should not receive
compensation above the usual.  If at some point you feel that your work is
not being fairly compensated, you can complain, stop working, or quit.
Making unusual compensation compulsory after a certain number of hours is
unwarranted interference.

Another way nanotech could help "protect" against these and other 
macroweapons is by keeping a running tally of the state of your brain in 
multiple hard-to-destroy nodes in your body, possibly uploading deltas 
to a central site.  It would protect by providing all the necessary 
information to reconstitute you in the event of major trauma.

Of course, by the time we have nanotech this mature we'll probably all 
be multiply redundant uploaded entities, anyway.

Bobby

I couldn't disagree more.  Gump responds to the ordeals life hands him 
with perserverance, intensity, and a desire for excellence, far 
exceeding the expectations one might have of his abilities.  We would 
all do well to emulate at least that part of his behavior.

He surely doesn't qualify as transhuman, but I nominate him for the 
first transmoron.

I will go even further.

An an-aesthetic life is not worth living.

Art is what distinguishes "us" from ants.

Absent art, one branch of which is technology (and I'll fight that one to
the _death_, I will), there is nothing worth preserving or enhancing. 

<Another branch of aesthetics is ethics. I won't bother fighting that one,
it's self-evident to anyone who's ever really examined hir life. Jumping on
a hand grenade is performance art--the very very highest. (serious :))>

Let me repeat that: absent art, nothing is worth preserving OR enhancing.
Nothing.

Art is human-directed Quality. Love is high art. Building nanomachines to
repair a genome is lower art. But almost everything worth doing other than
survival...

...is art.

Get used to the idea; you might like it!

In the context your using it, I could really care less about the grand
scheme of things.  What I do care about, is the life I lead and those I
find around me.  Only then can you have any significant impact on the
"grand scheme of things".  Besides, a life without art or beauty is a
life not worth living.  What's the point of living indefinitely if you
can't enjoy it?  That includes sex - the most intimate connection
possible between two entities in the known universe.

Nanotechnology has to be the most sexy thing I can possibly conceive.
Imagine the degrees of intimacy that will become possible between two or
more uploaded conscious beings.  For all intents and purpose, two
uploaded people could completely merge into one super-entity - the
offspring of their own memes.  If that does not make sex relevant, I
don't know what does.

If we eliminate all name changing from history - "ooggaa lulao ugga

issues; death and taxes are real issues - issues which this community
has addressed with some of the most constructive solutions I have ever
seen. Do you have any better ideas? If so, lets hear them!  Besides, the
level of commitment of people like Max More who went from publishing a
small college zine, to gathering some of the greatest thinkers (Marvin
Minsky, Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle, Kevin Kelly, F.M Esfandiary, Roy
Walford) into one room is highly commendable...  Questionable commitment
to real issues - what are you talking about?

I think your missing a very important point here.  Regardless of what is fair
compensation or not, the fact remains that the company has *taken away* money
from a more a powerful group.  Because companies need IT workers more than IT
workers need that company, why haven't IT workers realized that they are the
ones who really have the power?  You would think, that based on the IT shortage
trends, that IT workers would counter any company plot to exploit them.   Those
with the testicles in their hands control those who own those testicles.   It
just makes plain economic and political sense.

I believe the view of compensation as recently discussed is incomplete in
another way; permit me to include both figure *and* ground:

Because my productivity is likely to plateau (or worse!) after 40 hours
*AND* because my time is all I have, it is a good use of prices as signals
for me as an individual to set my over-40-hrs rate higher. Either in
dollars, or in other compensation.

This doesn't mean that the Gummit should step in, but collective bargaining
is not against free market principles. If the competent labor pool is in
short supply, the purchasers of my services will have to meet my terms or
do without me. Couldn't be fairer.

There is no one who values rational action and 
substantive debate over the shallows of thought
that pass for discourse in our present culture,
but I think your aiming at the wrong target here.

The most "cultish" and irrational meme I've
seen in your discussion is your idea that the
esthetics of Extropianism are somehow less
worthy, less valuable, or even at odds with
more scientific parts.  Nothing could be
further from the truth; Philosophy /requires/
esthetics, and implies culture.

If these important aspect of Extropian thought
are seen as irrational (and frankly, I doubt
not only your impression of them but also your
impression of the public's impression), then
it becomes our goal to change the perception,
not our own values.  The values are the center;
all the technology is just a means to achieve
the values.

/Why/ do we want to live forever?  Because
life contains art: food, music, sex, fashion,
literature, mathematics, philosophy, and arts
as yet undiscovered and unimagined.  Let us
not be so preoccupied with our fancy vehicles,
the road, even our destination that we forget
to examine the most important questions of
/why/ we have chosen this journey.

Of course. But this might be tricky, especially if your enemy is
willing to kill off a few people similar to you. But in general,
anonymity makes it easier to survive *direct* attacks, but it doesn't
help against weapons of mass destruction.

To some extent they might act as a "smart bulletproof west", but as
anybody who had been shot while wearing a west knows, that is just
partial protection. With nanotech one could always come up with
nastier bullets and attacks the smart west doesn't expect.

Yes, it would *reduce* it slightly, but nukes are still bad. Even if
you survive the blast, you might get a building on top of you. And too
close, not even nanotech is going to save you.

I wonder if this is feasible. If you wrap the nuke in a lot of lead,
the radiation can probably be made so faint the detectors won't react
to it. It is a bit like hiding the smell of plastic explosives for
bomb dogs, it is very hard but doable. 


The best way of protecting oneself in a world where many people can
unlesh destruction seems to be avoiding being there, and if you are
there, you should have some form of backup or distribution.

I couldn't agree more. 

If we just concentrate on making our nanodevices work, sift
information efficiently and built our transhuman bodies we will become
boring cultists (ever noted that fanatics never have humor or like
art?). But if we integrate beauty with our technological, social and
philosophical visions, then we will become something much, much more.

It might be amusing to point out that the motto of the Royal Institute
of Technology (where I reside) is "Science and Art". The two
essentials of technology.

[I'll try to respond in the same (dare I say it?) fashion, but let me say that
whenever one makes a strong critique of what is clearly the result of much
effort of expression of a person's core values, one should not be surprised by

He is clearly one of the most important "founders of transhumanism" but, as
others have already pointed out, there are many, many others before him who
saw key elements of the transhumanist or extropian idea and there have been
others since the publication of his seminal works that have added important
value to the ideas and values we express and develop as extropians.  Just off
the top of my head I can think of the U.S. Founders and the other giants at
the dawn of the age of classical liberalism as vital progenitors of extropian
political and legal thought.  Charles Darwin is surely as important a
conceptual founder of extropian scientific thinking as many 20th century
figures.  Closer to the core synthesis of uniquely transhuman thought, Mary
Shelley saw very clearly a good deal of the ethical material that obviously
concerns transhumanists and extropians. Olaf Stapleton likewise described
almost all of the core ideas and problems of transhumanism before FM 2030.
Closer to our own age, Stanislaw Lem and Arthur Clark have been writing about
the concept of technologically-mediated transcendence of biological evolution
at least as long as FM 2030.  The list of other contributors to the ideas of
transhumanism and extropiansim is so long that I won't spend the very few
moments of relatively lucid thought I enjoy during my second cup of coffee
lengthening it.

The act of naming an idea is fundamental to the process of cognitive progress.
While every idea has antecedents with other names, a truly new idea is in a
sense "born" when it is named separately from its antecedents.  The cluster of
ideas and values that is "Extropy" earns a unique name because of our insight
into the connection between technologically-mediated transcendence on the one
hand and certain "political" and ethical ideas on the other.

There is surely some of this, but perhaps you mistake pride in authorship of
the insight named by the term for pride in authorship of the term.  As
extropians, we share the thought that the best course through the
transhumanist period is navigated by a return to the ideals of classical
liberalism, tempered by a knowledge of current evolutionary theory (rather
than the necessarily primitive concepts of evolution current during the first
age of liberalism).  We think this may well mark the development of a new
cultural paradigm, just as the founders of the modern age did: Revisit the
writings of late 18th and early 19th centuries and you will see the same tone
of excitement at living during a revolutionary age, the same sense of urgency
and pride.  The folks who gathered in Philadelphia 200 years ago or so patted
themselves on the back, as well, while looking over their shoulders for
threats from the defenders of the old ways of thought.  You'll find some of
that latter mentality among us, as well.  "We must all hang together or surely
we shall all hang separately," said one of the first transhumanists.

Excuse the strong reaction, but I find this comment so far off the mark that I
can barely formulate a response.  Nevertheless, for fear of it being said that
I was ever at a loss for words, let me offer the following response:

As others have already pointed out, the artistic urge may well be central to
our nature as conscious beings.  The dawning of every new age has found
expression in the works of artists working out the new aesthetic vocabulary of
that age.  Because of its very nature, the artistic endeavor is best
appreciated directly, rather than through textual exegesis.  Accordingly, I
urge you to contemplate the flowering of Greek thought and then take a trip to
Athens, or to consider the fundamental humanist breakthrough that was the
Renaissance and then visit any of the northern Italian city-states or to
consider the liberal revolution and then spend a day (or a lifetime) at
Monticello.

It is literally impossible to comprehend the real dawning of humanism and not
appreciate Michelangelo's _David_.  One cannot _really_ understand the liberal
ideal of the self-reliant and truly free individual without considering the
gestalt of Monticello.  The strength of 17th century capitalism is nowhere
better expressed than in _The Night Watch_.  A little closer to our own time,
the power of frontierism doesn't really make sense until you've seen a few
Remmingtons.  Likewise, the breakdown of reason in the clash between
traditional values and modernism is _best_ expressed in the nihilism of much
of 20th century visual art.

You can't separate cause and effect in this process and thus somehow conclude
that the spirit of a new age is somehow more fundamental than its artistic
expression.  There is a constant feedback between idea and artistic
inspiration.  The realization of the dignity of man and our ability to
transcend the condemnation of superstition gave birth to Michelangelo's
vision, but the expression of that vision was itself a moving impetus to the
flowering of that realization. 

The more I think about the idea of automorph art, the more I am convinced that
this idea is the core artistic expression of the transhumanist agenda.  If the
urge to artistic expression is, as even the most superficial study of history
clearly demonstrates, fundamental to our nature, and technological self-
transformation is the core of transhumanism, then automorphism is the artistic
movement of the transhumanist period.  Period.

Again, history teaches that the coming of a new cultural paradigm generates
social experimentation on the one hand and the desire of the first pioneers of
a new memetic country to band together.  Likewise, the goal of creating "ideal
communities" seems to be inherent in the enterprise of developing new ideas.  

The more I read of evolutionary psychology, the less inclined I am to believe
that biological humans can improve on the mating pair bond as the foundation
of community.  But the mating pair bond is only the building block of
community: larger structures obviously must be formed for enterprising
entities to capture the benefits of division of labor.  It would be surprising
indeed, given the extropian interest in spontaneous orders and agoric social
structures, if we didn't experiment with new higher-order social structures.

Another historical note, although perhaps a digression.  I have a fascination
with the history of "fashion" seemingly inconsistent with my public persona of
"Texas trial lawyer".  However that may be, the instinct to adorn seems to be
near the core of our being and the universal use of "fashion" as a medium of
communication cannot be doubted.  Put simply, one can tell a lot about an age
by what the people in it wore.  Look at the riot of change in fashion among
elites between 1400 and 1900 to see just how rapidly people's conceptions of
themselves and the ideal social order was evolving.  In particular, I've
always been fascinated by the period between the baroque and middle of the
19th century: at the beginning of this brief 300 year period, our intellectual
forbearers clothed themselves in "semiotic envelopes" or "wrappers" (as Sasha
Chislenko might call them) beyond the dreams of the wildest fops of our day;
by 1850 men's fashions at least had evolved to a uniformity and drabness
unmatched since classical times.  In particular the period between 1790, say,
and 1850, marks the adoption of an egalitarian ideal in fashion that cannot
but be a reflection of the transformation of the political Zeitgeist

As for the importance of sex, I commend a bit of evolutionary psychology, in
particular, Buss' book, _The Evolution of Desire_ or Pinker's _How the Mind
Works_.  Self-replicators of our kind are inescapably and fundamentally
sexual.  The biological imperatives of our nature as sexual self-replicators
are so powerful and all-pervasive that it isn't much of a stretch to see the
entirety of culture as merely the thinnest garment worn by the figure of our
true erotic selves.  The truth of this was glimpsed, albeit through a glass
darkly, by Freud and, in so seeing we have been given tools of self-knowledge
of unprecedented effect.

A program of transcending our biological natures that ignored sex would be
like automotive technology that ignored road-building (hmmm).  Seriously, we
will be -- for the immediately foreseeable future, at least -- beings grounded
in a sexual nature.  Understanding what we now are is crucial to creation of a
rational plan of self-transformation.

Thus it always has been and always will be.  Immediately behind the cutting
edge will be those who grasp only part of the spirit of the new age and who
seek formulae for capturing its increasingly obvious power.  Thus the now-
apparent absurdity of such 18th and 19th century "scientistic" oddities as
mesmerism, phrenology and primitive "social Darwinism".  That such cultish
nonsense happened does not undermine the obvious power of the new age that was
dawning in those times.

Everybody runs like mad if he wants to remain in the same place. Must run
at least double that fast to get anywhere else. Basically, a major part of
the fitness function are the other guys. As they are in evolutionary flux
-- as are you, the autofeedbacked fitness function goes into a hyperactive
regime. Many ecosystems are thought to persist in a Red Queen equilibrium.

I think there is a fair change our future genome will be coded using
energetic states of nanoscopic islets of condensed matter instead of
solvated linear biopolymers. Darwinian systems tend to maximize obtainable
habitats, which should result in restructuring of matter on the global
scale. This neomoravecian view has been extensively discussed on at least
three lists.

I couldn't agree more: My post was simply an attempt to throw a little data at
the discussion.  In particular, as I've written here before, my experience as
a ship's agent and admiralty lawyer has given me an acute appreciation for the
vulnerability of ships and other maritime engineering constructs to the
"forces of wind and wave" (as the cliche of admiralty jurisprudence puts it),
to say nothing of the acts of intentional aggression.  It is hard to imagine a
more vulnerable position than lying afloat on the open seas.  A big boat is an
easy, high-contrast target.  The term "sitting duck" comes to mind.  A fixed
platform is obviously worse.

However, as Admiral Rickover realized, a stealthy mobile submarine is a pretty
good place to stash valuable assets.  Detection technologies right around the
corner, though, may make this current fact obsolete.

Beyond this, the only importance to the transhumanist agenda I can see to
formation of terrestrial extra-national enclaves in the near term is the
potential need of a secure base for research and development beyond the reach
of current nation states who may attempt to ban key technologies.  IF (and
it's a big "if") an offshore base were crucial for such work, then development
of a terrestrial extra-national enclave could be important.  This would
obviously be important only in a very brief transitional period, as getting
such efforts off-planet would be a much, much safer course of action: The
factors that made submarines important strategic technology in the 20th
century will make spacecraft much more so in the next.

Erm. What did you look at?  I'm intrigued.

Have a look at http://www.gii.net/dwayne/HTML/nexus.htm

although it's fairly defunct nowadays.

It just amuses me to see the word used in this context :)

Unless you are a massive, unstructured superalloy sphere you won't survive
a nuke fireball from a few m distance virtually unscathed. As has been
discussed on this list long ago, nukes are pretty useless in space,
especially against rad-shielded floating and underground habitats. Spatial
redundancy (=networked distributed system) is nicely complementary to site
hardening. 

What we should worry right now are not nukes nor nerve agents, but
engineered bioweapons (mostly viruses, not bacteriological bioweapons). 
Not many can now live sustainably in full biocontainment habitats. Also,
the suits tend to get pretty smelly with time.

Perhaps my geographic location near the buckle of the Bible Belt informs my
view too much, but I see real threats to the developments of enhancements.  I
often experience a sense of dread when I contrast the world-views of my
friends living on the West Coast or northern Europe, almost completely
surrounded by a social circle of skeptical, scientifically-minded people, with
the expressions of opinion I see as the near-universal cultural milieu
elsewhere in the world.  Transhumans are a tiny minority among scientific
humanists, who themselves comprise a tiny minority of the human race.  Of
course scientific humanism has had an impact on the world out of all
proportion to the numbers of people who have really grasped the scientific
revolution and have internalized its values, but the I FEEL that the
possibility is very real that all we have achieved in the last 500 years
stands threatened to be inundated by the ocean of irrational superstition and
primitive values governing the minds of the billions of humans who make up the
vast majority of the human race.

What evidence of this is there, you ask, Damien?  The current ban on human
cloning is only the most recent.  Galileo's suppression by the Inquisition is
perhaps the most famous.  In between there are many, many more examples.  You
argue that the self-evident economic benefit of real enhancements will
overcome the ideological opposition that is only now forming as the great mass
of people come dimly to be aware of the possibility of radically transforming
the human condition.  And of course Galileo's work was not suppressed for
long.  By expressing the new knowledge in terms more palatable to the current
world view, pioneers have insinuated their revolutionary insights into the
mainstream to slowly subvert old ways.

But the very realization of the truly fundamental change that lies just ahead
that has given birth to a uniquely transhuman or extropian world-view will
eventually dawn in the minds of the majority. When it does, we shouldn't
expect a grudging accommodation.  Get too close to the core and you provoke
coercion and violence.  People with too deep a stake in the old order react
very badly indeed to unavoidable challenges to that order: They bomb abortion
clinics (in contemporary America) and pass laws against the free formation of
capital (in late feudal Europe); they invoke the mandate of god against
contraception (in Latin America today) and send writers of seditious
literature to the gulag (in Soviet Russia); and they do ban the use of
threatening technologies (the Ming prohibition on construction of deep-water
vessels; the Japanese cultural prohibition on firearms technology following
the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate).  Occasionally, they launch wars
of annihilation against their memetic adversaries (jihads and crusades).

At some point in the not-too-distant future, the ideas we have been discussing
here for the last few years will become known to the larger world.  People
like Eric Drexler and Max More and Damien Broderick and Ed Regis are doing
their best to see that that happens, for better or worse.  (For better, I
happen to think.)  The idea of creation of "post-biological man" (as the term
was uttered in hushed tones in _Virtual Obsession_) will become a commonplace
in popular culture.  When that happens, buckle your seat belt, for a I fear we
are in for a bumpy ride, at least, and probably some severe turbulence.  Let
us hope that it is no worse than that.

James, I'd be very interested if you could find some reference for this
experiment.  Some questions occur to me: Can the shares be sold during the
lifetime of the shareholder (i.e. the purchser would have a "life estate"
measured by the life of the original shareholder)?; what is the core business
of this corporation (is it essentially a metropolitan services enterprise)?

This may be somewhat similar to the use of tribal corporate business with
which many Native American groups are experimenting.  I've often thought that
those enterprises should be watched closely as models for new forms of
governance and social organization.

Do I detect an invalid hypothesis here? Is it your view that the author of
the Skeptic's Dictionary is somehow a particularly competent critic? Or
that this one guy, or even CSICOP, is somehow possessed of great influence
over <much?> <popular?> consciousness?

This one guy calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg, any more than one
dork's ad hominem Scientific American article transforms K. Eric Drexler
into Mr. Peabody. 

Have you heard of the CRIT engine? If this guy posts something stupid about
anything you care about, it's grist for that mill, you know.

"Never apologize, never explain"--but don't be a cad or a bounder.

I agree that others' perceptions of one directly affect how effective one
can be in many situations.

But as one Extropian's mother once said, "What do you care what people think?"

Pussyfooting around and aggressive spin management get interpreted as
spooky and cultish too.

Why, yes, of course! Let's build a *spaceship*, fly to Mars and just claim the
whole damn planet. Off you go! Mmm, you'd probably still need some kind
of island as a launch base of course...A new focus for the transhuman effort?

Seriously, if this isn't a project worth considering, then I wouldn't know what

Extropia: the mutual aid organization for the survival of extremely rapid and 
profound future technological and social change (a/k/a Singularity). Primary
goal: establish a permanent independent space habitat (a Marsbase makes
most sense for obvious reasons).

A good idea. But does it have to be strongly linked with a physical
location? It might be *useful* to have a place of operations, but the
overall goal may require us to be more flexible than that would allow.

Mars? Why not an asteroid? I have never liked gravity wells, too
little freedom.

But yes, I would happily support a project I think has a good chance
of creating a safe space habitat.

 The effectiveness of #3 is unclear. I suspect it needs to be significantly

 Ok, I was wrong to guess that your stereotyping was based on education
level assumptions.
 I think you have an innacurate stereotype of Christian extremists.
You may be partly right about Randians. They clearly value simplicity
in moral rules, and their intolerance may be provoked by a need to hide
from themselves the differences between the simple rules the claim are
adequate and the somewhat more complex rules they actually obey.

[I'm about go offline for a week's vacation, so it will be while before

 No. I think the injunction "don't write to a file without permission of
its owner" is less abstract, and most rights that will be important to
uploaded beings can be built out of such injunctions.

 No, one point I was trying to make when I referred you to the Agorics
papers is that the ambiguities that cause such disputes can be avoided
if the adjudication method consists of software. The Unix filesystem is
an example of a system of property rights which is not open to differing
interpretations (at least as long as only one person has the password to
each account).
 For other ways of seeing the same point, read Nick Szabo's smart contracts
paper or Mark Miller's Extro 3 talk Computer Security as the Future of Law.

 It seems pretty obvious to me that my diet would be less diverse,

 It's not arbitrary, but I don't see how it's relevant to diversity.
I gather you use "diversity" to mean something more than I do. I'm
trying to use the standard definition I got from ecology textbooks
back in the 70's when I studied that kind of thing, which is roughly
"no single species occupies a large fraction of the available space"
(for many meanings of species, including "people with memeset X").
What do you mean by "diversity"?

Subject: Transhumanism in The Outer Limits?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

With all this talk about "Virtual Obsession" spreading memes, it makes me
wonder if people on this list have watched episodes of "The Outer Limits"?
I have been taping them weekly for a couple of months.  They have had
episodes about the following subjects:

- Cryonics, being frozen and coming back
- Transferring consciousness to a new body before death, including
transferring multiple consciousnesses into a single body
- An AI program that becomes sentient and demands equal rights, and finally
decides to ignore the physical human and deciding that the VR people are
more real, and the last physical human is irrelevant
- A world where everyone is in communication on a giant network with neural
chips built right into their heads from birth
- Many episodes where humans are extinct or close to extinct and replaced
by robots who continue society
- Lots of genetic engineering episodes, or end-of-the-world episodes where
only genetic engineering can make humanity survive in an altered form
- Lots of episodes where final humans turn against other humans in favor of
aliens, robots, AIs or other forms of life, deciding that humans aren't
automatically superior that other forms of life
- etc.

Some of these show the horrors of the technology.  Some of these are too
fluffy-sweet showing that technology is so wonderful that we were idiots to
ever have war, disagreements, or boredom because technology solves
everything.

My favorite part about the series is that each episode is written by a
different author and has a different point of view and different
characters.  Unlike Babylon 5, Star Trek(s) and X-Files, which are all
locked into the same characters and the same tired points of view, these
are different points of view every time.

It may be more effective to spread memes via a TV series rather than
individual movies.  Then we could have a different author and story idea
every week.

I agree, though I've had no experience outside a gravity well.:)  Anyway,
we should all look into what we can do to encourage/advance/promote
small scale colonization of space.  (I say "small scale" here because there
is a tendency to talk about big projects which will never be done.  It's nice
to dream, but I want to do too.:)

On the contrary, most forms of personal defense can readily handle most any
personal threat, even so far as  poison gas. However, it takes people willing
to purchase and use such tools before thay are of any use. People care more
about the 'appearance' of a threat as a deterrent to a would be attacker. Most
people do not want to have to actually use the guns they carry.

I think that the day some terrorist group demonstrates their ability to deploy
a nuke in an urban area is the day that SDI technologies will quickly come to
the market, if only at first for cities to purchase for their police forces.
The difficulty with defensive technologies is the energy requirements versus
reusability. While some kinetic kill missiles would be cheap, they are only
one shot apeice, while a railgun or laser system requires a huge energy
production and storeage capacity. Eventually, though, as the need for high
energy weapons are needed for space travel, they will be come more
commonplace. Also, space based weapons can be lower powered than ground based
installations, as they don't have so mcuh atmosphere to punch through.

I've heard of it--many in the US are aware of the plethora of
excellent authors in your country!  (Not to mention musicians,
painters, and one of the best ballet troupes on the globe...)  
Congratulations!

I'll reiterate an earlier comment--it's wonderful to hear about what
people are writing and publishing, so please keep telling us about
this sort of thing.

The problem with "The Outer Limits" -- old or new series -- is that it is
basically science fiction horror -- i.e., what can go wrong with technology.
I guess for dramatic interest, this must be done.  Else one winds up with
stories wherein the technology is grafted on to the plot -- like many
episodes of the "Star Trek" series, where the technology is just a
curiousity and not directly relevant to the story.

That can be an advantage.  I wish more big name science fiction writers
-- Poul Anderson, Vernor Vinge, etc. -- would make it to the little screen.
I am tired of seeing "Harlan Ellison" written over everything on TV that
even pretends to be science fiction.

That's true.  Now we only have to sell the idea to a studio or network
that is willing to invest in it.  Of course, a good movie might turn into
a series too.

Also, we might think of independent productions, which might create
a following, if they are done and marketed well enough.

We should also ry to penetrate other markets.  The Latin American
TV market, from what I've heard, is the fastest growing.  Potential?

Cheers!

It should be noted that this thread deals with defenses in general,
not just personal defense. Can the shields protect better than the
spears hurt? How do you create a personal defense, usable in daily
life, that can save you from (say) half a tonne of ammonium nitrate
explosives? Is there a *workable* defense against unexpected attacks
with nuclear weapons or killer nanites?

Huh? I assume you are assuming the terrorists would be silly enough to
use a missile of some kind, possible to track from afar (and leaving a
trail to the launch point). A more likely use would be to drive a van
with a nuke to the destination, leave by commuter train or something
similar, and then blow it up. How does SDI help in this scenario?

If you can see your enemy and know he is your enemy, then things are
much more even. But surprise attacks with weapons of mass destruction
are hard to deal with, since you may not know there is a real threat
until it is to late.

That is still for me to decide, even if its in a lucid moment and if I actually am nuts.
Deviating from this in any manner opens the door for big brother to decide when you are
insane or not, depending on your present political correctness, or for others to decide
you are nuts in order to get ahold of your assets (the recent 'Roby Ridge' incident is
one example of this). Some things cannot be surrendered, or we are all indanger of being
enslaved by the do gooders. Whether it is for my own good, (in your opinion), is
irrelevant. You are not the one with authority to decide.

SOrry, I don't know about your country, but here, doctors have to get your permission,
or if your unconcious, the permission of next of kin to operate. I don't see this
changing that much. Moreover there is more to substance dependency than just
physiological. Unless you approve of others having free reign to just rewrite other's
personalities, the only way for a person to kick a psychological dependency is through
personal will. This is recognised in most all drug treatment programs. The 30-45 days
you are in a treatment center is mostly for giving you time to kick the physiological
dependency, but it takes years of personal work to change your psychological dependency.
During this time, one is not insane.

SInce 'mentally ill' is only defined by psychologists as a state where one's perception
of reality differs from the mainstream, I think that this is not a criteria worth
considering. By this definition, everyone on this list is quite insane. Do you want
others making your health decisions for you?

The need for a physical location varies with the political climate etc, but
in any case you'll need a safe place to launch the initial spacecraft from
to start the construction of your actual ship (in high lunar orbit?). Launching
from existing nations might be difficult (legally), while a launch from a
private island can only be stopped with brute force (always a bit tricky in
the age of omnipresent media coverage). Of course, the fact remains that
in this scenario the private island is just a tool, and maybe not worth the
effort. Maybe there are plenty of countries with no objections to private 
manned space launches, as long as you pay them. Then again, a private
island might help to finance the space project if you make it into some 
sort of Las Vegas...

Because Mars:
--is far enough from earth to avoid direct problems with its governments
(it's too expensive/far/difficult to just send marines or nukes -- and you
can see them coming for months) but is still near enough to reach by
spaceship and to "stay in touch" with earthly developments (just a
relatively small communications delay).
--is a huge ball of raw material, with considerable value (with or without
nanotech).
--has a nice natural gravity well, something fleshy humans (unfortunately)
need to prosper (i.e. need to avoid total degeneration). Of course uploading 
would elliminate this problem, but we don't know when this will be safely 
possible - could be as much as a hundred years. Besides, Mars is a good 
place for uploads too (see above).
--has all the space to build your settlements (a whole planet can be devided 
between a couple of hundred/thousand people).
--resembles somewhat our natural habitat (you can go "outside" for a 
walk etc.), which might help psychological adjustment.
--is a very interesting place to visit from a scientific point of view.

The only problem with The Outer Limits is (IMHO) that the series lacks style.
It's just one of those X-Files ripoffs (or so it seems), with wooden acting, bad
lighting, weak storylines etc. They just annoy the hell out of me, so I hardly
ever watch (and never on purpose). Something about that series screams
"fake", but it's hard to pinpoint what *exactly* the difference is with the X-Files
(that I watch every week -- yes, shame on me). Ambiance I guess...

A good idea. But be sure to hire the X-files team for the rest.

P.s: Millenium isn't total crap, but it certainly hasn't the X-Files brand
of quality. Maybe it's just too hard to care about the depressing ex-cop
and his "perfect loving family". Yech! [vomiting noises]

Considering that most primitive peoples still on the planet think that the rest of us
passed beyond a singularity a long time ago, I think that our likely hood of going
through the singularity largely unharmed is highly likely. Why? cause we are already
in it. A singularity transcension is not an event, but an era that never ends. The
only thing that changes is the gradient of change gets steeper. Those going through
the events we currently view as 'the singularity' will not notice anything
particularly strange, although those who will be getting left behind like stone age
primitives as a matter of personal choice will notice the dislocation that they are
getting left behind. The most noticable indicator that will also cause the most
disruption is that the phenomenon now known as the 'generation gap' will tighten to
the point where those who do not keep pace with the cutting edge will quickly find
themselves out of touch with those that are. This is being seen now with computers.
The 386 PC with the 2400 baud modem owned by one of my coworkers is unusable in
dealing with 99% of current network technology. The people I am working with program
in COBOL and do their mailstream processing on an old mainframe using SPRI and BIM.
They sneakernet files from our NT network to the mainframe with 9track tape (at 1600
bytes per inch, oh wow). We have these 'baloney slicer' hard drives the size of a
refrigerator that carry a whole 100 megs. We even have an old PRIME. All of these
people have absolutely no conception of the change that is being wrought by the
internet. They look at it as a toy or a fad, yet while they are being outmoded by
technology, they are not being harmed in any way, outside of their future earnings
prospects.

The one area that I think will be rather violent will be the reaction of outmoded
individuals in positions of power to the threat of being replaced. They will use
force, and rather willingly, against what they will see as abominations.

In order to prevent any huge die off from combat between generations in conflict, it
will require the same sort of do gooder busybody attitude that I abhor and den Otter

Years ago I fantasized about a new type of series similar to outer limits but
that was trans and post-humanist.  The basic idea was that humanity had left
Earth omni-directionally in a great diaspora of thousands of ark ships ranging
in size from a few dozen people to tens of thousands.  Each episode would
freature the unique psychological, societal, experimental environs of one of
these ark ships.  Episodes would feature experiments with new money systems,
belief systems, biological and neuro-enhancements, radical brain change and
altered sates of conciousness, new relationship structure - polyfidelity,
polygamy, etc.

This type of series would be the perfect medium in which to push the boundaries
of "acceptable" television.  I still think its a good idea.  Anyone have any
Hollywood connections?

Lawyers and jurists have been struggling with this question for as long as
there is a record of law.  Among the most insightful discussions of causation
in law and ethics ever written is the decision of the great Benjamin Cardozo
in Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Co., 248 N.Y. 399, 162 N.E. 99 (1928).  The
Keystone Cops facts of that case served as the focus of Cardozo's unraveling
of the concepts of duty, breach, cause in fact, proximate cause and harm.
Among the brilliant observations to be found in Palsgraf:

	The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, 
	and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within 
	the range of apprehension.

	What we do mean by the word proximate' [in causation] is that, 
	because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of 
	justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events 
	beyond a certain point.  This is not logic.  It is practical politics.

Unfortunately, perhaps, the toughest application of these principles is to
situations in which the basic duty of one person to another is unclear or
subject to reasonable doubt.  It is not cause, per se, that concerns you,
Darren, but duty.

The answer lies not in conundrums of causation, but in an analysis of duty and
costs.  Every action has consequences, intended and unintended, foreseeable
and surprising, proximate and attenuated.  While I have a duty to not trespass
upon another, I also have a duty to protect myself from the unexpected, the
unintended and the attenuated results of others' actions.  This duty is the
price of life in society.  As it happens, in most instances protecting myself
from such things is far less expensive than protecting others from the
unlikely and distant results of my own actions.  Through reasonable caution,
insurance and other financial and social risk-shifting devices, I create a
buffer zone of protection around myself that makes life with others possible.

This is one of the toughest problems of a rational ethics that prizes
individual liberty.  On the one hand, one presumes that individual autonomy is
the bedrock of a rational ethics.  On the other, a paramount value on life
itself seems to be the sine qua non of any POSSIBILITY of sane moral action.
For myself, I cut this Gordian knot in favor of judging any suicide by a being
not experiencing intolerable pain with an organic cause as so irrational, so
inconsistent with any sane view of life itself, that such a person has lost at
least some of their rights to autonomy.  In this view, the truly self-
destructive person becomes, in a sense the adversary of his rational friends:
He may wish to kill himself, but that wish is in opposition to the judgment of
others that the would-be suicide be returned to a rational view of the
paramount value of life.  For those who care about the self-destructive
person, a duty arises to stop the suicide and to provide assistance to them,
EVEN IN THE FACE OF THAT PERSON'S EXPRESSED WISHES.  If the one who would do
away with himself desires that end strongly enough, they will simply accept
the opposition of their friends as a condition of "success" in their desire to
die.

This is not an entirely satisfactory solution to what is, at its essence, a
moral paradox.  Rather, it comes from "a rough sense of justice . . . This is
not logic.  It is practical politics."  The practical politics of friendship.

That would be quite amazing, considering that I watched The Outer

I think you are misrepresenting psychology here. Mainstream psychology
has no accepted definition of the "mainstream" or "normality" people
are supposed to conform to (many of the suggested definitions are very
wide, and it should be remembered that Freud even denied the existence
of normality), and most definitions of mental disorders have little to
do with comparisions to a normal state and are instead defined from a
classification of their symptoms (as revealed unto mankind in the holy
DSM-IV :-). 

The important question is of course when a state should be regarded as
a mental disorder or not. Modern psychology is aware of cultural
differences here (just look into any modern clinical psychiatry book),
but there are many states that are obviously undesirable even from the
perspective of the patient. A more general definition would be to say
that something is a mental disorder if it impairs a person's ability
to live a normal life - this is where the "normal" appears - but in
most cases this is a very basic "normal" like "able to interact with
other people, able to distinguish reality from imagination, will not
hurt himself". It can be abused, but usually it is fairly clear if
somebody can function or not. Where to draw the lines is widely
debated in psychiatry and psychology today, it is not a tacit
agreement.

As for this list, I haven't noticed much insanity here. Most
extropians seem to be able to do reality-testing, so they are not
delusional. The paranoia level seems fairly normal for the internet in
the 90's. No obvious mood disorders as far as I can see, quite the
opposite.

Doug Bailey offers, among his several cogent (if not ultimately convincing)
criticisms of matters Extropian:

I suppose that if anyone merits criticism for crowing over coining "Ex-"
words, I do, since I claim to have coined "Extropy" as we use the term.  (I
freely admit that others independently combined the same letters and applied
them to other subjects.)  Maybe other people would draw similar blame for
similar "Ex-" coinages.

But whatever the merits of *that* criticism, I'll wager that it does not
really hit the target at which Doug aims.  After all, people associated with
ExI just simply do not waste a lot of time dwelling on who thought up which
words.  They document coinages, to some degree, and set the issue aside.

I think that Doug really aims to criticize Extropians for not contributing any
*substance* to transhumanist thought; that is, for doing *nothing more* than
thinking up new words.  If that is the criticism, we have something
interesting to discuss.

My short response:  Extropians have in fact often credited FM-2030 and others
of their intellectual forebears, so I do not think they can credibly be blamed
for stealing others' thunder.  Furthermore, they have updated and fleshed out
themes only hinted at in earlier works, so I do not think it proper to blame
them for failing to add to the genre.  Also, I believe that on several fronts
Extropians have generated genuinely unique ideas (such developing a distinctly
libertarian flavor of transhumanism) or at a minimum been first to put
familiar ideas (such as spontaneous ordering) in a transhumanist context.

After making the original posting, I was able to dig up a little
information on the 'net based on what I could remember.  The information
available is really very scant.  I learned about this second-hand from my
father, so I didn't have a terrible lot to go on.

The company in question is the Haida Corporation, which has very large
timber holdings, as well as significant mining and energy holdings in the
Pacific Northwest.  They are also invested in numerous smaller businesses
including fishing and tourism.  They own a fleet of large cargo ships
(which I have seen in Washington and Alaska) and, from what I hear, have
annual revenues of several hundred million dollars.  From what my father
was telling me, they are a very influential and respected company in the
Pacific Northwest and are well-known for their business prowess.

The community is Hydaburg, composed almost exclusively of Haida Indians
(pop. ~2,000).  As is typical for these communities, only ~60% of the
population is employed, with ~20% unemployment.  It appears that this is in
fact some sort of tribal corporation.  

What *is* interesting is the business wisdom and general success of this
particular group.  I have lived on more than one Indian reservation and in
my experience, native Americans are usually not the sharpest business
people around.  However, in this case, the history of the Haida tribe is a
bit unusual.

Although currently a coastal tribe, they have only lived there for a couple
hundred years.  Apparently the Haida indians historically enjoyed
prosperity as an aggressive merchant tribe from what is now inland British
Columbia.  In the 18th century, they embarked on a series of conquests
along the Pacific coast in order to control important coastal resources.
Through deft political, military, and economic maneuvering they quickly
became one of the wealthiest tribes in the region (until the arrival, in
force, of Europeans).


What interested me was that I find the corporate government model to be
superior to traditional models in many ways.  While I am not sure whether
it would scale well to really large populations, the feedback mechanisms in
the corporate model are much quicker, more responsive, and generally better
lubricated than traditional models.  The improved feedback mechanisms
create a much more efficient organism, IMO.  Also, a government that
functions primarily as an economic entity is very unlikely to embark on any
actions for strictly political reasons if it would hurt its bottom line and
would almost never embark on any actions against its own shareholders.  A
corporation that got out of hand could be sold off or dissolved by the
shareholders with minimum difficulty.  Additionally, the prospect of
economic competition keeps the bureaucracy in check.

Ironically, it would appear that this would work best in an environment
were the corporation is not sovereign in and of its self i.e. there exists
a more powerful entity that exists to enforce the corporate structure.  Or
alternatively, a sovereign constitution could be written that essentially
embodies the corporate law structures.

I find the corporate government model interesting because it appears to be
a relatively effective model and it is one that hasn't been discussed in
great detail.  One aspect that should appeal to some on this list is that
allows you to, in many ways, set up your own virtual government/society
within an existing sovereign entity.  A corporation is to its shareholders
what a government is to its citizens.  When implemented like this, the
corporation replaces virtually all the roles of a traditional government,
but without many of the negative side effects.

Sorry. WTA=World Transhumanist Association. (It has been mentioned

The WTA web site is under construction and at present quite ugly, but

ok I'll bite:

Extropians List subscribers could be construed by mainstreamers to:
a) have social dysfunctions indicated by the fact they spend so much time
discussing strange topics on an internet mail list, therefore have
difficulty interacting with people in the 'real' world.
b) have a difficulty distinguishing their internet life from their real
lives (if they have real lives), and in fantasizing about htings like mind
uploading and a mythical transhuman singularity, nanotechnology and jupiter
brains, have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality.
c) in their wishes to upload their minds (which seems like it would be a
destructive process), support the right to suicide, promote the use of guns
for self defense, and have themselves frozen, they demonstrate a lack of
concern for their own safety and well being, and are likely to hurt
themselves.

So an active and dedicated extropian could be construed to be quite ill.

Thats my point. The members of this list are entirely TOO rational and
logical, as compared to the general population. That we can rationally
discuss such theoretical subjects as a transhuman singularity without (too
frequently) going off on almost theological trysts indicates that the
members of this list are not normal.

It is likely a new incarnation of the old series (I have seen some
re-runs of it). A bit like Mission: Impossible or Star Trek.

I wonder about the effects of series like this. They often have
anti-transhuman messages, but at the same time they spread the ideas
about cryonics, uploading etc, making them part of our culture. That
should not be ignored, the trick is to make sure they get the right
positive valence.

True, but setting up a perimeter around a city to sense excessive radition sources
is rather easy and low tech. Up to now there has not been a need, and of course
nobody will do anything about it till someone gets nuked.

High energy lasers are quite workable. SDI found this out rather early. What is
difficult in a large layered defense is not a defense against the occasional
terrorist attack but in the MAD type attack using thousands of warheads at once.
THis sort of attack requires the use of rather large computing and network
capabilities, that are on the verge of being commercially feasible. Contrary to the
media propaganda, SDI was a smashing success as a research program. The only reason
we don't have such a system in place right now is politicians and money, not
technology. As Ashton Martin of Physicians for Social Responsibility has
acknowledged, "The debate is not longer scientific." (this quote dates back to 1987)

Thus, for a distributed system, where rather than a few huge battlestations, every
community has a ground based system to protect against air attacks, with a radiation
sensor network to locate ground mobile warheads, this could be a rather robust
system for defense. Oh, and BTW, if you can track a nuke-in-a-truck with a sensor
network, then all it would take to disable the nuke is one of my handy dandy hand
held EMP guns to fry the controlling circuitry in the warhead. Voila, end of story.

Good try. And I have no doubt that some people would agree with you (I
have a friend (!) who distrusts *anything* I say since I'm obviously
"mad" because I discuss uploading and similar topics). But if you ask
any serious psychologist och clinical psychiatrist, they will at most
agree with a and b, and that is just a fairly benign personality
disorder (compared to what they usually deal with, it is). Of course,
if you go to a psychoterapist, he will immediately tell you that you
are ill and in need of help, but they say that to everybody (OK, I'm
not very fond of psychotherapy :-).

Quite. And who wants to be normal? Normal people are so boring! The
trick is to avoid being normal while retaining sanity.

THAT version of the Outer Limits was a rip off of The Twilight Zone. This version
was rehashed and brought back to TV when X-files demonstrated the marketability of
such a genre. (There was also a short lived rehashing of the Twilight Zone a few
years ago). IMHO, there's little worse in TV than to be the rehashing of one ripoff
show in order to rip off another show....

Several years ago, when I was debating this subject as a subset of a debate on the
usefulness of a mass transit system in Seattle (the debate was on the EICBBS, run
by Bonneville Power and the Washington State Energy Office), these gov't boobs
claimed that the government values your personal time (ie. any time you are not
working one of your 40 hours a week) as worth absolutely nothing. I was claiming
that since the mass transit system proposed would actually INCREASE the average
transit time by 15 minutes, that this was a negative net economic value. I also
used this to debate the merits of recycling, whether it was better for the
resident to sort his or her own trash, or have it done automatically by the
garbage company. These bozos just don't value your personal time as worth
anything. It was rather amazing that these supposedly intelligent people could
make such idiotic statements.

40 hours is the generally accepted mark at which most people start to draw the
line, as it then starts to become difficult to get the required amount of sleep,
feeding time, personal business, and quality family time beyond this point.
Personally, I don't mind working about 45 hours a week so long as the last 5 hours
are time and a half, but beyond that, expect to be paying me a lot more. My time
belongs to me, and the employer who thinks the can dictate beyond that point will
be preaching to an empty seat. You want any more of my time, expect to pay for it.
In this case, I have more stringent standards than the law. For people like us who
have no difficulty earning a living wage, it is not a big deal. The law is to
protect the marginal population from exploitation by sweatshops and farmers.

A somewhat extropian comic book out now is _Transmetropolitan_ (DC,
Helix label.)  It's focused on Spider Jerusalem, a journalist in The
City in the future, year intelligently avoided.  It has all the goodies
without a Singularity: cryonic revivals, body morphing (the first issues
deal with people with alien DNA), genetic engineering (two-headed,
cigarette smoking, fairly smart cat), intelligence enhancing drugs, a
President whose Secret Service are charging him privately, pervasive
networked computers, utility fogs.  The book has been called cyberpunk
but I don't think I've seen any of the classic cyberpunk elements;
people just don't know their SF.

First three issues are Spider returning to the City, and covering the
alien-DNA people.  I don't know how the aliens (Streiber style) got to
Earth, but apparently they're pretty poor; all they have to sell are
cultural artifacts and their own genes.  The Cat is found.

The seventh issue features people being 'downloaded' into 'foglets' --
what we could call being 'uploaded' into a 'utility fog'.  Except the
foglets might be the components, the people called foglet people.  I
think the verb switch may make sense, if it was chosen by the foglet
people, not the meat-people, who after all are dead once they've
uploaded.

The eighth issue deals with cryonics revivals, who all go into shock
upon seeing the City.  So there is a horizon Singularity in effect, but
no one's called it that.  All the current people regard things as
normal.

Violence is high by my standards, but low by most comics, I'd guess.
Writing and artwork seem good.  And it's fun having a trans-city as
background.

In one of those "heard through the grapevine" notes, the U.S. News

an article focusing on Ann Rand.  I'm thinking it may relate to the 
new movie currently in production about her (love) life 'The Passion 
of A. Rand', which seems to have renewed interest in her books.

Watchers of Extropian-transhumanist ideas in the general culture might want
to take a look at the current (March 1998) issue of Icon magazine. Icon
carries profiles of people, with this issue carrying a (rather
unattractive) picture of Michael Stipes on the cover.

If you look in the middle of the "o" in Icon on the cover you'll see the
quote:

   "It's not really that cool to be human, in my opinion."

If you turn to page 73, you'll find a three-page interview with me,
covering a variety of topics.

With any luck, this piece will introduce Extropian ideas to many who have
never encountered them before.

Also look out for the next issue of the UK-based .net magazine...

Onward!

What is the grand scheme of things?
No, don't tell me, it might ruin the suprise.

IM-less-than-HO, art is probably best looked at as the exploration of
communication (more message than medium.)  Transhuman and Extropian
artists are exploring ways to communicate their ideas.  If, as someone
commented, Nike means "I am utterly stupid and boring" then the
artists (and wearers) have found away of communicating that to you. 
Of course, I could be wrong, I've had bad experiences defining art in
the past.

Is it a bad thing that I have no clue who FM-2030 is?  Should I try

I never understand the whole Creativity vs. Science thing, surely the
act of science is creative and is an art form.  Taking a look at a
dictionary, art is described as "imitative or imaginative... in which
skill can be expressed."  It doesn't exclude science until, "certain
branches of learning as distinct from sciences" which kinda rains on
my parade.

No no, humour is a science, it takes years of study, testing and
research to implement even the smallest joke.  Have you ever seen the
victims of sarcasm gone wrong?

So here's the BIG question:

1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?

Pish.

I don't quite know why I was CC'd in on this discussion.  If I had to take a
guess, it would be because I have previously expressed similar, but not
identical, sentiments.

The "Extropians" have formed a distinct culture containing its own rules,
standards, art, terminology, and mailing list.  To the extent that this
culture professes idealistic and technophilic goals, promotes the public image
of AI, cryonics, and other frequently targeted technologies, provides
psychological support for those researchers who happen to be Extropians, and
encourages fresh blood to join the cause, Extropy can be viewed as a positive
affector to the Singularity and its subgoals.  Extropian art, Extropian
terminology, and discussions about such utterly useless subjects as sex and
fashion should be viewed as supporting Extropy itself, rather than Extropy's goals.

In other words, the causal structure is as follows:
{ culture      }                 [ P.R.         ]    { uploading   }
{ terminology  } TO "Extropy" TO [ recruiting   ] TO { Singularity }
[ mailing list ]    {culture}    { psy. support }    { nanotech    }
{ art          }                 [ forethought  ]    [ survival    ]

There are more efficient paths, especially if you're willing to dedicate your
entire life - which is why I am no longer subscribed to the mailing list.

Have a nice day.  By the way, I now own a "Singularity 2005" T-Shirt
[ T-Shirt ] TO [ conversations at cons ] TO [ psy. support ]
which, to the best of my knowledge, is the first of its kind.  Do I own a
priceless collector's item or an unoriginal followup?  Anybody know?

David Gelernter (Yale University computer science professor) has a new book
out and with it comes science and art.  The book is titled _Machine Beauty_
and brings to light Gelernter's views about science, art and the machine.   

"If the author [Gelernter] had his way, all computer scientists and software
engineers would be rushed off to crash courses in drawing, design, and art
history ...." (Jackson, "BusinessWeek" magazine, 3/2/98 issue.)

You can read "Wired" article about David Gelernter
http://www.wired.com/wired/5.02/lifestreams/index.html;

and also at http://www.townhall.com/pff/aspen96/gelernter.html:

"David Gelernter's research interests include parallel programming, software
ensembles, and artificial intelligence. The coordination language called
"Linda" that he developed with Nicholas Carriero (also of Yale) sees fairly
widespread use world-wide for parallel programming. Linda and its central
idea, called "tuple spaces", is the basis for the "JavaSpaces: extension to
Java recently outlined by JavaSoft; the goal of JavaSpaces is to "unify and
simplify," according to JavaSoft 's presentation at JavaOne -- Specifically
to unify object storage and inter-program communication, as in Linda.
Gelernter's current research interests include adaptive parallelism (the
"Piranha" system runs parallel programs by grabbing idle workstation cycles,
releasing machines when their owners need them), programming environments
for parallelism, realtime data fusion, and expert databases. He is co-author
of two textbooks (on programming languages and on parallel programming
methods), author of Mirror Worlds (Oxford: 1991) and a forthcoming book
about how thinking works (Free Press)."

<Metacomment, personal, to Wax; all others, please ignore: 
Wax, if I'm going to bother thinking about what you say, I'm going to have
to assume you're not just listening to yourself talk when you ask those
sorts of questions. Should I invest my time elsewhere?>

Well, science as humans practice it includes the active discovery of "real"
things not immediately evident. For "real", I use Dick's Definition: "what
doesn't go away when you stop believing in it". The active discovery part
can involve creativity in design, hypothesis and perhaps other things.

So my working model is, roughly: The way humans do science, there is art
involved. _But the art is not in the "scio" (~="knowledge")_. The art is
value added by the human practitioners. 

A dry collecting of facts, as by a weak-weak AI, possibly still having some
"activity" (e.g., "trying" things, but brute force) _might_ count as "doing
science". I consider the art content of such activity to be vanishingly small.

So mooshing art and science together appears to me to be of low utility.

Art, among its (not-science) distinguishing characteristics, appears to be
the way we humans create nonzero sum, win-win situations. While such
situations might be considered to exist outside the influence of humans,
new ones don't seem to crop up rapidly "in the wild". Science, so far as I
know, does not create these situations, although knowledge has power to
contribute value to them. Science is supposed to be value-free; art is
about nothing _but_ value. Thus engineering is art, and engineering a lab
setup is art, and (perhaps) making sense of the data is art.

But the data compiled in the CRC handbook, or even the Encyclopedia
Britannica, is not art, it's just (we hope) valid information. That has
value, of course, but it's a static pattern of value. Art is about dynamic
patterns of value.

Of course, that win-win vs value-free thingy could just mean that we are
all only  kidding ourselves about win-win; the scientific universe is
pretty much zero-sum. Alternately, it could be evidence for "As a Man
Thinketh". Or both at once.

Go figure.

It wouldn't matter what you did, at that distance nothing would be unscathed,  
not even atoms.

I think that's a big overstatement. It's true that in a vacuum you wouldn't  
get hit by a shock wave caused by the pressure of matter, but you would have 
to worry about the enormous shock from radiation pressure. We usually think 
of radiation pressure as being very weak, after all, we'd need a solar sail
miles across to slowly accelerate a small space ship, the feebleness is 
partly because the sun has a small angular size near the Earth but mostly 
because the of the sun is so cold, less than 10,000 degrees at the surface. 
When things get really hot the pressure becomes astronomical, literally 
astronomical, because just a small increase in temperature means a huge 
increase in radiation pressure, the two are related to the FOURTH power.

If you heat up a tin can to temperature T the Black Body radiation pressure  
inside the can is 1/3 [QT^4] , Q is the  radiation constant  
7.56591* 10^-15 erg cm-3 Kelvin -4 . If you heated up the can to 90,000,000  
degrees the radiation pressure inside the  can would be equal to the total 
pressure found at the center of the sun!   Yes your target wouldn't be 
completely enveloped and would only receive the radiation from one side, but 
on the other hand, an H bomb can produce temperatures well over 200,000,000 
degrees, and the shock would be further enhanced because the outer layer of 
the target would vaporize and rocket outward and because momentum is 
conserved the inner parts would rocket inward.

Incidentally, without radiation pressure an H bomb wouldn't work, the 
radiation from the fission trigger is the only way to compress deuterium 
enough to achieve fusion. You might think that photons of light couldn't 
evenly compress matter because of Rayleigh - Taylor instability, that's what 
would happen if you tried to support heavy mercury with a column of water, 
tiny tongs of mercury would force their way a small way into the water and 
then grow exponentially until the mercury had entirely fallen through the 
water. It's not at all obvious that the same thing wouldn't happen with light 
and matter, however detailed calculations by the military on the largest
super computers of their day showed that this instability does not happen, 
photons really can compress matter evenly. This fact was kept top secret for 
many years, and when it was finally revealed, after painstakingly piecing it 
together in the early 1980's from hundreds of unclassified documents and 
after several people nearly went to jail, astronomers found it very 
interesting.

The interior of the sun is at a chilly 14 million degrees so radiation 
pressure is not very important, the gas pressure is about 1700 times greater,  
the same is true for most stars but not all, it is vitally important in  
super giantstars, supernovas, the accretion cloud around Black Holes, and in 
the H bomb it's the entire ball game.  
                

       >What we should worry right now are not nukes nor nerve agents, but       
       >engineered bioweapons (mostly viruses, not bacteriological bioweapons). 
                  

That does worry me, another thing that worries me are the thousands of H bombs 
in the former USSR guarded by angry unhappy men who drink too much and make 
about a thousand dollars a year.

        Boy, haven't heard *that* one before. ;~)  It is interesting to
note how many people think of science and art as being polar opposites.
Truly, they are not at all opposite, but merely have slightly different
objectives.
So, to answer the age-old question (in my best way possible), I would say
that the objective of science is to create or discover new ways to increase
convenience and progress for society as a whole...as well as create or
discover answers to all the "how's" and "why's" society encounters during
its progression.  The objective of art is somewhat more individual
oriented, though I think it is safe to say that an artist's objective is to
convey his or her knowledge and ideas to society in the best (and often
only) way possible.
