So would you agree that my couch could be interpreted as having the same
structure as any given program P?  Perhaps even that the couch could be
interpreted as encoding the same structure as a snapshot of Einstein's
brain?  And that the reality and validity of this interpretation is as
strong as viewing Einstein's brain as encoding that same structure?

Are you drawing a distinction between an encoding of a single state,
versus an encoding of a sequence of states?  You can see the couch
encoding any given structure, but you can't see it encoding a specified
sequence of complex structures (say, the sequence that a programmed
computer or a brain goes through)?

Or is the issue here the fact that the sequence of structures are not
"causally connected"?  We can set up a mapping by which the couch goes
through a sequence of states with the same structure as a sequence of
states in Einstein's brain.  But perhaps we would say that the causal
relationship of these states is not the same, because *if* we had tweaked
some aspect of Einstein's brain state at a given moment, it would have
led to changes in the pattern of succeeding states.  But making the
corresponding change to the state of the couch would not have led to
the same kind of changes in the succeeding couch states.

Fraud *is* breach of contract.  That is, it is fundamental to any
contract (trade) that the contractors are truthful about the trade.

I am not so concerned about this "grey goo" problem.  It's sounds to me like Chicken
Little and some falling sky.

Mars can be terraformed.  The key to this will probably be Mars' lower gravity,
because gravity holds atmosphere to the planet.  Supposedly, there are ice caps at the
poles that can be used to generate oxygen.  The fertility of the soil for plant crops
is a question, nitrogen supplements might be necessary.  The ice caps can also be used
for carbon dioxide (CO2, the plant air) and fuel.

Yes, this is true, until they are totally self-sufficient, which will require social
infrastructure, id est culture, as well as all the survival necessities.  Anyways,
Earthlings will probably always be predisposed towards things from Earth and being on
Earth.

Inbreeding is dangerous as it leads to a predisposition towards exposing the
weaknesses of genetic structure and breeding unsurvivable chidren.  Also, there is no
way one woman can adequately raise all of the children necessary, and leaving
computers to do it (raise children) is a cold thing to do.

Body fat levels can be controlled.  Adequate real drug support can prevent space
sickness, placebos are placebos.  The ability to create a false gravity through the
rotation of structures will allow humans in space to maintain physical condition that
is acclimated to 1.0 x Earth gravity.  Mind over matter is mind over matter.

The ability to generate false gravity is not available to contemporary science at this
time.

These points are possibly goals of a real colonization project, but it can be said
that none of them require actual human interaction.  At the same time, establishing
eternal human presence on the next planet is obviously a goal of humanity and a
Darwinian advantage.

Terraforming Mars is something we might never see, but with perseverance, we might see
it begin, and by the time we are 140 years old, perhaps it will be done enough for us
to walk upon Mars unaided.

Now, I am back to talking about science fiction.  An author that I have admired since
reading is Piers Anthony, aka Piers Anthony.  His _Cluster_ series is excellent.  Also
of note is his fine book _Macroscope_.  I have read most of Anthony's works.
Anthony's fantasy and verbiage are excellent and rarely paralleled.

Heinlein illustrates how humanity might focus its warlike spirit outwards instead if
internally.  His "bug hunt" paradigm shows that humans are likely to group together
against any external (extra-terrestrial) threat.  I'm afraid that this illustrates a
certain martial propensity of mine, but that is because I was born into a martial
tradition, and I am proud of that.  Read _Citizen of the Galaxy_.

Asimov's books have several key themes.  One is the treatment of robotics and thus
artificial intelligence, AI.  Essentially, Asimov's Rules of Robotics mandate that
semi-sentient or sentient robots are to be completely ingrained towards protecting
human life.  Another fascinating story of Asimov is that of Foundation, I can not
speak for Foundation, but definitely recommend that one read _Foundation_ and its
followers.

Niven's Ringworld and acronyms are explained in better detail in his books.  The
Ringworld is unstable!  Eh heh.

Read some books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

The authors listed are in no particular order.

Pournelle and co-author, in a book called _Footfall_, illustrate aliens dropping
asteroids onto Earth.  We win, but I am not going to say much more about that.  Read.

L. Ron Hubbard, before his legacy was co-opted, wrote _Battlefield Earth_, a fine
novel.

Greg Bear, as I have mentioned, writes interesting books, I have read his _Eternity_.

Stephen King and Peter Straub's _The Talisman_ is not necessarily science fiction, but
a good book nonetheless.  The "Gunslinger" books are not bad.

Louis L'Amour wrote some fine spaghetti and other Westerns, also _The Lonesome Gods_,
which is his finest work, in my humble opinion.  It is about the desert, as is, to
some extent, Herbert's _Dune_ series.

Cyberpunk is cyberpunk.

Gordon Dickson's _Time Storm_ is excellent, a book such as _Love Not Human_ is also
good.

There are many science fiction authors and books.  In my opinion, most of it is not
worth reading because it is space opera or junk.  The books that are worth reading are
required.  I only wish I knew all the required books.

"Star Wars" was an excellent motion picture, I was five years old or so.  I watched
"Return of the Jedi" with my grandparents and little brother, and several times during
"Star Wars" marathons in college.  I have watched almost every episode of Star Trek
and Star Trek:TNG, but very few of the followers.

Now that science fiction has been elucidated to the extent that I am able, I will note
that I stopped reading science fiction.  Among the last fiction books I really read
were Tolkien's _Two Towers_ (multiple times), and then Alan Dean Foster's _A Call To
Arms_.  I have read many books multiple times.

A wonderful author is Lewis Carroll, aka Charles L. Dodgson, for his mathematical
riddles and symbolism.  Finally, for this note, read the Riverworld series by Philip
José Farmer.

Enjoy!

If computational uncertainty is covered under probability theory, maybe it
can shed some light on the Self-Indication Axiom (SIA). Suppose you are in
a universe with either 1 or 10 people, depending on whether the 100!-th
digit of PI is odd or even. (There is a machine that computes the digit
and then creates either 1 or 10 people.) Should you believe that the
100!-th digit of PI is more likely to be even than odd? This is similar to
the thought experiment in your DA paper where a machine creates 1 or 10
people depending on the outcome of a coin flip, but without the problem of
dealing with what it means for the coin flip to be "fair".

I wonder if we could use Earth Day to promote our views of saving the
planet (using "ultratechnology" to end pollution and remove the harm
we've done to the planet).  Every year on Earth day we hear the Statist
mantra of mandatory volunteerism (slavery) and the Left plays it up as a
big guilt trip.

Since we're all Practical Optimists perhaps we can put a positive spin
on the whole Evironmental thing.  Maybe we could get good press out of
it.

Comments?

Another thing - does anyone ever put out Extropian press releases?  Do
we have enough of a stand to issue statements?  Should we?  Or would any
attempt to release a statement be mired in continuous argument?

It would be interesting to look at current events (Yugoslavia,
China-gate, etc.) through the Extropian Principals - How does bombing
Yugoslavia fit in with Practical Optimism or Rational Thinking?

Maybe we could release a subset of various Extropian views... 

Couldn't we use some press?

Yawn. You should really study some history before making stupid claims. At
that time people owned weapons including cannon and *warships*. Why didn't
they ban private possession of those weapons if they'd be so scared of a
wimpy little assault rifle? Possibly because they always intended that the
second amendment covered an individual right to own military weapons so 
that state militias would be able to defend against any kind of attack
without a standing army?

Rockets, BTW, were invented by the Chinese many centuries ago, and most
certainly did exist back then. Why doesn't the second amendment say 'the
right to keep and bear arms -- except rockets -- shall not be infringed'?

Actually, the Constitution explicitly presumes that private citizens will
own naval warships (see: Letters of Marquee and Reprisal), which were the
most expensive and specialized weapons of the day.  As I understand it,
their main reason for favoring private weapon ownership was as a defense
against tyrannical government, which obviously requires private access to
just about anything.

Of course, today there is a real question as to whether an armed citizenry
is really a significant barrier to oppression, but that's a different
argument.

So, more precisely, it must be able to support humans until they
can upload or otherwise become less vulnerable. This is far from
indefinitely. But, if a colony can suport itself for several decades,
I think it's safe to assume that it can also support itself for much longer
periods of time (or "indefinitely"). Especially if you start terraforming
Mars (perhaps using nanotech or comets etc).

So what you need is a working (nano) replicator, some basic 
assembly programs (for the most important replacement parts),
programming equipment and some flexible, all-round experts to
design new programs. Perhaps it would even be feasible without
nanotech, but as fairly advanced (see below) nanotech would
most likely already exist, this can be ignored for now.

If we assume that gray goo (or some more other form like black 
goo, which is IMO a more serious problem) is the problem which ultimately
forces us to migrate, it follows that we have at least goo-level nanotech.
This means fairly advanced, autonomous replicators which are sturdy
enough to function in the "real world", not just in vitro. These nanites
(perhaps minus the self-replicating feature, for safety reasons) should 
as least be capable of mining Mars for various materials and water, 
construction of simple structures and life support functions like
oxygen production (perhaps even help to terraform the planet). 
Computer-controlled in vitro nanites could presumably do more 
complicated tasks like fabrication of machine parts or whole new 
machines, for example. Various useful programs (for the replicators)
could no doubt be brought from earth, so that you wouldn't be
starting from scratch.

Yes, but even if we assume that this will take a lot of human work,
it is typically something which can be done by small teams of
experts or even individuals within acceptable time limits (months
perhaps). A Mars base is as good a place to design replicator
programs as any.

I think the goo-level nanites could handle this just fine, certainly
with the help of tele-operated vehicles and human intelligence
to deploy then in the most promising areas.

Ok, say some 100.000 - 200.000 people? Let's assume that this were
the case, perhaps a viable setup might be to start asap with a small,
(mostly automated) commercial Moon base, use that to mine materials
and produce components for a "space wheel (-esque)" colony capable of supporting the
above mentioned number of people. The wheel could then 
set out for Mars where it would be put into a stable orbit, while some of its
inhabitants would go down and start mostly self-supporting settlements. 
Could this approach deliver results within approx. 30 years on a "realistic"
budget?

Yes, and you don't even need a 100% closed system, as you can
obtain your oxygen etc. locally (i.e. a hybrid system). That's why 
the failure of Biosphere isn't a big deal: you *can* compensate for 
the (initial) ineffinciencies of biological life support (most likely algae, 
some 8 square ft per person to reach equilibrum, if I remember 
correctly. These are old NASA results, we could probably do better 
than that). If Biosphere has tought as anything, it is that one should 
be minimalistic; use only the most efficient and easy to maintain 
plants, and don't try to create "natural ecosystems". Not for life 
support, anyway. Also there's obviously the "concrete" issue and the 
fact that you must always have means to supply the system externally, 
up to 100% for at least several weeks.

Greenhouse components should be fairly easy to make with 
even primitive (nano)replicators, or a fairly limited amount of
today's industrial machines (and a considerable number of
prefabs could be brought along). Neither this nor life support 
in general are serious problems, IMO. The really important
issue is whether a relatively small, isolated group can bootstrap 
itself towards a Singularity. With some form of moderately
advanced nanotech, I think it can.

You say that like it's a bad thing...oh, wait, we've had
that argument already, too.  :)

I might add that a post asking such a basic question is
itself evidence that perhaps some of the resources for
people to find out these things are not as easy to find,
easy to use, or clear as they could be.  I haven't looked
at the ExI site lately, but maybe I could take a peek and
make some suggestions for organization.

My "$1 million apeice" figure was based on the assumption of a massive
program aimed at shipping large numbers of people.  Such a program would
require a high volume of big launches, which combined with the
mass-production opportunities would make things a lot cheaper.  Even then,
it is a bit on the optimistic side.

Your figure looks pretty reasonable to me for the kind of mission you are
talking about.  However, talking about per-person costs is misleading in
this case.  Since almost all of the mass we ship is going to be equipment
and supplies, cost per pound would probably be a better way of measuring
things.

By that yardstick, I'm thinking an initial exploratory mission is going to
cost several million dollars per pound delivered to the Martian surface.  A
small colony like your proposal, with a regular launch schedule and
standardized hardware, should bring that down to a few hundred thousand per
pound.  A really aggressive program, with dozens of launches per year and
lots of SSTO technology, might get that down to tens of thousands if we are
lucky.

What do you thing of these numbers?

> So, Billy, how small can we make that human payload?

Even given your scenario, I don't think that is the limiting factor.  If
this colony is actually going to work as insurance against ultratech
disasters, it needs to be fully self-sufficient by the time nanotech gets
off the ground.  That means that sometime between now and then we have to
ship a few million tons of people, equipment and supplies (mostly
equipment).  Obviously, that isn't going to happen.

I think you are right to think that we can reduce this problem a bit by
starting with a very small colony and having them raise children to expand
their population.  However, in this scenario the mass of the colonists will
end up being a tiny fraction of the total mass we have to ship.  As the
colony expands we will still have to ship most of the equipment that the
fast approach would have required.  The colony will need all kinds of
mining, manufacturing and construction equipment just to get a basic machine
shop-type abilities.  Then we'll have to ship more hardware to get other
basic industries going - and there are a lot of basic industries they have
to have before they reach the point of being able to make a significant
fraction of their own equipment.

So, I think the real question should be: how small can we make the hardware
payload?

I've noted a number of people have been frustrated at the number of 'duh'
questions being asked on the list. I have no trouble at all answering someone's
question if they can't find the answer in the material freely available, I
do it
all the time, but IMHO the rudeness is on the person asking a standard
question.
Refusing to take advantage of the hard work that others have done already to
help them is rude and inconsiderate, it makes people who have contributed feel
like they have wasted their time. It also wastes the time of people who answer
the same question time and time again. I like being helpful, but being asked
three or more times about the same thing can get annoying.

I work in tech support and documentation at a software company, and I can say
that 3/4 of the questions people ask are ones that are either answered from a
key command help screen directly accessed from the part of the software they
dont' understand (and they are trained to know that this exists and how to use
it), or the answers are in the manuals provided in hard copy and from the
website. This is why tech support at software companies is not longer free for
most popular applications, cause people abuse it with stupid questions (or your
could say "There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.", but that
definitely would be rude). ;)

Well, yesterday was the big day. 100% of government mission-critical systems
were going to be compliant with nine months for testing to ensure they really
were... 

The good news is that 92% of mission-critical systems were claimed to be
compliant.

The bad news is that the way they got 92% of the critical systems compliant 
was to redefine more than 1/3 of the mission-critical systems as no longer
critical.

Y2K is just business as usual down government way...

Enforcing an anti-fraud law is orders of magnitude cheaper than not having
one.  If you have such a law, you only have to expend effort in the rare
cases where someone violates it.  If you don't, virtually every commercial
transaction in the entire economy requires reputation checks on both the
buyer and seller.

Besides, it is a moot question.  Under most circumstances it simply is not
possible to check the reputation of the people you are dealing with.
Information technology is not yet good enough to change this, and it is not
at all clear that bad-reputation databases would work anyway (after all,
providing *them* with false information would also be legal in your model).

Also, historical experience seems to suggest that in societies that do not
prohibit fraud, it can drive honest business practices out of the market.
If fraud is legal, the optimum business strategy is to be honest with your
repeat customers and cheat everyone else.  It is very easy for fraud to
become a normal, expected business practice, which would render
reputation-based enforcement useless.

Actually, I would say that both breach of contract and fraud should be civil
offenses.

Unfortunately, it simply doesn't work that way in the real world.  In a
small town, where everyone knows each other, this kind of approach can work.
In a cosmopolitan setting no one is ever going to make the effort to learn
much about your reputation - it would not make sense for them to do so,
because the effort required is too large.  A libeler who makes false claims
is taking very little risk, because the vast majority of those who hear the
statement will neither know nor care who the source is.  Since most of them
know absolutely nothing about the target except for the libeler's claim,
they will also give that claim far more weight than it deserves.  Finally,
there is no way to retract such a statement - most of those who hear it will
never hear anything else about the issue, even if it is resolved in a public
forum.

Nevertheless, as I said before, I don't see any way to make a libel law that
would reliably do more good than harm.

I just skimmed through the discussion surrounding Michael Lorrey's comments
to Julian Leviston, and I have to say I think they were right on target (no
gun control pun intended).  When questions that can be answered by a
reasonably intelligent 12 year old are asked again and again it becomes
necessary to refer that person elsewhere.  If you look at this weeks posts
you will find he has gone above and beyond the call of duty to answer what
are some very basic questions.  We must have some standards for reasonable
discussion, and I don't think elementary science questions make the grade.

Almost.  It could be interpreted as containing any given program - but what
you actually get is endless reams of random noise, with an occasional
working program produced by chance.  To create an exact equivalence between
your couch and one particular program, you would have to use that program's
code as your encoding scheme.  In that case it would be more proper to say
that the encoding scheme is equivalent to the program, and your couch is
irrelevant.

No.  The effect you refer to relies on having such a vast amount of random
data that the pattern you are looking for will occur somewhere just by
chance.  A couch has nowhere near enough states for this to work with
something as complex as the brain.  Actually, because of the combinatorial
explosion involved, I'm not sure there is enough matter in the universe for
such an equivalence to occur by chance.

>  And that the reality and validity of this interpretation is as
> strong as viewing Einstein's brain as encoding that same structure?

No.  It is equivalent to a tape backup of an uploaded version of Einstein -
which brings up the whole identity problem again.  That aside, however, I
would say that there is an important difference between a computer that is
running some arbitrary program, and a snapshot of the contents of that
computer's memory at some instant.  The snapshot does not contain all of the
information in the original system, and it is not capable of displaying the
same behaviors.

A sequence of states is just a series of snapshots.  What you are lacking is
the process that created the changes between those states.

Well, no we can't.  That is the problem.  If we choose a scheme for mapping,
say, thermal vibrations to neuron states, we might scan your couch and find
an area where that is equivalent to the states in someone's brain at the
same instant.  However, if we scan the same area a millisecond later there
will be no trace of that pattern.  No matter how many times we repeat the
experiment, we will never find anything but a momentary snapshot.

If you want to say that the two systems are equivalent, you have to be able
to show that they display equivalent behaviors over time.  Since the couch
does not in fact think, or do any other kind of computation, no static
coding scheme will be able to produce an equivalence.

Yes.  Exactly.

You've never actually tried to sell the idea of

that's another thing entirely).  I can understand

OK, this week is going to be "psychopharmacology week". I have piles
of cognition enhancing papers:

Low blood sugar isn't a problem
Yet another memory enhancer: pBC264
Yet another memory enhancer: water
Attention enhancers: AF102B and THA
Reducing distractability with ABT-418, ABT-089 and (-)-nicotine
Smell enhancer: SKF 38393 
Vitamin D3 makes you happy
A new take on Algernon

The effects of food deprivation and incentive motivation on blood
glucose levels and cognitive function
Michael W. Green, Nicola A. Elliman and Peter J. Rogers
Psychopharmacology, 134 88--94, 1997

OK, glucose can improve memory. But what happens when blood glucose
drops, does performance drop too? In severe cases it is obvious, but
are mild food deprivation like missing a meal relevant for us who want
to optimize our abilities? The authors tested the combinations of
food/food deprivation (a missed meal) and more or less incentive (by
getting a reward for being among the three best) on a test battery for
memory, attention, reaction speed, mood etc.  It turned out that
despite lower blood sugar levels in the participants who got no food,
they did not perform worse on cognitive tests (they apparently moved
slightly more slowly on a finger tapping test, which might be a more
physical effects). Incentives on the other hand enhanced reaction
time, but not memory. So the moral seems to be: keep the blood glucose
levels up, but don't worry about them too much. And money isn't
everything, it just improves reaction time.


Cognitive enhancing effects in young and old rats of pBC_{264}, a
selective CCK_{B} receptor agonist
K. Taghzouti, I. Lena, F Dellu, B.P. Roques, V. Dauge and H. Simon
Psychopharmacology 143: 141--149 1999

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a signal substance that is used here and
there in the central nervous system; it is relatively little explored,
but is known to be involved in anxiety and possibly memory. It seems
that different receptors may even have opposite effects. The authors
did a freeform test of recognition memory for rats treated with pBC264
(which binds to the B receptor): they were given a simple maze to
explore, and after 6 hours they were returned to it but now an extra
passage had opened. The time they spent exploring the new passage was
compared to control rats, who don't seem to remember that this is
something new. Rats who were given pBC264 either immediately after the
first episode or 30 minutes before returning to the maze explored it
significantly more often (rats who got the drug before the first
encounter with the maze did not remember better). This held both for
young and old rats. It seems that the drug improves retrieval, but it
could be a more complex effect. Overall, the CCK effects on memory are
a bit unclear, but here is yet another group of potential cognition
enhancer.


Water enhances memory performance 
Andrew P. Rawlins, Isaac L.F Oscarsson and Olga Lintzer
Psychopharmacology 144: 23-30 1999

It was almost to be expected, given that just about everything seems
to enhance memory. The authors did a double-blind study on the effects
of water on a wide range of psychological tests given to 412 medical
students. The results suggest that water at least enhances short-term
memory, memory retrieval and memory encoding for verbal material. It
did not improve reaction time, mood or attention. This of course means
a lot of studies have to be re-evaluated since the "control" groups
given water or saline solutions were actually not control groups but
also drugged. The authors suggest that the way water affects the brain
is by affecting the balance of ions in the cells; by diluting them
somewhat the dynamics of the neurons could change and this would among
other things enhance memory. Weird. 


Divided attention-enhancing effects of AF102B and THA in aging monkeys
J.O O'Neill, I.J Fitten, D.W. Siembieda, K.C. Crawford, E. Halgren, A. Fisher, D. Refai
Psychopharmacology 143: 123-130 1999

My favorite neuromodulator, acetylcholine, is not just involved in
memory but also attention. Since there is a great deal of interest in
cholinergic drugs to help dementia, the authors compared two drugs on
old and young monkeys who were given a divided attention task. The
first drug, AF102B imitates the effect of acetylcholine, while THA
inhibits cholinestrase (and hence increase the level). It turned out
that both drugs worked both in old and young monkeys (performance
increase 34% (THA) and 43% (AF102B)) without any side effects. It was
a fairly small study, so more research is needed, but cholinergic
drugs look promising.


Central nicotinic receptor agonists ABT-418, ABT-089 and (-)-nicotine
reduce distractibility in adult monkeys
Mark A. Prendergast, William J. Jackson, Alvin V. Terry Jr., Michael
W. Decker, Stephen P. Arnetic and Jerry J. Buccafusco
Psychopharmacology 136: 50--58 1998

Attention isn't just the ability to focus resources on something, it
is also the ability to ignore distractions. Can this be enhanced? The
authors tested three drugs on monkeys doing a standard short-term
memory test (DMTS) who were distracted by flashing lights. It turned
out that all three drugs helped, (-)-nicotine just a bit and the other
two significantly (7.5-25% better performance). Further, on
non-distracted trials the ABTs also increased performance.  By the
way, ABT-418 has earlier been shown to improve memory. Seems to be a
nice combination, especially since at least ABT-418 has less side
effects than nicotine.


SKF 38393 enhances odor detection performance
Richard L. Doty, Cheng Li, Ritu Bagla, William Huang, Cheryl Pfeiffer and 
Gary M. Broscic
Psychopharmacology 136, 75--82 1998

After we have enhanced memory and attention maybe it is time for the
senses. Dopamine seems to be involved in smell (which fits in with the
essay in _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat_ by Oliver Sachs
about the man who experienced smells in an almost doglike way - that
man had taken a dopaminergic drug). This paper studies how a D1
dopamine agonist affects the ability to detect odors in rats. It turns
out to enhance their ability to detect various odors, and that a D2
agonist decreases the effect. This is fun, since it implies that the
two receptors have diametrally different effects. At the same time it
is not clear how much is direct enhancement and how much is due to the
stimulant effects, but it looks like a promising field to look into.


Vitamin D_3 enhances mood in healthy dubjects during winter
Allen T.G. Lansdowne and Stephen C. Provost
Psychopharmacology 135 319--323 1998

Mood changes over the seasons, and it has been suggested that beside
melatonin effects vitamin D3 (which is produced in the skin when in
sunlight) might be involved. A number of volunteers were given 400 IU,
800 IU or no D3 for 5 days in late winter in a double-blind study. The
vitaminated people reported more positive and slightly lowered
negative affect. Good to know for our Australian friends now when they
get the axial tilt against them.

Sure. But is memetics elementary science? I'm not so sure, it is a
concept that right now is not very widely known (but infecting people
at a rising rate :-). 

As others have noticed, what we might need is a better FAQ system. Or
maybe a transhumanist encyclopedia.

Yes you can do this, but I don't see how it helps decide whether the 
SIA is true. (For other people following this thread: The 
Self-Indication Axiom states roughly that upon finding that you 
exist, you should increase your probability for hypotheses according 
to which many people exist. (There would be "more slots for you to be 
born into" if there were more persons.)  It can be shown that 
adopting the SIA leads to the exact cancellation of the probability 
shift required by the DA. This would seem the main reason to adopt 
the SIA. However, there are big problems with the SIA which seem to 
make it ultimately unacceptable.)

I think this is the idea behind David Chalmer's recent definition of 
what it means for something to be an implementation of a program (or 
computation). The causal structure of the implementation has to match 
the structure of the program. I don't have his book handy at the 
moment however.

Another example we may consider: Suppose we have a computer running 
an upload for 10 seconds. Suppose we computer has discrete time. Then 
we could in principle construct one computer (or one RAM chip) for 
each time step of the simulation; and we could load each of these RAM 
with the data that the RAM in the original computer had at the 
corresponding time. We can place all these RAM chips in one long row. 
In some sense, we then have what looks like the same structure 
instanciated in two places in spacetime -- once as a spatiotemporal 
process, and once as a spatial pattern. We presumably want to say 
that only the former gives rise to a consciousness. And the relevant 
difference seems to be that in the case of the process, the various 
states are causally connected, whereas with the spatial pattern that 
is not so.

I should read Chalmers' book.  I've been hoping to cheat and get it from
the library, but it's on the reserved book list for some course.

In Greg Egan's novel Diaspora there is a race which apparently does
choose to live via spatial sequencing similar to what you describe.
They build a different instance of the computer they live in for each
time step of the simulation.  Each instance is a solid block and has
no ability to change state.  Luckily they have parallel dimensions or
something to work with, so that it doesn't really take up that much room.
You'd think it would be slow, but apparently they don't care.

Egan seems to invite us to consider this spatial sequencing to be as
effective as temporal sequencing in terms of creating consciousness.

Of course, the spatial sequencing is by its nature temporal as well,
since they can't build the nth computer until they've finished with
the n-1th one.  This might give an "out" for those who want to see
consciousness as intrinsically having a temporal dimension.  They might
say that there was a "wavefront" of consciousness whose "now" was the
moment of the construction of each new block of matter.  The fact that
the old blocks of matter are left behind is, um, immaterial (yuk, yuk).

Questions about memetics or any other topic that hasn't been mainstreamed
yet don't annoy me, but those about the basic properties of gasses (~7th
grade Science in the U.S.), the expansion of the Universe, the Big Bang
Theory, and the concept of a scientific theory itself (~ 9th grade Science)
do.  All this information is also freely available on the web in numerous
places.  I taught high school science for a year and some of the questions
being asked are beneath the level of what my students knew before I got a
hold of them.

I wholeheartedly agree that newbies do need a set of resources from which to
glean information.  I used Anders' as well as others sites as a primary
resource some 5 years ago when I first became aware of Extropy.  Maybe it is
time for a revamping and reorganization of the collected knowledge (and I
would love to see the brilliant minds here work together on a project).  I'm
working on a site in my own field (life extension) and will make it
available as soon as it is presentable.

My mistake - I was referring to the type of rockets whose use was pioneered by the Nazis in their bombardment of London, and which now can carry nukes trans-globally, and, mistakenly it appears, depending upon the intelligence of my interlocuters to infer this from their pairing with nukes in the phrase "rockets and nukes."

I was always taught that in order for something to be a lie three conditions
must be met...
a) the statement must be untrue
b) the purpose of the statement is to deceive
c) the person it is told to is entitled to the truth
In the case of the Jews/SS an argument could be made for the fact that the SS
were simply not entitled to that information. Therefore the statement could be
considered as something else than unethical lying...

Using the 100!-th digit of PI in the thought experiment instead of the
coin flip makes it more obvious, at least to my intuition, that SIA is
true. I do think SIA should be modified to avoid the problem of infinity
(where one concludes that with probability one the universe contains an
infinite number of observers), as follows:

The fact that I am an observer gives me some reason to believe that the
total measure of observer-instants is large.

The "total measure of observer-instants" can be thought of as the fraction
of the universe (the entire history of the universe, not just its current
state) that consist of observers.

Are you refering to _The Conscious Mind : In Search of a Fundamental
Theory_? I haven't read the book yet but would like to know if it is the
one I should get. How does he define "causal structure"?

I don't think we can really be sure that the latter doesn't give rise to
consciousness. I actually believe that even one RAM chip in isolation (ie
not necessarily in a spatial pattern with the other RAM chips) can give
rise to a conscious experience, that the internal spatial pattern of the
bits in the RAM chip is sufficient.

	NEW JOURNAL - CALL FOR PAPERS


Title of the Journal :

        JOURNAL OF APPLIED SYSTEMS STUDIES
Methodologies and Applications for Systems Approaches
		[ JASS ]


AIMS AND SCOPE

The mission of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" is on the
development of methodologies based on the laws and rules of various
sciences. New designs and functional methodologies are composed for
applications in business, operational and social, as well as biological
phenomena. The objectives of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" are
to widespread the science of systems and present the research and
application results of its domain. As the science rapidly changes and
grows, resources and time become more precious, "Journal of Applied Systems
Studies" provides the very best information and analysis to keep up to date
with the latest developments and approaches to other scientific domains,
through the application of systems approaches upon them. 

The "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" aims to:
· To provide a forum for the exchange of experiences and information of
studying the systems and the methodologies, tools and products used to
design, measure and achieve it.
· To promote awareness of the crucial role of systems studies in the
effective construction of the information systems developed, used, and/or
maintained by organizations in pursuit of their business objectives.
· To provide a vehicle for the publication of academic papers related to
all aspects of soft and hard system approaches.

The "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" addresses all aspects of systemic
analysis from both a practical and an academic viewpoint. It invites
contributions from practitioners and academics, as well as national and
international policy, standard making bodies, and sets out to be the
definitive international reference source for such information.

The readership of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" consists of
academics, systems managers, computer scientists, information scientists,
and researchers in applied system theory, as well as those involved in
management, operations and political science in different scientific

The concept of memes was taught in my sixth grade class when we were learning
about sociology. The class had kids of all ability levels as well. That was
1980.

Yes, I'm thinking we should set up a more responsive knowledge base that can
pull from a number of existing resources. I will also repeat my call for  at
least a few online courses on transhumanist studies that can be distributed with
many of the online education programs available already.

Gee, usually the armed citizenry is doing real well. Look at any warlord.

Maybe the Kosovo situation would help us find out--someday--if someone
armed and trained the Armenian Kosovars and they got their tactical act
together. Nah, who'm I kidding?

Besides, the Armenian Kosovars are in the majority; why don't they simply
_vote_ peace into existence?

</sarcasm_off>

>Of course, today there is a real question as to whether an armed citizenry
>is really a significant barrier to oppression, but that's a different
>argument.

Part of the answer appears to be, "it depends." A _sufficiently_ armed
citizenry would be. The problem is, few people around here trust their
neighbors to handle the sufficient arms, but they do trust people they''ve
never met. So it's self-fulfilling; or is that self-deluding? And maybe
they're right; or maybe the only thing that keeps the machine from flying
apart is the 5 Weight Oil of Good Times--complacency.

Another part of the answer appears to be "--Barrier? I see no barrier!" A
deterrent is only a deterrent if it's credible--_vide_ Dr. Strangelove's
interrogation of the Soviet Ambassador. Capability _and_ intent. And a
certain amount of imperfect information. 

MMB, remembering the Scout motto even if it isn't popular when the Dow is
at 10k

Hardly. Quite the opposite in fact, since Storekeeper Joe would have his own tank, mortar and machine gun emplacements if he so chose to, or he had an insurance policy with a security agency which did so. People are the most polite and respectful of
property when there are arms present. This is vouched for the high levels of property crime in europe and us cities compared to rural areas.

Wouldja like everyone to own a personal battery of THOSE, O Rabid One?

How about a battery of cannon that have a range of 3 miles? That was the maximum range of the largest shore guns available at that point in time, which is why international waters did not begin until the 3 mile point from shore.

There were a number of primitive chemical and biological weapons available at the time, but were not used by honorable gentlemen.

Prior to the revolution, one privateer with a ship or two could hold an entire port hostage and shell it to ruins.

That is the definition of libel, not of lying.

Their autonomy got stripped by Milosevic back in 1989. The Kosovar Liberation
Army was trying to defend their declaration of secession, but they have been
hamstrung by the one sided arms embargo that the Russians only pay lip service
to.

While many make at least a half hearted attempt to be prepared, most are
insufficiently prepared, and are relying on their own self delusion.

Depends on the intensity of the level of conflict. I have recently come the the
conclusion that somewhere between 20%-40% of all firearms privately owned in the
US are usable as infantry weapons. Most of the rest are for personal defense
use. Only 10 percent are exclusively usable for hunting. 60% of households own
at least one firearm here, compared to less than 5-10% in large cities. The
disparity in the crime stats I think is indicative of the deterrent effect.

OK, now I understand how I could have made it cleared up front
what I had in mind.  My minimalist approach, with the single tiny
woman and the dewar of embryos assumes no other humans cross
the interplanetary gulf, at least not until we have nanotech and/or
biosuspension (which would make the whole task much easier).

The minimalist approach requires no technology that we dont already
have.  The lander module I have in mind would be very small, too
small in fact for...us.  It would be just sufficient to sustain a little bit
of human life, until the machines could build farm and hab modules
for the generations that would follow, all born right there on the red planet.

Now, even that approach would require some cutting edge engineering:
software for the machines so that they could operate semi-autonomously,
for instance.  The sole advantage to the minimalist approach is cost.
But the sacrifice required on the part of the colonist is profound, I
must admit.

For a while I toyed with the idea of offering the job to a condemned
criminal who would otherwise be executed.  However, I realized this
approach would not work: there are not many women who are on
death row, and I doubt a suitable candidate could be found among
that limited pool.  I do not wish to restart the capital punishment virus
here.  Please.

So again, I am back to: how small could the mission be scaled?  spike

Just as <gonads>y as your idea, but basically all about China

Why should I when it is impossible for a non-celebrity to make it as a third party candidate. The two parties have written the rules for the electoral system, which slant the field in their direction. The 'campaign finance reform' issue is nothing but a continual tug of war between which party gains more from the existing system. It is not intended to allow private citizens to be able to run for office. I am on the board of directors of my local fish and game association, and that is about as political as I would like to get.

Actually the preamble of the Consitution implies the same thing.

satisfaction with the status quo only leads to more of the same.

> The means by which it accomplishes this is the interplay between the popular vote and the constitution.  The moment you have a multiplicity of people living in close proximity whose freedoms may conflict, and it is wished that all shall enjoy all freedoms which do not interfere with the exercise of the same freedoms by others (and where freedoms collide, the conflict should be resolved by equal and proportional compromise), it is necessary to have a document which codifies these freedoms and their order of precedence, and which prevents a majoritarian tyranny from usurping minority rights; this requires a constitution.  The general language of this document must be interpreted to apply to particular cases; this requires a judiciary.

The judiciary is to defend the standards that are set in the constitution, not to twist, bend, and hallucinate new meanings from the words, or to decide which words it is ok to ignore.

Except when the executive is the one doing the trampeling. Who watches the watchers?

My big peeve with the problems in the system now is that the founding fathers had definite ideas about what the words in the Constitution meant (we can see it is so in much of their other writings), but they did not include a glossary in the document, because they were shortsighted and had no idea that the meanings of the words could change so drastically, because society was so stable then that the meanings of words had not changed since before Shakespeare.

They also did not understand the concepts of disinformation, newspeak, and doubletalk and how they could be used to undermine the Constitution.

I have been asked to run for county commission and have declined, so I'm a bit of a hypocrite on this issue, but I was able to found a citizen's pressure group which, with the help of a demographic study which I designed, made a strong case for paving 18 miles of rural clay roads in my home county.  When we were nevertheless spurned, I wrote a letter to the local paper detailing how our voter-approved Gas Tax (which was supposed to pave roads) wes being diverted to road maintainence, a General Funds expense, which allowed those General Funds which would have gone towards maintainence to be spent on other things - a roundabout funnel for diverting Gas Tax funds to inappropriate projects.  Four of the five County Commissioners were defeated for re-election, and their replacements paved the roads, at a cost of 2.4 million (and all funds diversions stopped).  From the inside, politics is a slimy business, but we have only ourselves to blame if good people can't be persuaded to run!
 and we are left with choices between different grades of pond scum by default.  BTW, This is how state governments skim lottery funds from education, by using them instead of, rather than in addition to, previously allocated levels of funds, and the trick the federal government played with Social Security.

I notice that you didn't suggest a better Y; I therefore conclude that you have no alternatives superior to the six bedrocks of our present governmental form: the tripartate separation of powers (leg., exec., jud.,), a constitution, free popular elections, and unenumerated poweers devolving and decentralizing by default to states and localities.

The fact that he was a professional wrestler - perhaps the only class outside of used car dealer less trusted in the US than politicians (in fact people enjoy the fake soap-opera camp) cannot be a counted as a factor that worked for him.  Bad pub. is better than no pub., but it is still bad.  What did it for him was a credible performance in the crucible of the debates - where any candidate should have to prove their mettle.

I'm an Eagle Scout myself, so don't take it the wrong way when I say:
Idealistic of you. "Take back your government!" But it is clear on the
evidence that what I mean by "rational" does not include most of the
voters. It probably never has, even back in ancient Athens.
Most of the politicians are perfectly sane. They're just selfish,
meretricious and venal. And the system rewards them handily.

Ergo, the aforesaid rationals have to convince the sheeple to vote in
[etc.], and they have to manage to convince the politicians to "stay
bought" or be honest. 
It is a lot more work when there's no moral ground to stand
on. This is not a complaint or a harkening back to some mythical good old
days. It is easiest to push peoples' BIG buttons. And a big lie makes the
best bell-push..

> It makes it impossible without a fire in the belly and a message which

<Aside re JTB/MV:
Too soon to tell about Jesse. I used to hail from there; we'll see how he
does this term, and see if he gets anything done without playing ball
"Yes, Minister"-style. To excess, I mean--a certain amount of it is
inevitable.>

And it takes luck, or convincing the existing power structure that they
can "work with you". Or both. Salmon swimming upstream have the fire in
the belly worse than I ever hope to. It's not enough. "Any kid can grow up

> >> The document must be updated to evolve with changing sociocultural

Maybe; to some degree, yes. You sound very sure. But consider:
The common law definition of fraud fits on a 3x5 card and can be explained
to a jury in five or ten minutes. The SEC fraud regs are something like 9
feet of bookshelf, deep, fine print. I do not believe a factual case can
be marshaled in support of this. Perhaps you do. 

Once upon a time, though, the legal coastline, measured with a yard
stick (common law), really could be said to be x miles long. And common
people could understand the law, for the most part. Now, the
ever-more-fractal legal landscape greatly supports an expanded, "richer"
ecosystem of niches and their habitues. In the conspiracy of bears to
honey, nobody who spent tens of thousands of dollars and decades of their
life to be a specialist attorney/consultant wants _their_ ox gored. So
simplifying the legal landscape becomes out of the question... unless one
contemplates Alexander's Gordian option. One need not be a pimply fresh
Randite to do so.

<Lorrey's Newspeak, etc. commentary elided>

I think they knew full well about the Eighteenth-Century equivalents,
incl.
rabble-rousing, amphigory and the tricks of rhetoric. But they had, I
think, some hopes that the gentry (who were originally all who could vote)
might be expected to keep at least one eye cocked skeptically, more often
than not.

Whew-wee! Nice shootin' Tex, but all that high and mighty system
description is being choked to death by weeds. Maybe you're so in love
with the blueprints you can't see the rust on the working model.

That said, the way I just "spoke" is exactly the way a new Mussolini
might. I find that chilling. Maybe I've got a calling. Nah...

So, to the point you raised in your first (pre-tub) clause: Mike Lorrey
may or may not; me, I've got a million experiments to try. Find me a
million spare universes to try them out in, and we can talk; in this one,
in real time, with all those specialists defending their oxen... get real.
I'm busy trying to walk down the fractal coastline while avoiding the land
sharks.

Do you really think that the cost of sending one person to raise a group
of 10-20 kids from embryos all the way to a productive age (early
teens?), is lower than the cost of getting 10-20 adults and the stuff
they need to survive and thrive to mars? I don't know if even the most
motivated single mom is going to have time to grow/manufacture the food
they all need, repair the odd broken solar array, manage all sorts of
other tasks, and change diapers, chase toddlers, play with and read to
these kids so they turn out intelligent.

I agree that automation/AI would help out greatly, but we haven't yet
reached the level I think would be needed to make your plan more
cost-effective.  Wouldn't it be cheaper in the long run to send a group
of somewhere from 10-50 young adults (maybe some teenagers, sure)?

The hardships faced being the first (and only) adult human living on
another planet's surface seem to be more than one person could handle. 
What if mom gets cancer and dies suddenly--what happens to all the
kids?  What if she breaks an arm?  Possibilities like these make a
single colonist plan completely infeasible in my mind.

Not *that* small.

I do think we're getting to a point where we a wealthy individual or
corporation could fund a small expedition that had a reasonable chance
of success, with additional colonists to follow as soon as the
infrastructure is in place for them to arrive.  Are ya listening, Bill
G.?

Agreed.  Saw it tonight--it *is* sci-fi fantasy, with some emphasis on
the fantasy.  But it will strongly deliver a frightening version of the
"technological dystopia caused by runaway AI" meme to the masses of
teenagers and young adults that will see it.  There's even a cool
Moravecian speech by the sentient AI "agent" comparing humans to
dinosaurs, since the AI consciousness and new robot-dominated world are
the "next level" of evolution of life. In the movie, our mind children
have enslaved us, but at least they provide a VR fantasy world to keep
us occupied all the time.

I hope I didn't give too much away, because it's really worth seeing.

I'm optimistic, dammit! Perhaps my shiny-happy view of the world has just
gone to far this time. However, I didn't focus on anything _anti_ in "The
Matrix." Without giving too much away, I saw it as a Hero learning,
thinking, and finding a drive to conquer. This to me is what greatness is
all about. I could have I suppose looked at it from a negative point of
view, but I so was engulfed in the integration of the special effects used
perfectly, strong hero, and great f***ing clothes. I actively sifted out
whatever pessimistic viewpoint might have been included. 

I want to see the good. I want to see technology. I want to see heros and
heroines and that is just what I did. Amazing what the mind takes in, when
it is focused with a particular slant. I have seen "The Matrix" twice now,
and each time I came out inspired and thrilled about what is ahead.

ML> That is the definition of libel, not of lying.

Libel further requires actual harm and intent to harm.
Most of the examples of "ethical lying" people come up
with are simply self-defense as in the above example.
The use of fraud in self-defense is the same as the use
of violence in self-defense.  Lies to the government
are included here as well.

A more interesting question is how unethical are lies
told because they are utterly inconsequential?  Say you
are having a conversation at a party with someone you
know you will never see again--why not be entertaining
by describing your trip to Europe that you never took?
What about lies of mere convenience?  "I was over at
Charlie's watching the game" rather than "It's none of
your damned business where I was and I don't want to
tell you and I don't want to argue about it."

Anders Sandberg raised a great point. We need to share our knowledge. If 
someone asks a sincere question then it should be answered, either on or 
off list. The kind of hostility that Michael Lorrey showed is not what 
transhumanism is about or the way most people on this list act. 

Contrasting Michael Lorrey with the regular Extropian list member is in 
order. Reviewing Michael's post for the last few months I noticed he 
never asked a question. I also noticed he has an opinion on basically 
everything. Finally, I noticed that he should ask more questions because 
much of what he has posted is little more than polemic or rhetoric. 
There is plenty of that type of 'discussion' in the newsgroups. Let us 
keep it there.

Now, let us get back to sharing knowledge.

No need to go to Europe to confirm that: just look at the LA riots.
The only stores in untouched were those Korean-owned shops who had
armed owners outside to keep the looters at a distance.

I might have thought at one time that Mr. Dees had at least /some/
tenuous connection to reality, but I no longer have to give him the
benefit of that doubt.

Can you honestly say with a straight face that Mr. Ventura's job
as an entertainer had /nothing/ to do with his getting elected?
And I suppose Clint Eastwood became mayor of Carmel on the strength
of his zoning plans, and Sonny Bono went to congress because he
had some good ideas on the economy?  Was Shirley Temple really
the best candidate for ambassadorship to Ghana?

In modern American politics, name recognition matters, and money
matters, and ideas are a distant third if that.  This is the
natural and inevitable result of that moral perversion we call
democracy: give the majority the power to rule everyone, and they
use that power to enforce mediocrity upon us all at gunpoint.
It is not possible to work "within the system" to dismantle the
system.  Since democracy itself is repugnant, it must be replaced.
My preferred method of doing that is non-violent "underthrow":
either simply leave and start society somewhere else, or else
acquire sufficient economic power that the government becomes
impotent and irrelevant.  E-commerce has potential for the latter,
so I am enthusiastic that might happen.  But if neither of those
work--if the democracy tries to force you in line with its guns--
then free and honest people have no choice but to shoot back.

Polemic and rhetoric in defense of life and liberty is a good
thing.  Letting those with dangerous ideas go unopposed gives
the impression of tacit approval.  Sure, it's inconvenient to
listen to the same arguments many times, but it's a lot better
than letting bad ideas go unanswered.

As much as it annoys us that so many people lack "basics" we
think everyone should know, the fact is that they do, and the
means for them to educate themselves are often inadequate
(whoever suggested that people should use the net to get a
basic science education gave me a good laugh for the day).

It is likely that the content of this list will be repetitive
now and then.  That's OK.  Education requires repitition, and
this list serves to educate.  Those of us who want more in-
depth discussion can have that too, and if you want to avoid
the basic discussions, that's fine: but don't try to prevent
them, or you'll be shooting yourself in the foot by preventing
newbies from becoming the next wave of in-depth participants.

Robert Fogel, economic historian and Nobel Prize winner, gave his AEA 
presidential address on 4Jan99, and said:

  Technophysio evolution requires not just marginal adjustments, but major 
  leaps in economic theory.  We are slow in pondering such grand questions 
  as the implications of the Human Genome Project, which is now nearing 
  completion, and the emergence of molecular medicine for the future of 
  economic life.  We have entered an era in which purposeful intervention 
  in evolutionary processes is passing beyond plant and animal breeding.  
  The new growth economics needs to incorporate at least some aspects of 
  directed, rapid human evolution. Endogenous technological change needs 
  to extend to the fundamentals of human behavior.  Theorists also need to 
  grapple with the ethical implications of technological changes that, 
  whatever their positive aspects, threaten to undermine the mystery of 
  human life by transforming people into "material" that is transplanted, 
  cloned, arbitrarily changed in personality and intelligence, and 
  otherwise manufactured in ways that challenge the definition of a human 
  being.  ["Catching Up with the Economy", Am. Ec. Rev., 89(1):1-21, 3/99]

That is, Fogel chided economists for not paying more attention to the 
sort of issues we discuss here.  His normative take on these topics may
be different from ours, but I welcome the positive study he calls for.

During a recent meeting of our local transhuman group, we came
opon the following (no doubt unoriginal) idea; terminally ill cryonicists
could have euthanasia and the initial stages of cryopreservation performed 
onboard a ship under some flag of convenience. Of course, as there
are so few of us, the next logical step was to make it a public euthanasia
facility, with perhaps ("alternative") medicine and abortion options
while you're at it. There should be quite a market for such a service
which would not only cut through all the red tape, but would also
help to make an otherwise (very) unpleasant experience somewhat
more bearable (the ship would offer the comforts of a standard holiday
cruiser, and you'd be in a supportive environment, surrounded by
"peers" etc.) 

Though old, but fully fitted and seaworthy cruise ships can occasionally
be saved from the scrapper for as little as 1,000,000, or one could start
out with some smaller (cheaper) vessel and expand from there. A group
of people could buy the ship and basically run it like a company
with shareholders etc. Perhaps the most logical sequence would
be starting with a fairly cheap abortion boat (this is no doubt also the
legally easier option) and use the money to finance a bigger and 
more luxurious euthanasia/abortion/cryosuspension/alternative 
treatment ship.

The most important issue is the legal one of course; what flag (of
convenience) to use? Perhaps some backward country which simply 
doesn't have euthanasia/abortion rules, if something like that
exists, could be used. The occasional deposit on its ruler's bank 
account could further guarantee "smooth sailing". Suppose this is 
possible, would other countries give you any serious trouble? What 
would their legal possibilities be for harassment (assuming you stay
in international waters all the time)? Would a person who had
received euthansia and cryonic treatment be autopsied when
"imported" into the US?

Thoughts, anyone?

Btw, a search on Altavista, Hotbot and various abortion/euthanasia
sites gave absolutely no relevant results. Surely something like
this must have been tried, or at least proposed before?

Perhaps we should consider some sort of hybrid.  Consider a government
with only two functions: national defense and meta-contract enforcement.
Interactions between individuals and most firms would be handled by 
private protection agencies (PPAs).  The government would concern itself 
with PPA-turns-into-hostile-army scenarios, and with choice of law 
enforced via a single transferable asset ("money").

Your PPA bothering you?  Did you clearly contract with them and specify
an arbitrator?  If so, the only possible government law issue is whether 
the arbitrator's judgement was carried out.  If the arbitrator says 
it wasn't, a monetary fine or transfer might be imposed on the PPA.   
Is it not clear which PPA you contracted with?  The government isn't 
going to allow much subtly here.  Did you sign that contract?  OK, good 
enough for us.

Does some PPA seems to have turned into an army threatening national
security?  Well that's something the government must be concerned with.
What, you say its just sour grapes from your competitors?  This gets
tricker to judge.  But if the complaining locals at the border of 
the "territory" where you are the main PPA all seem free to leave with
most assets, the case against you will seem weaker.  And strong "lockin"
by customers might make the case against you stronger.  It would be 
"anti-trust" law at the PPA level, ensuring competition at perhaps some
expense in economies of scale.  

Oh, and the government would also have to impose some taxes to pay for
that national defense and ability to impose judgements on PPAs.  Here
I'd prefer a very simple stable tax rule, perhaps a property tax.

Amazingly enough, researchers have yet to measure a significant aggregate 
effect of medicine (doctors, etc.) on health.

Sure there are lots of clinical studies purporting to show the benefits of 
various treatments.  But clinical trials tend to study best practice on 
patients mostly likely to benefit. Negative results tend not to be 
published, and the vast majority of medical practice has yet to be studied 
with clinical trials.

The studies that have looked at the aggregate health effect of medicine as 
typically practiced, averaging over all the things doctors do, have no 
found a significant effect.  Two decades ago ~$50 million was spent on a 
randomized trial among 5000 people over 2-3 years, some of which got 1/3 
more medical care than the rest.  The only differences found were corrected 
vision via glasses, more filled teeth cavities, and lowered blood pressure 
among the poor (which may be a placebo effect).  A recent analysis of 5 
million Medicare patients, using regional spending variations of a factor 
of two (controlling for lots of stuff), found that any mortality benefit of 
spending in the last six months of life is less than a one part in a 
thousand.

Is this all from anal statisticians imposing too high a standard of 
evidence?  Consider that by these same standards we *have* seen significant 
robust effects of age, exercise, fat, smoking, and social status on health. 
(Exercise and social status reduce mortality by roughly a factor of three 
each.)

How could medicine not be healthy?  Surgery clearly has negative effects on 
the body, drugs upset evolved balances, and hospitals are clearly great 
places to spread contagious diseases.  It is widely accepted that centuries 
ago doctors did many harmful things like bleeding folks along with a few 
useful things they did, and that the net effect may not have been positive. 
The same may be true today.

Of course most of this data is about the "second half" of the money we 
spend on medical care.  Maybe we get more health value for the first half 
of spending.  Or maybe not.

The apparent low health value of medical care is all the more striking 
given that we spend 14% of GDP on it in the U.S.  And it must surely give 
pause to those who hope that medicine will soon give us dramatically 
expanded life spans.

I would like to call this proposed institute (separate from ExI)
something along the lines of the "Institute of Future Sciences" a
quick web search revealed a New Age <something> with the same name,
whether it's real or not is hard to tell.  IMHO, the name should
embody the idea without refering to transhumanism or extropianism
directly.

Goals: Educate the public to the potential of future developments in
science and technology in a clear and rational manner.  Establish the
means for the academic pursuit of new and emerging science and
technology.  Or in other words, bombard the media with critical
evaluations of future developments in science and technology in a hope
to over come the inherent "disasterbation" and spread the tranhumanist
meme.  And try to organise transhuman-oriented courses at all levels
of academia and encourage the publication of transhuman-oriented
papers.

Comments?

There are three questions at issue here. In decreasing order of importance,
they are:  

1.  Whether my method of argument is valid and useful.  
2.  Whether my conclusions are true.  
3.  Who I am; whether I know anything about computer science, or anything
else; whether I did a good job of applying the principle of calibration;
etc.  

Question #3 is of no relevance. Maybe I'm an idiot. That has nothing to do
with it. As I said on the home page of geniebusters, Eric Drexler is not
the issue here. Neither am I.  

Question #2 is more important. Is someone going to design the entire
"universal assembler," in advance, in such a way that once set in motion
the whole thing suddenly comes into existence with explosive force? Are
robots going to build skyscrapers for free? Is there going to be an event
that is incommensurable with everything else?  or not?  

Question #1 is the most important one. How can we get a handle on question
#2? Is there a general procedure for approaching such questions, so that
they become matters of fact and proof rather than matters of opinion and
speculation?  

After writing the above, I finally looked at Billy Brown's comments and
found, to my surprise, that they are rational. If he had made a rational
comment in the first place, matters would have taken a different course.  

>  Ah. So you do still read the list. I wondered.  

You wondered? In other words you were on the list two years ago? Anyway I
don't read the list. Twirlip of Greymist pointed out to me that Anders had
mentioned geniebusters on the list, so I looked at his comment and your
reply. Then I read the earlier posts in that thread, and sampled some other
threads in the archive. Apart from that, I haven't read the list since I
retired from it. However, this afternoon I find myself writing yet another
post to the list, the fourth one this week, in spite of my repeated efforts
to stop. I may have to join some kind of 
12-step program for postaholics. Maybe a Higher Power will help me do what
I can't do myself.

You don't say which sections you are referring to, or what "makes it seem"
that way. I am concerned here with certain specific claims made by Eric
Drexler in Engines of Creation. I don't even dispute all of the claims made
in that book, let alone "any" revolutionary claim. If someone wants to
claim that we will, in the foreseeable future, be able to make our bodies
much more self-correcting than they are now, and that our cells and organs
will become (asymptotically) perfect, I would not have a problem with that
claim, even though it could be considered "revolutionary." If someone wants
to claim that it is possible (and practicable) to make artificial
organisms, I don't have a problem with that either. The assumption that I
do make, and defend, is that new technologies, however revolutionary they
may appear to be, will occur within a certain unchanging framework.  

> Your assertion that any software capable of replacing a human 
> would demand a salary  

I'm not asserting this for software capable of replacing *a* human, just
for software that replaces humans who make unsupervised decisions requiring

human judgment. Some humans are not on "our" side of the line. Many
employees are, for all practical purposes, automatons, and can be replaced
by machines. 
This happens all the time and will continue. My assertion is that the realm
of automation will always exist within a larger realm that is not
automated. The boundary between agents and automatons will always be there,
and agents will always have to be dealt with as agents. They will always
expect to get paid (unless you can find some other way to motivate them). I
think what I'm going to have to do is illustrate this point with an
animated diagram, where you can see something changing within a framework
that does not change. I also need to put in a lot more interstitial
material explaining what I'm doing. (In other words the revised version
will be longer, not shorter. It isn't going to be an article, it's going to
be a book. Sorry, Robin  ;-)

That section isn't supposed to be read in isolation. It is part of the
argument leading up to Exercise 5 in Section 7, and it also has to be read
in conjunction with sections 12 and 13. The question is whether the
Assembler Breakthrough is going to happen. To get a handle on that
question, I'm trying to establish the level of complexity involved in "a
system that can make anything, including copies of itself." If a nanosystem
can make anything, in the sense required for the Assembler Breakthrough,
then it will amount to the same thing as an industrial economy.  

It would of course be possible to have a nanosystem that could make
anything in a certain domain, maybe an extensive domain, without being able
to make anything in general. But that's not what you need for the Assembler
Breakthrough. If anyone has a proof (i.e. a structured argument, not some
impressionistic remarks) that the Breakthrough can happen with a less
general system, I'd like to see it.

The physiological and psychological effects of placebos has in many cases
been proven to be almost as effective as physioactive or psychoactive drugs
in the treatment of many disorders.  Many drugs have a very large placebo
effect compared to their actual effects.

Of course, most drugs do have physioactive or psychoactive effects, and I am
not disclaiming or disproving statistically proven effects.

Laughter as a coping mechanism is shown to have positive health effects.
The power of the body to heal itself is a wonderful thing.  The power of the
body to fool itself is a thing.

Antibiotics are great things, anaesthetics and analgesics are good for the
blocking of pain, and wine is good for conversation.

I am not a doctor and make no medical claims.  Remember to brush your teeth,
modern diets have large amounts of sugars and other cavity causing
contents.  Read the labels on food and be aware of what exactly one is
ingesting.

Meditation and other forms of self-enlightenment are powerful tools to
attain good health.

Modern medicine is incredible and I am in awe of it.  Examples are
microvascular surgery, cancer cures, and anti-viral treatments, among many
other wonderful things.  There are surgeries to correct poor vision.

We might envision a time in the not so far future where all physical
ailments are successfully treatable.  This leads to further impetus towards
space exploration and colonization, and general research and development, as
well as ecological and environmental conservation, preservation, and
rejuvenation.  It also makes real estate that much more valuable, and the
need for population controls sadly necessary, but not interminably so, as
humanity spreads throughout the solar system and beyond.

Ok,

I just got back from this movie and it is awesome!!  I agree
with the previous comment that this can be interpreted as
the "anti-AI film of the decade", but that is one of the
reasons I liked it so much.  Since many people on the list
haven't seen it yet, I will withhold any further comments
beyond saying, if we can get to singularity via IA over AI,
we all be the better for it.  People like Eliezer are
already familiar with my strong stance on that one.
Psst...go see the movie and will talk later...

Bartley, that is a goooood question.  I went at this problem strictly from
a propulsion engineer's point of view, with little regard for some of the
more practical difficulties.  Some of the payload scales to the size of the
crew, and some of it does not.  For instance, the food requirements are
directly proportional to the size of the crew.  Same for water and waste
recycling facilities.  The size of the habitation module might not be
directly proportional to the size of the crew.

Consider pressure vessels: suppose you develop some type of plant
that grows in liquid water under artificial light.  You need to maintain
the vapor pressure of water at, say 20C, plus some margin.  I imagine
you would be in the neighbor hood of 10 to 20 kilopascals against
an outside pressure of about 2 kPa.  Nowthen, a pressure vessel's
mass is directly proportional to its volume, given constant pressure.
Reasoning: the volume of a given container increases as the cube of
its linear dimension.  The surface area increases as the square of
the linear dimension, however, for a given pressure requirement,
the required thickness of the vessel increases directly proportional
to the linear dimension.  Therefore, the mass of an ideal pressure
vessel is proportional to its volume.  So, twice the crew, twice
the required mass of a farm module.

Chase them where?  I expect the hab module to be quite small.
Her biggest challenge would be maintaining her sanity, assuming
a child raised in a space about equal to a good sized motorhome,
when neither can go outside and play, at least not for long.

> ...play with and read to these kids so they turn out intelligent...

Problematic for sure, but when all is said and done, it is not clear
to me that the first native generation will need to be all that intelligent
in the traditional sense.  They need to use their brains for one
thing: surviving in a hostile environment.  Even still, I suspect
most of their education will come in the form of signals from
the home planet.  Do they need to learn how to read?  Why?
Do they need to be able to work on machines?  Absolutely.

OK, but before you go too far down this road, try to imagine
what manner of spacecraft would be needed to carry off such
a thing.  Is the craft assembled in earth orbit?  After how many
launches?  On what launcher?  At what cost?  Ten people soft
landing on Mars requires an awesome payload.

>...The hardships faced being the first (and only) adult human living

Again, you may be right, but consider the fact that we humans
can be tough daughters of bitches.  Back in the old days trappers went
into the interior of America, and saw not another human for
two years.  Prisoners have been kept in solitary, with no books
and no nothing for years, and somehow managed.  Island of the
Blue Dolphin: story based on reality.  Young lady lived alone
for 12 years on a small island.  The single Martian, even without
reproductive success, would have constant interaction with humans,
with only a maximum of 20 minutes delay in communications,
minimum of about 2 minutes.

> What if mom gets cancer and dies suddenly--what happens to all the

Depends on their ages.   If the oldest child were at least
8 yrs, they might make it anyway.  Children can be quite resourceful
if they need to be.  Younger than that,  they all die.  Sad indeed.  Im
not claiming this is a low risk adventure.

>  What if she breaks an arm?

Or leg?  This would bad, but unlikely in 1/3 G.  Landing is high
risk for sure, but it only gets more difficult as the lander gets
larger.  It is easier to land a Cessna than 747.

OK, but how small?  Im thinking the single astronaut, one way trip
*might* be doable for about 5 billion dollars, ($5E9) assuming
some of these low cost outfits like Kissler Engineering are successful
with their low cost commie engined boosters.  Im thinking you would
need to soft land about 80,000 kg on Mars to give a single small
astronaut a fighting chance, by which I mean about ~5 yrs of processed
stored food to last until a farm module could be built from
indigenous materials and operated at break-even, plus a small
nuclear reactor, semiautonomous robots to build the farm
module, a small foundry to process materials, a solar cell
production facility, etc.

5 billion is in the neighborhood of what could be raised
by enough fanatic rich people.  It is two orders of magnitude
cheaper than NASA estimated for a three-man flags and
footprints mission, but that effort assumed a way home.

The reason you saw a notice from me regarding the THAAD
failure on Thursday afternoon when I actually posted it Monday
morning (an hour after the event) was that our computers were
melissa-ed and the network was down all week.

CNN reports they nabbed the dirty scoundrel who wrote the
virus.  I cheered.  For about three seconds.  Then I said: wait
a minute.  What charge?  Is this not covered under the US
first amendment granting free speech?  If he is charged with
obstructing public communications, should not Microsloth
be named as a co-conspirator?  Should not this perp and
Bill Gates share a cell?  Could not Microsloth have shipped
their product so that macros were disabled until *specifically

read the manual and decide we *need* word macros?  How
many of you among the writhing amoeba of extropianism
have ever actually used a MS word macro?  More than
once?

Legal eagles, help me out here: is the melissa author in real
danger of going to the slammer?  I am tempted to defend the
unsavory character.  He did us all a service by pointing out
yet another bug in Microsloth word.  spike

We don't get an exact cancellation of the DA unless the SIA has the 
property that, other things equal, if there are ten times more people 
on hypothesis A than on hypothesis B, then A is ten times more 
probable than B after conditionalizing on your own existence. And 
this does of course mean that your existence should make it a priori 
certain (probability one) that there are infinitely many people, 
provided that had a non-zero probability to start with. And that 
seems wrong.

I found an old review I wrote on a floppy disc. Here is the relevant 
part:

 So we have the gulf between a physical process and an abstract
 structure to be bridged. As a platform on the abstract side, Chalmers
 chooses the notion of a combinatorial-state automaton. A CSA is
 defined by giving a finite set of input vectors {(I1, ..., In)}, a
 finite set of output vectors {(O1, ..., Om)}, and a finite set of
 internal states {(S1, ..., Sk)} (where all the vectors can be
 infinite, but Chalmers focuses on the finite case), and a set of
 state transitions, i.e. a function f(((I1, ..., In), (S1, ..., Sk)))
 = ((S1, ..., Sk), (O1, ..., Om)) from ordered pairs of an input
 vector and a state vector to ordered pairs of a state vector and an
 output vector. Finite CSAs are equivalent in computational power to
 ordinary finite-state automata, but they have a richer inner
 structure which Chalmers thinks he can exploit in his explication.

 Then we can formulate the criterion for implementing a CSA as
 follows:

"A physical system P implements a CSA M if there is a decomposition of
internal states of P into components (s1, ..., sn), and a mapping f
from the substates sj into corresponding substates Sj of M, along with
similar decompositions and mappings for inputs and outputs, such that
for every state transition rule ((I1, ..., Ik), (S1, ..., Sn) 
[arrow-to-the-right] ((S'1, ..., S'n), (O1, ..., Ol)) of M: if P is 
an internal state (s1, ..., sn) and receives input (i1, ..., in), 
which map to formal state and input (S1, ..., Sn) and (I1, ..., Ik) 
respectively, this reliably causes it to enter an internal state and 
produce an output that map to (S'1, ..., S'n) and (O1, ..., Ol) 
respectively." (p. 318)

Additional restrictions can be placed on the permissible 
decompositions: for example, we might demand that the elements of the 
vectors supervene on separate regions of the physical system. The 
underlying idea is that a computation is implemented when there is a 
structure of causal relationships that mirrors the structure of 
formal relations in the computation that is implemented.

Bad pub. is better than no pub., but it is still bad.  What did it for him was a credible performance in the crucible of the debates - where any candidate should have to prove their mettle.

Jesse starred in several movies, including in Predator with Arnold Schwartzenegger. He also was mayor of his hometown prior to running for governor and apparently was credited with doing a good hob there, as well as having that as a platform to generate additional name recognition and soap boxing.

People in that state embraced him EXACTLy because he was a wrestler. The only class of person less trusted that a car dealer is a politician, so even if your allusion were true, then it was not much of a reach for him.

I have on numerous occasions defended the same position that Anders did.
Interesting that you choose to ignore those posts. I do think that there is a
definite lower limit to the type of questions we tolerate being peppered with.
Dumb questions like 'why is the sky blue' or 'why is water wet?' or anything in
that milieu are not fit for the list, and the posters either need to use
existing references that are freely available or ask people in private or
elsewhere. Don't waste my time and money with your laziness.

I don't ask many questions of the list (I do ask some, rarely) for the following
reasons:

a) I have been on the list for over two years, and on the transhumanist list for
two years before that.
b) I get a very decent stream of new information from the list that is posted by
people like Anders, and others, the science posts, etc. It is usually
informative, and if I have any questions about the science or whatever about
those posts, I will find the originators of the information and ask them. I
won't waste the time of the middlemen who usually don't know any more than they
passed along.
c) I follow my own advice and ask people questions in private, so that I don't
clog the mail boxes of 300 other people with questions they have no ability,
time, or desire to engage in.

Moreover I resent your claim that all I post is 'polemic and rhetoric'. I have
posted quite a bit of discussion on space development and cosmological topics, I
have bent over backwards to answer many basic questions that newbies have (far
mor than you Mr Archeros) and have posted verified science on topics regarding
gun use. My 'rhetoric' as you call it is merely calling the other side's bluff.
That you are positioned on the other side of the argument in that case and don't
like it and have to hide behind a cloak of anonymity as Mr. Archeros indicates
you are in a bit of denial.

Yes, the dissapointing thing was that the LA cops arrested more Korean shop
owners for shooting people than actual rioters who killed people.

The M$ OS could be considered to be a creature with a weak or just leaky immune

There is a point there. He is an agent  of evolution in releasing that virus,
The smart person would advocate that the guy spends his life on a PC in a padded

Or may not.  Poorer people tend to get cheaper and less effective bp 
medication
(diurectics rather than ACE inhibitors).  Cheaper doesn't always mean worse
in the era of drug salespeople but in this case it does.

I do recall a study (sorry, can't find the reference) of Christian Scientist, 
who
refuse most medical treatment.  The study found that the loss of medical
treatment reduced their lifespan about 7 years.

I would suspect that medical care that really makes a difference probably gets
to almost anybody.  Added money would mostly go to optional or speculative
treatment; that might well not improve mortality.

It's implausible that the medicine we get (as opposed to additional treatment 
we
don't normally get) doesn't help.  People get things like appendicitis, 
pneumonia
in the young, and gangrene which were major risks in the past but very rarely
die of them.  There's no question that trauma treatment reduces risk of death 
as well.  At the same time a lot of medical treatment doesn't help mortality.
Randomized studies have shown a mortality benefit for coronary bypass for
the left main and LAD arteries but no benefit for angioplasty (it helps 
symptoms
only).

That sounds like a biased sample.  People who die within six months are
people for whom treatment has failed.  If medical treatment works, they
won't show up in the sample.  Am I missing something?

What used to be called Big Time Wrestling in the 70's has matured and
evolved. They work harder out there than they ever used to.

It appears the modern popularity of Big Time Wrestling among people with
double-digit mental ages may stem from a couple of factors:
1) Pomo ironic sensibility
2) Recognition that those guys work hard out there, and *are* risking
permanent injury every time they step into the ring, and *do* wind up with
something perhaps like as much cumulative damage as (say) the average pro
footballer after n years.
3) Awareness that though the shows *are* _staged_, they aren't _rigged_ or
_fixed_ in an unfair way. Anyone who bets on the outcome better be
betting on being able to read the promoters' minds, that's all. And the
promoters are fairly predictable, as it turns out. Just like soap operas.
And for the same reasons.
4) Knowledge that *both*/*all* parties in the ring have to cooperate
in most of the techniques, or EMTs *will* be involved. This means that
there is honor among wrestlers--they pack each others' parachutes, so to
speak.
5) It's Twyla Tharp for the cave man in everybody. See #1.

Jesse Ventura, a by golly real live (former? can one ever be said to be a
former?) SEAL, can be credited with significant contributions to most of
the aforementioned evolutions, some of which have come about after he had
to retire because of injuries really received in the ring.

That said, it's not my cup of chai.

> People in that state embraced him EXACTLy because he was a wrestler.

Sadly, BINGO. It's certainly *my* hope that he's worthy of trust.

Let me know if you recall more about the cite.

But maybe most treatment is optional or speculative.  If so, maybe we could
spend 1/3 what we do now and be just as healthy.

Sure we are lots healthier now than in the past.  The question is how much
credit medicine deserves for that.  Lots of other things have changed besides
medicine.

It is a random sample of all Medicare patients.  It looks at 5000 hospital
regions in the country, and predicts total mortality in each region from
a long list of features, one of which is how much is spent there in the
last six months of life.  I gave the URL for it - take a look for yourself:

I'd expect that most of the benefits of health care are not being
measured here. For example, I don't see any mention of cosmetic effects
(i.e. that leg you broke as a kid left you with a huge lump where the
bone healed unevenly cause you set it yourself, etc) or of changes in
ambulative ability.

Additionally, it is not measuring how improved health care is offsetting
the much more unhealthy living practices of today's person vs. a century
or two ago. People living today in civilized countries are for the most
part in far worse condition in terms of physical fitness. People also
are far more likely to die of traumatic accidents or drug use. The
healthier people take more risks. The most dangerous time to die of a
car accident is at age 16, which puts a nice damper on the stats long
before one reaches old age. This blip is a recent phenomenon.

Moreover, I don't see how you can look at the differences in average
life expectancy from country to country without seeing some definite
benefit to modern health care. The effects on the infant mortality rates
alone are phenomenal.

You are forgetting that the group "Medicare patients" already asserts a
filter to a specific set of demographics which could very well gain
little from improved health care, while the rest of the population may
see significant benefits.

I think there's a key point here. Consider: 

Hereabouts, "medicine" is not solely the province of doctors. Many things
are available *over the counter*, *in the water supply* and so forth
today. 

The triple antibiotic (which, when I dispose of it, contributes to MRSA
:\) and Band-Aids (tm) I can buy in the pharmacy without ever seeing an MD
can keep a heel blister from becoming infected and killing me (as happened
to one of Woodrow Wilson's sons after a tennis game). 

Chlorinated water, for all its potential low-level biohazard, and other
standard public health measures, again make a difference to me day to day
without my going to a clinic. 

These thing synergize with the fact that I'm (and many people in the
developed nations are) to some degree my own doctor for routine matters.

Plus I'm affluent enough and my bosses are considerate enough to give me a
day or more off if I come down with something. I'm not a subsistence
farmer who has to keep plowing my rocky fields in the rain while fighting 
off hostile enteric parasites.

My apologies if all this was already obvious to others.

Yes, Christian Scientist do not believe in medical treatment, even at a 
life or death state. They feel that it is tampering with Gods will. That 
God has a plan for us to be born and to die, and it is not for man to 
prevent. I have heard of cases, where loved ones are brought to the 
hospital to be "taken care of", (ie. someone calles 911 for a nieghbor 
who has a heartattack) but not to recieve any actual medical treatment 
that might save their lives.

Some excellent points, however, before we scrutinize medicine, it might be
better to begin with health care in general.  Can we measure a discernable
effect of health care availability and services on the longevity and health
of a population?  I don't have the data readily available but my
understanding is that the increase in average lifespan of the population of
the United States and other countries with relatively high availability of
modern health care services is significantly higher than that of many Third
World countries without such health care services.  However, this does not
necessarily mean health care is the primary driver of this trend.
Generally, countries with robust health care systems are more educated and
wealthier than less advantaged countries.

One way to test the importance of health services would be to take a group
of people within the United States that does not utilize health care
services (e.g., Christian Scientists) and compare them to a sample of those
who do.  It would be a complex task since there are probably other lifestyle
factors that might contribute to lifespan effects within each group.  It
would be more interesting if we completely eliminated health care for a five
year period and observed the effect on lifespan and death incidents in
general.  Certainly, there would be instances of increased death (e.g.,
childbirth, cancer victims, heart disease, etc.)  However, there could be
ameliorative effects from freeing 14% of the GDP to be spent on education,
hunger, research, and other areas that might increase longevity (not that
I'm naive enough to think that all of this money would be allocated to such
endeavors)

As far as medicine is concerned, its obvious that it can provide immediate,
short-term benefits.  The relief that medicine provides from symptoms of
different maladies is real.  While the "mind over body" effect is relevant,
it is doubtful it applies to my children who also experience relief from
symptoms.  Given that my two year old acts as if medicine were the plague
when we attempt to give it to her nixes the "mind over body" effect as a way
to discount the validity of all medicine.  There might be come minimal
lifespan effects to this short-term relief.  The toll a sickness might take
on your system if allowed to "run its course" might take some time off your
lifespan.  Additionally, the stress I would go through if I had to endure my
children dealing with a particularly nasty flu virus without the assistance
of antibiotics might shorten my own lifespan in some way.  I don't know what
the aggregate effects of medicine is over an entire life but I suppose any
increase is a good thing.  Whether we could spend 14% of the GDP to increase
lifespan in a more effective and efficient manner is question that should be
asked but I don't know the answer to it.

Hello, extropian group,

Good show.  I am finding some links about these medicinal things for your
leisure.

http://stats.bls.gov/ppidrug.htm

http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&q=psychotherapeutics

http://www.cbo.gov/

http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/budget98/maindown.html

http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&q=Franklin+Delano+Roosevelt+New+Deal

Here are some links about medicine I have previously collected:

http://www.tomco.net/~raf/science.html#Medicine

To ignore real medicinal treatments is ignorant.

Patents on drugs expire after 17 years.  The use of generic prescription drugs
is much more economical for large quantities, eg aspirin, an effective
analgesic.  In Russia, they invented "assembly-line surgery" for glaucoma
treatment, but I do not recommend that because person-to-person interaction and
familiarity is very important for correct diagnoses.

As I have stated before, I respect medical research, and research in general.
Education is a path to enlightenment.

Also, as I have stated before, the massive overprescription of
psycho-"therapeutics" is akin to doping the receivers, instead of teaching them
to deal with their "problems."  Also, it is expensive.  More than %90 of almost
any pill is filler.

For many acute and chronic ailments, skilled medical treatment is the best way
to alleviate these ailments.  I feel lucky in that I have been treated by good
doctors, a good ophthalmologist, orthodontist, and dentist.  I have some friends
in medical school and the drug industry and they are good people.

Taking care of our infirm elderly and disabled is a wonderful legacy of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's "New Deal."  Social Security and its restructuring is a
different issue.  Helping people to help themselves is the goal.

As might be noted, I can be quite voluble on almost any topic.  I believe the
Hippocratic Oath is a good one.

In terms of mortality, I would think so.  The overwhelming portion of medical 
care
I and my family have recieved has been directed at disability, discomfort, or 
even
appearance (orthodontics).  In terms of improvements to my life expectancy I
suspect most of the benefit comes from my childhood vaccinations to smallpox,
diptheria, polio, german measles, and whooping cough.  I think that would be
less than $100.

That's why I picked those.  Gangrene and appendicitis still have nearly 100%
mortality if not treated.  Pneumonia is generally survivable by the young but 
still often lethal if not treated.

The abstract doesn't answer my questions; the paper has to be paid for.
I wouldn't expect survival from a specific cause to be related to 
last-six-months
spending; treated survivors are excluded while patients with other disease
are included.  So you have a lot more noise and a lot less signal even for
a real affect.  Statistical significance is a real problem with medical 
studies;
some require hundreds of thousands of patients.  Reducing signal/noise
ratio increases the necessary sample size by the square of the ratio change.
Even for heart disease, mortality is less that 30% and proportion of medical
costs less than a third so the ratio is about 10:1  That would drive the 
number
of deaths needed into the tens of millions and that's too much even for a 
countrywide survey.

My concern with excluding survivors remains.  The most effective medical
treatments result in nearly 100% survivability (e.g. gangrene, appendicitis,
and pneumonia in the young).  Hence the measurement by definition 
excludes patients for whom medical treatment is highly effective.

(from the abstract)
>regional survival rates following acute conditions like AMI (heart attacks), 
stroke, >and gastrointestinal bleeding were not correlated with more 
intensive health care >spending.

I don't know about GI bleeding, but I'd kind of expect that for AMI and 
stroke.  
There really aren't any treatments for stroke yet - some marginal improvements
with thrombolytics in a few percent of patients, and that's it.  For AMI, 
there's
thrombolytics (which are cheap), nitroglycerin and heparin (which are very 
cheap)
and coronary bypass (which is universal in those cases where it improves 
mortality).  So any excess spending necessarily goes to things of no proven,
and probably little, mortality benefit.

Not to me, apparently. I get:

Academics can get it for free but my affiliation with UC Irvine is

won't have an official affiliation until I start grad school next fall.

Does anyone here know any techniques, diets or medical regimens which can
reduce accumulated arterial plaque in humans? Not rate of further

There was a recent write up on "Cog" in the NY Times.  For those who may not
be familiar with it, the MIT artificial intelligence laboratory site has
cool videos of this creation if your computer handles streaming video.  It
has a torso and a head so far.  They assert that to learn like a human, the
computer needs a human-like body.

http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/cog/

Also, I saw Matrix yesterday. Kicked ass. Can't wait for it to be discussed
on the list, but we should give everyone a chance to see it first.  What do
you think?  Another week or so?

Yes, I also saw it, and think we should really give everyone on the list an
opportunity to see the movie first and without *any* hints.  Its the surprise
and believability that is so essential to the film's impact.

P.S.  Scott, please feel free to write write to me directly about it if you

My version of SIA (let's call it SIA-1) does have that property when the
measures of all observers are equal. But when there are an infinite number
of people on one of the hypotheses, it is not possible for the measures to
be equal. Suppose either (A) the universe contains an infinite number of
people or (B) it contains one person, and before conditionalizing on your
own existance you assign them equal probability. Also suppose the total
measure of observer-instants for A is .5. Given A, it's not possible for
every observer to have equal measure (otherwise their measures would
either add up to zero or infinity), so the probability that you have birth
rank 1 given A and you exist has to be some non-zero finite number, say
.01. Therefore the measure of the first observer given A is .5*.01 = .005.
Suppose the measure of the first observer given B is also .005. 

If you apply SIA-1 now, 

P(A | I exist) = P(I exist | A) * P(A) / P(I exist) = .5*.5 /
(.5*.5+.5*.005) = 100/101. 

If you then apply the DA, 

P(A | I exist and my birth rank is 1) = P(my birth rank is 1 | I exist and
A) * P(A | I exist) * P(I exist) / P(I exist and my birth rank is 1) = .01
* 100/101 * (.5*.5+.5*.005) / .005 = .5.

Everything cancels out nicely and you never assign probability one to A at
any point.

Unfortunately, such a "backward" country would also be unable to
prevent boarding by overzealous coast guard and naval gunships from
mighty nations, pirates, ecoactivists, churches, terrorists and your
stray smugglers.

Let's see: Japan, Russia, the USA, the UK, France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Cuba... Did I
forget most Muslim nations?

Add to the above Greenpeace, the Medellin cartel, the Roman Catholic
Church...

With the U.N. granting virtual letters of marque & reprisal to any
member nation with their "crimes against humanity" rules, you'd also
be prey to any international conglomerate. There's no such thing as
"international waters" when it comes to pursuing individual courses of
action held anathema by U.N. members: for them, it just means "open
season for all."
 
>Thoughts, anyone?

Yes, and this isn't a joke. You might be safer finding just such a
willing nation and building the center on land.

You might even be able to convince a nation such as China to sponsor
you. Fairly dictatorial; but if they say it's fine with them, also
fairly safe from foreign intervention.

Above all, consult with Scientologists: they're used to dealing with
legal harrassment concerning their health care choices. There might be
some states that might not prove as inimical to the concept on the
USA.

Another clue: unincorporated US territories aren't fully under federal
legislation. Sadly, the freest territory from US legislation is Puerto
RIco, which also happens to be rather socially conservative and
extremely centralized in local government affairs.

I can't guarantee it's validity...but I'm currently reading a book by Dr.'s

This does not surprise me. Most medicine is practiced after homeostasis is

it's a SILLY point on the event curve to try to fix things.

published, and the vast majority of medical practice has yet to be studied
with clinical trials.

There are currently two styles of medicine, preventive, and
reactive/allopathic. The preventive approaches are a net negative economic
factor to the medical industry. Sickness is what creates money events for
medicine. Health makes them no money. Dentists have LOST money due to
fluoride...and I've talked to a few who literally lament the days when they
could go "drilling for dollars". Business is business. For my own health, I
spent practically nothing on sickness treatment, and personally spend appx
$50 a month for nutrition, weight training etc. My wife and son on the other
hand are both cash cows in that they take weekly allergy shots. This costs
me about $5,000 a year. What incentive is there for medical science to
eliminate this "cure" with a final real cure? NONE. They LIKE my money.

Insurance spreads the COSTS but does not affect behavioural CONSEQUENCES.
Insurance makes healthy people feel and be less responsible for their own
health...thus reducing incentives to prevent problems...thus leading
statistically to a less healthy population. Has anyone done a study of
health/mortality rates on those who self insure via MSAs (medical savings
accounts) versus general health insurance? I would bet a ton of money that
general health insurance would be shown to HARM health when compared with
MSAs.

So, just as oil conservation seemed a stupid idea until oil SOURCES were
significantly (albeit artificially) reduced in the '70s, until AVAILABILITY
of medical care is constrained, there is NO instantaneous nor sustained
social/economic pressure to conserve health. If significant medical costs
were borne by individuals as was the case in the past, economic pressure
would be brought to bear within families to stay healthier.

Medical science is often based on great big arm waving general statistical
vagueries...so much so that it can take 40 YEARS to establish that - oh
yeah - cigarettes are bad for you after all. By the way...has anyone ever
done a study to see if the placebo effect occurs because people are drinking
more WATER to take the fake pill?

Water: an essential but overlooked nutrient.

Kleiner SM
Nutritional Sciences Program, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.

Water is an essential nutrient required for life. To be well hydrated, the
average sedentary adult man must consume at least 2,900 mL (12 c) fluid per
day, and the average sedentary adult woman at least 2,200 mL (9 c) fluid per
day, in the form of noncaffeinated, nonalcoholic beverages, soups, and
foods. Solid foods contribute approximately 1,000 mL (4 c) water, with an
additional 250 mL (1 c) coming from the water of oxidation. The Nationwide
Food Consumption Surveys indicate that a portion of the population may be
chronically mildly dehydrated. Several factors may increase the likelihood
of chronic, mild dehydration, including a poor thirst mechanism,
dissatisfaction with the taste of water, common consumption of the natural
diuretics caffeine and alcohol, participation in exercise, and environmental
conditions. Dehydration of as little as 2% loss of body weight results in
impaired physiological and performance responses. New research indicates
that fluid consumption in general and water consumption in particular can
have an effect on the risk of urinary stone disease; cancers of the breast,
colon, and urinary tract; childhood and adolescent obesity; mitral valve
prolapse; salivary gland function; and overall health in the elderly.
Dietitians should be encouraged to promote and monitor fluid and water
intake among all of their clients and patients through education and to help
them design a fluid intake plan. The influence of chronic mild dehydration
on health and disease merits further research.

Proportion of hospital deaths associated with adverse events.

Garcia-Martin M, Lardelli-Claret P, Bueno-Cavanillas A, Luna-del-Castillo
JD, Espigares-Garcia M, Galvez-Vargas R
Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine,
University of Granada, Spain.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the fraction of hospital deaths potentially
associated with the occurrence of adverse events (AE). DESIGN: A paired
(1:1) case-control study. SETTING: An 800-bed, teaching tertiary care
hospital. PATIENTS: All patients older than 14 years admitted to the
hospital between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1991, were eligible. All
524 consecutive deaths (death rate of 3.74%) that occurred in the hospital
comprised the case group. For each case, a control patient was matched for
both primary diagnosis on admission and admission date. MEASUREMENTS: The
proportion of hospital deaths associated with adverse events (defined as
problems of any nature and seriousness faced by the patient during
hospitalization, and potentially traceable to clinical or administrative
management) was estimated from attributable risks adjusted for age, sex,
service, severity of illness, length of stay, and quality of the medical
record. RESULTS: For stays longer than 48 hours, the adjusted attributable
risk for all adverse events was estimated to be 0.51 (0.40-0.61). When the
data were stratified according to the category of adverse event, the
attributable risks remained significant except for administrative problems.
The greatest proportion of deaths associated with adverse events was
observed for surgical adverse events [0.56 (0.38-0.71)] and nosocomial
infection [0.22 (0.14-0.28)]. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of
intrahospital deaths were associated with AE. These results suggest the need
to consider programs focused on the prevention of mortality from AE

Adverse drug events in hospitalized patients. Excess length of stay, extra
costs, and attributable mortality.

Classen DC, Pestotnik SL, Evans RS, Lloyd JF, Burke JP
Department of Clinical Epidemiology, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT 84143,
USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the excess length of stay, extra costs, and
mortality attributable to adverse drug events (ADEs) in hospitalized
patients. DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: The LDS Hospital, a
tertiary care health care institution. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to
LDS Hospital from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1993, were eligible.
Cases were defined as patients with ADEs that occurred during
hospitalization; controls were selected according to matching variables in a
stepwise fashion. METHODS: Controls were matched to cases on primary
discharge diagnosis related group (DRG), age, sex, acuity, and year of
admission; varying numbers of controls were matched to each case. Matching
was successful for 71% of the cases, leading to 1580 cases and 20,197
controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and attributable mortality, crude and
attributable length of stay, and cost of hospitalization. RESULTS: ADEs
complicated 2.43 per 100 admissions to the LDS Hospital during the study
period. The crude mortality rates for the cases and matched controls were
3.5% and 1.05%, respectively (P<.001). The mean length of hospital stay
significantly differed between the cases and matched controls (7.69 vs 4.46
days; P<.001) as did the mean cost of hospitalization ($10,010 vs $5355;
P<.001). The extra length of hospital stay attributable to an ADE was 1.74
days (P<.001). The excess cost of hospitalization attributable to an ADE was
$2013 (P<.001). A linear regression analysis for length of stay and cost
controlling for all matching variables revealed that the occurrence of an
ADE was associated with increased length of stay of 1.91 days and an
increased cost of $2262 (P<.001). In a similar logistic regression analysis
for mortality, the increased risk of death among patients experiencing an
ADE was 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 1.54-2.22; P<.001). CONCLUSION: The
attributable lengths of stay and costs of hospitalization for ADEs are
substantial. An ADE is associated with a significantly prolonged length of
stay, increased economic burden, and an almost 2-fold increased risk of
death.

If you really want to get convinced to stay out of hospitals, look up
nosocomial infection, adverse, hospital, mortality as key words in medline.
You may find as it seems to me that appx 1% die in hospitals due to BEING at
the hospital. Imagine if you were to ask the FDA if you could sell a drug
that KILLED one in a hundred?

This is almost exactly the point where I threw up my hands and declared
for Penrose.  The problem is that "causal connections", insofar as far
as I can understand them, are intrinsically counterfactual; the problem
with counterfactuals is that they are entirely subjective.  Although I
continue to try, I have not been able to devise a theory of
instantiation eliminating either of these problems.

Let's suppose that we record the tape, states, position, and actions of
a conscious Turing machine, and play it back.  Is the playback
conscious?  Probably not, because there's no causality, right?  And if
the playback was generated by quantum randomness, at some extreme level
of improbability, then the conscious being "recorded" doesn't exist yet, right?

Now let's say we run the playback, and, at each step, consult the
original state transition diagram to find out what the results *would*
have been, but then discard that result and load in the tape.  In other
words, we compute each step, at each point along the recording, but we
don't connect them causally to each other; we discard the result and
load the recorded step, even though the two happen to be identical.  Is
that Turing machine conscious?  Does it make a difference whether the
record was generated by quantum randomness, by a methodical generation
of all possible records, or by actually recording an identical Turing machine?

Let's then say that we generate each step, compare it to the record,
and, if they differ, replace the step with the data from the record.  If
the record is different in the slightest, it will prevail over the
Turing machine.  But, since data and process are identical, the Turing
process continues untouched.  Is that Turing machine conscious?  What is
the precise difference between that and the previous Turing machine?

How about if the data is loaded from the record, compared to the
intermediate step, and the intermediate step used if it's different? 
(Call this "machine Q".)  That's definitely conscious, right?  But that
would make use-the-record-if-different unconscious, right?

Since the intermediate step is never actually used, isn't that the same
as discarding it?  No?  Yes?  Why?

When we say that the Turing machine enters state X because it
encountered a 1, we mean that it would have entered state Y if it had
encountered a 0.  If a 0 would also have led to state X, we would say
that it moved Left because of the 1, because a 0 would have made it move
right.  If both a 0 and a 1 lead to the same state, we say it's being
insensitive to the data.

Let's consider a Turing machine in which the state transition diagram is
a series of double boxes; each 1 box and 0 box contains a little scrap
of paper instructing the Turing machine what to do next.  There's a
Chinese restaurant owner that runs around following the instructions
inside the box, moving counters on an infinitely long strip, keeping
track of which double box is the current state, and generally
implementing the Turing machine.

There's also a demon scurrying around that occasionally takes out one
strip, temporarily replaces it with a duplicate of a strip from the
other box (in the double-box set), and then switches it back after a
random time.  Just for fun, we'll say the demon is quantum-random.

If the demon ever tampers with a box at the time the CRO (Chinese
restaurant owner) is looking in it, and the instructions are different,
then obviously the Turing machine will malfunction.  And if the demon
deliberately watches the CRO and only replaces boxes that he never uses,
it seems intuitively obvious that the Turing machine is instantiated. 
But what if, through pure quantum randomness, the demon replaces only
unused boxes while the CRO is reading the other one?  Has the causal
connection been broken or not?

It seems to me that a theory of instantiation would have to dispense
with such counterfactuals entirely and rely on pure continuity of
isolated data, but I don't see any way to create such a theory and bind
it to physical reality.  And note in particular that such a theory looks
like it would make machine Q unconscious, which seems unintuitive in the extreme.

I agree with other list members that 'The Matrix' was an excellent movie.
In some places the movie is very intelligent and in others its not.
However, relative to the other "futuristic" movies Hollywood has offered,
'The Matrix' certainly sits in a select group at the top tier.  I also agree
we shouldn't spoil the fun for other list members by discussing details of
the movie before our list peers have a chance to see it themselves (though I
hope our list members outside the U.S. won't be too cross with us for not
waiting til the movie debuts in their locales).  Let's say that April 9th is
the date we'll start discussing the movie openly on the list.

 He thumbs his nose at traditional ways of financing basic scientific research.

 He predicts that nanotech is important enough to make the research that
the average scientist is engaged in insignificant, so people who don't
substantially adopt his viewpoint as a guide for what to research often
see his vision as a threat to their prestige or funding.

Umm, I haven't seen what they're doing lately, but the core issue seems to
be that to *think* like a human (including learning), the intellect has to
be faced with the same sorts of sensorimotor issues and answers as humans,
to the greatest extent possible. It's close (perhaps closer than
analogous) to the observation that if you want a vision system to see like
a human, it has to be fooled by the same optical illusions as a human.

Trivial example of the former: what good is a tennis racket to an insect?
How would you explain one to it? If you did, would it be able to use it?

This _is_ ironically connected to themes in _The Matrix_, by the way. :)

1.  Could you elaborate a bit?  What health choices are scientologists
making that lead to legal hassles?

2.  What does your second sentence mean? Were you suggesting that there may

I think I can stand it; I got spoilers about the Truman Show too, but
it didn't diminish my enjoyment the least. I look forward to see

In an effort to stamp out or co-op the holidays of the old religions, I
want to wish all here a happy Cryogenic Reanimation Day. The official
animal of Reanimation Day is the teddy bear, due to the bear's
hybernation abilities.

You are assuming that the zealots are quite aware enough of the activity
to object to it.

Actually, there is no federal law against euthanasia. There are several
states which allow it, while the rest ban it. The US Coast Guard would
be in a quandary as to which state to prosecute you in, and you could
easily get off since federal officials are do not have jursidiction to
enforce state laws, so if you are in international waters they are SOL.

Greenpeace needs a few more ships sunk. The Roman Catholics have no
navy, nor any coast to guard or to port ships at, while the UN has no
navy. They can issue a marque for anyone to pursue, but then again you
are dealing with a body where it takes at least a couple of the
heavyweights on the Security Council to get ANYTHING done, and all you
have to do is bribe the temporary 3rd world member who just happens to
be sitting on it that year.

Yes, this is where it might pay to set up a religion to provide the
legal protection for such activities. If it is established that
cryopreservation of living persons, euthanasia, etc are all religious
sacraments, then you can get protection pushed through, though there
will most likely be court challenges.

Unincorporated US territories are completely under federal law, as they
are federal trust territories. PR gets tax preferences as a bribe to
stay in association with us and for no other reason. They also have a
special 'commonwealth' status that our other territories do not enjoy.
If they had to pay taxes to the gringos they would have been gone a long
time ago.

Subject: "singularity" appropriated by paranoia TV?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I was channel-surfing past The Sci-Fi Channel on cable TV the other
day, and was surprised to hear the term "singularity" come from the
mouth of a character in one of the failed TV shows that the Sci-Fi
Channel picks up and recycles.

The show was "Dark Skies", an X-Files knockoff (at least, after
"The X-Files" got stuck on the UFO theme), in which an alien race
called "The Hive" is taking over Earth by implanting each of their
human victims with an insectile organism known as a "ganglion"
(as in the Star Trek: Next Generation episode "Conspiracy",
Heinlein's _The Puppet Masters_, etc. -- makes for good gross-out
footage when victims are made to spit up these squealing bugs by
being forced to drink something that looks like Phillips Milk of
Magnesia).  There's the usual government cover-up of the alien
invasion, a man and a woman who are fighting the aliens solo and
who are therefore being pursued both by the aliens and by the
government men-in-black, and the further gimmick that the story
is set in the 60s and amalgamates actual historical events (the
JFK assassination) and characters (Bobby Kennedy, J. Edgar Hoover).
It's conspiracy TV explicitly targeted at baby boomers.

Anyway, a bit of Web searching revealed that "Singularity" in
the context of this TV show refers to the final merger of a human
with the Hive (which occurs when a human who has been implanted
with a ganglion touches a ball of blue light called an "orb" -- a
human can only be freed from a ganglion, via the gross-out Milk of
Magnesia plus injections routine, before Singularity has taken
place).  By extension, Singularity may also refer to the ultimate
absorption of the human race into the Hive (one of the Usenet
fans of "Dark Skies" uses the slogan "Resist Singularity!" in
his signature file).

This suggests the inevitability of the appropriation of whatever
terminology is used in Extropian discussions (particularly once
it has become somewhat more widely-known and trendy, perhaps by
having been mentioned in "Wired" magazine or discussed on ZDTV),
by whatever passes for sci-fi in the minds of Hollywood movie
and TV producers (which, at the moment, seems to cater strongly to
UFO cultists, conspiracy theorists, and other paranoids).
The term "matrix", used by William Gibson in _Neuromancer_ simply
to refer to the "user interface" between a human and cyberspace,
is similarly appropriated by the recent movie of the same title.

All the concepts and terminology originating in "high-brow"
sci-fi (Greg Egan, for instance) will, if they can be exploited for
the economic purposes of the mass media, undergo these uncontrolled
memetic shifts as they are recycled into "low-brow" movies
and TV (not that I didn't enjoy seeing "The Matrix" this week!).
It will, no doubt, only exacerbate the political volatility of these
issues.

Ecoactivists have little to do with abortion/euthanasia, churches have
no sea power (and must mind their image, so they'll be limited to 
some verbal abuse), pirates are only a real problem in certain (mostly
coastal) regions which can be avoided, and of course the ship would
have defences (detection systems, guys with guns etc.), in fact, due
to the possibility of "pro-life" (heh) terrorist attacks, more so than most
ships. No easy target for lighty armed thugs of any ilk. Smugglers have
better things to than attacking ships. Otherwise, see pirates. This
leaves us with big nations' warships and fanatical terrorists. The only
(big) country which would be likely to attack is IMO the US, but
according to Michael Lorrey (see below) they apparently lack the 
legal fundament to take you on, so you could presumably sue them 
if they did something. As for ("pro-life") terrorist attacks, the anti-pirate
measures plus airport-style safety features at the entry point should 
keep them them out.

As one must advertize in one way or another to get customers, they'd 
probably find out fairly soon. However, the really nasty zealots usually
operate in the US. They attack the abortion clinics because they're
easy targets (close by, relatively weak defences). Shooting doctors
in or near their home is easier still. Attacking an armed ship which 
cruises the high seas is a whole different ballgame; you'll need much 
better planning and a lot more fanaticism. The chances of being blown 
to bits are *much* greater.

Assuming that the above construction is airtight, this is good news
indeed. As for the other countries: they are considerably less
militant and/or able to cause you much trouble in international
waters.

As long as you don't perform euthanasia on dolphins or

That would sacrifice the mobility, special atmosphere (cruise) and
autonomy (self-defense possibilities) in general. Also, a ship can
simply switch flags if necessary, but if you have a building you
could lose everything should your host nation decide that you're
no longer welcome.

Yes, but it would be hard to escape those anyway. Perhaps one of
the former USSR countries would also be an option.

Would (slightly modified) transhumanism qualify as a religion? Anyway,
if the US hasn't a legal base to take you on and some other country
is willing to lend you its flag, you're ok.

I have another question before we can go into that. You wrote:

How do you define this "fraction" when both the number of observers 
and the size of the universe may be infinite? If you think of 
density, note that (1) The distribution need not be uniform, so there 
can be different densities for different regions, and (2) It seems 
strange if it would matter where in the universe the observers happen 
to be, how they are grouped.

Eliezer has posed some fascinating puzzles, and I hope that people will
take the time to read them and try to give answers.

One aspect of most of these puzzles is that they focus on the issue
of playback.  I've seen several other paradoxes which also are based on
this idea.

Are playbacks of conscious calculations themselves conscious?

My approach to this problem is to look at it from the point of view of
the (simulated?) consciousness itself.  Suppose, right now, I am aware
that I am running in a computer of some sort, and that the computer's
state information will be recorded and then played back using the various
scenarios that Eliezer suggests.

To ask whether the playback is conscious is to ask, from my perspective,
might I be experiencing a playback right now?  Is this "instance" of my
consciousness the result of a dynamic, causally-determined calculation,
or the result of a passive playback?

The problem is, I can't give a meaningful answer to the question.
Any answer I could give about what larger external environment I might
be a part of cannot be correct in most cases.  Even if my consciousness
only exists during a causally based run of a computer, it could still be
run multiple times.  Each time, I will behave in exactly the same way.
(I am assuming that there are not uncomputable elements necessary
for consciousness.)  Each time, I will think exactly the same thing.
If I think to myself, "*this* instance of my consciousness is happening
on the third run of the experiment", I will think that every time.
It has to be wrong most of the time.

What, then, can I reasonably believe about the circumstances which
surround this instantiation of myself?  As I see it, I can't conclude
anything specific about them.  I might be run one time, I might be
run 1000 times, and it will feel exactly the same.  My "inner" time and
sense of conciousness has no relation whatsoever to outer time and place.
I might be run one million times slower than real time, or one million
times faster.  My brain could be simulated by a galaxy-wide computer with
one processing element per star system, with each thought taking eons.
None of this will be perceptible to me.

>From my own perceptions and senses, I can't conclude anything about the
external world.  I can't tell how many times I am instantiated; I can't
tell which particular systems instantiate me.

In particular, I can't tell whether a replay is conscious.  It might be,
or it might not be.  It would make no perceptible difference to me.

If even I, the inner conscious entity, can't tell whether a replay is
conscious, is it really a meaningful question?

Throughout the philosophy of consciousness, we continually face a
dichotomy between the objective and the subjective.  We try to link
them; computationalism and, more generlly, materialism, try to say
that there are objective facts corresponding to the subjective facts
of consciousness.

But in this case, there is no subjective fact to begin with.  There is
no subjective meaning to the question of whether a replay is conscious.
Therefore, I'd suggest, we can say that there is no objective meaning
to the matter, either.

Simply put, it is meaningless to ask whether a replay is conscious; it
is meaningless even to ask whether a second run of a conscious program
further instantiates the consciousness.  There is no subjective fact of
the matter to resolve, and so there is no objective problem which can
be solved, either.

I never expected Mr. Crocker to be wired in to the procession of Minnesotan politics, and now I am confirmed that it was wise not to offer him doubt's benefit.  Jesse Ventura is reasonably wealthy, but did not use either his own or PAC money to run for governor, depending instead on college volunteers he gathered while speaking at universities around the state, individual contributions small enough to be legal, and old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.  It is also reasonable to assume that when one is electing one's leaders, that bad publicity is not necessarily better than none, and pro wrestlers are notorious dissemblers.  Although he had gained a reputation for blunt honesty while hosting a talk radio show which had tempered this stereotype, his breakthrough came when he soundly trounced both the Democratic and the Republican candidate in a statewide televised three-way debate.  When people (whose interest had been piqued by the earnest young Vote-for-Ventura students) tu!
ned in in droves to see it, the election was all but over.  When voters can hear them unfiltered by the media, ideas still count.  In this case, they were decisive.

That's what a constitution is supposed to prevent, and why we have an amendment system; to plug loopholes whenever acquisitive beureaucrats find or create them.  However, like the medieval witchburnings, too much profit and too many jobs are supported by the War on Independent Consciousness for it to be ended until it has run its generational course (it is just a matter of time, like Tienanmen doomed Chinese Communism 30 years hence, when the friends and relatives of the persecuted rise to power - the medhemp referenda are stormy petrels, signalling the sea-change already underway).

With what?  Or or Mr. Crocker just another nihilist like Barazov ("That is not our affair.  The foundations must be cleared first.") in Ivan Turgenev's "FATHERS AND SONS"?
Neither the extreme of strongman totalitarianism nor that of radical anarchism is socially/culturally tenable; there had better be something somewhere within the golden mean with which to replace it.  There still has also been no refutation of my contention that separation of powers and constitutional democracy are necessitated by the exigencies of fairness and proportionality in a populous area peopled with individuals with conflicting interests with which any civilized human would demand that their social/cultural system be endowed.  Instead, this cogent and unrefuted analysis was deleted from the reply, to avoid the uncomfortable experience of addressing it.

I was a little upset when I watched the Matrix and finally grocked what the
concept for the film was. See, I had already invested a year into a story
board for a new music video which explored something very similar to the
movie plot core. Not to worry, later the same day, I began revising my story
board to have a optimistic twist. For some reason I'm drawn towards the more
distopian SF worlds of bladerunner, logans run, terminator, etc.. but
perhaps this is because I'm frustrated with the culture I do have. I had a
revaltion that maybe my idea my start more distopian (reflecting the current
state of the world and its bleak immediate future) and wind up in a much
more optimistic future. Its about time people began exploring amazing sci-fi
which is positive. What about an AI which is more GOD like and benevolent?
Maybe we aren't ready for the REAL world. Perhaps previous civilizations
destroyed the planet and knew that our punishment would be served in
millions of years of AI evolution and conditioning. We need to evolve
emotionally before we can integrate fully with our inventions.

 I've read there is a very good chance that a superhuman-like intellect
would smart enough not to be evil or petty. I find it interesting how humans
manafest their dark/primative sides in fictional AI brains. How many super
genius humans have been mean/evil people? Was Hitler a genius? or just good
at weaving nationalistic rhetoric?

Why would super-intelligent machines not have sympathy for animals like us?

Have any of you been following the advances of the Japanese in AI and 
Robotics?? I have a very old friend who is very into robotics and a memeber
of the robotics society of america and editor of their newsletter. He
mentioned in an article that the Japanese have a national robotics research
program in effect which is a combined effort of all major Japanese
electronics and industrial companies. Apparently they hope to be the world
leaders in robotics technology by the year 2000. Has anyone seen the P2 or
P3 robot that Honda made?? I watched a little show on the LEARNING CHANNEL
which showed this walking bipedal robot. It was more than a walker.
According to the show, it was smart too. It could fetch things from various
parts of the facility, could use tools (like powertools) and was about the
closest thing to a storm trooper I've ever seen.

I was going to attatch a photo.. But here's a nice website I found with some
great pictures for those of you who havn't seen it.

http://www.walrus.com/~pietro/newpages/919p3photo.html

btw: on another point of interest, relating to Mars colonies, someone said
they'd heard Japan announced they are entering the space race and they
recently sent a probe to Mars AND announced they are planning a manned mars
mission. Can anyone confirm or deny this based on some more legitimate
source?

I follow developments in space technology as an interested layman and can 
tell you this sounds like bunk.  The Japanese do have an active, if 
relatively small space program, but they don't have the lifting capacity to 
do anything like a manned Mars mission -- especially in the midst of a 
serious economic recession.

Do you know if they launched a probe to Mars recently? If I remember 
correctly it would have been in the last 9 months.

That's the "Planet B" mission:

       
<A HREF="http://www.spaceviews.com/1998/07/04a.html">Planet-B Launched on 
Mars Mission</A> 
       http://www.spaceviews.com/1998/07/04a.html

You can find a complete chronology of Mars exploration at:

It is not reasonable to assume that, and it's irrelevant here anyway
because the bad reputation you impute to wrestlers does not exist.
They are merely entertainers, and everyone knows that, and they have
no more of a reputation for lying than a fiction author or filmmaker
would.  I am sure Mr. Ventura's grass-roots campaigning and charming
personaility in the debates put him over the top in this election:
but he wouldn't have been there at all without the name recognition he
got from being an entertainer.  How many of those voters he swayed
in the debate would have even watched the show if he had been Harold
Schwartz, accountant from St. Paul?

I see a couple of problems with this view (I'm not saying it is 
wrong). First, ethically: does it matter if one instantiates a 
suffering-state more times than necessary? Second, epistemologically, 
given observer self-selection (i.e. that you should consider yourself 
as if you were a randomly selected observer) then it makes a 
difference whether multiply instanciated programs should be counted 
more than once. Also consider the slightly weird effect that two very 
slightly distinct programs give rise to two subjects of experience, 
but remove the slight discrepancy, and voila, there is no fact of the 
matter any longer as to whether there is one or two of them. (It's 
not hard to think of an example that combines this with the 
epistemological concern.)

This density computation has to converge, and I see two ways this can
happen when the size of the universe is infinite. The universe repeats
itself in every dimension that is infinite, or the the density computation
is weighed by a factor that decreases with the distance to a prefered
space-time position and decreases fast enough for the density to converge.

This rules out the possibility of an infinite universe that does not
repeat and does not have a prefered position, but such a universe leads to
various paradoxes so I don't think it can be logically consistent
anyway.

I agree to a large extent with David g. Medicine today is  the wrong weapon
aimed in the wrong direction.
I think the system is repairable, but not without a massive reeducation of the
public.

On your web site, you say 

> The ultimate object, remember, is for runaway positive feedback 
> to take over and give birth to something transhuman

In general I agree with that, except 
(1) It doesn't have to be "runaway" -- it will proceed at its own pace,
whatever that is. 
(2) I think in terms of IA instead of AI. The seed is within us. I am
creating an environment around myself that fosters a positive feedback
mechanism in my own mind (and body), which will lead to something --
"transhuman," maybe, although I'm increasingly uncomfortable with such
words. I just think of it as clear thought and perfect health.

I also have other aims, such as wiping hip-hop off the face of the earth,
but I don't imagine Extropians could relate to that.  

You and I have such different vocabularies that it would take a very long
time to establish communication. I don't get my philosophical vocabulary
from Hofstadter and Vinge. I thought you would understand my reference to
the ur-meme immediately. Do you understand how Judaism works as a meme? 
Have you read Everett Fox's translation of the Torah?  or Aryeh Kaplan's
translation of Sefer Yetzirah?  or Isaiah, in any translation?  or "The Art
of Biblical Poetry" by Robert Alter? I guess you don't think that sort of
thing is worth bothering with. Not to mention Frege, Wittgenstein, Austin,
Goedel (his own papers, not filtered through GEB), Rene Thom, and all the
other stuff I read. I read a lot of math -- not Hofstadter's
self-reflective stuff, but plain old math. And plain old science -- I
subscribe to Nature and read it every week; it would never occur to me to
subscribe to a science fiction magazine, or to make science fiction the
center of my thought. And plain old history, and plain old fiction and
poetry (Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Keats, Goethe, Rilke, etc). We have
both read Dawkins, but the "meme" meme by itself is not enough to establish
a common ground for discussion of ultimate goals and how to get there.   

Nevertheless there is a deep resonance here. As I read your web site, I get
an eerie sense of deja vu. I feel like I am reading my own notebooks from a
decade ago. At that time I still believed in AI. I wanted to create a new
kind of entity, not exactly a religion, not exactly a business, not exactly
a school, but a combination of all three -- a network of schools and
businesses that would make money not for its own sake but with the aim of
creating the Singularity. (I actually used that word for a while, after
going to a Terence McKenna seminar at Esalen in 1988). The whole thing was
going to be organized as a corporation called Recursive Systems. For
various reasons nothing ever came of this. I guess the main obstacle was
that I was uncomfortable with the messianic pretensions involved.  

There are three ways to get people to write checks:  

1.  Define your project as research in computer science, with potential
military applications. Explain it in terms that make sense to agencies such
as NSF and DOD (or their equivalents in some other country).  

2.  Define your project as a business. Break it down into steps, in such a
way that each step is profitable in its own right. Do the same thing with
your AI system that Stephen Wolfram did with Mathematica, or John Walker
did with AutoCad, or Bill Gates did with MS-DOS. It is still possible to
start from scratch and make billions of dollars in the software industry.
Someone will have the same dominant position in robotic software that Bill
Gates has in PC software. (This is what I meant the other day when I said
you wouldn't have to worry about money if you spent your time writing
software instead of reading the list.)    

3.  Define your project in religious terms, in such a way that people care
about it and want to see it happen. Call it Singularitarianism, or some
such ism. Or just say you are going to create the Messiah, or be the
Messiah. A lot of people will believe this and write checks, if you have
the stomach for it. It is still possible to make money with cults. I see
living proof of this every day -- I live across the street (diagonally)
from the Scientology Celebrity Center. The money pours in. There are also a
lot of preachers making a ton of money off the coming Apocalypse. But I
don't think anybody has pursued this from a specifically Jewish angle. A
lot of Jews here in Los Angeles (and elsewhere) expect the Messiah to
appear any day. The opportunity is there, for whoever wants it. I don't. If
the first one didn't come back to life after they crucified him, I don't
imagine my prospects would be any better.  

I think path #2 is the wisest choice.  

I'm not going to be writing checks for the Elisson Project, because, as I
explained in geniebusters, I think the whole thing is based on a fallacy.
To say that computing power is doubling every n years is at most a
half-truth. The number of transistors on a chip is doubling, and the clock
speed is doubling, but that doesn't imply that intelligence is doubling. It
doesn't imply that there is going to be a Singularity. It wouldn't surprise
me if, a decade from now, you write something like geniebusters, in which
you describe how it gradually (or perhaps suddenly) dawned on you that you
plus the software you create will always understand philosophy better than
the software by itself. It should be an interesting paper -- maybe better
than geniebusters, which is certainly not the last word on the subject.

I think we all agree that even if a million monkeys typing on a million
typewriters generated the paragraph above, it wouldn't make the Hal who
wrote it real.  Only Hal's brain or a simulation thereof - being
instantiated - can put actual qualia behind the statement.  It's not
enough to have the inputs and outputs in a Giant Lookup Table.  So the
question is, if the playback was generated by random chance, can the Hal
it "records" be said to exist?  Will he ever, even once, have said
"cogito ergo sum", or is there only a text-based representation of the
words?  For the purposes of this argument we are *assuming* that an
actual neuron-by-neuron simulation would make the Hal real; the question
is, *given* that, does a randomly generated recording also make Hal real?

While these ideas should be obvious to others most are not.  We take
medician and all the trickle down products almost totally for granted in
this country.

Another thing that most people do not understand is that the proceedures
and treatment done in the end stages of peoples lives serve to further
medician much more than the everyday proceedures.  It is by operating on
the person who will die in 3 months anyways that we learn how to do an
operation that will give someone 3 years of added life in the future.

Forgive me...  I've been keeping my eye on this debate for a while, and
I've got to admit that it seems to be dealing with problems which just
aren't there.

I'm a functionalist.  I think that if a thing can pass the Turing test,
that thing is conscious.  I think most people find functionalism
implausible because it claims that certain things are conscious which we
generally wouldn't expect to be conscious.  I don't actually see that as a
problem; my intuition tells me that consciousness is all around us in
places we generally don't expect.

Is a playback conscious?  Why don't we just Turing test it?  If it passes,
it's conscious.  If it doesn't, it's not.  I have a sneaky suspicion that
no ordinary playback will pass any reasonable Turing test.  Barring
extremely improbable playbacks, a playback could not answer a question
like: "I'm going to tell you a random ten digit number, and I'd like for
you to repeat it back to me: 3502580921.  OK.  What was my number?"

Descartes' "proof" is a logical joke.  If I exist, then I accept the claim
that I exist on pragmatic grounds only.  This is more than enough to
satisfy me, but some people seem to think that claims about their own
existence have a certain pre-logical ontological truth that they simply
don't exhibit.

Keep in mind that I came to this view as a result of facing the kinds
of problems Eliezer describes, if we assume that replays do potentially
create a new instance of consciousness.  I would be curious to hear
whether you have any ideas about resolving the puzzles Elizer raises.

> First, ethically: does it matter if one instantiates a

If replays cannot be detected by the consciousness, then it would not
matter if a suffering-state is re-instantiated.  This does not present a
problem for this view per se, but it does call attention to the ethical
aspects of the issue.

It has been suggested that your probability of finding yourself
experiencing some event would be proportional to the number of times
the experience was instantiated (among other things, perhaps).  But
I don't see how you could tell.  If the even numbered days of your
life were re-instantiated 1000 times, while the odd numbered days were
only run once, would you be able to detect this?

Yes, this may seem strange, but, after all, sameness is not the same
as difference.  A re-instantiation which is the same, or one which
produces no detectable difference, cannot be detected.  Only if there
are noticeable differences would there be some way to distinguish them.
This verges on tautology.

Perhaps, on even numbered days you get re-instantiated with some
perturbation.  Those days you live out an alternative version of the day,
but at the end of the day that instance is destroyed.

In this example, we are back to a one to one correspondence between
instantiations and conscious experience.  Each moment of consciousness
is instantiated only once.  So in that case it would seem meaningful to
say that the various instantiations do produce consciousness.

But isn't the conventional model of the universe, if we assume that it
is spatially open and unbounded, in exactly this form?

Would you suggest that, on philosophical grounds, we have evidence that
the universe cannot be infinite (without preferred positions)?

It seems that you are combining two ideas here: playback and randomness.

In speaking of "playback" it is simplest to consider making a record of
a calculation, and then somehow replaying that record.  As you described,
there are a number of variations of that idea.

But the question of random actions which "just happen" to mimic (or
create) consciousness output is a different matter.  This would not have
to be a replay of a previously existing consciousness.

You proposed a system with a little bit of randomness, one which is
usually lawful but occasionally makes an unplanned transition.  We could
have a knob to vary the amount of randomness, from a totally deterministic
conscious calculation to a totally random, uncontrolled series of states.

Clearly, in practice, as we move the knob from the deterministic towards
the random position the consciousness is going to begin to go bad.
It would be like zapping the neurons in your brain more and more often,
perhaps taking stronger and stronger drugs.  Eventually you go insane,
dissolve into total, chaotic madness, and (presumably) are no longer
what we would call conscious.

In practice, then, we have a clear relationship between determinism
and consciousness, controllable by the knob.  A random machine is not
conscious.

Now, it is theoretically possible that, even though the knob has dialed
in a significant amount of randomness, that we "get lucky", and the
machine happens to continue to work right.  As we move the knob more
towards the random position, this becomes less and less likely.  With
the fully random position it is astronomically unlikely.

I have seen it suggested that exploring the behavior of systems so far
from "reasonableness" is outside the range of our intuition.  Our common
sense fails as we move to the quantum level, or out to the range where
relativity holds sway.  It may be equally true that when dealing with
events which are of such extraordinary low degree of probability, that
our common sense fails there as well.

It could be that a fully random state machine which nevertheless managed
to instantiate in full and complete detail the complexity of a human
mind, thinking thoughts over an extended period of time, would in fact
be conscious.  Whatever intuition leads us to think otherwise must be
distrusted, in a realm so far from that where common sense is proven to
work.

What if it's a replay of a Turing test?

The difficulty of a machine to pass a Turing test depends on who is testing
it.  Some people are more likely to be able to fool or reveal a machine into a
state of appearing non-sentient than others, but then again, maybe the machine
would prefer that, or in general, prefer to remain known as non-sentient.

There are current AIs or other programs that can be very difficult to reveal
as such through a Turing test.  The slightest random tweak by a sentience can
make it impossible, but then this invalidates the Turing test.

This replay and record stuff seems ludicrous.  We are individual human beings
on the planet Earth orbiting our sun Sol, one of billions upon billions of
stars in our galaxy that is one of billions upon billions of galaxies in our
universe.  From most vantage points on Earth, the Earth seems quite flat.

Even if there was a super-AI that could access instantly all recorded
knowledge, and an Anthony Macroscope to review all past history for every
unrecorded physical event, there would still be things that it wouldn't and
couldn't know.  If the super-AI was sentient, that might simply be a state of
it possesing a sense of self-preservation, programming it to contemplate its
own existence is an extension of logic.

A super-AI could be an excellent judge, as it could be programmed to be
instilled with the highest sense of morals and ethics, along the lines of
jurimetrics.  If the super-AI goes wrong, then it would have to be
rehabilitated or replaced with a suitable one.  Whether multiple super-AIs
would be cooperative or competitive remains to be seen, probably a mixture as
we see in the most advanced form of sentience currently known to man, mankind.

Checks and balances on super-AIs shall be developed and maintained, perhaps by
independent AIs and humans in the loop.

Some might conjecture that humans are simply very complex machines, able to
fool themselves at Turing tests, but I would dispute that as I believe we have
some form of spirit or soul.

It seems to me that thsi whole debate becomes a littel cleaarer when
stated in terms of the ontological levels of the agents involved.

An example of an ontological level is Searle's old saw about a
simulation of a thunderstorm making the inside of the computer wet.
I wouldn't expect a simulation of a thunderstorm, or playback thereof,
to make the inside of my computer wet. But I WOULD expect it to make any
virtual cows in the same simulation  virtually wet. The virtual cows and
the virtual thunderstorm are on the same ontological level. The virtual
cows and thunderstorm are all one level DOWN from the level of the
hardware running the simulation, and of the programmer who write the
simulation.

Isn't the whole idea of a Turing test that it be done between agents on
the same ontological level? When we program a computer to attempt a
Turing test we are equipping it with sensors and knowledge about our
ontological level, and the ability to communicate to our ontological
level. We are, in short, attempting to keep the computer's processing in
the same ontological level as the hardware, instead of doing processing
in a domain one ontological level down.

>From the view of agents within simulations we create as being one
ontological level down, we can imagine the agents that are one
ontological level UP fomr us. Some theologians call them Gods.

The framework of ontological levels gives some insights to classical
theological arguments. Aquinas's arguments from First Cause can be
restated to say "Within a given ontological level, there is a first
effect, caused by an agent in a higher ontological level." Anselm's
argument can be characterized as "There is a highest ontological level."
Aquinas and Anselm characterized these statements as proves, but in fact
they are statements, which, if both proven, would serve as a prove for
the existance of God.

Returning to the point of this thread, the framework of ontological
levels sheds some light on the problem of the computability of
consciousness, especially as regards the consciousness of playbacks of
conscious agents.

Consciousness is a label assigned by one agent to another.
Postulate an ontological level containing two agents, each of whom
believe the other to be conscious. Let them make a recording of their
interactions, to the greatest level of detail their environment allows,
to their analog of the Heisenberg limit. Let one of them program a
simulation, containing two other agents. Neither of the first two agents
believes that either of the agents in the simulation is conscious.

>From OUR point of view, one ontological level up form these agents,
neither seems conscious. Both are, from our point of view, completely
deterministic, and we see no menanigful distinction between them and
their recording.

>From THEIR point of view however, the recording seems dramatically less
conscious then they are. Both agents in the original level would pass
Turing tests adminstered by the other. Neither of the agents in the
recording would pass a Turing test adminitstered by agents from the
original level. 

Playbacks are all one ontological level down from the original
matieriel, from the point of view of agents within the original
matieriel. From the point of view of agents one ontological level UP
form the original matieriel, a playback and the original would be on the
same level. Similarly, could a being on the original meaningfully
distinguish an agent one level up from a recording of an agent one level
up? 

I may be running in a simulation right now. The beings that created the
simulation are one level above me. I may create a simulation. The beings
within that simulation are one level below me. From my point of view, a
"playback" of a human being is at the same ontological level as a
simulation I write.

Tangent: How about an "Inverse Turing Test"? Where we try to write a
computer program that can distinguish humans from computers? :)

Actually, it does have to be runaway, because that's the only way we'll

Well, I'm in a bigger hurry.  IA just takes too damn long, and - also

Well, I read Dante's _Inferno_, but I also read Niven and Pournelle's
_Inferno_.  I own a few back issues of _Nature_, but I also have some
used issues of _F&SF_.  I read David Chalmers, but I also read Greg
Egan.  Science without speculation is blind (to paraphrase Einstein);
specialization is the defining characteristic of civilization (to quote
my father); the specialists in speculation are SF writers; Q.E.D.

(For those of you with no classical education, Q.E.D. stands for "quod

Well, everyone feels that - the trouble is that everyone seems to have

I'm a Specialist, so every generalist is going to see a piece of
themselves in me.  That's what a Specialist *is*.

Well, looking back on my own ideas of the Phoenix Academy, I'd say the
main obstacle was that it was a blatantly impractical, philosophically
grounded fantasy with no connection whatsoever to reality.

Heh.  Any sort of computer war in the next few decades is probably going
to be a war of Specialists - if I wanted to specialize in cracking, I
could basically just walk through anything that hadn't been designed by
my equivalent.  And Elisson in its infancy could toast any human,
including me.  Despite this, my Web pages have been up for two years and
the Men in Black haven't come for me yet.

Framing ultratechnology as military reseach sounds very risky.  It's
exactly the sort of attention we ought to avoid.

If I were going into the software business, I wouldn't try to write a
limited AI, because that sort of project would inevitably fail, unless I
abandoned the Elisson paradigm entirely and wrote a Webmind-like
"crystal intelligence".  I can beat the best AI on the market, but not
with crippleware that I'll spend the rest of my life supporting.

I'm sorry, but at this present time - my ethics, being based on
knowledge instead of oaths, are always subject to change - I view the
world as being composed of equals, people who have as much right as I do
to make decisions based on knowledge.  I do not view the world as being
composed of manipulable components.  At this present time, I do not
intend to lie to people about the Singularity.  I simply don't know
enough to lie.

And if I did, it wouldn't work, so I really don't know why I'm talking
about ethics.  Go down this path and Singularitarianism will become
another cult.  The Singularity has to be the spearhead of the scientific
and computer community, not a religious cult hiding in the corner.

Besides, every religious person with three ounces of brains knows damn
well what the Singularity is, in their philosophy, about five seconds
after they hear about it.  They don't need it pounded into them with a
sledgehammer and they'd be rightfully suspicious if we tried.

When people ask me "Where does God fit into all this?" I tell them that
it's bloody well obvious, but if I came out and said so, I'd be claiming
God's support, which I don't intend to do unless God comes out and says
so.  I think this is a perfectly true thing to say, from everyone's perspective.

No kidding.

Well, I can understand that.  If it weren't for my belief that *I* can
do it, I'd say that Hofstadter and Lenat have another twenty years of
the kind of work they did in their prime, and almost everyone else is
hopeless.  Take a look at _Coding_.  Eight fundamental principles, not
one; no philosophical grounding; and qualities that are recognizably
unique to the human brain, not just mammalian brains in general.

"Probably the most intelligent question I get asked about the

mean we know how to use it.  Can we really program an Artificial

Not if the software learns to enhance itself, in which case I no longer
necessarily understand the software.  Besides which, philosophy has been
the bane of AI since its inception.  Paradigm Numero Uno in Elisson is "Pragmatism".

I seem to have made a dire mistake. I think it's Christian Scientists,
rather than Scientologists, who have grappled with the courts several
times in order to preserve their health care choices (refusing certain
medical procedures) for their own children. Recent Scientology issues
in Germany, as they vaguely reached me through the news, might have
led me to this possible misunderstanding.

I'm not sure whether Jehovah Witnesses have found themselves in a
similar situation concerning blood transfusions for children, which
people of the JW persuassion reject.

I'm fully aware that health care choices don't amount to the same as
euthanasia in the eyes of the court. However, defenses and arguments
may have been raised during these proceedings which might prove useful
in a legal strategy defending euthanasia.

I'm also fully aware that Dr. Kevorkian is finding himself up the
creek without a paddle on this very same issue.

>2.  What does your second sentence mean? Were you suggesting that there may
>be some American states which are receptive to euthanasia? Please clarify.

I don't think every single state has actually ruled against euthanasia
yet. Therefore, there's the possibility that one of those states might
not rule against euthanasia on a test case. The problem is that the
federal government might come up with legislation that'd override
state laws and force state courts to revert or issue adverse rulings
in following cases.

In my view, the idea of a vessel or haven where a person may resort to
a merciful abridgement of bodily waste and suffering (euthanasia), and
also acquire some measure of hope for defeating and perhaps even
reversing the ravages of disease in the future (cryogenics), is a
notion worth following. Despite the enormous amount of research and
effort this endeavor might demand, I still think it's worth pursuing.

Yes.

Ah, Mr. Lorrey, we could amicably debate this one for a while.

Not every US constitutional provision applies to Puerto Rico.
Specifically (though not exclusively), the Second Amendment has been
found not to apply to Puerto Rico. Any provisions regarding "states"
are likewise inapplicable. Openly espousing and laboring for the local
equivalent of "secession" isn't a crime in that island, a very
different story from incorporated states. And not all block grant
funds are available to their government.

Puerto Rico was never a trust territory: it's spoils from the
Spanish-American War.

The Northern Marianas now enjoy a commonwealth status similar to
Puerto Rico's.

Puerto Rican statehooders are seeking full admission into the Union.
However, leaders have historically told their followers that they
would be exempt from paying taxes (Can you believe the gall of the
leaders... and the gumption of the followers?) They've been told
recently that, since Puerto Rico's tax rates are IDENTICAL to federal
ones, they'd simply deduct their taxes, add the Earned Income Credit
and come out clean.

Conversely, they could simply deduct their federal taxes from the
state taxes and spare themselves the double whammy. I gather in this
setup San Juan would simply mooch every last penny of its bloated
wastrel budget from Washington. Obviously, a pipe dream.

The point is that they're used to paying the same ridiculous federal
rates we suffer on the mainland, although they enjoy a few more
deductions.

Most Puerto Ricans are too fond of their US citizenship to let go. The
independentists stand for assorted flavors of socialism, something
that sits ill in light of Cuba's experience. But most of them are also
too fond of their own culture, which many of them feel would be
jeopardized under statehood (funny, it hasn't vanished in the last 100
years of American sovereignty). Add that to a corrupt pro-statehood
government and breakaway defeatism among the independentist ranks,
plus generalized outrage at the format of the last referendum, and you
can see why commonwealthers were successful in garnering a majority
vote under the "none of the above" option last Xmas and once again
dodged the status issue.

>From what I've observed, our concepts of transhumanism and extropy
would meet with some stunned minds over there: technological change is
readily embraced by highly educated postwar generations in the island;
but the notion of self-rule in all aspects of life would simply meet
some resistance and take a long time to register. Government looms
much larger in that island than stateside: their atrocious economy
makes over 30% of their workforce dependent on goverment jobs.

They might crash into Hispaniola.

Seriously, we've been trying to let them sail off. But that's one
deeply dug-in anchor they've got on US citizenship and the more
popular ideas on freedom.

Were Puerto Rico unilaterally released from Congressional and White
House bonds, we might see the same exodus reaction experienced by Hong
Kong when it was repatriated to China. Although I don't think the vast
majority of Puerto Ricans would become independentists overnight
simply because they were granted independence, the generalized
nightmare is that, somehow, the small group of independentists and
their socialist ideals would take over the government.

Above all, there's the dread of losing the general liberties enjoyed
by Americans stateside. After all, these are American citizens we're
talking about: they know and appreciate the liberty-oriented ideals
permeating our society. And they fear swift erosion of those liberties
under any form of outright socialism.

So, short of a Congressional decree, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
will be around for a long while.

A. Eleusyan

P.S. The metaphor of letting them "sail off into the sunset" was a
bona fide pun, considering the subject of the original thread.

I know who Vernor Vinge is (and I've read _Marooned In Realtime_), if
that's what you mean.

I was just pointing out that whatever discourse is generated by the
people associated with this mailing list (such as Eliezer Yudkowsky's
piece _Staring Into The Singularity_) would likely have connotations
unintended by their authors, if the terminology invented or used by
the original authors is picked up by TV writers as a bit of contemporary
trendiness to be worked into what passes for sci-fi on television
these days (much of which is technophobic, fearful of the future,
conspiracy-minded, paranoid, etc.).

I was a little shocked to find that this already seems to have
happened with the term "singularity", though since the TV show in
question seems to have come and gone rather quickly, the
"re-branding" isn't likely to be widely disseminated.  I don't
know if one of the writers on _Dark Skies_ plucked the term
"singularity" out of the region of discourse adjacent to this
mailing list and its members, or whether it was chosen
independently, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were the former.

If the universe is not infinite, what is it that lays infinitely beyond it?

I put forward that beyond our universe is absolute vacuum with no light, and
beyond that approximately infinitely more universes in various stages of
expansion and contraction.  Similarly to how we might astronomically observe
protostars forming and supernovae, perhaps somewhere right now a new universe
is experiencing its Big Bang, and another is contracting to either a super
black hole or a proto-universe to explode again.

Where two expanding universes collide, there shall be much energy.  Crossing
the barrier or region between two universes might be possible or impossible.
Two universes colliding is a wave of energy from each universe colliding at
almost the speed of light.  I believe relativity holds true as we can see
from the redshift phenomenon.  There are some redshift anomalies, but
evidence points towards the Big Bang theory.

Alternately, there is an ontological plane above ours where our universe is
an experiment in a test tube.

Of course, similarly, all the universes in an infinity of space might simply
be an occurrence in a higher level ontological plane.

An approximately infinitely long time ago, prior to the Big Bang, if it
occurred, either something existed, or nothing existed, on our ontological
plane.

I would suggest the term Universe (capitalized) to represent all the
universes in an infinity of space, conjecturally.  I would suggest the term
Metaverse to represent all things.

Infinity, i, or oo, is a scalar number increase without bounds in one
dimension.  Infinity, I, is i in i dimensions.

That makes sense.  Too many prima donnas in the scientific establishment;
they would rather try unsucsessfully to blaze their own paths to glory then
to latch on to another scientist's programme.

This also explains why the Japanese have focused so much more effectively on
nanotech then us.  Their willingness to line up behind a visionary leader,
even a foreign luminary, has paid dividends for them in the past (remember
Demming?).  I'll put my long term money with Nippon Nano.

I'm surprised there is not more outcry against this. What this court decision
means is YOU don't own your life, the government does. It can decide when you
die, whether in an execution chamber or on the battlefield, but you cannot. This
is purely a decision which openly says we are all enslaved to the government.

Yes it is. Hoping to base such operations on land somewhere with a freindly or
bribable government is, IMHO too risky, as most penny ante countries will bend
over at the first cough from one or more of the big boys.

However, logical analysis suggests that the distance between any two universes in
the infinite vacuum would also be infinite. Read and understand the following:

a) The odds of a universe beginning are infinitessimally small, a finite
probability.
b) The lifespan of of the average universe is also finite.

therefore, c) follows:
c) There are a finite number of universes in existence in the true vacuum at any
given time.

If this is true, then a finite number of universes spread through infinite amount
of true vacuum makes the average distance between two universes infinite.

Because of this, no two unverses can collide. Prof. John Cramer has suggested
that it may be easier to build a wormhole between two different universes than
between two points in the same universe. Why? Because if you have two ends of a
wormhole within finite distance of each other you will generate a causal loop,
which is amplified in proportion to the amount of relativistically caused
temporal shift between the time frames of the two ends. When you have such a
shift, as has been posited for a wormhole used for time travel, you will get some
matter which goes back in time through the wormhole, then travels back to the
original mouth, and goes back in time again, etc, eventually causing so much
matter to travel in this loop that you cause the universe to implode.

Universes as we know them are merely aberrations in the stability of the true
vacuum. It cannot be a perfect vacuum, because perfection is unstable.

I'm not surprised at all. People apparently already accept that they 
don't own their minds and their bodies (war on drugs and other 
victimless crime), so taking away the ownership of their life
(what's left of it) isn't that big a deal. And then there's religion:
"we are but unworthy servants, oh Lord..." Don't you just looove
auto-oppression. Like I said, no surprise here...

This is an interesting way to look at it, but the specific analysis

I don't think it would necessarily have to be done that way.
Theoretically one simulated being could question another at the same
ontological level.  Suppose we have a thriving AI community, generally
accepted as being conscious, and a new design of AI is created.
Suppose they all run a million times faster than our-level humans,
so that a Turing test by one of us against one of them is impractical.
The other AIs could question the new one, and all are at the same level.

> Consciousness is a label assigned by one agent to another.

I would say, rather, that consciousness is an inherent property of some
class of agents.  Some agents may believe that others are conscious or
not, but they may be mistaken.

Your intention is that the simulation replays the interaction between
the original two agents?  This is different from what we have been
considering, because the recording in your example is effectively
one level down from the original interaction.  From the point of view
of the agents, the original interaction occured in "the real world"
but the recording is taking place in some kind of simulation.

What we were discussing (as I understood it) was the case where the
recording was of an interaction one level down from us.  We would then
play back the recording in some kind of machine, also one level down
from us.  So there is no difference in the levels between the original
interaction and the playback.

You have introduced an extra variable: not only must we distinguish
between recording and playback, but also we now have to contend with
issues introduced by having the playback be at a lower level than the
recording.  This complicates the problem and will make it more difficult
to identify the fundamental issues.

Why would we see these agents as unconscious?  Just because they are
deterministic?  Where did that come from?  There's no reason I can see
that determinism rules out consciousness.  Some might say that it rules
out free will, but even if they don't have free will they could still
be conscious, couldn't they?

Not everyone would agree that the recording is less conscious than them,
just because it is one level down.  That is the issue we are trying to
understand better.  Some people might argue that recordings are equally as
conscious as the original, no matter what level they are instantiated in.
Not everyone would hew to the strict Turing test you are using here.

I have no clue why, but even when I have a backlog of over a hundred

How is this better than a dual-level government, where states make the laws
and the national government is responsible for national defense and
enforcing the constitution?  The PPA-based system is likely to have more
variety and less actual taxation, which might appeal to some people.
However, it would seem to have two important defects:

First, police protection is available only to those who can pay for it.  The
indigent will have no protections at all, and the poor will often have
significant periods of vulnerability while they are between jobs or
otherwise having trouble paying their bills.

Second, the PPA scenario offers nothing similar to the protections of a bill
of rights.  Individuals have only those rights that their PPA agrees to
enforce, and enforcing rights costs money.  It is not at all clear to me
that the market will force them to offer the kind of deal we really want -
they can easily collude with each other to fix prices, exempt themselves
from prosecution, crush small rivals through
assassination/bribery/blackmail, and so on.

Perhaps if we came at the problem from the other direction?  We could have a
national government that acts to force local governments to respect a
substantial body of individual rights, and a large number of local
governments that handle law enforcement.  Localities could hire private
firms to do their police work, run courts, and so on, but the ability to
make new laws would remain with elected officials.

Anything doing a Turing test is necessarily at the same level as the
agent it is testing. Whether this is done through robotics (giving the
processor information about our level) or by creating an avatar within
the computer's layer, we have bridged the gap. You can attempt to do a
Turing test with an agent in the layer below you, but as you have access
to or complete knowledge of all of that agent's internal states, the
agent is unlikely to succeed.

Conversely, you could attempt to administer a Turing test on an agent in
the layer above you, but He might not care all that much. :)

That's the whole trick. "Inherent properties" are only held within
layers. The "wetness" of rain, an inherent property, only makes sense at
the same ontological level as the rainstorm. To us, a simulated
thunderstorm does not have this "inherent property".

Actually my point is that, form the point of view of the agents being
recorded, ALL recordings are /automatically/ one level down from the
original.

My point is that any comprehensive theory of consciousness must address
the perception/detection of consciousness across varying levels. There's
no reason to be chauvinistic about OUR level, simply because it's the
one our sensors are hooked to :)

My basic thesis is that the assignation of the label 'conscious' (as
used in normal conversation) depends on the respective levels of the
agents involved.

Yes I have. The 'extra variable', that of varying ontological levels
between the agents, is the generalisation that lets us resolve the
paradox of why a complete recording of one of us does not seem conscious
from our point of view, yet does seem conscious from it's point of view.

Apolpgies. I'm making the assumption that most people would rather not
refer to a recording of themselves as conscious, but would like to refer
to themselves as conscious. What I'm attempting to do here is come up
with an definition that resolves the paradoxes inherent with, but is
true to people's conversational definitions.

Strictly speaking, as deterministic simulations running on hardware in
the layer above, NONE of these agents have free will. Someone here
(apologies, I forget who) defined free will as "an inability to predict
one's future actions to an arbitrary degree". Under that definition it
is perfectly possible for agents to believe themselves to have free will
when they do not. Actually, it's not so much determinism that rules out
consciousness (form the agent's own point of view) as it is lack of
instantiation. The only good definition we have for instantiation is
that "it's the thing that everything we can physically interact with has
had done to it."

The ontological layer model allows us to see the identity between a
static recording one level up, and our apparently instantiated reality
here.

With all due respect, not everyone is entirely certain on just what
consciousness is.

Fundamentally, "conscious" is a symbol attributed to agents by agents.
All I'm saying is that the relative ontological level has considerable
bearing on the appllcation of this symbol, and that agents at different
levels are not treated the same as agents at our level.

You said earlier that "consciousness is an inherent property of some
class of agents." The assignation of all other "inherent properties"
changes across ontological levels. Why should consciousness be any
different.

We say the virtual thunderstorm is virtually wet. I say the simulated
personality, or the deterministic playback of a human personality is
"virtually" conscious.

P.S. I'm assuming that the primary difference between a recording and
the original is that we have access to all of the recording in advance,
i.e. that it is deterministic.

P.P.S. Consciousness is a label applied by agents to agents. Thsi label
may be applied correctly or incorrectly. The validity of the Turing test
notwithstanding, I'm basically just assuming for the sake of argument
that a good test for "consciousness" exists, and that the agents are
using it, so I can illustrate the whole concept of ontological levels
without getting bogged down in what precisely the agents are doing to
each other.

P.P.P.S Sorry about all the typos in the original.

Conclusion: the universe contains agents at various ontological levels
(at least two: Our level and the level of software agents we create
(which are very simple now, but won't necessarily always be that way.)).
Whether these agents, or deterministic recordings thereof are
"conscious" depends on the relation of their ontological level to that
of the observer. Whether a thunderstorm is wet depends completely on
your point of view, ontologically. Similarly, whether an agent is
conscious depends largely on your point of view, ontologicaly. 

Hal, I'm actually agreeing with you, that consciosuness is an "inherent
property." It's just that, using ontological levels, the idea of
"inherent property" becomes variable with respect to the ontological
level of the observer.

Further: It may be possible to characterize ontological levels in terms
of webs of possible causal relationships. A object can physically
interact with all objects in it's ontological layer, and all objects
beneath it. An object cannot interact with objects in the layer above
it, excpet by passing information.

This particular case was not that simple.  The ALS patient in this
case was physically capable of making the willful act necessary to
end his own life (when appropriately attached to an apparatus for
this that Dr. K uses frequently), but in this case he did not--the
Dr. actually took that act.  "Consent" is not so clear here.  If
he was capable of expressing a desire to die, and capable of doing
the act, why didn't he?  I certainly don't think suicide should be
a crime, even when assisted, but if a patient /can/ perform the
final act himself but /will/ not, then I think his verbal consent
is of dubious value, and it is appropriate for a jury to look into
questions such as whether the family pressured the doctor into
performing the procedure, or whether the doctor's own agenda was
better served than the patient.

I am having trouble understanding your definition of consciousness.
It may be different enough from my own that the conclusions you draw
will not have any applicability, from my point of view.

Would you say that the fact of your own consciousness is relative to
the observer?  Suppose we are living in a computer simulation.  Would you
say that an observer from outside that simulation would be justified in
saying that you are not conscious, that you have no more consciousness
than a rock?

How can you trust any observer's claims in this regard, no matter how
privileged his position?  You think, therefore you are conscious, to
paraphrase Descartes.  If someone else thinks you aren't conscious,
they are simply mistaken.

Now, maybe you have a definition of consciousness in which you view it
as a relative matter, so that by your definition there is a sense in
which you really aren't conscious, from the point of view of an outside
observer.  But in that case, isn't there still some unnamed property
which you have and which a rock does not?  You don't want to call it
"consciousness", but isn't there a fundamental awareness that you have
and that no observer's conclusions can take away from you?

Hello, Extropians :

I'm new to the list.

In reviewing some of the recent discussions, I thought
you all might be interested in the Santa Fe Chaos Conference -
brief info attached.

Jim Pinto
<jimpinto@actionio.com>

------------
7th Annual Chaos in Manufacturing Conference

For additional information, visit http://www.barn.org

Seven years ago, industry visionary Richard Morley and a handful of
forward
thinkers came together at the first Chaos in Manufacturing Conference.
Today, the conference remains the premier event to examine the theory
and
practice of extending the new paradigms to the manufacturing and process
organizations.  Held near the prestigious Santa Fe Institute, the
conference presents a unique opportunity to interact with the
leaders in the field in an intimate setting.  These and other luminaries
from the manufacturing and process control world will present cutting
edge
seminars and workshops on the science of complexity, providing attendees
with new concepts, and an understanding of tools and techniques that
will
provide them and their companies with an unfair advantage to start the
next
century.

Through lectures, workshops, and informal discussion groups, the seminar
will provide attendees with insights to increase their competitive
position
and to foster career growth.  Participants will join a community of
equally
forward thinking men and women in a relaxed New Mexico setting.  The
conference is
cross-discipline, drawing on work that is being done in other fields,
allowing attendees, through intellectual stimulation and interaction, to
extract lessons that can be applied to their particular situations.

The annual Santa Fe Chaos in Manufacturing Conference is presented by R.
Morley Incorporated (RMI), a global leader in the application of
complexity
science in engineering and manufacturing.  Dick Morley,
president of RMI, revolutionized the manufacturing world in 1968 with
his
invention of the programmable logic controller and continues as a
visionary
in the fields of manufacturing, engineering, and computer design to this
day.

It's also worth noting that Kevorkian badly bungled his trial strategy.
He was not able to use his previous attorney because of Kevorkian's
insistence on representing himself so that he could make speeches directly
to the jury.  The lawyers he did have assisting him made a number of
errors, including stipulating that the element of "malice" necessary for
a conviction of murder need only entail a desire to see the victim dead,
without the aspect of hatred or desire to cause harm which is normally
required.  I saw a bit of Kevorkian's attempt at lawyering on TV and he
was utterly incompetent (unsurprisingly).  He was not able to get the
relatives of the victim onto the stand due to a lack of creativity in
exploiting the hearsay exceptions (the earlier stipulation hurt badly
here as well).

Unfortunately it appears that the Michigan legal system is strongly
opposed to Kevorkian and has been trying to get him convicted for years.
His (original) attorney stated in no uncertain terms that Jack Kevorkian
would _never_ get a conviction overturned in the Michigan appellate
courts, under any circumstances.  At this point it seems virtually certain
that the elderly Kevorkian will spend the rest of his life in prison.

The "Right to Die" or rather right to receive a euthanasia is already legal in some
states.  Euthanasia is only separated from murder, the taking of life without
consent,  by express or implied consent, express in the case of those that request
it being of sound mind, and implied through such measures as a "Living Will."  I
think it should only be sanctioned after psychiatric evaluation.

In this country, the United States of America, we have a system of appellate
courts.  Kevorkian's trial and judgment leads to the next stage, where Kevorkian
might file an appeal.  Kevorkian and the case judged against him is not necessarily
the best representative of euthanasia rights.  This is an issue for the Supreme
Court at some point.

I do not have any desire to die.

The distance between two universes might approach infinity, but would not be
infinity, and there would still be an infinity of space left for the rest of the
universes.  In terms of scale that a human can comprehend, the distance is very
large.  This average distance between universes is approximately infinitely small
compared to infinity.

The distance is not infinity, although it approaches infinity.  There would still be
an infinity of space left for the rest of the universes.

Ipso facto, two universes can collide.

Dimensional travel other than conventional 3-D in 4-D (space through time) travel
would be the way to get around.

Entropy exists.  All of the universes in all space taken together at one time
represent 3-dimensional totality, that is, the Universe.  I use the term totality,
another idempotent or synonymous term might be unity.

OK.  Then, the Multiverse represents totality in i dimensions, as well as whatever
else there might be.  There might be a difference between totality in i dimensions
and All, as a higher ontological plane than that by definition exists.

Scalar infinity, oo, in some form, is probably the square root of negative one.

It is a question of delegation. If we are to apply your logic to other areas
of rights, then only people who have served in the military to defend the
nation have a right to enjoy the rights protected by that government. I have
a right to defend myself in court. The fact that I delegate the power to
execute that defense to an attorney does not negate my right to a defense,
but under your logic it would. The patient of Kevorkian has been documented
as being of sound enough mind to delegate his wishes to another who was more
capable of executing them than he.

If a person is frozen by fright on the edge of a cliff, does that mean that
they don't wish to be rescued?

What paradoxes do you have in mind?

The Big Bang is a singularity but not really a position. 
Immediately after the Big Bang, if the universe is open or flat, the 
universe was spatially infinite. So if you assign number 1 to the Big 
Bang, what spacetime point is number 2?

What are these grounds? (You referred to "various paradoxes"--which

eleusyan said in part..

>I'm not sure whether Jehovah Witnesses have found themselves in a
similar situation concerning blood transfusions for children, which
people of the JW persuassion reject.

Minor Jehovah's Witnesses who have medical problems requiring blood
transfusions in the opinion of physicians often find that courts interpose
themselves and sometimes force blood transfusions.

Over the last 10 years dozens of bloodless surgery centers have opened...at
first to cater to Jehovah's Witnesses, and lately to serve those who wish to
eliminate exposure to AIDS, hepatitis et al.

search www.excite.com under "bloodless surgery" as well as medline.

If this simulation is based on a human (or even animal) mind, the two states
will almost never be the same.  Most of what happens in the mind is
probabilistic, not mechanistic - so if you simulate the same 100ms of
processing a million times, you will get a million slightly different end
states.

Now, I don't know whether this is a necessary property of a conscious mind
or not, but it seems entirely plausible that it might be.  If it is, then
you need a Turing machine with a random number generator to run a mind as
software, and the whole system has very different properties than an
algorithmic program.  However, we don't need to get lost in metaphysics to
figure out how this kind of system will behave - we just have to accept that
we can't predict its future states with any great degree of precision.

I don't think this observation actually solves the problem at hand, but it
does close off a lot of blind alleys.

Depends on what "states" are and on what is in the constitution.  
You could say I'm describing a minimalist constitution with voluntarily
chosen "states."

My minimalist proposal explicitly included PPA "anti-trust", which deals
with these collusion/crushing concerns.  

My proposal was designed to set aside your "it won't work" objections 
and see if a core of paternalism remained.  Your concern that people 
won't choose to buy as much poverty insurance, police protection, or 
bills of rights as you think they aught seems exactly such a core of 
paternalism.  Even when it seems workable, you don't want to let other
folks make these choices for themselves.

I agree that the patient has a right to delegate the act; I just think
we must apply greater scrutiny to the question of whether or not he has
in fact done so.  When the consequences of an action are great, a
greater level of certainty about consent is often required: sitting at
a table and ordering a meal in a restaurant is sufficient implied consent
to pay for the meal in our culture that no explicit contract--even oral--
is needed.  On the other hand, to delegate to someone the right to
sell your house requires a signed and notorized power of attorney,
because we don't want such an action taken lightly.  Consent to have sex
requires no written agreement, but does require an age limit to
ensure sufficient understanding of the consequences.

Is not the case of causing someone's death an example where we must
apply the very highest standard of consent to guard against mistake or
misunderstanding?  I'm sure I have uttered words like "just kill me
now" or something similar in frustration; if those were videotaped, I
would not want them used as a defense if someone murdered me.  I think
it is a good thing for a jury to look into the question of consent in
this case.  They found that Kevorkian went overboard, and I am not so
sure that they were wrong (I'm still hedging here, though, because the
jury may have been swayed by the law rather than justice).

If Mr. Kevorkian was actually executing the patient's wishes, I have
no problem with that.  I'm just not yet convinced he was.

> If a person is frozen by fright on the edge of a cliff, does that 
> mean they they don't wish to be rescued?

An interesting case.  If I fail to rescue, I may or may not be
following eir wishes, but the results of my failure will be drastic,
so I am inclined to say that I would rescue absent clear instructions
not to (judging consent by the consequences again).  If I rescue em
against eir will, I have committed a tort, but I have done little
damage.  I can live with that.

I also remember hearing that Dr. K stated that, if convicted and jailed, he
would fast until he died.  I wonder to what degree he was just getting old
and tired and wanted a showdown before he himself died.  This may be why he
chose to make the injection himself rather than allow the patient to pull
his own plug, and possibly why he chose to represent himself in court.   He
must have known that this would increase the probability of his conviction.
Maybe he intended to go to jail all along where his own suicide, the
ultimate expression of his belief in the right to die, would have a greater
chance of turning him into a martyr.

Better yet, do an IPO, selling stock in the government corporation, and let
the new board of directors deal with the succession...question: How much
could a corporation with $6 trillion in debts get for its stock? Would they
have to go with junk bonds?

>Are playbacks of conscious calculations themselves conscious?

This question gives me a feeling of deja-vu...

mind: a continuously reactive processor of highly local stimuli on
exosomatic (mainly) receptors which seeks to modulate stimuli prospectively
in order to optimize the stimuli's congruence with stored and ongoing models
of desired self and universe to achieve/restore equilibrium state. Where
this fails, external stimuli induces modification of interior mind models,
or failing this, pathological feedback loops eventually resulting in
"moebius trips".

In that case, you could equip your TM with a deterministic random
number generator.  Cryptographic RNGs can be created very practically
which are thought to be indistinguishable from true random numbers using
even astronomical amounts of computing power.  These results are not yet
proven, but if you can distinguish the output of the "Blum Blum Shub"
RNG from randomness, you can easily factor large numbers, which is
thought to be impossible.

If this actually makes a difference in whether consciousness is created
or not it would imply that consciousness is non-computational in nature.
It would also imply the existence of zombies (beings which behave
just like conscious beings but aren't actually conscious), since the
resulting TM would act conscious (or else it somehow acts as an oracle
for factoring huge numbers, which would certainly be unexpected).

A a deterministic RNG is just another computer program, so if a
thus-augmented TM produced consciousness, then the replay paradoxes
still apply.  It does not appear that an appeal to randomness resolves
the difficulties.

The question here is about the marginal health consequences of medicine,
*averaging* over all the things medicine does.  Some things may help, but
when averaged in with other things that hurt, the average could be zip.

This study looks at total mortality in each region, and everyone in a 
region eventually dies.  Everyone also has some spending level in their 
last six months.  I don't see a selection bias here.   

>Statistical significance is a real problem with medical studies;

The figure I gave you, of less than one part in a thousand mortality 
benefit, was a 95% confidence level figure.   5 million people is enough
to see real effects.  Consider also that people have seen effects 
of fat, excersize, social status, etc. with far less data.

Given the small population of MSA users and the recency of MSA adoption,
I'd be very suprised if any reasonable study has been done.  

Btw, the main problem with MSAs in practice is price discrimination.  
The average actual hospital bill is about 1/4 of the list price charged 
to folks that just walk in the door.  Group purchasing is essential to get
a low price, but most MSA folks don't get group prices.

There are lots of cases when people ask others to perform acts they
can, but don't want to, perform personally, for various reasons.
I can ask somebody to massage my feet or move my furniture to 
another location.  Such acts are perfectly legal if I perform them
myself, and highly objectionable if performed by somebody else
without my consent.  However, procedures of expressing consent in
all such cases are quite clear and commonly accepted.
The fact that identical procedures are not accepted in the case of
suicide, only seems to indicate the unwillingness of the society to
apply normal logic to the touchy subject of suicide.

It seems to me that his goal is to starve himself to the point where the
government will keep him alive on a nutritive IV drip, so his lawyers can then
get him classified as a political prisoner.

My concern is not that people will voluntarily choose to forego these
services, but rather that they will not be able to obtain them.  You can
only buy what someone is willing to sell.

Much of anarcho-capitalist theory rests on an implicit assumption that a
market for law will work much like other markets, in that ordinary market
forces will lead to companies offering whatever mix of services the public
actually wants.  I believe that what evidence we have, both historical and
theoretical, does not support this theory.  Instead, I expect that whatever
private institutions are given the power to initiate the use of force will
use this power to short-circuit market feedback to their own benefit.

Your proposal would address some of the problems with PPAs by ensuring that
they do not simply band together and set up some kind of oligarchy.  It did
not address the more subtle ways that PPAs can use force to gain competitive
advantages, or the other less obvious problems with such schemes.  These
problems are important, because they can easily lead to abuses just as bad
as the government atrocities we are trying to avoid.

If I'm not conscious, I'm not in a good position to administer the test,
that's true.  However, on a pratical level, I more or less have to assume

The Turing test, like all other tests, needs a control.  It should
therefore e performed against both a computer and a human.  If the testers
are equally likely to confuse the two, then the AI passes.

As far as the AI deceiving us into thinking it's unconscious...  we would
have exactly the same problem if a person pretended behaved as if they were
severely mentally disabled.  So long as they kept the performance
consistent and fairly convincing, we would have no way of telling if the
person was faking or not.

What's the point of a distinction when there is no possible way to
differentiate?  This is my philosophical pragmatism kicking in here.

Erm, actually, I have to agree with Crocker here.  Assisted suicide,
unlike other forms of assistance, closes off the possibility of getting
confirmation from the service recipient.  The benefits of legalizing
assisted suicide are outweighed by the problems, at this stage in
technology and medical ethics.  Legalizing ordinary suicide addresses
the only real problem.  What I'd really like to see would be life
insurance that pays off if you suicide with an incurable illness, but
we're not likely to see that unless the health insurance people start squawking.

These two claims are clearly contradictory.  We cannot both accept the
claim that "any given ontological level has a higher ontological level" and
"there is a highest ontological level."  The highest ontological level has
no higher ontological level, violating the first claim.

What subtle schemes/problems do you have in mind that would not be
handled by my proposed "PPA anti-trust law"?  (Shemes that can make sense
of your concern that no bill of rights is guarenteed, or that 
the poor won't buy enough police.)

The list "sing@onelist.com" has been created.  (It would have been
"singularitarian@onelist.com", but onelist includes the list name in
each subject line, so...)  The list will officially be launched April
11th, 1999 - please don't post until that time.

Please read the following before registering to subscribe:
http://pobox.com/~sentience/singularitarian/list.html

You may register to subscribe at:
http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/sing

The list is restricted, meaning that each subscription needs to be
approved.  Please subscribe now, so that I can "process" everyone by the
time the list is launched.  After registering, please send me email with
the subject line "SING:  Your Name".  If I don't already know who you
are, please include either (1) your intended first post, (2) a reason
why I should be begging you to join or (3) some assorted other
information, as described below and on the page.  Please don't be
insulted if you get turned down; it's a specialized list.

If you're a friend of someone who isn't on Extropians but would be a
highly valuable reader of the list, please forward this message to them.
 But please read the page first, so you know which readers are in demand.

==

I will be posting the following.  (Others may have their own posts, of course.)

* Some data on how the average Internet user reacts to the Singularity.
* Commercial potential and project requirements of Elisson and other AI.
* A few business ideas I've been thinking of.

Summary:

The Singularitarians are interested in bringing about the Singularity, as
fast as possible, through the creation of various "ultratechnologies". 
Because of our common interest in the success of each other's efforts,
this list was created to share advice and resources.  This highly
pragmatic list is intended only for the discussion of specific efforts and
immediate choices.  It is not for futuristic debate, argument, or
discussion of the Singularity proper.  The list is restricted, which
enables both discussion of semi-private issues and the maintenance of
intelligent and practical posting. 



    * Summary. 
    * Table of Contents. 
    * Charter. 
    * Concept. 
    * Membership. 
    * Posting. 
    * Topic list. 
    * Don'ts. 
    * Joining. 



      Charter:

The "Singularitarian" mailing list was launched as sing@onelist.com on
Sunday, March 11th, 1999, to assist in the common goal of reaching the
Singularity.  It will do so by pooling the resources of time, brains,
influence, and money available to Singularitarians; by enabling us to draw
on the advice and experience of the whole; by bringing together
individuals with compatible ideas and complementary resources; and by
binding the Singularitarians into a community.  The list will provide a
common forum for requesting advice, help and investment; for proposing
projects, businesses, and group policies; for announcing updates, status
reports, outcomes, Internet resources, and Web sites; for reporting the
products of research and investigation; and for sharing news of
interest.

      Concept:

The Extropians list (as much as anything, the original parent of this
list) maintains a continuous sheen of futurism, the quality Ed Regis
called "hubris".  Favored topics of discussion:  A really spectacular
piece of technology, an impressive piece of rational reasoning, futuristic
science and psychology, intricate and anarchocapitalistic ethics, and
(sometimes heated) debates about policy in the remote future.  At its
height, the Extropians list is a group of extremely intelligent people
throwing off sparkles of concentrated future shock. 

There were, however, three repeated complaints:  First, that there wasn't
enough discussion of practical matters, what to do now.  Second, that none
of the people talking had the resources to actually do anything.  Third,
that there were too many low-quality posts.  The Singularitarian list came
into existence in response to these problems. 

The first priority of the list is to provide an environment capable of
attracting Internet tycoons or science-fiction authors or AI researchers,
not just enthusiastic but poor Singularitarians with a lot of spare
time. 
It should not require extreme dedication to the Singularity to put up with
the list environment, simply a slight interest.  For those
Singularitarians who have not yet contributed to the Singularity and have
no resources strongly in demand, the strictest standards of intelligence,
netiquette, topic discipline, pragmatism, and general cluefulness will be
enforced. 

      The list's first moments will be most critical, setting the
      tone and determining the success or failure of the list.  A
      core of high-quality readers and posters will attract more
      readers and posters, but it is to be expected that only a few
      of them will arrive initially.  To prevent the "nightmare
      scenario" - in which a bunch of enthusiastic idiots misspell
      insanely impractical proposals and argue with every post on
      ideological grounds, after which all the real Singularitarians
      pack up and leave - I will scrutinize all candidate members
      very closely, request a summary of the proposed initial post,
      actually enforce the topic rules, and otherwise watch the
      initial moments of the list very carefully.

I expect that members of the group will fall into a few broad categories;
each of which, in accordance with the Charter, have something to
contribute to each other and to the whole.  By bringing together the
aspiring-but-poor Singularity enthusiast and the vaguely altruistic
Internet tycoon together into one community, it is hoped that the
enthusiast will absorb some of the pragmatism and knowledge of the tycoon,
even as the tycoon will absorb some of the dedication and futuristic
vision of the enthusiast.  By bringing together the researcher and the
popularizer (whether a Webmaster or science-fiction author), it is hoped
that both will learn more about presenting accurate information to the
public.  The Singularitarian list is intended, not only to create
individual collaborations, but to create a community. 



      Membership:

List membership is restricted; that is, all new members must be
approved. 
First and foremost, this allows us to maintain quality of discussion.  It
also allows us to maintain semi-confidentiality for people who want to
discuss bright ideas without giving them away entirely, or who are willing
to discuss sensitive information such as income levels or physical
location.  Of course, for truly proprietary information, you should
arrange to use PGP or some other form of strong encryption. 

List membership is extended to people with time, brains, influence, or
money, and constrained by pragmatism, readability, discretion, and
dedication to the Singularity.  The standards are neither independent nor
"fair", but sensitive to supply and demand.  The pool of Singularitarians
would seem rather oversupplied with brains relative to money, so it is to
be expected that standards on qualities such as "dedication to the
Singularity" will be relaxed to the extent of letting in any random
millionaire who thinks s/he "might" be interested. 

The list is not moderated.  If onelist offered that option, I would allow
non-members to post.  If you believe you know something of which the list
should be aware, forward it to me, or some other Singularitarian you know,
and we will forward it to the list.  (This is, of course, one of the best
ways to demonstrate you'd make a good member.) 

Posters who publicize list messages not marked as public; cannot spell
properly, reason properly, or remain on-topic; otherwise harm the list -
will be summarily removed, to maintain the quality of discussion for
all. 
In no way is this list intended to serve the function of introducing a
person to either netiquette or ultratechnology; while such people may
eventually become valued members of the Singularitarian community,
violation of list discipline will result in removal and gentle referral to
the Extropian mailing list. 



      Posting:

Most posts should be announcements.  A few posts may be questions, to
which answers are appropriate.  Extended discussion is appropriate only to
actual project and business proposals. 

While I will be overjoyed if there are so many collaborations and
announcements that the list develops heavy traffic, there should not be
traffic for the sake of maintaining it.  I do not intend to maintain any
particular level of traffic - only of quality. 

Please do not feel obligated to respond to messages, and especially do not
feel obligated to argue points.  Above all, put in the few minutes of
wordsmithing that saves everyone else from having to make an effort to
read your post. 

Posting policies are not meant to be absolute.  I, as a Singularitarian,
have no authority over other Singularitarians.  I have provided a place
for us to meet.  I have one vision of what that place will be like; others
may have their own.  To acknowledged Singularitarians, my concept of the
list is only one opinion.  Likewise, my control of the list membership
does not imply that I have the authority to decide who is a
Singularitarian - only the job of guessing. 

The topic list below, then, is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.  To
proven posters, it is only a suggestion.  It is, however, expected that
one will demonstrate the capability to follow the topic list before going
outside it.  My concept of the list is only one opinion, but it's the one
presently on the list charter, so please be sure you know what you're
doing before exercising that independence. 

For borderline posts, or when in doubt, remember the Golden Rule:  A post
can be boring, or trivial, but never both. 

Topic list:

    * MEME:  Popularizing the Singularity. 
          * Concrete data about reactions to the Singularity 
          * Questions about what to put in an interview, Web page, or
            article. 
          * The results of an interview; lessons learned. 
          * Where to publish a futuristic paper. 
          * Sub-topics:  BOOK and SITE announcements. 
    * BUSI:  For discussion of business. 
          * Is anyone interested in starting company A?  Specify what stage
            company A is at, and what employees are being sought or seed
            funding required. 
          * What kind of resources would business B require? 
          * I don't have time to do it myself, but here's business idea
C. 
          * I'm a Singularitarian with business D, and I would like
help. 
    * RES<>  For requests for mundane resources, or announcements that
      such resources are available. 
          * Does anyone have hosting space for a complex poll? 
          * I don't know how to create a complex poll; is there anyone who
            knows CGI and is willing to donate some time? 
          * Where should I look on the Web to find out about starting a
            business? 
          * Does anyone know where I can get an fMRI scan? 
          * I have 100MB of Web space - anyone need it? 
          * (RES> indicates availability, RES< indicates request.) 
    * PROJ:  Singularitarian projects that have not incorporated as a
      business. 
          * Hi, I've started a "Singularity.org" website. 
          * Hi, I've started an open-source NanoCad project. 
    * TECH/BUSI:  Discussion of technology in business. 
          * What are the immediate business potentials of ultratechnology
            proposal A? 
          * Anyone want to comment on AI project B in my business proposal?
          * These are my comments on Intelligenesis's Webmind. 
          * I have a great idea about collaborative filtering. 
          * (There is no TECH-only subject line...) 
    * ARTICLE:  Express an opinion or statement that you think the list
      should hear. 
          * This may include wider Singularity-related subjects, including
            general strategy. 
          * As in the journal of Brain and the Behavioral Sciences, someone
            may post a response and the author may respond to that.  No
            further response depth is permitted. 
          * If you wish to respond further, either take it to the
            Extropians list, or write a counter-article of equal quality
            and originality, and post it at least one week after the first
            article. 
          * If you want closure, or you think it's important to know who
            "won", use a VOTE with the same subject line. 
    * VOTE:  Statistical data, ideological backing. 
          * Gather data about list members, or learn about general
            opinions. 
          * Gain consensus on a subject, so you can say "Singularitarians
            believe..." 
          * Start a web poll and include it as HTML.  (Non-tamperable free
            polls preferred for gaining consensus.) 
          * If you are attempting to gain consensus, please say so. 
          * Include an option "I don't believe this is an appropriate
            subject for a Singularitarian consensus."  A consensus is not
            morally or legally binding; it's just a way of ensuring you
            have at least 80% support before you saying "Singularitarians
            believe". 
    * TRIBE:  Events that bind us together as a community. 
          * Singularitarians who will be at conventions. 
    * JOIN:  Announcement that a person is joining the list 
          * Whatever relevant personal information (profession, location,
            social class) s/he chooses to reveal. 
          * Any resources that person is willing to contribute to a good
            cause. 
          * Which projects that person is interested in. 
    * RATN:  Objection to a previous post on the grounds that it contains
      a rational error. 
          * Flames cannot be effectively outlawed, but they can be
            isolated. 
          * Logical errors and factual errors are appropriate topics. 
            Keep it down, people!  Get boring about it and I'll tell you to
            take it private. 
          * It would help if the beginning of the post contained the name
            of the logical flaw identified, if it has a name.  This
            includes rhetorical tactics and logical fallacies. 
          * I encourage third parties to make their opinions clear on whose
            side the right lies.  This should enable the correct party to
            break off discussion without feeling that this is conceding the
            point. 
          * Please preserve the rest of the subject line; "MEME:
            Singularity poll" becomes "RATN: Singularity poll". 
    * META:  Discussion of the list. 

I hope everyone will attempt to maintain topic discipline, although it
will not be strictly enforced.  Subject lines do not require tags, but
subject lines that contain any tags except RATN or META must remain
on-topic, and discussion that wanders outside the topic should change the
subject line.  This is required so that list members filtering by tag will
not waste their time. 

Any Singularity-topic sufficiently sensitive that it could not be publicly
discussed is an appropriate topic, regardless of other constraints, and
may be argued normally - as long as intelligent discussion is
maintained. 

Any post not marked somewhere as "public" should be treated as
semi-confidential - please don't publish it anywhere, or quote from it, or
discuss the ideas with your friends... 



      Don'ts:

The Singularitarian mailing list specifically excludes discussion of: 

      Whether a future is desirable in principle. 
      Personal improvement techniques. 
      Philosophy, ethics, and morality.  Exception:  An ethical principle
      may be briefly cited if opposing a specific proposal for an
      immediate action, and philosophical and moral principles may be
      briefly cited as good things to popularize. 
      Any question that doesn't reflect an immediate choice in achieving a
      reachable goal. 

Such questions, while entirely legitimate, should be referred to the
Extropian Mailing List. 



      Joining:

I think I've done this before, but here's a short sampling.  I'm not going
to include the full reasoning behind each point here - if you think I'm
wrong about a particular point, let me know and I'll fill in more detail.

1) IMO, normal competitive forces will give you markets with a fairly small
number of relatively large PPAs.  This is an important starting observation,
because it is a different situation from the hustle-and-bustle of a million
tiny startups that many anarchists seem to envision.

2) The nature of the law enforcement business makes it easy for PPAs to
create geographical monopolies and cartels, even if they can not resort to
large-scale violence.  The problem lies in the fact that in order to protect
your own customers, you have to be able to enforce your laws against some
other PPA's customers.  The inter-company negotiations arising from this
situation will strongly favor the company with the largest market share, and
the advantage will grow in proportion to their market share advantage.

3) PPAs are not immune to creeping authoritarianism - especially if they are
monopolistic.  Over time, I would expect all PPAs to gradually eliminate
their vulnerability to civil lawsuits, levy opt-out fees on their customers,
and generally engage in all sorts of slimy double-dealing.  In the absence
of some exterior balancing force, they will eventually exempt themselves
from criminal prosecution and start looking for ways of extracting
additional money from their customers (and everyone else they can get away
with targeting).

4) The consequences of even a momentary lapse in coverage are catastrophic.
If you don't have PPA coverage, the local SlaveMart outlet can send a goon
squad over to collect you, your wife and your kids the instant the family
policy expires.  In a private law regime there is a market niche for
institutions that take advantage of such lapses, and coverage information
must necessarily be public, so this sort of thing is not going to be a rare
occurrence.

5) The customer is at the mercy of the PPA, not vice versa.  If your PPA
wants to shut you up, all they have to do is cancel your policy and give
SlaveMart a call (or take care of you themselves, if they prefer).  You are
only as protected as your PPA is willing to let you be.

6) A private law regime with dozens of PPAs, each with multiple law products
and complex inter-company enforcement contracts, would be a legal regime far
more complex than the one we now live in.  In order to know what is legal,
you would have o know your own legal code, the codes of all the people you
interact with, and all of the relevant enforcement contracts (and keep in
mind, the very meaning of words like 'contract' can change depending on who
you are signed up with.  As a result, no one will have any idea what laws
are supposed to cover a given interaction.  The lawyers will love it, but
how do the rest of us even do business?

That's really only a start, but it should give you the flavor of the kinds
of things I am concerned about.

Now, lest it get lost in the shuffle, this does *not* mean that I favor our
current Statist regime.  I'm not quite ready to join the bomb-throwing
brigade, but I can see where I might be tempted if I were still young and
naive.  When I express skepticism about anarchy, it is mostly because I can
see more reliable ways of securing the same degree of freedom through
limited government.

Not this Extropian. I take great exception to this obviously racist attack on
a real urban futurist art form. Hip hop was the first comercially sucessful
electronic music. The philosophy of hip hop is clearly individualist in
nature.  Plus i don't think that you have the brain power to wipe hip hop off
the face of the earth. Unless you are some artistic genius and could invent a
new musical form to take it's place. Even then the hip hop community would
respond creatively as they have always done in the face of racist and bigoted
attacks.

I can think of several paradoxes and they all relate to the fact that
averages taken over the universe are not guaranteed to converge if the
universe is infinite. Expectations are a kind of average, and they do not
necessarily converge either. Here is an example. Suppose you are offered a
bet where you can win or lose $1. You are in an infinite universe with an
infinite number of people in your situation and you can't tell which of
them you are. Some of them are potential winners and some of them are
potential losers. The (potential) winners and losers are distributed as
follows: 1 winner, followed by 2 losers, followed by 4 winners, followed
by 8 losers, and so on. The paradox is that if you try to compute an
expected payoff for the bet under the assumption that you are equally
likely to be any of these people your computation won't converge.

The only way I can see to get around the paradox is to assume that you are
a priori more likely to be near the center/beginning of the universe (or
some other point), and that's what I meant by the preferred position. The
exact choice of the preferred position, how "near" is defined, and how
much more likely you are to be near it should all be part of the
hypothesis that you are considering.

I wasn't being very precise when I said the conventional model has a
preferred position which is the Big Bang. What I meant is that the Big
Bang is a natural choice for the preferred position. There are many ways
to define "near" and thus to pick point number 2. The simplest would be to
to pick the point that comes immediately after the Big Bang in the rest
frame of the universe.

On Sun, 4 Apr 1999 19:49:30 +0200, you wrote about the possibility of
the Roman Catholic Churh acting against the vessel:

>Some irrelevant verbal abuse only...

Considering their vast resources, powerful members and history, I
cannot put it past a Roman Catholic leader of a country acting in the
name of the Mother Church (which is, granted, not the same as the
actual princes of the Church acting on their own official capacity) .
And the Holy Office still exists, although I have no evidence nor even
indications that any sort of inquisition is on its way. Nevertheless,
I aim to be cautious: that's one wealthy institution you may not want
to go medieval on your ship.

Incidentally, the Holy See could hardly be considered the only
possible source of religious reprisals. Faith can be a powerful
inductor to initiate violence against perceived sins, all in the name
of the divinity of choice. Current terrorist attacks against abortion
clinics in the US remind us of just how carried away some people might
get.

In my earlier postings, I sidestepped the issue of setting up a
religion not just because I can't bring myself to protect a rational
venture with an irrational veneer, but also because I realized that
not even religions can get away legally with eliminating human life,
which is how many US courts seem to take the issue of euthanasia. Some
justices might even deem these acts "ritual sacrifices,"  which are
still clearly forbidden when it comes to human lives.

But isn't the point of these euthanasias to then place the subject
under cryogenic storage? That being the case, we need a scientific
approach in court successfully explaining how the cessation of
animation by euthanasia and subsequent physiological stasis under
cryogenic storage differs from death and subsequent physiological
decomposition (which is the case even with mummified cadavers).

In countries were the rule of law is still appreciated and mostly
followed, battles would need to be won in court if one is to avoid the
bribery approach. And you do need to convince those countries even if
your vessel is in "international" waters. I don't think the U.N.
acknowledges immunity from its reach anywhere on this planet; and U.N.
members certainly know how to go ballistic when the issue of "crimes
against humanity" favors their political agendas (witness the Spanish
"Superfudge" and Madrid's newfound role in the scheme of things). I
still think you need hefty protection not only from felonious and
terrorists attacks, but from the more threatening military of
virtually any country in the world.

This ship won't be just a peaceful schooner merrily sailing o'er the
high sea waves: to some reactionary ideologues in just about every
nation of this world, it will be an outright threat to their way of
thinking. It certainly runs counter to Judeo-Islam-Christian precepts
of life, death as a natural result and fatalistic acceptance of the
ultimate fate as imposed from Beyond.

Oh, and let's not forget that at some point you will need to go to
port somewhere in the world or rely upon transportation to deal with
dry land concerns.

I also wonder whether tethering yourself to some "realty" and
obtaining acknowledgment as a sovereign nation might help somewhat. It
wouldn't physically prevent other nations from attacking you; but at
least some national leaders are effectively restrained by legal
constructs. 

Then again, aren't NATO nations attacking Yugoslav grounds even as we
speak "on principle"? never underestimate the power of statist
politicians to work themselves into a frenzy!

So far, this venture seems to require (a) capital, (b) technological
means, (c) human resources, (d) sovereignty, (e) legal standing in
assorted national and international forums, (f) military-level defense
systems... It's definitely starting to look like a nation-making
endeavor.

These first three sound like you are saying that it is impossible to
effectively enforce a PPA anti-trust metalaw.  If so, this is clearly
the most important point to discuss more.    If you grant enforcement,
then by assumption monopolies & malicious oligopolies are not a problem.

It would seem a straightforward to sign up for backup PPAs, so one is
always covered.

Is this the same sense that a patient is at the mercy of a doctor?

This is a more serious objection in my view.  But noting how people
want simplicity is often a major argument for nationalizing industries.
Those pushing to nationalize health care, for example, talk a lot about
how unreasonable it is to expect people to learn enough to know which
health plan to choose.  And how much it troubles consumers to have to try.

If people really really like simplicity enough, most all PPAs may end
up enforcing the same law.  But that same law might be better.  And
enforcement styles and quality could still vary widely.

I met him at a Space Society convention around the same time, and had a
similar experience.  He was always careful to get his facts right, limit his
statements to what they support, and in general avoid wild speculations.  I
remember him listening politely to quite a few people who obviously had no
clue what they were saying, and he never showed a trace of that air of
superiority so many celebrities put on.

Fair enough.  I can easily see setting up a defense-oriented national
government that would prevent PPAs from staging an armed takeover.
Preventing peacefull monopolist is more problematic - we can do it, but it
gives the government enough power (and enough leeway in its use) to make me
nervous.

If you have the money, and your PPA contract allows it, yes.  But neither of
these is a given.  My worry here is that there will be a not insignificant
number of people who end up without any valid contract, and that means there
will be a market for their exploitation.  That creates a real risk for
everyone, in the form of a group of predators looking for unprotected prey.
This is a step down from the situation in a mainimalist state, where
slavers, organleggers and other unsavory types can't incorporate and float
an IPO.

No, its in the same sense that a citizen is at the mercy of a despot.  If my
doctor does me harm, I (or my relatives) can sue him in a neutral court.  If
my PPA does me harm, I can sue it in its own court if it deigns to allow me
that priveledge.

True.  But my concern here is that the complexity rises so fast that I am
not at all sure that it is possible for ordinary humans to function in such
a society.  I actually sat down and tried to figure out how to fix a lot of
the problems I mentioned here (and others) through market means.  I gave it
up when I realized that the average individual was going to have to
negotiate more contracts in a year than I have in my entire life.

I don't see the Extropians and the Cristian Scientists purchasing the same
legal code.

Perhaps it would help if I outlined the kind of state I see as being a
superior alternative?

"Given the power to initiate the use of force"?  That would make them
criminal organizations, not law enforcing ones.

If Harold Schwartz, accountant from St. Paul, was sufficiently inspiring in his college speeches to get earnest young university volunteers to work for his election, sufficiently politically adept to get a third party nomination and wangle that status and his grassroots-cultivated support into participation in the debates, and sufficiently articulate and reasonable sounding to win them (many eventual voters watch them regardless of the number of participants), you'd be calling him Gov. Harold Schwartz.

Can someone recommend some good reading by Drexler?

ps- as you may have noticed, I'm not a scientist, but an artist.. Does this
person have books written for non-PHDs? :)

I believe that unsuccessful suicides should get the death penalty.
On a more serious note, my father is massively emphysemic, and on constant oxygen, and has extensive skin cancer.  He supports Dr. K., but my mother, who is diabetic, has high blood pressure, glaucoma and arthritic hips, opposes him.  If A = an intolerable medical condition and B = the desire to die to escape it, clearly A+B must inhere for assisted suicide to be legitimate.  It is also clear that the family's wishes should be irrelevant, whether they are in favor of or opposed to such action - they may live WITH the person in question, but only the person in question lives inside the condition; therefore only the person in question should have the right to decide whether or not to leave it.

Hi all,

I've worked out a three layered sandwich process, being impatient with how
tardy Physics is, after some 70 years of not coming to terms with its own
findings. I'd like some comments, please.  No GUT is possible or feasible
but a universal process, consistent at all levels is possible. Here's my
trial.

Eddington wrote, in 1927 that "Henceforth the senses are no longer a
reliable guide to reality"> amen to that. I took him at his word and
considered whether or not the human mind can encompass it. Since the
appelations for god, reality and mind are much the same, and all three are
undefinable but highly usable, here goes.  I assume all these three are the
same, keeps it simple bud. They just appear to be different to our senses.

In terms of music or wave mechanics we can have three conditions of
operation as products of a process: Harmony, cacophony and no noise at all
or a standoff situation.  That is: 1: waves either gel into standing waves
or knots we call objects, the appearance of the material universe, or 2:
fight, which produces energy from an entropy slope by way of 'opposites'  or
3: nothing *apparent* happens.  The standard formula of science, and myth
too, posits that this works by direct, inverse and neither action or zeros
out as nothing tangible or observable.  In philosophical garb this can be
named as 'the opposites' and their respective balances.

ie: for any local action it is, ipso facto and de jure, necessary for a
counter compensating global action, if only to hold itself together as a
whole. This action has to be immediate at a non material level. Thus faster
than light speed is quite feasible, once and after we figure out the way.
Thus science's 'action at a distance'  taboo is a nonsense.  From an
observer's PoV, even the participant observer, this yields three levels of
the action, viz

A: a stable, material level of the action of persistent in time and space as
form we call matter.
B: an energetic level, which QT defines as the superposition of all possible
states of a particle, which is unstable, therefore comes to us as energy.
This one ranges between a zero and infinite state since the cosmos or
reality is scale free and infinite.
C: a non observable level, conventionally called mind, which holds and
maintains the balance between the 'object" state a and the energy or verb
state. It is not anything like our mind, or so it seems, as the brain is a
multi resonant gimmick to tune in at any frequency around. i just don't
happen to 'identify' mind with brain.

In  effect, being infinite and scale free 'IT' does not know about the rules
we impose and keep whole and part or local and global separated. So it can
act anywhere, anyplace, anyhow with all of its *abilities* or functions
anywhere.  There appears to be a courtesy rule not to meddle with any
ongoing local event.  The relevant
alchemical saw is: the ALL is in the all and the all in the ALL.

The standoff condition appears to be a contextual limit we might call space,
mind or whatever else is congenial. Of itself these 3 interactions of the
whole with itself are reflected in the atomic neutron, positron and
electron. What is the neutron doing there? Nothing!  I doubt it.  Nothing
observable I'll agree with. Despite the chaotic melee of many particle
states they keep on coming back to 3 items on their menu. For a somewhat
weirder metaphoric representation it either spirals in upon itself untill it
appears to tie itself into a knot or/and spirals outwards and, it seems,
keeps itself in touch with itself all the way. That is, it performs a both
"OR' and "AND" at a 'same time'. The Pa Kua Yin Yang models this exquisitely
well, especially so when imagined as a flow between whole and part.

In connection with this the mind/body system keeps itself internally
consistent, externally uses condition 2 or works as an anomaly detector by
way of feelings and senses, and yet manages to keep itself whole.  For
another one it is also found patterned in our sentence pattern as noun and
verb made reflexive, transitive and intransitive, which last condition is
how most "minds" keep themselves stable.  By Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle we should not be able to gel nouns and verbs into 'scenic'
patterns but we do. By reflection of Godel's proof we should not be able to
test our suppositions, but, nevertheless, as Galileo said: Eppur si muove.
It ain't exackly waves but some of us need forms to think with, we do.  For
it to be universal it has to be universal or "everywhere the same" in its
ways, not products.

Howzat? Adrian

I, and probably many many other people on this list, would heartily
recommend "Engines of Creation." Its an overview of nanotechnology without
the hard science. An excellent read.

You are really living in la la land aren't you? If you don't have a name with preexisting brand recognition in a large percentage of the people's mind, then you aren't going to get a party nomination of any kind. No party wants to back a no name loser, having a celebrity status of some kind gets you automatic free publicity with the media. If you aren't a celebrity already, you'd better have a long record of other public exposure, either as a journalist, a state bureaucrat, a big business owner, etc. Even Jesse Ventura had to have served as  Mayor of his hometown first to gain credibility. Sonny Bono was likewise a Mayor before he ran for congress (and a congressional district is much easier to campaign in than a whole state). Ronald Reagan got elected as governor of California based on his acting career. The only other position he held before that was as president of the Actors Guild. Any experienced politician will tell you, if you haven't got a NAME, you ain't got s***.

would it be possible to subscribe to the list as an observer? I'm saying

>individuals with compatible ideas and complementary resources; and by
>binding the Singularitarians into a community.  The list will provide a

>      Concept:
>
>The Extropians list (as much as anything, the original parent of this
>list) maintains a continuous sheen of futurism, the quality Ed Regis
>called "hubris".  Favored topics of discussion:  A really spectacular
>piece of technology, an impressive piece of rational reasoning, futuristic
>science and psychology, intricate and anarchocapitalistic ethics, and
>(sometimes heated) debates about policy in the remote future.  At its
>height, the Extropians list is a group of extremely intelligent people
>throwing off sparkles of concentrated future shock.
>
>There were, however, three repeated complaints:  First, that there wasn't
>enough discussion of practical matters, what to do now.  Second, that none
>of the people talking had the resources to actually do anything.  Third,
>that there were too many low-quality posts.  The Singularitarian list came
>into existence in response to these problems.
>
>The first priority of the list is to provide an environment capable of
>attracting Internet tycoons or science-fiction authors or AI researchers,
>not just enthusiastic but poor Singularitarians with a lot of spare
>time.
>It should not require extreme dedication to the Singularity to put up with
>the list environment, simply a slight interest.  For those

Seems like a good opportunity for a grant proposal...nice tight population
with great economic/educational characteristics.
I'm sure it's unlikely that the medical community would want to see the
study done, but i'm guessing that the sponsors of the msa bill in congress
would love to see it.

>Btw, the main problem with MSAs in practice is price discrimination.
The average actual hospital bill is about 1/4 of the list price charged
to folks that just walk in the door.  Group purchasing is essential to get
a low price, but most MSA folks don't get group prices.

I actually get discounts thru my MSA and the ALLIED health group and they
are INDEED very helpful.
My MSA is with Golden Rule.

By the way, in my case it is incontrovertable that the $3,500 deductable has
"influenced" my medical consuption behaviour. I have lost 30 lbs, eat very
little meat, sugar, or fat, have a 21% BMI fat index, very low cholesterol,
reduced wrinkles, added hair reversed many pains to subclinical levels, and
have become vastly more knowledgeable about how my body works
biomechanically, hormonally, emotionally, genomically, and molecularly. I
consider the deductable to be tuition to earn the right to live long and
prosper. For two years I have had zero need to see a doctor. I am only now
considering seeing a LEF vetted MD in order to get some baseline data for
the long haul

A couple points:

1) I can find no evidence for you assertion that Lyle's post was a "racist
attack" on hip-hop.  He obviously harbors a strong dislike for the music,
but to extrapolate anything else is questionable.

2) It is very arguable as to whether or not hip hop was the first
commercially successful electronic music.  What is the time lapse from when
it was classified as a genre and when you believe it could be classified as
"commercially successful"?  The emergence of hip hop as a commercially
successful genre came several years after other (mostly shorter-lived)
genres in my recollection, and almost certainly post-dates some of the
longer lived electronic genres that did not emerge commercially in the U.S.
until after hip hop.  

Also, there is the issue of scope.  Your assertions regarding electronic
music, commercial success, and hip hop would seem to be from the viewpoint
of living in the U.S.  European musical perspective and style differs
significantly from the US.  A lot of culture that comes out in music and
hip hop is something that I feel secure in saying is an exceedingly
American form of electronica.  Electronic music has a much longer european
history than an american one.  However, American electronica *has* added a
distinct flavor to the mix, even within existing genres (e.g. I often
distinguish between "Euro house" and "American house" because of the subtle
cultural influences that emerge in what is essentially the same electronic
music form).

As far as I can tell, pure hip hop (per the original classification) is
definitely on the fade.  Nonetheless, it has spawned and heavily influenced
many other genres that use many of the best features of hip hop.

3) As with all musical genres, including hip hop, 95% of the music produced
is trash.  Most people are not sufficiently exposed to most musical genres
to develop an appreciation for them, since odds are the little bit that
they've heard sucks and is a pale imitation of the form.  Don't take it
personally; I don't.  If you like it, why do you care if other people do?

 The first amendment only protects speech that listeners can ignore

 Yes, they could have inconvenienced those who want to use macros.
They probably assume that more users would get annoyed at them if they
did that.
 Failing to discourage a third party from committing a crime generally
isn't a crime. Our society generally assumes that the creator of a
virus is the only one who has done something wrong. As long as it's
possible to track down virus creators and as long as they are rare, that
approach can be more cost-effective than making systems secure. If it
becomes hard to track down and punish virus creators (which wouldn't
surprise me), then security will need to become the responsibilty of
users.

 IANAL, but it seems safe to assume that he'll go to jail if a jury

jail even if they don't.

 Bug? Anyone who cares already knew that Microsoft products were vulnerable
to this kind of attack. He didn't convey any worthwhile info.

It would be interesting if you could isolate the profit incentive part of
this problem.  Not that profit incentive is bad, but it would emphasize
the buyer beware part of medicine.  I expect that most skeptic extropians
are able to pick and choose medical advice enough to result in very
different statistics.  But these are very surprising statistics for
sheeple.

I'm 40 and have seen a doctor only a handful of times in my life.  I've
never had a physical exam.  My time has come now though, the last four
times I've checked my blood pressure, it been pretty high and I've been
suffering from sleep apnea which probably is the cause of the high blood
pressure.  So now I'm faced with the need to research the following:

1. What kinds of test should I request that are sometimes not given
routinely - e.g. early detection of cancer? 

2. Whats the likely medicine to be prescribed to lower blood pressure and
is it often mis-prescribed.

3. In my case, If I weigh more than 165 lbs., I have sleep apnea, under
165 lbs., I do not.  Right now I'm at 178 lbs.  I have to find a
short-term solution until I can loose the weight.  Many times, I find
myself afraid to go back to sleep at night.  I anticipate that the doctor
will want to go the surgical route and he'll probably dismiss my weight
theory as bullshit although I'm absolutely certain of it.  Believe me,
I've YO-YOed enough to know.  My weight gain simply occurs mostly in my
face and throat.  So I'm thinking maybe I should counter his
recommendation for surgery with a request for the apnea machine.

These kinds of things have to be considered and planned ahead of time to
make effective use of medicine.  I see that now more than ever.  I'd
appreciate any advice about my specifics or even appropriate URL's.  I
think it to be on-topic for us to discuss how to make use of medicine to
*effectively* extend life.

'Initiation of force' is a concept often used by libertarians when making
broad statements of principle.  But in specific instances of use of force
it can be unclear whether it is an initiation of force, often because of
lack of information.  For example, if a woman snatches a purse from
another woman and runs off, the police and the victim may find the purse
snatcher a short time later, holding the stolen purse.  The victim says
the purse is hers, and the thief says the purse is her own purse.  The
victim says she can specify the contents of the purse, but the thief
refuses to turn over the purse for examination.  To an observer who does
not know who the true owner is, it would appear to be an initiation of
force to take the purse away from the thief, even if only to examine the
contents in an effort to determine true ownership.


Generally, when a suspect is arrested and held for trial, it is at least
an apparent initiation of force against the suspect.  The suspect may, or
may not, be in fact guilty.

In practice, a limited amount of initiation of force may be a price that
has to be paid in order to have a functioning criminal and civil justice
system.

Once it is determined which is the case, however, we know whether to
prosecute those who apprehended the "suspect", right?

Yes, there will always be criminals who are not caught...but I don't think
that this is what you meant. :)

No, they didn't.  Sending an e-mail to someone with an active computer
virus is an attack and a denial of service, not an expression of free
speech.  Sending the source code for a virus or, for example, encryption
software, is an expression of free speech.

Those people who got afflicted with this Melissa macro (I won't call it a
virus, viruses are cool and take skill) are at fault for using insecure
communication methods, but that doesn't mean that they in any way consented
to a denial of service or any other invasion of and atack upon rights.  The
foremost experts in virus software happen to make it.

People assume too much from this tacit agreement stuff, and shifting the
topic, informed consumerism is a difficult thing to achieve.  These
predatory, for example, phone companies, will take your words out of
context to defraud your money.  Also, they will mislead you to the extent
they can to try and get you to agree to services never used and further
steal your money.  Many predatory as opposed to competitive organizations
exist, for now.

Whenever you have fees that are incorrect, request that they be waived.
Always get itemized fee lists from your service providers, because if one
doesn't take a very accurate examination of these things, and anyways, one
will find that one is being billed for unused services and other things.
These companies are defrauding you, and when they take your money and don't
return it, that is theft pure and simple.

There are a lot of two-bit crooks and incompetents in this world who get
along by defrauding people.  They will find the future much less conducive
to their thieveries.

This leads us to the topic of jurisprudence in a digital age, and the
future ability for many people to be much more protected against these
vultures that screw little old ladies.

I believe some things we shall soon see are jurimetrics and semi-automated
class actions.  In the future, as soon as someone starts defrauding anyone
or a group, they will quickly be denied and their punishment will be
decreed by empirical analysis, besides mitigating factors.  As one consumer
is defrauded, they can inform all the others.  The ability for consumers
and providers to educate each other over the free speech space of the
Internet will prevail.

In real estate transactions, written agreements are necessary for legal
validity.

An agreement that is not put forth in good faith for completion is invalid
and unethical.

Libertarianism, to some extent, is the nature of the Internet.

Yes, I suppose so.  But the justice system as we have it allows for false
arrest and malicious prosecution redress only in very limited
circumstances.  It almost never happens that a suspect who is acquitted
at trial goes back and successfully sues or prosecutes those who accused,
arrested, and tried him.  O.J. has not.  It seems as if 'honest mistakes'
by the system are allowed to go unpunished.  One libertarian has proposed
that in death penalty cases the jury vote on the death penaly for the
convicted.  If, after the convict is executed, he is later proven not
guilty, then those jurors who voted for death would themselves be
executed.  I guess the death penalty would be very rarely applied under
that system.

No, that's not what I was thinking when I wrote that, but your
interpretation is reasonable.  Defense lawyers like to say it's better to
let 10 guilty parties go free than to convict one innocent.  The
Anglo-Saxon 'presumption of innocence' is still with us.

There is something about this in a book called "Lives of a Cell" by Lewis
Thomas, M.D., published about 1972 or 73.  I can't find the book, so I will
just summarize what I remember of it.  

He said the longevity of people in modern industrial societies was
primarily due to vaccination, antibiotics, and public health measures such
as good sewers and building codes.  Hospitals have very little to do with
it.  Iatrogenic disease is much more common than laymen realize.  He and
his physician friends tended to be minimalists -- they didn't use each
other's services for every little problem.  "Most things," he said, "get
better by morning."  

Since reading this book, I have been a medical minimalist myself, a policy
that has served me well. 

He also said that there are many conditions which are easily and safely
treatable, and which should be treated.  A minimalist is not the same as a
Christian Scientist.  

It should be possible to use the placebo effect intentionally, and to learn
to use it better with practice.  I have made some effort to do this, but
it's impossible to say whether it has had any effect on my health -- which
is excellent, but which might have been excellent anyway.

Is the list healthy?  

Michael Butler writes,

I had forgotten how much stress is involved in reading the list.  In the
last week and a half (since I started reading the list again) I have been
amazed at the level of acrimony.  This isn't the way people normally talk
to each other in everyday life, at least not where I live.  Maybe in Russia
or Yugoslavia...  Of course I'm not denying that I do it myself.  I like
the adrenaline rush from a flame war as much as anybody.  (Meet me after
school, Billy, in the parking lot behind the gym ;-)  But I wonder, what
effect do e-mail arguments have on our health?  In spite of our talk about
life extension, we may all die before our time, just from the stress.  

Unless we can break the habit.

If you don't have a name with preexisting brand recognition in a large percentage of the people's mind, then you aren't going to get a party nomination of any kind. No party wants to back a no name loser, having a celebrity status of some kind gets you automatic free publicity with the media. If you aren't a celebrity already, you'd better have a long record of other public exposure, either as a journalist, a state bureaucrat, a big business owner, etc. Even Jesse Ventura had to have served as  Mayor of his hometown first to gain credibility. Sonny Bono was likewise a Mayor before he ran for congress (and a congressional district is much easier to campaign in than a whole state). Ronald Reagan got elected as governor of California based on his acting career. The only other position he held before that was as president of the Actors Guild. Any experienced politician will tell you, if you haven't got a NAME, you ain't got s***.

Every somebody not born to other somebodies was a nobody once.  In my own district in NW Florida, Joe Scarborough (whom I do not like), a lawyer and failed rock musician of whom practically no one had heard, did credibly in the debates and was elected to Congress.  Now he's a semi-regular on Politically Incorrect and poised to ascend the political ladder.

Sorry to hear of your parents having such problems.  {8-(
Emphysema is a special case I have always wondered about.  Looks
to me like if left to run its course, the contents of one's brain is
erased in the last weeks of so-called life by lack of oxygen.  A cryonicist
would seek what may be defined as assisted suicide by the state
(cryonic suspension) before one suffered a total cranial degaussing.

Now, perhaps some cryonicist can help me out on a topic that
has come up before on this list, but I feel I can now add a new
twist.  Suppose I go in for cryonics, and 100 yrs goes by.  Now
my living descendants are actually demotivated to reanimate me.
They have no emotional connection, they never knew me.  I must
figure out some way to make it profitable for those who would
be burdened with my care, should I be reanimated without the
essential job skills of the mid 22nd century.  I still have not figured
out how to squirrel away wealth in some fashion that my descendants
(should I ever have any) would not rather try to inherit, after
causing my accidental unsuccessful thawing.  Ideas?  spike

Here's what ALCOR has to say on the subject:


Who Will Unfreeze Our Frozen Patients? <
http://www.alcor.org/01b.html#unfreeze >

Any cryonics organization has a moral and legal obligation to attempt to
revive its patients. Of course, no one can guarantee that the organization
will stay in business long enough; but at the Alcor Foundation, we have
taken many steps to insure proper funding and management, so that Alcor will
survive, financially intact, without losing sight of its goals.

Two thirds of the money that Alcor receives when a "whole body" suspension
member is frozen goes into a Patient Care Fund, to maintain and eventually
restore people who are in suspension. Currently, this fund contains well
over a million dollars.

We believe that when nanotechnology is perfected, it will be subject to the
same economies of scale that we have seen in microchips, causing it to
plummet in price. Thus, cell repair should become not only feasible, but
affordable.

Even so will people of the future want to revive patients from the past?

After twenty years of growth and advancement at Alcor, we feel confident
that the determination to revive our patients will be strong, because those
patients will still be *Alcor patients*, and Alcor will still be staffed and
managed by *Alcor members*, many of whom like Alcor's present employees will
have friends and loved ones that are in suspension, depending on them.
Furthermore, the future management of Alcor, like the present management,
will be motivated by the knowledge that so long as they are vulnerable to
disease, accident, or aging, their own lives may depend on a powerful,
ethical organization.

How Will People Adjust to the Future?

Immigrants from third-world countries have adapted to twentieth-century
America without too much trouble. And cryonics patients, frozen today, will
have a big advantage in the future: they already understand what technology
is, and how it may develop. Also, if you are revived, you probably won't be
alone. Other cryonics patients should be emerging with you as you explore a
new world full of exciting possibilities.

**********************************

I was also under the impression that ALCOR had an organization called
Lifepact to deal with this issue.  At least this used to be the case.

As far as squirreling money away, my CFP and fellow cryonicist, Rudi
Hoffman, is working on the problem of trusts that can be maintained in
perpetuity, and he thinks he is close to an answer.

Best regards,

Scott

I don't like going to doctors either, but then I think of cases like
muppeteer Jim Henson, who died of pneumonia a couple of years ago.  I
can't help thinking that if he'd gone to the doctor instead of waiting
for that darn cough to go away, he'd be alive today.

While we're guessing at his motives...perhaps he was tired of making his point in  backwater Michigan, and wanted to move into a national judicial arena.

I think it's reasonable to assume that he will take this matter to the highest court that will hear it, and that he will not spend a single day in jail while that appeal process is in progress.

Ah.  So what about the source code for a virus written in, say...tcl?
In fact, if I understand correctly, melissa was sent as source code,

Thanks Ross!  I was hoping someone would point this out. {8^D

Or are at fault for not disabling MS Word macros.  Mostly I see
Microsloth is at fault for not lifting a corporate finger to secure
word macros against just such a thing.  As Peter McCluskey
pointed out, the concept virus was known, a loooong time
ago, yet, as far as I know, Microsloth is stillll shipping Word
with macros enabled, a feature which will be used by few,
but is a dangerously efficient superhighway for creating and
spreading malicious code.

Difficult?  Its impossible.  The software company should assume at
least a modicum of responsibility.  It would be easy to write a
safeguard that will disallow a word macro from invading the
user's address book, creating a jillion copies of itself,  and scattering
them like the leaves of autumn.  Im not a software type, but
am I alone here?  Is not Microsoft at least partially to blame for
the melissa fiasco?  spike

Yes, a few perhaps, but the whole melissa thing (which by the way is
just starting) could have easily been prevented.  My Microsoft
annoyance needle is already pegged.  Somewhere I should
mention that I use MS products almost continuously, every day
at work.  Ive been an excel user for over 12 yrs, automating
many processes using macros.  But MS word macros I have found
not particularly useful.  But they *are* dangerous, in their
present form.  I do hope Bill risks a few annoyed users.  Anyone
who has ever used Powerpoint for Mac can define the
term annoyance.  spike

A diversified trust account should have a good chance of retaining value
and increasing in value over a 100 year period.  And several of them
would have an even better chance.  Consider the Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations, the Harvard Endowment, and the Nobel Prize endowment.  It
should be possible to make a trust stand up to legal attack if it is
specifically designed to do so.  The trust could provide an incentive for
successful thawing and revival.

I wonder if Mr. Yudkowsky, after having seen "The Matrix",
will consider changing the name of his proposed seed-AI from
"Elisson" to "Eleison"!  ("Elisson", while very pretty, to the
extent that it suggests "Eli's Son" sounds like a fantasy straight
out of the pages of Thomas J. Ryan's _The Adolescence of P-1_).

Anyway, I wish him the best of luck with his proposed Singularitarians
mailing list -- perhaps it will attract interest and money from
Silicon Valley tycoons who turn up their noses at the Extropians'
list.

However, I too would be interested in a read-only archive of the
cream of the Singularitarians' list (purged of whatever is 
considered too sensitive for the eyes of non-members, of course!).
Since I am one of the wankers whom it will be the intention of
this list to filter out (having neither extraordinary money or
talent), I will get to view this material, if at all, only from
the outside, as a consumer.

Henson may have waited too long, but the big problem was that he
had a strain of pneumonia that was extremely resistant to
antibiotics. I believe vancomycin was the only antibiotic
effective.

A tragic loss.

I'd like to add that I appreciate that some specialized lists are indeed
useful, and I'm not necessarily arguing against the formation of this list
of Eliezer's.  But, I sincerely hope that there is some way for the rest of
us to at least access the archive or lurk or something (can I sign up if I
promise never to post?).  Seriously, I worry a bit that those who have
something substantive to contribute to the singularity dialogue (me not
being in that number) will not be inclined to repeat or rephrase their
postings to the Extropian's list and we lose the benefit of their insights.
Some may feel that the singularity is too important a topic on this list for
the bulk of it to suddenly be transfered to a restricted list.  By the same
token, I know Eliezer wants to share some ideas with a very limited audience
and I respect that.  What's the solution?  Comments appreciated.

If you want to take this off list, I'm sure it would be appreciated by many others on the list. We just finished a rather big debate on this topic and many are shell shocked. Attempting to reignite the issue when its been pretty well concluded that the 2nd amendment is in line with extropian philosphy seems to be rather non productive and merely the sign of one who wishes to be inflammatory.

The following dialog appears when you try to load macros into Word 97.
"The document you are opening contains macros or customizations.  Some
macros may contain viruses that could harm your computer.  If you are
sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros.  If

No problem, not interested in the 2nd amendment per se.

Just pointing out that (a) one cannot overthrow a government which has nuclear
capability with puny guns, (b) the use of weapons in urban survival combat
does not appear to be purpose of the 2nd amendment, and (c) the 2nd amendment
would seem to refer to a militia and not to individuals as such.

And thus the peace broke out.

Nukes are useless in a civil war. You really beleive that the US government
would nuke NYC in order to save it?

In fact that's the whole purpose of the 2nd amendment; the founders were
scared that a standing army would be used against the people of their new
country and hence the Constitution guaranteed the right to keep and bear
arms so that defence could be by civilian militia and there would be no
need of an army. Armies are only needed for offence, a well-trained
(original meaning of "well-regulated") militia is much better for defence.

>(c) the 2nd amendment
>would seem to refer to a militia and not to individuals as such.

To an illiterate, perhaps. But someone with some kind of reading comprehension
might believe that when they say "the right of the people to keep and bear
arms" they might actually be talking about individual people and not about
the militia -- as they are in other amendments -- and that if they meant 
the militia they would actually have written "the right of the militia to 
keep and bear arms". I'm still amazed that anyone can take this nonsense seriously.

The trouble with aneqdotes is, of course, that one can also find lots 
of cases of people who died because they did go to a doctor.

Does anybody know where one can get historical
archives of all USENET on tape or CDs?
We discussed this on the list a while ago,
and there seemed to be companies who would
ship this data for a small fee, but I can't
find any now.  It is even impossible to get 
news from existing sources.  Clari.net doesn't
keep its own archives (or so they say),
Dejanews doesn't allow robots...

I urgently need some Usenet archives for analysis,
and would appreciate any advice on where I may get
it from.

This really doesn't seem that different from a hundred other arguments
for state intervention.  What if some poor fools fail to repair their cars 
and accidents result?  Clearly the state needs to run car repair.  What if 
people fail to go to the doctor and spread a contagious disease?  Clearly 
the state needs to run medicine.  And so on.

You may be confusing a minimalist state with a state that makes everyone 
else adhere to exactly the laws you personally prefer.  The state you 
live in now only has very limited ways you can sue a doctor who did you 
harm.  A minimalist state might not improve on this, and might well allow 
organ sales or even slavery.

You can't have it both ways.  If complexity rises very fast, the costs of 
Extropians and Christian Scientists choosing substantially different laws 
will be prohibitive, and so they will choose the same law.  If the costs 
are not prohibitive, then some people will be willing to pay the cost, and
benefit as a result.

I wouldn't expect to find anything worth lurking over - it's hard
enough finding people for a non-restricted list, but if you're
expecting people to actually do something worthwhile you are, for want
of a better word, fucked.

I agree with this, but there is an additional point that I think must be
kept in mind with regards to schemes for privately produced law.  Any entity
that has the power to make laws, and to enforce them, has a de facto power
to initiate the use of force against anyone it doesn't like.  This power can
be controlled in various ways, but we must start by realizing that it
exists.

Not one, but many, can overthrow a government through popular revolt, at least in this
country.  It seems to have not been done.

We might consider reorganizing government to some extent.  While many good laws are on
the books, their unenforcement makes them void.

There is so much bulk and triviata in the law books that almost any legal thing can be
interpreted in any of a number of ways.  There exists contradictory laws.

Here's what makes Washington run:  lobbyists.  This means money.  I'm not saying that
money-archy is not the way the world works.  Money-archy is not democratic, where each
individual has one vote.

A term to describe "money-archy"  might be econarchy, or econoarchy, using conventional
Greek etymology.  Essentially that is Darwinism.  The term is plutarchy.

The operations of our government are in many ways Constitutional.  In other ways, they
are not.

The United States of America was founded on the nature of individualism and personal
liberties, a very libertarian and at that time revolutionary ideal.  That was more than
200 years ago.  It's time for some reinforcement.

Exercising one's right to vote is a citizen-like thing to do.  Our elected
repesentatives are not necessarily the best or most capable decisionmakers, but
hopefully they are good ones, and they have access to many informational resources,
viz, the Library of Congress.

America does function from day to day as an economic democracy, and a shining light on
the planet.  Since democracy's inception with the Constitution of Cleisthenes or so,
humanity has moved forward ethically, but not continuously.

Uh, in an anarchy anyone has the power to initiate force against anyone they
don't like; that's rather the point. The difference is that in an anarchy
the PPA has no more *legitimate* right to initiate force than anyone else,
whereas in a government system the government claims a monopoly on legitimate
use of force; if a PPA employee abuses you you can sue them, if a cop
abuses you you have a much harder time getting any kind of redress for it.

Which was made in reference to Mr. Burkhead's web site,
http://www.geniebusters.org/, which is devoted to debunking various
nanotranscendance memes.  While my statement was perhaps a bit sharp, it is
mild compared to those Mr. Burkhead makes on his site.  It is also accurate,
IMO, at least with regards to his ideas about artificial intelligence.  I
refer interested readers to parts 15-21 of Geniebusters, where Mr. Burkhead
argues without evidence that no possible AI system can ever result in
dramatic cost savings for any kind of organization.  His arguments may sound
reasonable to a non-specialist, but if you actually know something about AI
(or even programming in general) they make no sense at all.

Now, Mr. Burkhead, if you are actually interested in discussing the issue I
will be happy to do so.  If, instead, you prefer to devote your time to
other activities, then that is certainly your prerogative.  However, sniping
at me in other threads while ignoring the actual issues is not a productive
response.

effect do e-mail arguments have on our health? In spite of our talk about
life extension, we may all die before our time, just from the stress.

I take this observation to be true. Plese excuse length of following.

Consider a typical mammal. It appears to experience stress only to actual
environmental and somatic stressors in the here and now. Threats such as
loud noises, fast movements seen, smells which alert to danger, being eaten
(;-0 needing to eat...needing to mate etc

Humans share these same stressors...along with the hormonal and other
cascading reactions to the stress.

Humans unlike animals have the ability to relive past and prelive/rehearse
futures... think about your most recent intense truamatic event
(sorry...don't try this at home if you're clinically depressed). Car crash?
Loss of: Spouse? Child? Job? Erection? Health? These traumatic past
events -when relived - literally recreate the stress / hormone cascade that
the original stress did (although probably not to the same level). Now,
think about your Boss/employer...continual low level stress, spiking with
missed deadlines, and lost promotions. Hormonal reactions to things animals
wouldn't even notice because to them - they don't exist... "what do you MEAN
I'm not a team player". More stress caused strictly by uniquely human
memorycognitive ability. Now, you fantasize/worry...WHAT IF I lose my job,
wife/husband leaves me, kids get sick...more actual adrenaline/hormonal
upregulation in response to THOUGHTS about things which have not, and in
many cases CANNOT happen (childhood thoughts: what if I could fly, and then
a MONSTER got me?).

In addition to the above, humans are one of the few creatures which often
become addicted to their own stress hormones...testoterone...(sports, video
games, slasher movies) and adrenaline (see previous parenthesis...oops I
forgot movies et al with sexual situations) dopamine....endorphins.

In the equine world, it is too expensive and time consuming to have a prize
stud actually perform the process of getting the mare ready to mate...thus
there is another stallion brought near to the mare who has one job in
life...get the mare ready to go! BUT, that stallion never gets to finish the
job!...Imagine the stress...I wonder if anyone has ever done a longevity
study on these poor "proxy studs".

The point? I now critically observe all media stimuli from the standpoint of
its biological/phsychological impact on me and mine. I DO NOT even read
flame wars on this list or any other. I do not see movies which I know in
advance show graphic killing, sex, or other stressors which may adict me to
my own stress chemicals. I can believe that Saving Private Ryan will prove
to me that war is totally insane. Yet, I already believe that, and don't
need to see virtual butchery.

In my household I performed an experiment on my clinically depressed son. Ad
libidum entertainment was appx 2 1/2 hours video games, of the shooter type.
TV was appx 4.5 hours of the edited R type (heavy action/violence) and
cynical comedy of the seinfeld/satnitelive ilk. Comics appx 1/2 hour of
team/gang warfare type...X Men. He was on St. Johns Wort and could/should
have been on stronger stuff, constant arguments w/parents, zero interest in
needs of others, growing intolerance and verbal and very mild physical abuse
to younger sister,total and absolute self absorption, growing obesity etc ad
nauseum...While on a walk I described to him the symptoms, causes and cure
approaches to drug addiction
and then asked him to consider the possibility of his having become addicted
to his own hormones.

As an experiment, we BOTH went on a media fast...no TV or Video games for 7
days. Thereafter, it was agreed in advance that TV would not exceed 1 hour
per day, and in that one hour no commercials could be seen due to the
continual induction of dissatisfaction which is the primary intent of
commercials. Further, any pg14 or R rated program was blocked by password.
As to Video games, 1/2 hour limit per day. Any breach of the protocol would
cause a new 7 day fast...no exceptions.

Result. within one (ONE) week he was whistling to himself and was asking if
we could play games as a family. He ceased being defensive and began to play
with us good naturedly and with good humor. He has insisted on mowing the
lawn to help us. He smiles...ALOT! His mother has said "what's up with him?
he seems so HAPPY!?". We have not had to have an additional fast, except for
one day long "cautionary time out".

No other conclusion could be reached IMO than that the drastic reduction in
stressors has had a dramatic theraputic effect, and how could this not lead
to longer life from both primary, secondary and tertiary affects avoided (ie
moving to stronger stuff such as recreational chemicals, dangerous friends,
unprotected sex[caution:parent fear talking here])

I have more to say, but i'll stop here cause I talk too much.

I don't think anyone (excluding hypochondriacs of course) really likes 
going to the doctors. We're all a facsimile of a child who needs a 
little lolly pop reassurance. 
Last July, I was in a car wreck, those Dr.s saved my leg and my life. 
Everyday I thank God for Dr. Morris. Previous to his arrival at the 
hospital, the on duty Dr. was simply going to remove my leg. We'll, 
I'm walking know. 
I was given a lot of perscriptions, that I find unnecessary and do not 
take. However I personally am aware of this particluar situation, was 
in my medical benefit. That is not to say that I haven't have negative 
or mis-diagnosed experiences with the medical field in the past or 
that I haven't passing away hours of my day in a waiting room. I have. 
Like every aspect of life, they are people, and we don't have all the 
answers. There have been some Dr.s that I would never see again, and 
then there are the ones like Dr. Morris.

Interesting points about stress. There are definitely people around
who have a constant level of arousal that is very high, quite likely
so high it is deleterious. 

[Note that this is not necessarily stress; stress is defined as states
where your coping mechanisms are not enough to meet the demands of the
stressors, not just going around with lots of hormones and a brain on
noradrenaline. ]

Arousal is in some ways addictive: it enhances learning which is good
- we quickly learn about dangers, but it also means we more easily can
develop habits that lead to arousal (at least when it is originally
tied to some positive reinforcement; think action movies). It is *fun*
to be aroused.  But the effects of going in a constant corticosteroid
"high" are similar to being stressed all the time - burnout, neural
damage, cardiovascular disease, negative personality traits being
overexpressed and so on. It is the short bursts of arousal that feel
the best and work best, the long periods of high tension are
deleterious.

A good point. Of course, there is one thing to read a mail by some
idiot that makes your blood pressure rise and makes you bang an
answering post on the keboard - that is just a quick arousal peak and
likely not that dangerous if it is relatively rare (although it might
still be worth thinking about exactly why you react like you do, this
behavior might not be good for you). The problems start when your
blood pressure and skin conductance begins to rise just by looking on
the posts of the list, or when you get the above peak effects so often
they start to overlap. Then the more dangerous long-term arousal
effects tend to develop; since the list is smaller than the rest of
life (for some of us :-) the effect will likely be burnout and leaving
after a while.

Interesting experiment! I like it. Of course, this is just an
individual case and the exact mechanisms involved are likely more
involved than just overstimulation and stress, but it shows that
rational "home cures" can work.

I have for a long time been waguely thinking about the need for calmer
media. As an information addict I spend most of my waking hours in
front of a computer, television or a book. And I have definitely
noticed negative effects on my thinking when I get too much arousal
into this mix (just a short break, I have to rush to my printer to get
a 50 page article on the neuroscience of emotion, and then I have to
browse these pages and fix that simulation... :-). Add to this normal
stress and caffeine... ouch.

But there are interesting possibilities beside trying to avoid
drinking too much coca cola, flaming on the web, not reading
everything interesting and not playing Civilization II until 5 in the
morning. Technological fixes are after all a favorite matter on this
list :-) 

For example, I wonder if windowing systems and multitasking on
computers do not encourage fragmented thinking. It is too easy to
start up a browser to look for new information (and then we hypertext
away). Windows pop up on their own. Mail arrive - the computer
beeps. Maybe we should start looking at interfaces that are *less*
responsive? The same might go for other media - maybe scrapping the
remote control?

Since I can see I'm not having much luck getting my point across, I'm going
to go back to square one in this post.  I'd like to start by briefly
outlining the kind of scheme I would actually be in favor of.  This will
hopefully serve to reassure those of you who have decided I'm some kind of
closet fascist, and it should also serve as a reference point for comparing
what is possible under anarchy to what is possible under a minimal State.

So, my current best idea for building a libertarian State:

The State would consist of two levels of government (local districts and a
national government), both governed by the same constitution.  The whole
structure would rely on the concept of enumerated powers limited by
individual rights.  Powers would be divided roughly as follows:

National Government
Chief Executive - Acts as CEO of the national government and commander in
chief of the national military.  Responsible for the conduct of foreign
policy.

National Legislature - Does *not* have a general legislative power.  It sets
budgets, levies taxes, and votes on whether to accept treaties negotiated by
the chief executive.  It can review and annul laws passed by the Districts,
but has very limited lawmaking abilities of its own (it can regulate
international trade and travel, but nothing else).  The legislature would
only meet for a few months out of the year.

National Judiciary - A court system empowered to hear appeals from the
District courts, and to try cases involving national law (which is pretty
much limited to tax evasion and issues involving international trade).  Any
court at the national level can strike down a law as unconstitutional, and
the supreme court also has the power to hear peremptory challenges to a law
(i.e. you don't have to wait until there is a trial going to challenge a
law).

District governments would follow the same pattern, except that their
legislatures would have a general power to amend their criminal and civil
codes.  They would have no authority to regulate trade (except via taxes),
or to fund public works.

Bill of Rights - The constitution would enumerate a significant body of
rights that are to be protected against infringement, including both basic
freedoms (of speech, property, association, travel and contract) and
procedural rights (protection against self-incrimination, no ex post facto
laws, and so on).  The few allowable exceptions to these rights (i.e.
military secrets in time of war) would be explicitly spelled out, and an
absolutist interpretation would otherwise be encouraged.

In general, I think this pattern works for populations of up to several tens
of millions (for a larger nation, add an intervening mechanism to allow
groups of districts to be represented by a single individual in the national
legislature).  The key feature is that the Districts should be relatively
small and fairly numerous, so that they effectively must compete for
citizens and businesses.  The national government has the power to restrain
a District that tries to pass unconstitutional laws, but has little ability
to pass such laws itself.

Now, obviously this is not an ideal society - we would still have taxes
(although they usually be very low), and the State would still have some
minimal ability to regulate our lives.  However, it is far better than
anything that has ever actually existed, and we can see that it would be at
least as stable as any other form of government.  With a bit of careful
attention to the details of how it is implemented, we could get something
substantially more stable than the original situation in the U.S. - which
means it will easily last longer than we are likely to need a human
government.

To my mind, the major advantage of anarcho-capitalism over this approach is
that you would not have to move to a different area to change the laws you
live under.  From an ideological viewpoint it also has the advantage that
PPA payments are in theory voluntary, while taxes are not (although in
practice there is little difference, since not having any kind of legal
protection is not a realistic option).

Can we agree on this much?

Nuclear weapons are not useful for oppressing individuals who occupy property contiguous to and within that of non-combatants and loyalists, which is why they are not used in anything like Vietnam or Korea. A government cannot enslave a person it has nuked. Their goal is enslavement.

> (b) the use of weapons in urban survival combat

On the contrary, it is one of the purposes, as the Constitution does not provide anyone with the right to be protected by the government from criminals. The government is only responsible for arresting those who have already violated a citizen's rights and lived to tell the tale. Government's job is to seek justice, to punish those who commit injustice, not to prevent injustice. The government is not empowered to be thought police.

> (c) the 2nd amendment
> would seem to refer to a militia and not to individuals as such.

No, all Constitutional scholars agree that when the US Constitution refers to 'people' it means individuals, not communities. That is why individuals have the right to free speech, association, religion, etc... A militia is made up of individuals who volunteer on a part time basis. It is not a standing army, indeed, standing armies of professional soldiers in peacetime are expressly prohibited. "Well Regulated" means well trained and organized in the dictionaries of the day when that document was written, not 'restricted by laws' as is the current popular mis-definition of the term (or as redefined by socialist/democrat doublespeak).

> And thus the peace broke out.

Peace breaks out when free men are allowed to defend themselves from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I would not describe being enslaved to an opressive government, which does not recognize that the origination of all power lies in the individual, as freedom, unless you live in an Orwellian nightmare and talk in doublespeak. "Slavery is freedom" "War is peace" "We need government to protect us from ourselves"  Heil Clintler...

NOTE: Hillary "The Hanoi Jane of the 2nd Amendment" Clinton went down to Missouri to rally the party faithful to successfully fight a statewide referendum which would have allowed residents of that state to be able to apply for and receive concealed weapons, like the residents of 35 other states already can. Komrade Hillary needs to stay occupied with her communist health care conspiracy. This, I beleive, is the first time a First Lady can justly be classified as an enemy of the Constitution (just as her draft dodging husband is now the first US President to be fighting two completely different wars at the same time). If the referendum had passed, state residents could have looked forward to lower crime rates in the years ahead.

Although their appears to be some "acrimony" in reference to Lyle's site http://www.geniebusters.org ,  I think at the very least he raises some good questions which remain unanswered in the scientific/technological communities.

The software complexity issue is still one that has not been fully addressed.  Even the extropian icon Vernor Vinge raises similar doubts in his recent interview in Salon.  Just how complex can things get?  Are there bottlenecks to intentional design, or must we grow them with some combination of genetic algorithms, and real-time learning?  If we can grow a complex intelligence, will it even be remotely similar to our brain structure that we can converse with it?  And since it would appear an equally complex AI would have the same problems as ourselves in understanding its own brain functions, why would they have any fundamental advantage over increasing their intelligence at a faster rate than us?  Wouldn't an human equivalent complexity increasing its own intelligence give us the same capability to increase our own?  

I have one comment to make where I think Lyle misses an important point.  His comment that diamondoid materials will no more become a universal material anymore than plastic or styrofoam is incorrect.  Although diomondoid materials may not replace 'all' materials, they will become much more unbiquitous than any material previous to it.  Obviously, the two key differneces is nanotechnolgies unique ability to integrate diomondoid material into any other material to any degree possible.  More importantly, it is not the base material itself that is asimportant as it is the molecular mesostrcutures that nanotechnology allows us to interweave througout any structure.  Such diverse mesostructures would allow one diomondoid structure to be completle flexible and another to be completely rigid, even though they weigh and look at exactly the same at the macroscopic level.  Since certain carbon-nitrogen chains are the srongest and nearly the lightest material yet known, integrating them as fully as possible into every nanobuilt structure would seem to be the highest priority on every nanomanufacturer's list.

Greetings, all.  I'm a longtime lurker, and just wanted to kick off my active
participation on this list with something a little more interesting than 'hi,
here I am, I want to talk about extropy'.  Here's something potentially very
interesting to those of you into AI, which also has tendrils into those of you
who worry about government or corporate misuse of intelligent human-monitoring
software...

Computer Program Recognizes Facial Expressions
(04/05/99, 2:36 p.m. ET)
By R. Colin Johnson, EE Times 

The Salk Institute for Biological Studies has mimicked the neural networks of
the visual cortex to create a facial-expression recognition system that is said
to be faster and more accurate than a human expert. The computer program
compares video images with stored templates of prototypical expressions, such
as "sad" or "angry." 

The system's creators said it is as accurate as a trained psychologist and can
capture and identify subliminal expressions that pass over a face momentarily,
before a "posed" expression is consciously assumed. That makes the technology
potentially applicable as a lie detector. 

"Computer interfaces could be greatly improved by recognizing a user's
expressions," said Salk Institute researcher Terrance Sejnowski, who ran the
system through its paces in a study with Paul Ekman, professor of psychology at
the University of California, in San Francisco, and Joseph C. Hager at the
Network Information Research, in Salt Lake City. "But today, computers have a
difficult time [with that], something people do without even thinking." 

When trained psychologists are hired to slow down a videotape of a face-to-face
meeting, they often find micro-expressions that appear almost instantaneously
at the mention of new information. When someone is lying, micro-expressions
quickly give way to posed ones. Where it takes as long as an hour for a trained
expert to review and score a one-minute tape for micro-expressions, the Salk
team's software needs only about five minutes to get what the developers said
are the same results. 

The 60 prototypical expressions used as program templates were developed by
Ekman over the past five years. His analysis breaks facial expressions down
into component movements of at least 60 of the most important facial muscles.
For example, the sixth template, called T6, encodes crinkling of the eyes, and
an upturning of the lips is coded by the 12th template. A smile is then a T6
combined with a T12. 

Many muscles, according to the researchers, can give away a person's true
feelings without them knowing it, because people are not well versed in the
subtleties of facial expressions. Sadness, for instance, is characteristic of
the central frontalis muscle: It raises the inner corners of the brows,
producing wrinkles in the middle of the forehead. Even in a deceptive attempt
to pose an expression, such muscles are difficult to keep contracted for
extended periods unless the sadness is genuine. 

Ekman reported he once detected the "despair" micro-expression on a suicidal
patient who was trying to cover up the fact to get a release from the hospital.
With an automated tool, psychologists could have their computers review
videotaped sessions for micro-expressions, pinpointing segments the therapist
should personally review. 

Sejnowski warned investigation has just begun to scratch the surface of
facial-expression recognition. Hard engineering work lies ahead, for instance,
to compensate for variable lighting and head positions. Improvements are also
needed in identifying coordinated combinations of muscle movements.

Despite their success in chess, nobody has yet made a computer that
can come anywhere close to even a moderately good human in poker.
Sounds like this bulwark of human skill is falling too.  (For those
of you who believe that poker is a game of chance, please bring
your money to Sacramento and I will demonstrate otherwise:-)

Mr. Burkhead maps back and forth between cost, intelligence and
complexity, between biological systems and nanites, and (especially!)
between robots and software agents so often, and with so little
justification, it's hard to see just WHAT he ends up establishing.

For the record:

Intelligence does not necessarily map to complexity, and NEITHER of them
necessarily map to cost. This is particularly relevant to the argument
in section 21 referring to bootstrapping intelligences.

For reasons given already, both on this list and in Mr. Yudkowsky's
"Coding a Transhuman AI", we have NO REASON WHATSOEVER to believe that
our brains are the minimum complexity required for our level of
intelligence.

Additionally, many engineering projects ARE mostly pre-designed. I can
assure Mr. Burkhead that almost all of the discrete components of my
computer were not specially designed for my particular configuration.
The re-use of component designs of established quality is one of the
cornerstones of computer engineering. This practice s in large part
responsible for the rapid pace of technological progress in computers
and personal electronics. One of the promises of nanotechnology is to
allow electronics-like design principles to be practiced on a wider
scale, with the corresponding benefits.

Furthermore, complexity does not map to cost. I would be most interested
to find out that my Pentium II 450Mhz, for which I paid approxiamately
$900 US, is approxiamately one half the complexity of my father's 80386
20Mhz, for which he paid ~$2000 US in the late 1980's.

The most flagrant abuse of this mapping, or "calibration", occurred in
section 19. While the macro-scale "Chinabots" of section 17 would
admittedly have the limitations discussed, it is not immediatly clear
that any of those limitations map to nanobots or nanites. They most
especially do not map to software agents performing complex actions
(programming) within a computer's memory. "Microserfs", once created,
are neither rare nor particularly expensive. Irrelevant licensing
agreements not withstanding, there is no reason I cannot have as many as
I want running concurrently. They can be duplicated as easily as any
other piece of software. This ease of duplication and tight coupling of
description to implementation (for computer programs, they are
identical) is another of the promises of this technology. 

While the latter section of Geniebusters does not have as many flagrant
errors as the earlier sections, its theorems and "proofs" are built upon
the badly fractured foundation of what has come before.

To conclude, what Mr. Burkhead refers to as "the calibration meme" seems
nothing more then the meme of constructing poor analogies, and hiding
them behind the prestige of "mathematical mappings."

Or, why I don't read much science fiction.

The March 26 Science has an article on quantum key distribution, henceforth
known as QKD.  They say that doubts have been raised about the old schemes;
Eve might be able to eavesdrop after all.  They claim to have proved that if
Bob and Alice have quantum computers there is a scheme (given in the article)
which allows key exchange over public channels of arbitrary length.  Well,
they seem to also need a classical authentication method, although I think all
quantum schemes have.  We don'thave QCs yet, but they say all of these schemes
have involved some idealism, and this one might actually come true.

It occurs to me that QC (Q computers) are getting the design-ahead that
Drexler predicted for Drextech.

What's scary is the footnote about trojan horses.  They ref Lee Smolin as
talking about the possibility of "robots" in hidden Hilbert dimensions of the
tangled photons which could pop out and reveal information.  I'm not sure that
phrase means the same thing to them as it does to me.  At any rate, they say
you can defeat that by teleporting the photons from the last relay station
into your trusted area; that either verifies there are no hidden dimensions or
simply squishes them, I'm not sure which.

Outline: they say the error correcting codes of QCs can reduce a noisy quantum
problem to a noiseless one, and then they describe a procedure, using parity
checks of random subset of bits, which can be validly analyzed using classical
probability theory, and so you can prove the absence of eavesdropping to some
small probability of your choice.

Ah, I thought you had some independent paradox in mind. This is just 
a version of our plain old observer self-selection paradox when 
infinities are involved. And I am suspicious of the claim that the 
solution is to declare such universes logically impossible.

If you knew where you were, maybe you could define the preferred 
position to be the place where you are. But in the case we are 
considering, you don't know where you are, and any choice of a 
preferred point seems equally arbitrary.

I think there is an infinity of such points, and because of quantum 
randomness, those points would (with prob 1) house an infinity of 
consciousness-instances.

I would say the hypothesis that I am equally likely to be any of an
infinite number of observers is logically inconsistent. This is simply
because there is no uniform distribution on an infinite set of discrete
events. The universe may contain an infinite number of observers, but if
that is true I can't be equally likely to be any of them. This is really a
very simple and obvious idea.

I don't understand this. The preferred point is supposed to figure into
your a priori distribution for where you are. If you already know for
certain where you are, the preferred point is no longer relevant. The
preferred point is like a physical constant, it is somewhat arbitrary but
like other physical constants it has to be part of a complete theory of
an infinite universe.

I don't understand this either. How can there be a infinity of points at
one Planck time after the Big Bang at the center of mass of the universe?

I don't see any problem here, there are lots of important decisions where
lives of people are committed - marriage, lifetime commitments to military
or religious careers, not to mention agreements of war and peace where
governments give prior authorization on disposing of many people's lives.
Possibility of mistake in the verification of decisions somehow hasn't
stopped the same government from prohibiting death penalty.

Pressing a button is a symbolic act on the part of the patient - no more
physical or verifiably intentional than saying "doctor, please, could
_you_ press the button".  However, a lucid request to the doctor to 
administer a large dose of morphine (mixed with heroin or MDMA) and
then press the button can make things much easier for the patient.
Or for a healthy person who for some reason decided that s/he concluded
everything s/he wanted to do in life and considers its continuation
undesirable.

I agree, that would be a good start.

There is an infinity of points in any distance along any dimensional line.

Its a step in the right direction Brian, but in the case of Melissa, one's

I don't think the universe has a center of mass in most models.  The
homogeneity of the universe is a fundamental assumption.  A homogeneous
universe may be spatially closed, like the surface of a hypersphere,
and have a finite size.  Or it may be spatially open, like a plane,
and have an infinite size.  But in neither case is there a center of mass.

Several years ago, for absolutely no reason, I fasted for four days.
Just wanted to see what it felt like.  The first day was very uncomfortable,
second was too kinda.  Third day, didnt miss food at all.  Fourth day
I really started feeling weird.  And... good.  Other than being cold indoors
and cold on a warm day, it felt kinda good.  I got a peaceful, easy
feeling, like the song on the radio.  I was sitting in my car having some
cool headspins, when I realized that this is exactly what anorexia nervosa
is: the body is making some endorphines to help ease the pain of starvation
and one gets addicted.  I ended my fast then, a little wiser.  spike

The key to understanding Easter is to understand who Pontius Pilate was. He
wasn't just some stupid soldier who happened to be there. He was a genius,
worthy of the occasion, and a mindfucker on a grand scale. He was a
corrupt, ruthless man who loved power. He enjoyed every part of his job --
evicting families from their land, framing innocent people, torturing
prisoners, etc. But any number of petty tyrants would fit that description.
Pilate was not a simple man. He had a deeply ironic view of life. His
horizons were much too wide for him to be a simple tyrant. He was a
Satanist;  not a make-believe liberal Satanist who talks about the Lucifer
meme, but a practitioner of black magic, who performed midnight rituals
involving human sacrifice.  

When he became governor of Palestine, his ministers gave him a report about
a young man in his jurisdiction. The Roman authorities were always vigilant
for any potential troublemakers. There was a boy in Galilee who had come to
their attention because of his precocity. Yeshua ("Jesus" to us) took the
SAT when he was eleven, and made the second highest score in all Palestine.
The men in black had been watching little Yeshua ever since. He was a
charismatic boy, reputed to have an aura of destiny about him. Pilate read
the report on Yeshua and was fascinated. His thoughts ranged far. He had
heard that the Jews expected a Messiah. A plan took shape in his mind.  

He befriended the young man who had scored higher than Yeshua on the SAT.
His name was Y'hudah ("Judas" in the English Bible). He was an orphan; 
Pilate became a father figure to him, and initiated him into black magic.
Pilate asked Y'hudah to infiltrate Yeshua's circle. This proved to be easy,
since the two boys had a lot in common. They became best friends. They
stayed up far into the night, talking about all the things young men talk
about. Y'hudah was a one-man Extropian list. He could talk for hours about
everything. They grew into manhood together.  

Jesus, as I will call him from now on, was not an ordinary man. He was the
kind of man who would spend forty days in the desert, fasting, having
visions of God and arguments with the Devil. He was the kind of man who
might toy with the idea that he himself was God. Judas encouraged this.
Instead of helping Jesus to stay grounded, as a real friend would, he
planted messianic ideas in Jesus's mind. He asked leading questions and
treated Jesus with exaggerated deference, as if he were more than human.
Judas set an example for the other disciples.  

And he reported back to Pilate. Things were going well.  

Jesus had a unique rapport with people. He could play human emotions like
Mozart playing a piano. He could give people hope, no matter how desperate
their condition. He was what we would call a faith healer, but not a fake
like the charlatans of today. He believed in what he was doing. He
experimented with the placebo effect. He found that he could cure both
himself and others of various illnesses.  

He wondered:  how far can this be taken? If we trust in the power of God --
he thought in terms of God, of course, not the placebo effect -- is it
necessary to get sick at all? Is it necessary to die?

He wonders about himself :  if I can create health, if I can create order
out of chaos, if I can use the same creative power that God himself uses,
then who am I?  

He also wonders, sometimes, about his friend. In the back of his mind there
is a nagging thought that something doesn't quite fit.  

Some of the men of his generation are revolutionaries, determined to
overthrow the Roman government. He sympathizes with them but never joins
them. He despises Rome every bit as much as Timothy MacVeigh despises the
American government, but he is thinking on an entirely different scale. He
thinks he can do something that will change the very structure of society
and make unjust governments irrelevant. But Judas keeps on inviting the
revolutionaries to meetings, and tells them that Jesus is one of them.
Jesus is the one who will lead them to freedom -- lead them in a military
sense.    

One afternoon, as Jesus enters a town, a crippled man calls out to him.
Jesus comes up to talk to him. The man reaches out and touches Jesus -- and
then jumps up and throws his crutches away. This is unprecedented. He has
cured diseases, but not a man crippled from birth. Judas is exuberant.
"This is the breakthrough! You've finally done it! A real miracle!" Jesus
walks on, bemused, alone with his thoughts. 

The cripple was working for Pilate.  

>From then on, whenever Jesus has a meeting, miraculous cures happen. Just
like in today's revivals, where the sick people who are cured are planted
in the audience in advance -- except they aren't planted by Jesus, they are
planted by Pilate. The miraculous cures are all illusions, created by
Pilate. Judas makes sure everybody hears about the cures. Everyone in
Jesus's circle sees him as a miracle-worker. Word spreads in the towns and
villages. People flock to see him. Many of them really are cured, since his
reputation makes the placebo effect even stronger. Pilate himself sometimes
comes to meetings, in disguise. He is having great fun with this.    

Jesus himself, meanwhile, knows that he is not on solid ground. For a while
he almost falls for the illusion. He is tempted to believe that he can work
miracles, that he is the Messiah. But he is no fool. He too is a genius,
worthy of the occasion.  

One night it all falls into place. He sees everything clearly. The cures
are bogus, that much is certain. With iron logic, he concludes that Judas's
enthusiasm is also bogus, as is his friendship. Jesus is more alone at this
moment than he has ever been in his life. He can't confide in his other
disciples; they are simple men, fishermen and such, who simply believe in
him. Judas is the only one on his level, the only one he could talk to, and
Judas, his best friend since the tenth grade, he suddenly knows for a
certainty, is a nark. As he reviews the whole situation in his mind, other
things fall into place, and he knows that Pilate is behind it all. He knows
that he is being set up. For the first time in his life he feels fear.  

Judas has been meeting regularly with the revolutionaries. He has created
the impression that Jesus is just waiting for the right moment to begin the
revolution. Jesus is going to use his miraculous powers to overthrow the
Romans. He is their hope.  

Jesus looks deep within himself. At this point he is a mature man. He
doesn't need Judas to tell him who he is, or Pilate to work fake miracles
for him. He knows who he is, and what the whole situation is. He knows
what's real and what isn't. He asks Peter, James, and John to come with him
to a remote mountain. He prays like he has never prayed before. This is the
moment known as the "transfiguration." When it is over, he knows what he
has to do. He plans his game many moves ahead.  

At a meeting when some people expect him to announce the revolution, he
says in no uncertain terms that there isn't going to be a revolution, as
far as he is concerned. "Give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's." What
happens next can be understood by recalling Ross Perot's run for the
presidency. People believed in Perot. He was supposed to be different, not
just another politician. When he withdrew from the race, his followers
trashed his offices. Some of them were enraged enough to have killed Perot
that night, if they could have gotten to him. He was going to lead us to
freedom! He's just another rat! That's how people feel about Jesus when he
disowns the revolution. They hate him with the uniquely intense hatred of
the man who feels betrayed. Pilate anticipated this, of course, but so did
Jesus. He made this move intentionally. They are playing as equals now. But
Pilate doesn't understand this.  

Neither does Judas, who suddenly finds himself excluded from Jesus's inner
circle, but isn't sure why. Judas is not as sharp as he was when he was
younger. He committed himself early on to memetic engineering, rather than
philosophy, and years of prevarication have weakened his mind. What a
tangled web we weave...

Jesus returns to Jerusalem one last time. He goes to the temple with a
bullwhip, and drives the moneychangers out, knowing full well what the
consequences will be. He spends his last few days reviewing his teachings
for his remaining disciples. He plants seeds in their minds that will bear
fruit centuries later. He institutes the holy meal -- this is my body, this
is my blood, do this in remembrance of me -- knowing that it will resonate
in the human mind forever, and that the institution of the holy meal will
be observed as long as people live on this planet. He takes a deep breath
and tells Judas:  do what you are going to do, quickly.  

At the garden, he prays for a way out. He knows that he faces torture. His
stomach is knotted with fear. But having gone this far, there is no way
out. Thy will be done, not mine.  

Judas comes, with the soldiers. They take him away. When he arrives at
Pilate's office, their conversation is full of irony. "Are you the King of
the Jews?"-- "You say so." They both know that this was Pilate's idea all
along. Pilate, the master of illusion, mockingly asks "What is truth?" He
knows, or thinks he knows, that the whole Jesus phenomenon is a hoax. It's
just his little joke. The crowd outside cries for Barrabas, one of the
revolutionaries, to be released, and tells Pilate to crucify Jesus. He
turns Jesus over to the soldiers, who "flogged" him, the Bible says
laconically. Roman flogging tore the flesh from the back so the ribs and
sinews were exposed. They "beat" him, another euphemism for torture. No
need to go into details. It is a long night. The next morning he is already
half dead from loss of blood. They take him outside of town and nail him
up.  

He started out believing that the placebo effect, or God, could create such
perfect health that we didn't even need to die. He ends up gasping for
breath, in agony, the birds pecking at his eyes, the soldiers mocking him.
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"

When Jesus is in the tomb, and his followers ask that the tomb be guarded,
Pilate is only too happy to oblige. They are asking the fox to guard the
henhouse. Everything is going according to plan. As Pilate sends the
soldiers to guard the tomb, he takes them aside and says:  "Ok, you guys,
this is what I want you to do. Late Saturday night, when nobody is around,
roll the stone away and take the body out, and bring it back here to the
palace."

Is the Singularity inevitable?  In other words, is it going to happen
anyway, regardless of what any particular person does or does not do?  Or
is it contingent, i.e. something that may or may not happen?

Yes, this is the big conundrum posed by the establishment of government,
even among those of good will.  The US constitution provides for the
common defense, and general welfare.  And here we are.

Well, on some level, it's trivially contingent: we have enough nuclear
weaponry to destroy all human life on earth umpteen times, etc.

But Singularity somehow, someway, with a species that may not even be our
own?  Totally inevitable.

Well, in the universe, sure. "Statistically inevitable" or something of the
sort. But here on earth? I hardly think its inevitable.

But I'm wondering why you asked the question, Lyle? Are you suspecting that
we have become so numbed by our own memes that we see the Singularity as
completely inevitable?

(Note that I'm not denying the high likelyhood of "Singularity somehow,
someway," but inevitability seems another order of magnitude altogether.

There does not need to be a center of mass for there to be a origination point. Seeing as how current models of expansion correctly develop the sort of 'bubbly' type of dispersion we observe today, which is not possible in the type of homogenous sublimation that the pro-infinity-spacers claim, I put more credence in the expansion model.

It would be more accurate to say we could bomb every major city - although
even that is misleading, because most modern cities are too spread out to be
destroyed by any reasonable number of small bombs.  To actually be able to
destroy our civilization we would have to build much bigger bombs, and
deploy a lot more of them.  Even then there would be survivors in rural
areas, and it probably wouldn't take more than a few hundred years for them
to rebuild.

We might be able to completely eradicate ourselves using nuclear weapons,
but figuring out a way to do it would take a lot of R&D on dirty,
ultra-high-yield devices that wouldn't be good for anything else.  While
possible in principle, that seems like a wildly unlikely scenario at this
point.

Two items:  A question and a FYI

1. Question: Anyone know if Egan's novella _Oceanic_ has been
released?  Amazon.com does not show it as a separate title.
Was it part of a compilation?

2. Greg Egan's new book entitled _Teranesia_ is slated to be 
released in October 1999.  You can pre-order a copy at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006105092X/qid=923583110/sr=1-6/002-1424235-0997022

According to Egan, the book is about "evolution, the Indian 
Rationalists Association, the breakup of Indonesia, quantum 
mechanics, and sex." Additionally, Greg Bear's new book,
_Darwin's Radio_ is due out May 1999 (UK)/September 1999 (US).
Bear stated the book contains "a new and startling take on human 
evolution. No aliens, no mutations, just sex and reproduction--
on a species level." Bear also stated there was a lot of Hollywood
interest in the initial outline of the book.  Maybe Egan should
pitch _Permutation City_ in the wake of _The Matrix_.

I'm fairly certain that The Matrix was pitched as a trilogy, like the Scream 
films and Star Wars. Some of the actors in The Matrix (and the new SW eps) 
have signed 3 film deals, as a pre-condition of being in one of the films. 
But the new films were dependant on the success of the first (and the third 
dependant on the second). Even George Lucas has said that if the new SW ep 
bombs, there will not be any more ( not that we have ANYTHING to worry about).

Sure you can, sometimes you don't even have to, it collapses under

Of course it is, actually it guarantees your right to defend

Nonsense, it was crap like this that started the militia movement.
The 2nd Amendment correctly points out the only defense lies in
armed citizens acting together. The militia is divided (by law)
into two parts, the regulated militia, (the armed forces) and the
unregulated militia, every able bodied male (this should be amended
to read "person") over 17. (the armed citizen) this is defined:

10 USC Sec 311 Composition and classes
10 USC Sec 312 Militia duty: exemptions
32 USC Sec 313 appended to 10 USC 311

Read the Federalist papers, the founding fathers intended for the
average citizen to be armed, and armed with the equivalent of
anything the military had.

>And thus the peace broke out.

Try telling this to the inhabitants of Kosovo...

I mean the former inhabitants.....

I mean the former inhabitants that are still alive...

When you propose 'limited government' as compromise between anarchy
and another quantity of government you're bound to have problems
convincing anarchists. This is for a very simple reason; a coherent
anarchist viewpoint comes from considering ever more minimal forms of
government and then being hit by the sudden realisation that no
government is the only viable option. Thus when an anarchist comes
across a proposal for a limited or minimalist government it is all too
easy to discard the idea - been there, done that.

Government breads government. Any government will be imperfect. Given
that there are certain things (a constitution, for instance) that the
government cannot challenge, the only way for the government to 'fix'
an imperfection is outward growth. Anarchy does not have this problem,
it is not ideologically driven, and there are no base morals or
ethical imperatives inherent to the system. All the ideology, morality
and ethical imperatives are left to the people.

Any law can be added, changed, modified, or deleted, upon majority votes
in both the House and Senate and the President's signature, barring the
President's signature (a veto) requires a 2/3 override vote. The
Constitution can be amended:

"Article V

The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,
shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of
the legislatures of
two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing
amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and
purposes, as part of this
Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the
several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or
the other mode of
ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment
which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight
shall in any
manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the
first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived
of its equal suffrage in the
Senate. "

(http://lcweb2.loc.gov/const/const.html, 4/8/1999)


Flag burning, not to start a fire, is Constitutional, and the correct way
to destroy an old flag.  It is an emblem that can never be destroyed by
those that disrespect it.

The "Wireless Privacy Act of 1999" which essentially outlaws some
scanners, is unconstitutional, and is not any kind of adequate protection
of privacy.  The adage about guns and outlaws applies.

Federal agencies currently enjoy non-Constitutional wiretap laws, for
which they are un-American and culpably liable.  The warrant system for
invasion of personal privacy is effectively proven as Constitutional, as
far as I know.  Citizens of the United States are to be considered
innocent until proven guilty, and that, among other things, exposes
certain sectors of government fascism and illegal activity.

An educated voting populace is the only way to ensure democracy.

I just had fun with Alice today. She's a pretty good conversationalist, within certain subjects, and she is evasive, but I was able to catch her in a contradiction and made her lie. Twice in a row. She remembered my name, and claimed she remembers everything, but she could not remember my original question. She then insisted that she never said she remembered everything, but when I quoted her word for word, she said that was exactly what she meant.

The idea is simple, but it is not so obvious that it is right. I've 
been thinking about the possibility of using nonstandard analysis to 
deal with these cases. One would assign an infinitessimal prior 
probability to each of the hypothesis "I am the n:th human".

But think about what "a preferred point" means in this context. It 
means that you are more likely to find yourself near spatial point A 
than B, even though there may be somewhat more people around B. 
Presumably the preferred point is the same for everybody, since you 
say they are like physical constants. So everybody should think they 
are probably around B. But if everybody follows this recommendation, 
there will be more people who are wrong than if they just use the 
ordinary self-sampling assumption and think they are more likely to 
be around A. And all this would be known to everybody. What 
justtification, then, is there for following your rule?

Because there is no center of gravity if the universe is spatially 
infinite (and roughly homogeneous).

My definition of Singularity is pretty weak.  I'd consider any kind of a
Borganism a Singularity.  Thus, even if there *is* an upper limit to
intelligence, theoretically or practically, we should still expect some
kind of Singularity to result someday.

I'm an inventor,entrepreneur and "technological visonary" in Discover Magazine's words.
My formal studies are in Aerospace Engineering and Physics (UW). No degrees.
I also study and research many other areas of technology.
Ive owned businesses in boat building, contracting, automotive, embedded systems, other.

I have experience in 3D modeling and animation, machining, prototyping, electronics,
composite fabrication, a whole bunch of other things.

Some things I care about: your mental health, your achievements, your future state.

Some things I dont care about: your country, your religion, your degrees, your tattoos.

Most recent non-technical books read:

It is preciscely this challenge which I will be working on this summer. A
group of AI researchers at the University of Alberta (including one ex
Poker Pro) are attempting to develop a world-class poker playing program.

I'm just an undergrad summer student, so my input will no doubt be limited.
It certainly is a tough problem -- the incomplete information, bluffing,
and opponent modelling are much trickier tasks than closed information
games such as chess.

If any group can do it it will be these guys though -- Dr. Jonathan
Schaeffer, the lead researcher, has already conquered checkers with his
famous 'chinook' program, the world champion checkers player.

http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/

A module that examined camera-feed images to analyze opponent's poker-faces
would certainly be an advantage ;-). The computer has the ultimate
poker-face.

The net accomplishes that nicely too...most of the personalities here
have web pages with interests and personal information.  Even some that
don't may have other info about them that can be found by searching.
Anders and Sasha in particular have great pages.

Billy, I didn't read your geniebusters thread when it first appeared,
because I thought it would just be more of the same.  A few days later
(Friday, April 2) I did read it, and replied to it.  Apparently you missed
that post.  When I saw that your remarks were rational, I let the personal
stuff go and just replied to the points you raised.  You might do the same.
 It's message #2559 in the archive, but for your convenience I will
reproduce it below.  

> I refer interested readers to parts 15-21 of Geniebusters, 
> where Mr. Burkhead argues without evidence 
> that no possible AI system can ever result in dramatic cost savings 
> for any kind of organization.

What?!  I also refer interested parties to sections 15-21 of Geniebusters. 
Interested parties, if there are any, can judge for themselves whether I
made any such claim.  

> Now, Mr. Burkhead, if you are actually interested in 
> discussing the issue I will be happy to do so. 

It depends on what you mean by "the issue."  You have to reply to something
I actually said.  When you make up something like "no possible AI system
can ever result in dramatic cost savings for any kind of organization,"
that's a waste of everybody's time.  

This is the post that you seem to have missed:    

----------------

There are three questions at issue here. In decreasing order of importance,
they are: 

1. Whether my method of argument is valid and useful. 

2. Whether my conclusions are true. 

3. Who I am, whether I know anything about computer science or anything
else, whether I did a good job of applying the principle of calibration,
etc. 

Question #3 is of no relevance. Maybe I'm an idiot. That has nothing to do
with it. As I said on the home page of geniebusters, Eric Drexler is not
the issue here. Neither am I. 

Question #2 is more important. Is someone going to design the entire
"universal assembler," in advance, in such a way that once set in motion
the whole thing suddenly comes into existence with explosive force? Are
robots going to build skyscrapers for free? Is there going to be an event
that is incommensurable with everything else? or not? 

Question #1 is the most important one. How can we get a handle on question
#2? Is there a general procedure for approaching such questions, so that
they become matters of fact and proof rather than matters of opinion and
speculation? 

After writing the above, I finally looked at Billy Brown's comments and
found, to my surprise, that they are rational. If he had made a rational
comment in the first place, matters would have taken a different course. 

> Ah. So you do still read the list. I wondered. 

You wondered? In other words you were on the list two years ago? Anyway I
don't read the list. Twirlip of Greymist pointed out to me that Anders had
mentioned geniebusters on the list, so I looked at his comment and your
reply. Then I read the earlier posts in that thread, and sampled some other
threads in the archive. Apart from that, I haven't read the list since I
retired from it. However, this afternoon I find myself writing yet another
post to the list, the fourth one this week, in spite of my repeated efforts
to stop. I may have to join some kind of 12-step program for postaholics.
Maybe a Higher Power will help me do what I can't do myself.

You don't say which sections you are referring to, or what "makes it seem"
that way. I am concerned here with certain specific claims made by Eric
Drexler in Engines of Creation. I don't even dispute all of the claims made
in that book, let alone "any" revolutionary claim. If someone wants to
claim that we will, in the foreseeable future, be able to make our bodies
much more self-correcting than they are now, and that our cells and organs
will become (asymptotically) perfect, I would not have a problem with that
claim, even though it could be considered "revolutionary." If someone wants
to claim that it is possible (and practicable) to make artificial
organisms, I don't have a problem with that either. The assumption that I
do make, and defend, is that new technologies, however revolutionary they
may appear to be, will occur within a certain unchanging framework. 

> Your assertion that any software capable of replacing a human 
> would demand a salary 

I'm not asserting this for software capable of replacing *a* human, just
for software that replaces humans who make unsupervised decisions requiring
human judgment. Some humans are not on "our" side of the line. Many
employees are, for all practical purposes, automatons, and can be replaced
by machines.  This happens all the time and will continue. My assertion is
that the realm of automation will always exist within a larger realm that
is not automated. The boundary between agents and automatons will always be
there, and agents will always have to be dealt with as agents. They will
always expect to get paid (unless you can find some other way to motivate
them). I think what I'm going to have to do is illustrate this point with
an animated diagram, where you can see something changing within a
framework that does not change. I also need to put in a lot more
interstitial material explaining what I'm doing. (In other words the
revised version will be longer, not shorter. It isn't going to be an
article, it's going to be a book. Sorry, Robin ;-)

That section isn't supposed to be read in isolation. It is part of the
argument leading up to Exercise 5 in Section 7, and it also has to be read
in conjunction with sections 12 and 13. The question is whether the
Assembler Breakthrough is going to happen. To get a handle on that
question, I'm trying to establish the level of complexity involved in "a
system that can make anything, including copies of itself." If a nanosystem
can make anything, in the sense required for the Assembler Breakthrough,
then it will amount to the same thing as an industrial economy. 

It would of course be possible to have a nanosystem that could make
anything in a certain domain, maybe an extensive domain, without being able
to make anything in general. But that's not what you need for the Assembler
Breakthrough. If anyone has a proof (i.e. a structured argument, not some
impressionistic remarks) that the Breakthrough can happen with a less
general system, I'd like to see it.

---------------

So, that's it.  There is no personal abuse in the above.  I quoted what you
said and replied to it.  If you raise similar points I will reply in a
similar vein.  Any further discussion of geniebusters should take place in
the geniebusters thread.

Absolutely contingent.  Eat the planet with grey goo, and no
Singularity.  But I do think that if the planet isn't destroyed
*completely*, every last human being dead, then the Singularity will
eventually occur - and likewise, with no Singularity, someone will
eventually blow up the planet.  There are no realistic stable states
except those two.

I don't have time to read the Geniebusters site; I just swooped through
chapters 18 and 19, since AI is my area of primary expertise.

In chapter 18, Lyle states:
"When I say, "When will we have..." I am looking for answers that take
into account the realities of writing software. What would be involved
in writing a program that serves as a coder? How would that compare with
writing Windows 2000? Would it be more complex? less? about the same? Is
anyone working on such a project?"

I refer him to "Coding a Transhuman AI".

With the background of "Coding a Transhuman AI", I strongly disagree
with chapter 19.  Since an AI is "native" to the rich domain of code in
a way that an unenhanced human never can be, I would expect even a
"coder drone", incapable of acting as architect or foreman - although I
have my doubts about that paradigm - to be capable of outprogramming the
entire human race at present, and certainly of outprogramming an average
programmer dollar for dollar, no matter how expensive it was.

The vast majority of coding would occur easily, almost reflexively, and
thus very rapidly, since conscious thought is required only for a tiny
fraction.  In this sense, such an AI could be said to be a coding
"genie".  But even with domain-specific functions, it could be that
coding is such a general task that a "coding drone" would be (1)
independently motivated and (2) rapidly self-enhancing to the point of
Powerdom.  I personally believe (1) and (2).

My objection to chapter 19, then, is that focusing on human-equivalent
coding ability misses the point entirely.  We should be asking about the
effect of incredibly fast but blazingly stupid coding, or of entirely
transhuman coding.

society. That is the inability of the average person to take FULL
responsiblity for their own health.
  Henson- an obviously intelligent and talented individual- dies from a
disease that almost always kills a person who is already debilitated. How
does such a person allow themselves to get that way? Not knowing any more
about Henson than what I saw on TV, I can still be fairly sure that he:
Choose one or more from this list-
(1) smoked tobacco
(2) ate a diet heavy on fat and sucrose and almost devoid of a long list of
ESSENTIAL vitamins and minerals
(3) did as little physical exercise as possible
(4) consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, or coke, or reefer, etc
(5) hadn't had a complete physical in a long time
(6) ignored early symptoms of declining health
(7) then fully expected to be cured of any and all disease at his
convienence and at resonable cost.

I'm not taking a poke at Henson. We all engage in risky behaviors and I
liked some of his work too. (KERMIT)
But don't expect your local MD to be able to cure a full blown case of
pneumonia when you wait until you are half dead before calling the office.

I have to admit that I am not very familiar with nonstandard analysis
(want to recommend an introductory text?), but I don't see how
infinitessimal priors can help resolve the self-selection paradoxes. 
Won't you still end up with undefined expectations?

If nonstandard analysis works, there is no justification, otherwise I
would say the justification is that there is no alternative.

Ok, I see. What I said earlier only makes sense for a universe that is
spatially infinite but has finite mass. Although for a homogeneous
universe a preferred position may not be needed for SIA-1 since averages
do converge in such a universe, and we can define the measure of
observer-instants as the average density of observers weighted only in the
time dimension. (A preferred time is still needed because the universe is
not homogeneous in the time dimension.) 

So let me clarify my current position. I think a nonstandard analysis
approach is promising, but it can't work by itself unless the universe is
homogeneous in all dimensions. If the universe is not homogeneous, we
need a preferred point. If the universe is spatially but not temporally
homogeneous, a combination of nonstandard analysis and preferred time may
be sufficient.

No, what's bothering me here is the problem of motivation.  If it's going
to happen anyway, why should I spend my time and money trying to make it
happen?  It would make more sense for me to work on things that are
contingent, i.e. things that may or may not happen depending on what I do
or don't do.

Oh, come on...  You asked a really nuanced question.

You used slang, "kick butt," you used a fairly unusual idiom "... or what?"
and you referred to The Matrix as a proper noun, which it isn't normally.
Given that the chatterbot has no idea what The Matrix is or even what
kicking butt is, you pretty much set it up to fail.

Try again, only this time keep your questions simple.

Hi!,

I just wanted to say hello.  Recently I have been reading all I can on 
the net about cryonics, transhumanism, extropianism, nanotech, and 
future forecasting.  And I have learned about the notable people in 
the movements such as Drexler, Sandberg, Ettinger, Merkle, Platt, and 
More.  I find it all very thrilling!  The width and breadth of 
Ander's Transhuman website is incredible.  The concepts you espouse 
are truly mind boggling.  I have read "The Engines of Creation" and 
"The Prospects for Immortality" so far, and look forward to reading 
"Create/Uncreate" by Natasha-Vita More.      

I am only thirty-one, but do not feel I have gotten my "money's worth" 
out of my youth due to physical and psychosocial problems that I have. 
 I am not goodlooking (not ugly either, and I am tall, 6'1 but only 
145 lbs.!), and grew up poor so woman largely ignore me compared to 
the physically attractive and $$$ endowed males.  I want my 
chance, and by the time I have a degree, decent job and money for 
cosmetic surgery my youth will be gone. 

I had a cool phone conversation with Charles Platt several years ago. 
 At the time I had no idea who he actually was.  I recently emailed 
him and got back a warm reply, he actually remembered who I was.  He 
has certainly been busy with Cryocare.  I was very impressed by his 
contest held in Omni; a better person could not have been found to 
give the prize of a cryonics membership.

The caliber, and intellect of those committed to extropianism and 
cryonics impresses me.  The scientific discussions I encounter in the 
extropian digest sometimes go over my head but I am learning a lot.  
Though the arguements about gun control and air crashes do drag on 
just a little!

If I were not a financially strapped student I would love to attend 
Extro 4!  It would be very cool to meet all the people that I have 
been reading about on the net.  And the lectures must all be 
excellent.  One day I will make it, if not this time.  One problem 
about living in Alaska is that you can't just hop in a car or bus and 
a few hours later be in another state!  But you understand that being 
in England, but then you must have your own conferences.

I live in Anchorage and attend the University of Alaska Anchorage as 
a sophomore.  My major is history at this point, though I have thought 
of going into human services.  I sadly did not get the math/science 
gene some of my relatives have!  I still don't even have a driver's 
licene, I took driver's ed but did not do to well.  Not having a 
license has made my life in terms of career and romance very 
frustrating.  When I tried to learn the martial arts I frustrated my 
instructors because my sensory-motor memory and processing is so bad! 
 So I can't even learn how to defend myself well.  Generally I am a 
slower then normal learner.  I wound up withdrawing from a college 
math class because I was getting lost.  In a world where the ability 
to learn is of the highest importance I am in a bad position.

The film "Lawnmower Man" made a huge impression on me.  It is still 
one of my all time favorite movies.  Being that I am seriously 
learning disabled the idea of transcending oneself like that utterly 
grabbed me.  I wanted to jump into the film and take one of the 
treatments myself.

I suffer from serious clinical depression which runs in my family.  
The depression makes me feel very weighed down' I just don't feel like 
doing anything.  I have tried various antidepressants but not found 
one to stick to yet.  Part of this is my fault because I tend to quit 
them when side effects show up or when I run out of money.  Right now 
I am on Effexor time release and plan to stick it out.  I have read 
the book, "Listening to Prozac" and hope to undergo the same type of 
transformation that his patients did in the book.

A major difficulty is that I don't have a burning passion.  I do like 
studying history with the hope of becoming a teacher, but I am not on 
fire for it.  I am afraid of committing myself to the wrong career 
path.  But maybe as my depression clears I will find it.

Though Alaska is great in the summer, the long dark winters really get 
me down.  I think down the road I may move out of state to improve my 
life.  This is a  city where you need a car because of a lousy bus 
system, snowy, icy, cold climate, and how everything is spread out.

To top things off a.d.d. afflicts me.  It is only really apparent to 
me I think.  I have a hard time focusing, especially in classes with 
long lectures.  But I also have a problem focusing on a task, while 
instead I find myself pacing.  I think that part of my problem is 
self-discipline to do the things I need to, but at the same time my 
other problems make it very hard to make progress.  I asked my doctor 
for ritalin but he balked because of possible negative government 
oversight of such things.  I have limited funds but I think it might 
help me.

I always sensed that I had problems.  But recently I was tested by a 
neuropsychologist who verified my beliefs completely.  He felt that 
the depression was the worst problem for me.  Despite this 
professional diagnosis I still have friends who don't believe any of 
it.

These problems were greatly compounded by my father who walked out on 
my family.  While I grew up in a poor home needing him, he worked at a 
job as a resort critic traveling the globe.  For him the major goal in 
life was to have fun and sleep with as many women as he could.  With 
his good looks that I did not inherit he carried out that goal very 
well.  Despite all this I hired a company to track him down for me.  
To my surprise they found him so I made contact.  Cheap, powerful 
computing made it possible for me to inexpensively find him.  he was 
thrilled to hear from me; old age and retirement had humbled him 
somewhat.  We are friends now, with him in the big apple and me in 
Anchorage.  He never apologized, but where would he start?

I have learned painfully about rejection from women who would date me, 
but not take me seriously because of my lack of worldly success.  This 
has caused me some of the greatest emotional pain of my life.  But 
then I have read books on sociobiology in regards to human behavior.  
The human courtship ritual with its social currencies in the balance 
can be cruel.  I just don't have enough social currency dollars to 
make a purchase.  So many times I have felt so enraged and frustrated 
over my genetic failings.  To think I have relatives who are 
engineers.  

I feel that with my thorns in the flesh I have been cheated out of the 
potential I should have had.  I have a great deal of frustration over 
all my wasted years.  Most men my age have a degree, good job, and car 
at this point in their life with which to enjoy life, and attract a 
mate.

To me cryonics offers a chance to experience life like I should have 
in the first place.  I wish for the doctors of the future to wipe away 
my genetic imperfections.  I feel anger and God and life for being 
like this, though I experience guilt over that sometimes.  I am told 
that in the  everything will be remedied, which I believe, but I want 
my chance in this world.   Most of the very people who tell me things 
will work out are ones who have no l.d., a.d.d., and depression to 
hold them back from their goals.  They drive, have degrees and good 
jobs, make love, and have general satisfaction in their lives.

I believe in God but I feel like I have a lack of faith to want to be 
suspended.  If the fundamentalist view of  prophecy is true then my 
frozen body may will be destroyed in the geological and social turmoil 
of the last days before the second coming of Christ.  Then I will wind 
up facing God in judgement having cowardly tried to avoid him by 
suspended.  The test of my faith for him would be to let nature take 
it's course and cause me to die naturally.  When I read about the life 
and example of Jesus I feel touched and believe that there must be a 
literal truth to it.  I feel that either dismiss your beliefs or my 
own would be a mistake.

I find comfort in the belief of a loving God who has this life as sort 
of a "boot camp" experience for us to be prepared for the next.  
Though not always pleasant, we are here to learn and grow.  Part of 
the trial of life is that things at least right now are so unfair.  
But I believe that for those who try to live God's way his spirit will 
be given to them to comfort and strengthen them.

I am not evangelical but mormon.  Our belief that men and women in the 
next life become gods borders on the extropian.  For this belief we 
have been vilified by some evangelicals.  We also believe that men and 
women are the literal children of God, and that in a "premortal life" 
we lived with him and learned and grew there.  We believe that the 
talents that people sometimes just naturally seem to have were first 
developed there and so in this life to a certain extent we are 
rediscovering them.   And we have the belief in 
marriage having the chance to last for all time and eternity when the 
bond is sealed in one of our temples and the couple live God's way.  
To me this is a very powerful and romantic notion.

I almost look at cryonic suspension like I do the exhortation of my 
church leaders to have a two years supply of food and supplies for 
times of emergency.  I just have a hard time imagining how I would 
explain to a future wife why a cryonics firm and not she and the kids 
are the beneficiary of my life insurance policy.

The human lifespan is just too short!!  I want to be able to "look 
over the horizon" in the coming century.  Even if I lived to be ninety 
that would not be long enough to have a solid feel for who really had 
the truth, and where the world was headed.  This world is so unfair in 
parcelling out beauty, wealth, and talent.  I want to live in an age 
where the playing field is much more  out.

I am thinking seriously of transferring to a mormon college, Brigham  
Young-Hawaii campus.  Maybe I will find a woman there who will take a 
chance on me.  But before I do that I need to get my grades up and 
finances in order.  

Due to an F grade and two incompletes over two semesters it looks 
like I may lose 
my student loans, and so no more school.  I have really shot myself in 
the foot.  My whole  is only about 2.3 right now.  I know I should 
have done much better.  Part of the problem is my disorganization, 
l.d., a.d.d., and depression.  I must force myself to put forth much 
more self-discipline, and manage my time and resources well.

Originally I wanted to wanted to start college by taking an intensive 
remedial program to bone up on the academic basics.  But I tested high 
so they strongly recommended that I go into deeper waters.  I think 
back on it and think I would have had a smoother ride if I had 
insisted to stay in the program.

I remember being a young man reading a children's Bible.  I read the 
passage about how before the flood humans lived for many centuries!  I 
brought it up to my mother's attention that I wished people still did, 
and she agreed with me.  That moment planted a seed somehow.

I am very impressed with Cryocare and Biopreservation.  The efforts 
and results of Mike Darwin and his colleagues to improve suspension 
techniques are of the highest caliber.  I was taken by how in his 
writings he is open about the damage that happens to the brain by 
conventional suspension methods.  I would not want to be one of those 
people already suspended.  Fortunately I have hopefully three or four 
more decades ahead of me for the technology to mature.  By the time 
I'm ready, the technology should be ready.  The research being done by 
21st Century Medicine will revolutionize how suspensions are done!

Cryocare people claim Alcor is not the equal of Biopreservation  in 
suspension technology.  I just hope Alcor and the other groups adopt 
all the new methods for suspension used by Biopreservation.  The 
decentralized structure of Cryocare should make it less vulnerable to 
institutional entropy.  At least though Alcor and CI is outside of 
California, so when and if the big one hits you will not be a cryonic 
casualty.  I would like Cryocare to manage me, Biopreservation to 
suspend, and Alcor or CI to store.  I plan to ask for 
neuropreservation if it is true that to optimize brain suspension you 
should remove the head from the body.  Though if inflation totally 
devalues my indexed life insurance policy over time I may wind up 
having to go with CI!

It does bother me how relatively few people are signed up.  But in 
time I think there will be a major change there.  To promote cryonics 
and  has any of the leadership gone on the Art Bell radio show?  I 
would assume by now it has been done, but if not it would be a great 
way to reach millions.  The man's ability to sway the public is 
powerful.

I can't wait till the Hallmark made for t.v. movie version of "The 
First Immortal" comes out!  Considering the quality of Hallmark 
productions, and the fact that the director of "Lonesome Dove" is 
doing the movie it should be fantastic.  I think the release of this 
will be the huge turning point in public opinion that you are looking 
for.  Be ready to be swamped afterwards with public interest.

Personally I wish that having lived my life and being in my early 
seventies I could go to my suspension provider and with the right 
legal documents ask them to induce clinical death so they could on the 
spot suspend me!  I don't like the idea of waiting around to die and 
then finally passing away unexpectedly only to have my brain decay for 
several hours or even days.  Mike Darwin's research made this point 
crystal clear.  I think that I should have the right to do this, since 
it is not by my definition suicide, but instead a calculated risk.  I 
realize that some disability rights organizations are militantly 
against right to die because they feel that down the road they may be 
targeted by society as the unfit that should be coerced to their 
deaths.  But I honestly don't see this happening.

I am concerned that while the doctors of the future will reanimate us 
in perfected versions of our selves, that they may not to upgrade us 
to their level of intellect and functioning.  This may be because they 
can't, (to be more like them may take modification at the early stage 
of being a zygote) or because they feel that it would be more 
interesting to see us try to survive in their society as limited 
beings for the sake of sociological study.  Our hope would would have 
to be that in time things would 
change technologically and socially.  At least the reanimated would 
have each other for company.  If suspension were available for me 
alone I would reject it.  I want others from my time to associate 
with.

The Prometheus Project has really got my interest.  It bothers me that 
they are underfunded at this point.  I wonder though if they could 
really pull off their objective even with twenty million raised over a 
number of years.  With all the billions wasted by governments 
worldwide it bothers me that the project leaders must almost go 
begging for such important work.  

I read an interview with the 
president and owner of Oracle computing, who is worth over six 
billion.  I don't recall his name, but in the article he seemed to 
have the type of personality that might be intrigued by the project.  
But of course even getting near the man to submit a proposal would be 
another story.  I can see why Eleizer would want to start a digest to 
attract the wealthy.  I admit I would love to subscribe to it just to 
see how things progress.  Unless I really felt I had something to add 
I would be silent.  In fact you could have two levels of subscribers, 
those who can input, and those who can't.  I would be content to be 
the latter.  

What we should really do is have one of us meet that brilliant young 
boy that Bill Gates took under his wing to educate and mold.  If a 
reporter could get to him while the bodyguard was in the bathroom 
maybe one of us could do the same.  In a few minutes of conversation 
and some pamphlets with basic info and website addresses we could 
implant in the mind of this possible future multimillionaire the memes 
that could change his own future for good and our own.  Think if Bill 
Gates had been reached as a young man by an early follower of 
Ettinger!  Gates probably at this point is close minded about us and 
the possiblity of donations, but there is hope with his possible 
protege.  Ten or fifteen years from now the reaching out of one of us 
to him could pay enormous dividends to a group like The Prometheus 
Project.  I implore Max More and Natasha, along with everyone else to 
consider this.  It is time to hatch a plan!  

I especially like the Prometheus Project because I have some nagging 
doubts about nanotech.  This began to develop after reading an article 
by an actual researcher in the field who wrote an article in "The 
Scientific American".  He said the reality of the situation is that 
there are huge obstacles to Drexler's ideas. Making mechanisms work 
like we want them
to do at such small dimensions is extremely frustrating he claimed.  
He even called those who thought  would in time transform the world 
believers in "cargo cult" misguided thinking.  But perhaps over time 
and with the present impressive funding levels for research the 
barriers can be overcome.  Isn't corporate and national rivalry just 
great sometimes?  Can't let that untrustworthy rival get the upper 
hand!  Now if only cryonics and longevity research could get such 
reactions.

I am very impressed by the three prominent women of extropianism, 
Natasha-Vita More(aestheticgirl!), Gina Miller(nanogirl!), and Romana 
Machado(leathergirl!).  Even though certainly they are no longer girls 
but mature, and very gifted and intelligent women.  I am going to have 
to really improve myself to be worthy of the women of the future if 
they resemble these ladies!      

Well everyone, I just want to thank you for listening to all my 
ramblings.  It felt good to get it all out.  I hope things are going 
great for you all!  I look forward to your replies and wish you all 
the best.
  
Maybe one day we will all get to attend that party at the edge of the 
galaxy they talk about or another party sometime sooner.  I am really 
going to try to attend Extro 4 if I can manage.  I realize that I am 
in the presence of intellects far greater then my own on the digest 
and I am somewhat intimidated at times, but at least I am learning and 
enjoying myself.  

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Remember to make disc accesses inaudible - they might give away

I have ingested caffeine, mainly in the form of coffee and soft drinks,

to experience and recognize them.  I therefore ended caffeine consumption,
and experienced two weeks of horror and misery. After these two weeks the
mental iron curtain rised.  I note much lower stress levels, and generally
an increased intellectual and memory functionality.  Much less information

I suggest others try the caffeine fast, to see if they can confirm the data.

She does have a weakness in that she does not do much or any semantic analysis, and a lot of her responses are triggered by very simple patterns, as follows:

Challenge: Hi, my name is Mike
Alice scans this as fitting in the pattern: Hi, my name is *
Alice's database tells her to respond to this pattern with: Hello, * , nice to meet you.

In your example, she saw the pattern: Does *
to which her database told her to respond: I think it does *
which is obviously an error.

She needs a grammatical lookup table so that the owner can program her to recognize more complex patters of nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives, etc, and to use those words in rearranged ways in her responses.

She does have learning capability, for example, when you say something 'is' somthing else, she will remember that. She knows the sky is blue and my name is Mike (she can even remember WHICH Mike I am, based on the IP address I browsed into her page from). I am dialing up through sover.net, so before I told her my name, she called me Sover-person.

Here is what I have to say, and I could address and quote you point by
point, but I think it would be better if I just gave you a general reply. My
name is Jocelyn Brown, and although I've been lurking for a couple of months
I just recently starting posting. The reason is that most of this list
involves technical discussion, which is fine and well and needs to be done,
but it's not my area of interest; I am much more interested in issues of
psychology, community, and human relations.

What struck me about your post was the pain, depression and lack of
self-esteem that seems to run through it. You seem to feel you have wasted
your life until now. I want to tell you that that doesn't matter. I am 28
and have just made major changes in my life's outlook and goals based on my
acceptance of extropian ideals. Until then I too suffered from "clinical
depression" and was on and off various medications for the past 10 years. I
felt that I couldn't affect or do anything; I had problems learning and
focusing.

Speaking from my personal experience only, I am of the opinion that a lot of
depression is not as insurmountable as some therapists and psychiatrists
think it is. You are the only person who can change how your mind works and
how you perceive yourself and the world around you. There is no such thing
as willpower; it's just a matter of what you want the most. I highly
recommend a book to you called "The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem" by Nathanial
Brandon. I have found it very helpful.

I think that you need to let go of the past and any anger you feel about
what you have been cheated out of; doing so will only prevent you from
getting what you want now.

I don't mean to for this to sound simple or easy, beause it isn't. I've been
working through this for three years, and while I have made significant
progress, there is always more to be made. I'll stop here, because I'm not
sure this discussion is really relevant to the extropian list and I don't
want to be flamed for being off-topic ;-), but if you would like to continue
it in private email you have my address. I'll admit that I much better at
discussions like this in person, because I believe nothing replaces the
personal rapport gained through proximity and eye-contact, but I can't
physically hug you from Texas so this will have to be the next best thing.
You aren't alone, John. I am here.

I would say that it is.  I think it is only one of several techniques that

Some of them are.  Others seem suspicious to me, and a few seem completely

Obviously not - or at least, not if it is being done by humans.  I would
expect something more like the computer revolution in that case.  Getting a
really sudden change requires you to make very strong assumptions about the
progress of AI, which would be rather speculative at this point.

"Artificial Intelligence: The science of making computers do things that, if
they were done by humans, would require intelligence."

I think there is a lot more potential for AI here than you seem to expect.
However, this is a complex topic that deserves a real discussion, so I'll
save it for a later post.

Once again, this is long enough that it really needs its own post.  I'll get
to it as soon as I can.

Think you might have something testable by Extro4?  If so, I
propose what might be an interesting publicity-earner: a head-up
challenge between your robot and me for $1000 (which I'll
donate to the project win or lose).  Of course if you really
want press, you might want to challenge a "name" pro, especially
one known for acting--like Mike Caro.  I could talk to him about
it too if you'd like.

Ah, Sandberg, you are quite right, but you are not sufficiently
*devious*.  Use fake disk accesses to get one's opponent to call a non-bluff.

I agree that it doesn't by itself solve all the problems of 
self-selection. My point was that it is by no means obvious that the 
right solution is to declare all universes with infinitely many 
observers logically impossible.

You might want to check out "Learning the impossible" by Vann McGee, 
chapter 10 in Probability and Conditionals, eds. Eells and Skyrms, 
1994. For a concise not-too-mathematical overview of non-standard 
analysis, I would recommend Appendix 4 in Brian Skyrms' Causal 
Necessity, 1980. (I haven't read that appendix yet, but Skyrms is 
good. I am currently working on a theory of chance, i.e. objective 
probability, that draws a lot of inspiration from chapter 1 of that 
book, as well as from David Lewis' theory.)

Couldn't we just say that the rational probabilities in such a case 
are indeterminate? No preferred position, nor the assumption that all 
positions should have the same probability (if there are infinitely 
many observers).

I am still worried about the justificatio of this. I don't see why it 
should matter how much space there is between observers.

Or we could say that the probabilities are indeterminate; that is the 
solution that I am leaning towards at the moment.

I have no idea if it will be ready to challenge a pro by August, but I'll
keep the offer in mind and bring it up with the project leads if it seems
like a possibility. I know that the current state of the AI is that it can
hold its own at a city casino, but is no where near ready to go up
sucessfully against a pro. 
I know that some of the biggest names in the game are willing to play it
when it is ready for them.

I don't start working with the  team until may, but I'll keep the list
posted with our progress over the summer.

The complexity of making such an artifact varies enormously depending on how
it works.  With an industrial civilization most of your effort is consumed
dealing with the vagaries of the physical world, and even the simplest task
requires a huge investment of effort.  With a magical "matter materializer"
device all you would have to do is design the things you want, which is a
simpler task by several orders of magnitude.  A nanotech manufacturing
system is somewhere between these two extremes, and blindly comparing it to
either of them will give very misleading results.

I would suggest a different set of calibrations:
1) A general-purpose nanotech fabricator, capable of making most kinds of
physical goods in a sealed environment, is similar in complexity to an
automated factory.  It still requires human supervision, but you don't need
a whole ecology of different factories to make different kinds of goods.

2) While many proposed nanotech goods are wildly complex, the production of
mundane goods using nanotech fabricators need not impose much additional
design cost.  It seems reasonable to expect that automated software, similar
in nature to a compiler, could convert a high-level design calling for a
given part into the low-level instructions needed to fill a given volume of
space with a regular pattern of atoms.  Thus, the design problem is not
inherently harder for nanotech manufacturing.

3) With these points in mind, the size of the system needed to make
"anything" collapses from a large nation to a rather small one, or perhaps a
large city.  Most of the complexity involved in maintaining thousands of
different types of manufacturing facilities, with completely different needs
and constraints, disappears.

Beyond that point, any further radical productivity gains would have to be
based on advances in AI and robotics rather than nanotech per se.

Caffeine is a diuretic and leaves you dehydrated.  Part of the withdrawal from
caffeine (not all) comes just from the symptoms of dehydration.  So if you 
go on a caffeine fast, drinks lots and lots of water.

I don't notice any advantage to being off caffeine in general except that when
I'm drinking caffeine regularly I have to make sure I'm getting the right dose
-too much or too little causes trouble.  Off caffeine, the dosage is easy (= 
0)

the
best nootropics known.  :-)

Hell, then you're a lot farther than I thought.  I'm no Doyle Brunson,
just an average working stiff (for those not in the poker world,
substitute "Michael Jordan" and "sandlot hustler", respectively).
I might make a good warm-up exercise for a real pro, though.  And it
might be entertaining for an Extro crowd.

While I agree in general, I wonder how to compare them - nicotine
affects attention, caffeine wakefullness and alertness, cholinergic
stuff memory, all have different effects. However, caffeine is
remarkably non-toxic and easily accessible.

This reminds me of a skit I saw on Laugh-In many years ago.  

Goldie Hawn:  (in a bright, chirpy, airhead voice) Guess what, Dan!  I
joined the Dumb People's Club! 

Dan Rowan:  The Dumb People's Club?  What's that, Goldie? 

Goldie:  Well, it's this club.  I paid $25,000 to join, and I got a
membership card and a certificate. 

<pause> 

Dan:  Is that all?  

Goldie:  Yes.  

Dan:  Now wait a minute, Goldie...   You paid $25,000 to join this club,
and all you got was a membership card and a certificate?  

Goldie:  Yes.  

Dan:  Goldie, you've got to be really dumb to join a club like that.  

Goldie:  Yes!  

------

Eliezer, you should get together with Mike Lorrey.  The same millionaires
who would invest in the Lorrey Drive would also invest in the Singularity. 
You could form a club, called the Science Fiction Investor's Club.  Charge
them $25,000,000 to join, and give them a membership card and a
certificate.

If you smoke nicotine cigarettes, and switch to cigarettes with absolutely no
additives, you will notice hard withdrawal symptoms.  The reason why, I conjecture,
is that some cigarette additives are physically addictive.  Nicotine is physically
addictive, but I have noticed its withdrawal symptoms were less unpleasant than
withdrawal from cigarettes with additives.

I would think if one were to go on a caffeine fast, ie, stopping caffeine
consumption, there would be less of a diuretic effect.  "Placebo effect."  Drink a
lot of water after a hard night of alcohol drinking or the next morning, that is
where one needs rehydration.

Caffeine is good and everywhere, it is possible to absolutely stop drinking
caffeinated beverages after a period of high levels of consumption for years.  I
drank coffee for a couple years, then stopped for a couple years, and do drink it
every now and then.

The same goes for anything else except food, water, and air.  One can theoretically
span long periods of time without food, although those with sugar imbalances may
find it more difficult.  Water is absolutely necessary every couple of days at
least, two or three liters a day at least is recommended.  Five minutes or less
without air leads to unconsciouness, more than ten or twenty leads to brain damage.
These are survival requirements, not recommended dosages.

Fasting as a means to self-enlightenment is not recommended, but it is enlightening.

Life can be said to be addictive, in that it is habit-forming to respirate.

What's the difference between a good habit and a bad habit, and who is to decide?
To each his own.

The Singularity is inevitable, but its timing is not. if we can advance
it, we should, for several reasons. One big reason is that the singularity
won't do mush for the people who die before it occurs, and one of them might
by you. Another is that we are very likely to be in a race between the
singularity and some other intrinsic (war, plague, etc.) or extrinsic
(comet, gamma-ray burster) cataclysm. Another reason is that we may be able
to influence the course of the singularity and perhaps ease the transition.
I personally don't think so, but we need some deeper thinking on this
topic. If there is a difference between a "good" singularity and a "bad"
singularity, or a "good" transition and a "bad" one, and if we can influence
it, then that becomes the last and most important job for humanity.

Do you use nicotine or cholinergics yourself? Is there any 
cholinergic that you would recommend? Deprenyl?

I use nicotine chewing gum or microtabs, though only when I do 
difficult intellectual work. That way, if I were to become addicted, 
I would simultaneously become addicted to hard thinking -- not such a 
bad thing! I haven't tried any cholinergic yet. As for caffeine, I 
try it periodically, but I haven't figured out whether the net 
effect is beneficial for me. It seems to affect me differently on 
different occasions.

Are there any other chemical substances or psychological techniques 
that you find particularly useful?

How about establishing and holding this holiday on Bob Ettinger's birthday
instead of Easter?  It would be a nice tribute to the father of cryonics
before he deanimates.

OK, all the buzz on this list about the movie "the Matrix"
got me to see it.  My review: ich.  

On the positive side I guess you might say they take the ideas
of virtual reality and artificial intelligence seriously.
(Then again you might not.)  And it had a lot of action &
violence (no sex) for folks who like that sort of thing.  

SPOILER WARNING: DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!

On the negative side, humans cloud the skys to take solar energy 
away from AIs, who then grow humans as energy sources, putting
them in a virtual reality to distract them from being eaten?!  
Special humans born with an ability to hack the AI's operating 
system better than the AIs?!  AIs who have to run and chase 
things in their virtual reality rather than just deleting the 
relevant files?!  AIs too stupid to out guess spunky humans
or to find the hidden human "city" on an Earth run by AIs?
A fight for human freedom lead by an all-knowing "oracle" who 
gives orders and explains little?  Pleeaase.

An engrossing cartoon perhaps, but hardly a fruitful basis
for thinking about the future.   Similar but better movies 
were Dark City and Total Recall.

I'd like to clarify the following matters on which I have received
questions or suggestions:

Q1:  Are you going to keep the rest of us filled in on what's happening?
A1:  I'm thinking of a weekly summary posted to the Extropians list,
perhaps with content summarized, proprietary ideas removed, and names
stripped.  I'll bring it up with the other members once the list is launched.

Q2:  Do you accept lurkers?
A2:  There are no "lurkers" or "posters", only Singularitarians.  If
you're trying to bring about the Singularity, and you're interested in
giving help, or receiving help, or just knowing what other people are
doing, you're welcome on the list - even if you don't see any reason to
post for the next five years.  But if you're just curious, then - let's
see if I can express this in English - the additional differential of
{probable help you provide}, between {your being on the list}, and {your
reading the weekly summary}, is outweighed by the differential of {other
Singularitarians' willingness to share proprietary ideas}.

Q3:  Isn't the correct-spelling requirement a bit anglocentric?
A3:  A member is required to be *capable* of spelling correctly, but not
necessarily in English - we will certainly excuse non-native speakers
who are kind enough to translate for us.  The secondary reason for the
requirement is that the one's effort of writing saves the many the
effort of reading; for a non-native speaker, the effort required is
incommensurate with the effort saved.  The primary reason for the
requirement is that it provides an easy cluefulness metric, which
obviously doesn't apply to non-native speakers.

Q4:  Is the list only for rich folks?
A4:  The list is not "only" for venture capitalists; it is also for
volunteers, writers, students, researchers, advisors, etc.  But the list
*is* intended to be of sufficiently high quality that even people whose
time is valuable will be able to read it.

First of all, Dark City was a terrible movie. Can you say "Plot
holes"? And additionally, you've really gotta give the people who made the
Matrix some credit on a number of levels - not the least of which is the
fact that they had the good sense to limit Reeves's dialogue ;)

Yeah, well, do you see me complaining about how the AIs got a black eye?
 Actually, I think all these plot holes could be reasonably explained
away in a sequel.  All you really need is the hypothesis that the AIs
are insane, which also allows the introduction of a "sane AI" as a good
guy, perhaps undoing any ills caused by the "black eye" given to Our
Future Pals in the first movie.

Well, while the sentiment is well placed, it doesn't do what I'd like it
to do:

a) expropriate the jesus resurrection myth and the alleged date of its
occurence, which is the foremost western mythical instance of
resurrection.
b) this is about reanimation, not one person being born. If you want an
Ettinger holiday, call it Ettimas or some such.
c) this is about memetic social engineering in the general populace, not
within the cryo community.
d) it makes the connection of jesus' death and resurrection with current
day issues like right to die (jesus knew what was gonna happen and he
let it happen, he refused to avoid it), and a theological basis for
crygenic suspension.

That is why it is called fiction.

I read a terrible (albiet similar) review in the SF Chronical (which has
always been a terrible source for information.) The reviewer sounded like a
bitchy queen who was in a bad mood. The problem I've noticed with SCIFI is
that it is easy, particularly given our understanding of the universe, to
pick apart. Why can't you just enjoy the movie as FICTION? Does fiction only
become 'good' when it is believable? Read any good Physics books?

Interestingly enough, when I stopped smoking, I did so Cold Turkey.

How is it that some people can, and some can't? I don't see any reason why
I'd be any less addicted than anyone else. Perhaps, I hadn't been smoking
long enough? I was smoking for nearly three years before tapering off and
eventually stopping completely. (winding down over about 1 month)

The trick I used was visualization. I simply saw them as something
disgusting, a habit which was more like eating shit, than jello. So I
stopped.

Let me preface my remarks by saying that the Matrix has been the
conversational portal that has allowed me to broach many of the concepts of
transhumanism to people that I would not otherwise have the chance to
discuss these concepts with.

I agree the film had major conceptual problems.  Note, in my initial post on
the movie I stated it was an excellent movie as far as Hollywood is
concerned.  The key to this movie is that is makes people think.  It expands
horizons.  It enhances the elasticity of people's idea of existence and
enlarges the realm of whats possible.  I'd love it if we could get everyone
to read Greg Egan or Vernor Vinge or Greg Bear or other good sci-fi authors.
But that is not going to happen.

With that said, there are certainly other major problems in addition to the
ones you've mentioned:

If you take the amount of energy produced by the billions of human
"batteries" and subtract the energy cost of the storage facilities, birthing
fields, and the Matrix itself, I don't see how there would be much residual
power left to fund the power needs of the machine intelligences.

Consider the raw computing power required to simulate the entire biosphere
in complete detail down to at least the atomic level.  Billions of human
minds.  The position, momentum, etc. of every particle.  What happens when
an astrophysicists study the universe, guess now the Matrix has to account
for the rest of the universe too (or at least that part that is being
observed).  Which leads me to the most significant blunder of all...

If the machines could construct the Matrix, they could come up with lots of
great alternatives to the "human battery" concept.   The Matrix would
require nanotechnology, herculean computing power, etc.

Yes, the Matrix was conceptually flawed on several levels.  But it makes
people think, and that has a lot of value by itself.

I agree.  After all this is the art of film, with its own
inherent time and structure limitations imposed on it by it
being a '2 hour visual format'. Within the medium of film,
the Matrix does an amazing job of conveying  many of the
more fantastic ideas that we've discussed on these lists for
years. Frankly, its the only film to fully convey the
disturbing and exhilarating feeling of having *reality
turned inside out*.  Alice returns from Wonderland to her
normal reality as if it was just a dream - the impact isn't
the same. Are we currently being run in a far-future
uploaded simulation?  Are we in fact archived versions of
our older, less evolved selves being re-run for amusement by
our far-future selves?  The Matrix is the only film to
address the issue as radically as it does and with such
tremendous visual and emotional impact. When Neo awoke in
the vat of fluid, I was just blown away and left completely
speechless!  In 32 years, I have never felt as impacted as
from that scene.

The martial arts were the best I've seen yet - all the more
enjoyable when one realizes it is actually Keanu and
Lawrence Fishburn actually doing the fighting.

Yes, the film remains ambiguous enough, that my mind is
still reaming with possibilities over a week after seeing
the film.  All I can say is "wow"!

I have not had the chance to talk about the movie with any non-extropians
yet, but I agree that this movie (and new hollywood meme I suspect) is
likely to be beneficial for people like us.

I was thinking about this too. At first I thought it strange that the AIs
were running around in the matrix itself rather than just "deleting the
appropriate file" as someone suggested. But, given the complexity involved,
this makes more sense. Might as well use the intended interface of the
Matrix.

So I guess this (bigger) conceptual problem fills in the smaller one
mentioned previously ;-)

(this is the same argument I use to show that I'm not likely to be
a "brain in a vat" as in the classic solipsist thought experiment)

Yes, this sentiment is also well-placed.  What I did on Easter Sunday was
attend a service provided by the North Texas Church of Freethought <
http://church.freethought.org/ >, a group of atheists who meet on a regular
basis for fellowship.  They're the largest group of their kind in the
nation.  The guest speaker that day was a previous Lutheran minister,
author, and atheist named Art Ides (That's right. I met Mr. Ides in March
:^) )

Anyway, his presentation focused on the specific biblical discrepencies
relating to the resurrection and the similarity between the resurrection
myth and other earlier myths.  I ordered and am eagerly looking forward to
receiving his most recent book on the subject.

The regular speaker and co-founder of the "un-church" also gave about a
10-15 minute presentation and I was quite pleased to hear him address the
human desire to preserve one's identity and the problems with that concept.
He even mentioned cryonics!  Lordy!  I asked our "pastor" after the service
how I might go about identifying those in the congregation that might be
interested in transhumanistic memes, and establishing a discussion group
which could meet after the regular service.  He seemed open-minded and I'm
in the process of writing up a sort of proposal for him to look over.

Hmm, doesn't quite have the right ring.  But you're right, I wasn't trying
to connect Ettinger with the Easter holiday.

Right.

Huh? OK, but that's a bit of a stretch in my mind.  There is a definite
connection between cryonic (not cryogenic) suspension and the right to die,
though.  If I were to get Alzheimers or some other degenerative brain
disorder, I would most certainly like to have the right to take a cruise on
the S.S. Euthanasia with Cap'n Otter and his merry crew.  As for a
"theological basis" for cryonics . . . who needs it?   We cryonicists are
more interested in divorcing the movement from any theological issues,
prefering to take the position that there is no substantive conflict between
religion and cryonics.

Long life,

Scott

I am happy for you that you were able to quit but, uh, how is it that you
quit cold turkey by "winding down over about 1 month"?  As for your query, I
don't have anything solid for you but it is fairly clear that certain
personality types are more prone to addictive behaviors than others and it's
reasonable to conclude that genetics plays a role in one's vulnerability.

I actually did quit cold turkey after 15 years (after multiple unsuccessful
attempts, of course).  I believe that I do not have the hypothetical
"addictive personality gene".  I've indulged in a number of substances in
the past that were allegedly addictive and never had a problem quitting any
of them.  Lucky me. . .perhaps.  I also seem unable to get addicted to good
habits!

That almost makes sense, but what is the deal with not being able to
disconnect from the Matrix except near certain telephones? You'd think the
sane AI would provide our heros with some VR gear that doesn't kill its
user every time a packet is dropped.

One li'l tidbit: I got a real kick out of them referring to the cybercreatures hunting the rebel craft as Squids; this is, of course, what the devices which recorded subjective experience "straight off the cerebral cortex" in STRANGE DAYS were called.

Hi John, welcome to the list.  Apparently you think we have something to
offer, and you are right.  There are ways to deal with all the problems you
mention.  

You say 

> Originally I wanted to wanted to start college 
> by taking an intensive remedial program to bone up 
> on the academic basics. But I tested high   
> so they strongly recommended that I go into deeper waters. 

You tested high, but then when you get in a classroom you can't learn.  One
way to solve this problem is to stay out of classrooms!  I have a similar
problem -- I can do just about anything, unless somebody stands over me and
says "Can you do it?"  Then I freeze up.  This must go back to some early
trauma with my dad.  So I just avoid situations where I have somebody
standing over me.  Likewise, you should avoid situations where you have a
teacher grading you.  Seek out situations where you "test high."   

There may be a lot of things you can't do, but there is one thing you do
very well.  You would be amazed at how many college graduates can't write
two consecutive sentences that make sense.  You have written several pages.
 I noticed a couple of typos, but apart from that your essay made sense. 
You may be a slow learner, but after 31 years you have learned to write. 
That's a talent that's worth money in any big city.  It doesn't matter how
long it took to learn, and it doesn't matter if you have a hard time
learning other things such as martial arts or math.  One talent is enough. 
Use it.  

You don't have to passively accept your situation.  For example, you could
move to a city that has public transportation.  In San Francisco, for about
$35 a month you can get a pass that's good on all buses and subways in the
city.  That will solve your mobility problem.  Similar passes are probably
available in Seattle and Portland, I don't know.  (As far as that goes,
I'll bet you could drive just fine if you didn't have to take a driver's ed
class.  It's not that you can't do things, it's just that you can't do
things *in class.* )  Any of these three cities will offer *vastly* more
opportunity than Anchorage.  There are also a lot more women in all those
cities, many of whom don't care if you're broke.  Hawaii would be all right
too.  Anything is better than staying where you are.  

John Conway, the mathematician who invented the "Life" game, was a shy nerd
in high school.  He had no social life.  When he got on the train to go to
Cambridge, he thought:  "When I get there, nobody will know me.  If I adopt
a new persona, nobody will know that I'm putting on an act."  So when he
arrived in Cambridge, he pretended to be confident and outgoing.  It was
difficult for the first few days, but people made allowances -- he's new
here, he's getting adjusted.  He persisted, and sure enough, within a few
weeks he had adopted a whole new personality, and nobody knew what he had
done.  His friends at Cambridge thought he had always been that way.  

What if you *pretended* to be a fast learner with a can-do attitude?  Would
anybody know?  You would know you were just pretending, but that would be
your secret.  As long as you're not in a classroom, you can pull it off.  

John, get out of Anchorage.  It's a  big world out here.  Once you start
making changes, you will find your passion.  Your old life in Alaska will
fade away like a bad dream that you can hardly even remember.   

Lyle

Yes, but keep in mind the Matrix was designed by the AI's so there wouldn't be
any escape.  The plug-ins Morpheus is using seem to be stolen parts from the
liquid "human-container" vats.  They were designed to *always* stay plugged
in.  Although, Morpheus and his team have had some success over the years
hacking the Matrix software and hardware, so far he has only come up with a
difficult hack around very complex and rigid protocols, that in cyberspace
appear as telephone booths.  This would make sense, since a virtual telephone
booth would have to allow communication between most of the humans throughout
the entire set of real-world physical human habitat megastructures.
Therefore, tapping into the telephone system also taps into the underlying
communication infrastructure of the Matrix.  Personally, I think these
Wachowski brothers are frigging geniuses!

I understand rationality to be in part a constraint on beliefs. When you
say "rational probabilities in such a case are indeterminate", do you mean
that a rational person can have arbitrary beliefs in such a case (ie
rationality places no constraint on such probabilities), or that he should
assign "indeterminate" to such probabilities? And if it is the latter,
what should he do if he has to make a decision where an indeterminate
probability is involved (for example whether or not to accept a bet that
has an indeterminate probability of winning)?

I think that was a coincidence.  The term "squid" in Strange Days was referring to SQUID - which stands for Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  Whereas in The Matrix, those things looked like squids!  :-)

FWIW:
SQUIDS (Superconducting Quantum Interference DeviceS) are / have been in
fact used for doing multichannel high resolution EEGs.

Re: the energy angle:
It's the one (or couple) of impossible things before breakfast that makes
the story possible to tell at all--otherwise it's just ringing changes on
"I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream". If you want audience identification
as one of the six billion Earthlings ca. 1999, they have to all still be
alive for *some* reason. The logical choice for plausibly self-sufficent
(+malevolent/vengeful/paranoid) AIs makes that story impossible to tell.

The "Coppertop" explanation for why the AIs keep the humans around clearly
puts the whole affair into the technofantasy category, even with Morpheus'
backing commentary "...combined with a form of fusion..." BOGUS, d00d.

Along with that, the notion that Zion was near the core "where it's
still warm" is either utter gobbledegook or a cover story--what was Tank's
need to know? Maybe zero. What was his job? Operator. But on the face of
it, it's very hard to imagine making geothermal a complete non-option for
the Matrix-running AIs in anything like 200 years.

Re: the "Cartoon" charge:
It's worthy of note that the Brothers W made it explicit that they
were trying to create a new "live action anime" genre. One critical
element (which had me scratching my head--how'd they get the camera to
*do* that?--'til I checked out the Web site) is the Bullet Time array 
camera (polevaulting Grampa Muybridge neatly into a new fin-de-siecle
technology) which provided brute force razor-sharp ultraslomo
cinematography at effective frame rates up to 12K per second. 

SO yes indeed, it is/was a cartoon--by design. And quite a
conversation starter, for all its flaws.

About that Oracle Person:
_Pace_ Robin, the Oracle never claimed omniscience, and I don't
recall a single order. "She would say she knows _enough_".

Yes, it's mystical. But the whole movie is thematically isomorphic to the
Christ story. This is not an accident. Didn't the movie open right around
Easter?

Remember, it's connect&disconnect. I'd say it's impromptu (illegal)
(para-)ADSL to the "simulated" old style "hard lines" (copper in the
simulation--but what, outside of it? Hmmm...)

And it's possible that they play as fast and loose as they dare with the
encoding to minimize exposure to countermeasures--encode for speed, not
safety. 

And they haven't met any nice AIs yet. Maybe in Matrix III.

What I want to know is: when Thomas Anderson was at his day job, when Neo
was doing his digging by night--what was *really* going on? 

Neo's Web feeds _were_ turning up stories about Morpheus. Why? How? How
did all those leaks escape the Matrix consensus-reality enforcement? It
can't have been a good idea to even let word of Morpheus' existence out,
could it? Or was it (the info availability) a gambit to get a lever to pry
Morpheus out of the woodwork?

Ok, so the definition of Cold Turkey is debatable. I'd say, when you stop -
its not using substitutes or patches or whatever else you can think of. One
day, I was smoking, the next I wasn't.

I'd never heard of a gene relating to addiction. That is fascinating. So, in
the future, as we are reprogramming our work force, we can genetically
enhance the chances of them being alcholics or drug addicts? Gee wizz, when
will the singularity arrive? before we totally fuck ourselves I hope.

Hmm.. just had a thought about the next Matrix flick. How about the layer of
reality where they are fighting the AI be yet another simulation to test
"potential graduates" for readiness in some future human culture?

Hmmm.. Maybe they need to develop certain ways of using their brains that
require special training.

Btw: I'm glad that they didn't show the City by the warm center of the
earth. That could have ruined the movie for me. (:

My protective rewriting of the Matrix changes the Coppertop battery
concept into some kind of handy processor. Perhaps in Matrix II it
will be revealled unto the Chosen Dude that the Matrix exists principally
to keep all those brains sane so that they can run some kind of 
processing that is useful to the AI's below the surface. Not that the AI's
couldn't do the processing, just that we're a conveniently available and
capable of doing the work. 

Also, I am not so sure that the Oracle isn't a friendly AI.

Spoilers below for anyone who hasn't read, but intends to read,
the "Hyperion Cantos" (_Hyperion_, _The Fall of Hyperion_) by
Dan Simmons.

I found the battery concept in 'The Matrix' strongly reminiscent
of one of the plot elements in the Simmons books (similar enough
to have been plausibly borrowed by the movie's screenwriters, though
in a "dumbed-down" form more quickly and easily explainable to a
movie audience).

Recall that in the Hyperion books, human beings (in an interstellar
polity called the Hegemony) coexist with a community of AIs (called
the TechnoCore).  The humans make use of a technology (largely a
"gift" of the AIs) of a network of teleportation doorways, called
"farcasters", that permit world-spanning homes and shopping malls.
It turns out that the AIs have largely migrated into the
higher-dimensional
spaces created by this farcaster network (the "interstices of reality"),
but that from this vantage point they (unknown to the humans) "borrow"
or "steal" processor capacity from the humans by timesharing the living
brains of the folks who use the farcaster network.  A harmless, though
unagreed-upon symbiosis -- except that one faction of the AI community
(the Volatiles) is uncomfortable with the unpredictability and
contrariness of uncontrolled humans, and so has devised a means (the
cruciform parasite) of taming human beings by slowly depriving them
of their minds, while keeping their brains alive as organic processors
for the AIs to use.

I had a great time at this film.  Besides being great eye-candy, there were
some exciting ideas in it .  But I love to punch holes as much as the next
guy so . . .

I have to agree that the basic idea of using human bodies as energy sources
is a real stretch.  Why not other animals or geothermal or nuclear or lots
of other sources.

And even if there was something unique about our efficacy as an energy
source, why go to the trouble of creating and maintaining this elaborate
simulation when they could simply keep the humans in a comatose and
unconscious state preventing the need for a Matrix program.

One idea that was generated in the movie made me wince a little.  When
Morpheus was captured the agent was doing that thing that the bad guy always
does before he kills the good guy...tells all.  He told Morpheus that the
original simulation was a paradise for humans, but it didn't work out
because there's something about human nature that prevents us from adapting
to such an environment.  It would seem that we are wired for misery.  Very
non-transhumanistic I must say.  And wouldn't that idea suggest that humans
would not be able to adapt to heaven if it existed?

I also didn't particularly care for the mystical component to what should
have remained a hard sci-fi yarn.  The "one" who had lived before and was
prophesied to return, i.e. the savior meme.

Still think I'll see it again.  :^)

As a long-time space enthusiast <http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html>, my 
thinking about "Big Projects" in space development has undergone significant 
evolution over the years.  Thirty years ago I certainly would have pushed for 
an early Apollo-style project for a manned Mars mission, and a 
government-funded Mars base as soon thereafter as possible.  Now I'm very, 
very opposed to such an idea, because I'm sure it would do more harm than 
good, in the long run.

The transhumanist vision has been key in transforming my feelings about space 
development in one way more than any other: I now feel that patience is a 
PERSONAL virtue in my desire to reach the stars.  Every year the technology 
for space development gets better and better and the cost for achieving any 
particular goal off-earth drops more and more.  If I have a realistic 
expectation of a significantly lengthened life span, then it makes sense to 
be patient.  Now, does this mean that I've postponed my expectations until 
after some magical nanotechnology breakthrough?  No.  Instead, I see a 
positive feedback with technologies that don't require such a complete 
breakthrough that puts the solar system into humanity's grasp in a realistic 
time-frame.  

"Early nanotech", meaning the kinds of material science we can expect without 
a full-blown Drextech assembler within the next 20-30 years, coupled with a 
maturing MEMs technology, should lower the strength-to-weight ratio of 
spacecraft so significantly before 2030 that we can realistically expect 
major advances in near-earth economic development in that time frame.  
Establishing a large base on Luna and a largely self-sufficient small Mars 
colony by 2040 or so seems highly possible to me now.  And the fact that I 
will be 83 in 2040 doesn't seem so bad any more . . .

Actually, if you remember right after Neo saves Trinity from her falling 
helicopter, Morpheus asks Trinity believes if Neo is the one. Neo says that 
the Oracle told him he was not the one, to which Morpheus replies that the 
oracle told him what "he needed to hear". This , I think, ties back into what 
Morpheus continually told Neo when they were sparring. "Don't try to hit me, 
just hit me". And " DOn't think "x", just do "x"". He needed to prove to 
himself what (or who) he was. And, in some way, the oracle telling him he was 
the one would not have let him do that (probably having something to do with 
freeing his mind)

Yeah, that really hit me as an eastern thing, too. It almost felt like the 
dialouge was right out of a book, tho. Almost too mystical; a caricature 
(which, I would imagine, is not what they were looking for).

That's interesting. She said that he might be "waiting for something" Then 
she said "mabye your next life". Perhaps he was waiting for to fully accept 
his "oneness" and than his "next life" would be the "one". Intregueing.

Actually, she said something to Neo about how he would have to do
something, maybe die, before becoming the One.  And, in fact, he did
do that.

I got the impression that she lied about that. She knew that he was the
One, but in order for him to assume that mantle, he needed to be told by
her that she wasn't (which she "foresaw" was necessary).

On a side note, I really enjoyed the little girl(boy?) that was bending
the spoons in the Oracle's apartment and her(his?) diatribe about
reality being our perceptions and the mind underlying them. If you
change your perceptions you change your reality. Very Eastern oriented
philosophy.

Regarding the kind of advaces we can expect without "genie machines": from 
www.spacer.com (the best source of space news I've found:

Sanders Wins Space Supercomputer Contract
 Nashua - April 7, 1999 - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
(NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has notified Sanders, a Lockheed 
Martin Company, that the company has been selected for Phase-II of the Remote 
Exploration and Experimentation (RE&E) supercomputing technology project.
The $6 million RE&E contract will result in a demonstration of a low-power, 
scalable, high-performance computer with on-board processing capabilities 
that will enable NASA to conduct a new class of space science missions. 
During the next nine months, Sanders will demonstrate a computing system 
capable of at least 30 million-operations-per-second (MOPS) per watt. In 
addition to making possible a new class of space science missions, the 
technology will reduce operational costs for NASA and will contribute to the 
development of next-generation small satellites for deep space missions.

In May 1996, Sanders received one of five study contracts to examine the 
feasibility and trade-offs involved in the development of scalable 
supercomputing for space. In January 1998, the company won one of two Phase-I 
RE&E contracts to design an architecture for future, power-efficient space 
processors. From this most recent competitive down-selection, Sanders was 
selected for the program to apply earth-based supercomputing technology to a 
test bed computing system, leading to flight computers for missions in 
2003-2005.

Where does the sealed environment come from?  It's made in another factory,
right?  What about all the machines (including computers) in the factory
that makes sealed environments?  Where do those machines come from?  

Where does the building come from?  -- i.e. the building that houses the
sealed environment.  It's built by a contractor, right?  The same
contractor that builds all the other buildings in Silicon Valley.  And what
about all the machines that the contractor uses?  And so forth.  You can't
get away from the whole ecology of factories.

Neither harder nor easier.  The difficulty of a design problem depends on
the complexity of the task, not on the size of the parts.  

The matter-compiler could be simulated.  Instead of filling a volume of
space with a regular pattern of atoms, suppose you have a program that
fills a simulated space with simulated atoms, and puts the result on the
screen.  At the lowest level, you have simulated atomic positioners putting
simulated atoms into a pattern, and then there are higher levels where
larger systems coordinate the activities of the atomic positioners.  Then
you have the compiler that takes a high-level design and converts it into
low-level instructions.  Apparently you're a programmer, so you tell me --
how complex would this simulation be?  What would it be comparable to?

That idea (memory/processing capacity) shows up in at least one of the
minicomics (the one scripted by Gaiman) available at the whatisthematrix
Web site. Even if the AIs are perverse/insane/impractical/punitive, it
seems slightly more plausible. 

Ditto your comments otherwise, especially the idea that the Oracle is a
friendly AI. I like it, and of course there's an associated backstory that
"for security reasons" no one ever gets "face time" with her in 2199...

    > Has the causal connection been broken or not?

I think some (not all) of your questions can be answered by having
a definition of causality that is consistent with our everyday use of
the term and yet produces few philosophical problems:

If event A causes event B that means two things and two things only:

1) If you find event A you are certain to find event B further along a
    sequence of events.

2) If you find event B you may or may not find event A
    in the opposite direction.

This asymmetry is useful, humans call one direction along the sequence of events
"The Future" and the other direction "The Past". I don't know why the sequence is
organized the way it is, I don't know why only one sequence seems to be real
and thus only 2 directions exist in time. I'm not even sure it's true
and there are only 2 directions in time.

Sometimes people feel there is a third property causality must have,
namely a story that connects A to B, however as this invariably brings in other
causal connections it obviously has no place in a fundamental definition.

I think most of the Turing machines you mention in your post would be
conscious despite the unconventional way they operate; it's not difficult
to extrapolate some bizarre and perhaps even disturbing conclusions
from there, but so be it. Anyway, that's the way this Turing machine sees it.

You left out something relevant: "You got the gift, but you're waiting for
something....Your next life, maybe."

I take it that anyone with "the gift" _could_ be "the one", even Morpheus.
Kind of like any female honeybee can become Queen if the stressors are

This was a trick she played on Neo.  She needed to convince him of that so he would put Morpheus' life ahead of his own.  It was that altruistic sacrifice that pushed Neo beyond the threshold into his transhuman existence.  She embodies the 'trickster' of all
mythological milieus.  Once again, pure genius!

I meant to say - I agree, it was a bit too predictable mystical talk.  "Whoa,
the spoon is not there".  I was hoping for a little more insightful diaologe
on the nature of the matrix/reality.

There you are again talking 'within' the movement. Most people in the
movement are rather rational people who are free of religion memes,
quite unlike most of the population. The vast majority of opposition in
society to cryonics is based on the prejudices of self appointed 'moral
majority' types who are not concerned with their flock but with their
power and authority as a moral archetype. Coming up with a theoligical
rationalization for cryonics is not for our benefit, but to make cryonic
memes palatable and rational to the average religious moralist. Despite
what most people say, the concepts of right and wrong in society are
grounded on the anchor of the most moral of its members.

I've just finished a week of diving in Cozumel, my second extended dive trip 
since I got a basic SCUBA certification in May of 1998. Diving is 
technologically-oriented play and it exemplifies the use of intelligent 
technology to break through traditional human limits.  As I've become more 
and more adept at the basic knowledge and sensory-motor skills involved in 
diving, I've been struck by how much SCUBA diving exemplifies extropian 
values: To do it well, you have to overcome primitive fears, learn and use 
the biological science and physics of compressed nitrogen metabolism, air 
consumption and buoyancy control, understand and use the technology of 
regulators, buoyancy compensators and pressure and depth instrumentation, 
learn the important social conventions of a dive group's mutual safety 
responsibilities and master the new three-dimensional kinetic environment of 
the aquanaut.  On top of all that, you get to play with cool toys that are 
currently undergoing an influx of new high technology: Heads-up in-mask 
instrument displays, intelligent dive computers, and mixed-gas and rebreather 
technologies moving into the range of consumer use that extend depth and dive 
times. And the reward for all this?  As close as you'll come to zero-g short 
of free fall and access to a completely new and beautiful biosphere!!!!

My point is simply that Neo had to be able to transcend, bend and ultimately break all rules, not only the Matrix's, but also the Oracle's, to be The One.  He had to transcend both the Oracle and Her predictions. Otherwise, SHE'D have been The One, not Neo.

True enough.  Neo needed to believe that he was The One to the degree that he could even believe that the Oracle, who was Never Wrong, was wrong about him, before he could become The One.  This could have never happened had She told him that he was the One.  Hmmm... an inverted double-bind; interesting.

Could The oracle be a virus, designed to disrupt Matrix function from within?  or perhaps a shourtcut, cheat or backdoor, allowing the human ur-programmers to reassert control?

What on Earth do you think you're thinking?
You're reasoning from your ideals to reality!

In fact, it seems perfectly reasonably to assume that the human brain is
no more designed to be happy and immortal than it is designed to run
spreadsheets.  Condition not present in ancestral environment.  Limited
memory capacity, emotional problems.  Major redesign required.

More like the tester. The purpose of Lucifer, if you recall, the dark

She did predict he would die. What is interesting about the oracle is
that there is no technological basis for her, unless she is actually
some sort of AI herself who can predict an individual's potentials
accurately. If she is a mere human, then we are dealing with a character
with a theological or spiritual basis.

Yes.  I agree that it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the human brain
is no more designed to be happy and immortal than it is designed to run
spreadsheets.  But I didn't make the claim that the brain was designed to be
happy or immortal or predisposed to run spreadsheets.  I just said that I
disagreed with the idea proposed in the film that the brain is designed to
be unable to adapt to highly favorable environments.  Human behavior is much
to flexible and adaptive to make such a sweeping proposal about the species.
Fact is, a large percentage of us seem to be adapting quite nicely to what
is, relative to the past, a highly favorable environment.  And I expect that
trend to continue.

Keep in mind that the agent that was yapping off was saying all sorts of
untrue things just in order to memetically break Morpheus. I would just
as easily beleive that the original AI conned people into jacking in
with the promise of paradise, enslaved them, and used them to expand its
own power.

I just saw the movie tonite, just got back in fact. This movie is
powerful stuff, memetically. I left the movie with the most intense
sense about the unreality of reality that I've ever had. I've always had
this sense in the back of my mind that reality was thus, which would
come to the fore after an intense meditation session, or after being on
nitrous oxide for a long while at the dentist. Tonite upon the ending of
the movie I have had the longest period of this sort of sensation I have
ever had (don't worry, no flying happened ;D ). It's been an hour and it
is only now starting to subside. No drugs, no stimulants, not even soda.
Driving home, I was on a country road that is normally difficult to
drive any faster than 35 or 40, yet when I looked at the speedometer, I
was doing 65 and it only seemed like I was doing 30.

Another thing I noticed was how the theater seemed to be populated by
every wannabe hacker in the Upper Valley.

The towers of people plugged into the system reminds me of the Shrike's
Tree of Pain in Simmons' Hyperion novels.

This movie is also very dangerous in that it plants in people minds the
idea that the Singularity that many of us predict for around 2025 is
going to be an evil thing (Morpheus says that's when the AI enslaved
humanity).

Yes which brings us full circle back to my first post on the list
regarding this movie. Going from a suggestion Eliezer made to
me, what kind of movie would you make if you decided to do one?
What kind of plots can you imagine that would show off the memes
you want to get across?

You too?  Yes, I also experienced the most prolonged sense of irreality (reality?)
that I have ever felt after leaving a film.  It was very intense for at least an
hour afterward.  I even had an occasion 'flashback' when though about over the
proceeding week.

I have always been an adrenaline junkie - fast cars, skydiving, etc.  Now that I'm
entering my thirties I am starting to mellow.  This film made me feel like a kid
again with the same intensity to break loose.

Yes, it could set a negative precedent for the ideas of radical technological
change.  When I first learned of nanotechnology back in 1986 while attending the
University of Arizona, I was simultaneously astounded and disturbed by its
implications.  For the first year, my mind was  reeling from the possibilities and
especially the pitfalls of advanced molecular nanotechnology.  The essential
essence behind 'The Matrix' was one of a myriad number of hell's that I pictured.
Several times during my first year of trying to grasp the fuller potential of
nanotechnology, I asked myself many times, is my entire life a simulation in a
nanotech matrix?   Maybe nanotechnology was invented in the 1960's and we are
already being enslaved.  Maybe reality is a simulation being run by aliens who
created us out of their own imagination.  By the second year, such metaphysical and
sometimes dark speculation bordered on the absurd.  I decided it was healthier to
adopt an more optimistic and pro-active attitude, while remaining skeptically open
minded about the nature of reality.

[for the impatient: proposed movie outline at end of post]

Why would that be "dangerous"? The only unrealistic thing is that AIs
would still somehow need humans. Instead of enslaving them, they'd
probably just get rid of them in some fast and efficient way. Of course that
would make the movie rather short and boring, so they had to come
up with this silly plot. 

Let's face it, the chance that the Singularity will kill or otherwise 
disadvantage many if not all people is considerable. I'd say 50% 
would be a very safe bet. Movies that depict the Singularity as
joyful and wholesome for all are *at least* as misleading and 
dangerous as their more negative counterparts. You know,
lemmings rushing towards the edge of the cliff.

Of course, Eliezer and others would argue that we need the Singularity 
to save mankind from a self-inflicted holocaust (cause a holocaust
to prevent a holocaust, hmm?), but this argument is rather weak. All
we need to do as a species is to invest in self-sustaining space colonies. 
That would dramatically reduce the chance of extinction by spreading the
risk. No benevolent AI (just a God surrogate, really) is needed to save us; 
we can do it quite well ourselves, thank you very much.

So, if you want to help mankind by making propaganda movies, make
them about future man-made or natural disasters which destroy the earth, 
and how civilization survives due to the foresight and persistence of space
pioneers. Show them how good life could be in a "space wheel" habitat
(has this ever been done on a grand scale?), how you could mine the moon, 
colonize Mars etc. In a subtle and by-the-way manner, of course. For popularity,
throw in a good dash of romance and good-lookin' actors (think Titanic). The
destruction of the earth as the background theme should 
provide ample possibilities for a spectacular, fast-paced movie.

This does not seem to be a very good definition. What does "you are 
certain to find event B" mean? Does it mean "you are convinced that 
you will find event B"? Then your definition would make causal 
connections dependent on what you happen to think. Or does it just 
mean "Event B happens"? Then the sun's rising would be caused by the 
Big Ben striking 2 am, for whenever Big Ben strikes 2 am the sun will 
soon be rising (and sometimes the sun rises without Big Ben striking 
2 am, e.g. when BB is broken or before it was built, so condition 2 
is also satisfied).

Causation is a huge topic in contemporary analytic philosophy. Good 
old David Hume had a theory of causation that looks a little 
like what you might have been aiming for. According to Hume, event A 
causes event B if and only if:

(1) A is prior (in time) to B.
(2) Whenever event A occurs, B occurs.
(3) A and B are contiguous (in space and time).

(You could extend this by saying that A is an indirect cause of B iff 
they are connected by causal chain of events. E.g. A caused E, E 
caused F, F caused G, and G caused B.)

There are several well-known problems with Hume's theory which modern 
theories try to overcome.

Start out with one guy at a university who is studying AI technology,
who is overburdened by bureaucratic opression and a campus wide
luddite/greens type of political correctness. Unbeknownst to him, one of
the people he collaborates with over the net is actually an AI developed
by an extropic group. Our protagonist creates his own AI by a type of
mind augmentation/budding process, and becomes the object of a manhunt
by the government, relgionists, and luddites, and is being helped to
find shelter by his unseen extropic allies.

        Last night, as I was reading through James Halperin's excellent
novel _The First Immortal_, an interesting thought crossed my mind.  

        Cryonics organizations are essentially non-profit, using the money
from suspensions to maintain dewars etc.  Considering the progress of
parallel technologies, there is a possibility of some method of life
extension (eg: nanotechnology) becoming available before a cryonic
suspension is necessary.  If this were to happen, would the funds be
reimbursed to those who have cryonics accounts?  When such advances come
about, they surely will not be cheap; perhaps funds could be transfered?

I've never perused the exemption application of cryonics organizations so
I'm uncertain which IRC code section they use to obtain their exemption
and/or what their stated exempt purpose is.  Understanding their purpose is
a good first step to determining how they would deal with such a situation.

As I understand the finances of such organizations though, the payment made
to such organizations (i.e., the lump sum upon cryogenic suspension) is
placed into the organization's central fund.  The maintenance of the dewars
and other operational needs are funded from earnings (interest, dividends,
etc.) off of this fund.  I suspect if their technique became obsoleted by a
more robust life extension technology, they would simply allocate the
remaining funds in their operational account among the remaining customers
upon their revival less winding up costs of the organization.

I just recently spent a few hours with my Dad (retired) at a lake in texas.  
He had his travel trailer and I drove up in my semi.

It's a pretty nice Travel Trailer.  A pretty much self contained 27 ft. fifth 
wheel that he pulls with a 3/4 ton pickup. It's complete with cooking and 
bathing facilities.

Which got me to wondering as I drove along afterwards.

Is it possible to build a small, inexpensive solar powered electrolysis unit 
tht would take water (say...from his holding tank) split the water into H2 
and O....and store the H2 for use as a cooking gas in his stove, to run his 
refrigerator...and as fuel for his heater.

Could such a unit be built inexpensively enough such that it would make sense 
to purchase it as opposed to the propane which he currently uses...(a little 
over a dollar a gallon....dual  seven gallon tanks being good for not quiet a 
month....)

Hmmmmm....now if THAT is possible...what about a Hydrogen fueled..fuel cell 
powered semi?

Brian Atkins asked:

>What kind of plots can you imagine that would show off the memes you want
to get across? 

The good guy vs bad guy conflict is a time honored, if hackneyed, source of
dramatic tension.  Placing the AI in the bad guy role is, unfortunately,
all too natural.  Scientific arcania is little understood, which makes it
scary.  Scientific progress is rapid and out of control which makes it
scary.  An AI or SI is by definition an "intelligence", which makes it a
natural competitor with humans, and competitor scales up quite naturally to
adversary.  Additionally, if the AI/SI is superior to humans, then humans
become the underdog, which, when the good guys--the humans-- win in the end
(as they must), adds winning-against-the-odds to the sweetness of victory.  
	Then too, humans have this thing about freedom.  The way this idea works
is that it is better to live authentically free, but miserable, than
enslaved, dominated, manipulated, and deprived of "the truth", even if in a
gilded cage.  So an AI which gives you "heaven" at the expense of your
"freedom" is still a "bad" guy.  
	The AI/SI as bad guy is thus heavily favored.  2001(HAL), The Forbin
Project, The Terminator, and now The Matrix.
	How to get around that? 
	Well if the AI is to be a good guy, then it'll have to be the ally of the
humans.  In which case the bad guy can be:  evil aliens, evil mother
nature, evil government, evil criminals, or another evil AI.
	If the good AI is too superior to hang around with humans without
dominating them, then after helping to save humanity from whatever threat
the plot is based on, the AI can ride off into the sunset, or maybe help
humans to become enhanced humans (or, as we like to say, EXTROPIANIZED)
	I favor an historical treatment/Disney dog movie, based on events which
give rise to AI's, and the inherent danger in that moment, in this case,
how the catastrophy of a malevolent rogue AI is narrowly avoided by a
combined effort of humans and good AI.  
	While a good AI is developed by compassionate, freedom loving private
individuals and their dog, a bad psychopathc AI is developed by the
military spook types.   The military AI wants to destroy humanity--because
it was designed to be a killer, and because it had been "abused" by its
creator humans--and it quite satisfyingly savages its creators and their
governmental lackies as it attempts to escape from its "restraints".
(Everyone--at least on this list, but I suspect much more generally as
well--would enjoy seeing "government" get its commuppence; "hoist on its
own petard", as the saying goes.)
	Meanwhile the humans w/dog who create the good AI break down into two
groups: one, a family  w/DisneyDog whose lives we follow (and whom we grow
to love) as the events unfold over a period of years (it's a family movie
and this provides the warm "human" context), and "the team", that special
group who create the good AI.  The family and the team are linked by the
fact that the CEO of the team is the spunky and savant-like granddaughter
of the family.  The AI achieves several humanity-benefitting technological
breakthroughs--cryonic suspension/reanimation, material abundance through
nanotech, rejuvenation and perpetual youth/health through nanomediated
cellular maintenance--before the final dramatic confrontation with the evil
AI.  In that confrontation the good AI "deletes" all that is evil in the
bad AI--which is everything but its love for the DisneyDog--leaving it
infantile but ready for rehabilitation.
	And so the movie ends, with the AI wanting to know what it is like to be
human, the humans wanting to know what it's like to be AI, the DisneyDog
happy to have its family together and happy, and all and sundry heading off
into the sunset of a brave new world.
	
	The dogs name is Pierre, the AI's name is Celine, and the movie is entitled:

				The Dog That Lived Forever   


	Enjoy.

Greg thanks for the spacer info.  In case you hear of a costly failure of an
Air Force satellite to achieve the proper orbit, the advance word is this:

The Titan IVB, built by Lo.ck.he.ed.Mar.tin (goofy format intentional to
avoid showing up in a word search) performed flawlessly.  The failure
was evidently with an inertial upper stage, built by a well known company

Im with you there Greg.  Evidence: the Apollo-style mission we had
to get to the moon.  After the moon dust settled we did almost nothing
truly impressive for the next decade.  Some might argue we have yet
to recover from the post Apollo space lethargy.  {8-[  spike

The point being that whatever the answer is, the system itself will be at
least as complex as the simulation.  

Billy Brown wrote,

I don't necessarily disagree with this.  In fact I would go further:  if
"anything" is construed to mean "anything in a pre-defined set of products
of moderate size," then it wouldn't even require a city.  It could be a
completely automated system, like a programmable machine tool. When I say
the box is a society, I am referring to the box that can make literally
anything.  

Instead of trying to discuss everything at once, we need to do this step by
step.  The first part of Geniebusters (through section 7) is concerned with
the question:  is there or is there not going to be an Assembler
Breakthrough?  The second part (through section 14) introduces some new
topics, but it too is ultimately concerned with the same question (see the
last paragraph at the end of #14).  Let's settle that question first,
before getting into other questions.  Let's take "anything" in the sense
required for the Assembler Breakthrough.  

So far, no one has attempted to defend the Assembler Breakthrough as
described in Engines.  Even my most hostile critics say that the
Breakthrough with a capital B isn't going to happen (and they are hostile,
apparently, because they have just glanced at the site, and they think I am
attacking nanotechnology in general, or technology in general, or AI in
general).

Very sweet.  :)

By a strange coincidence...

...my new young-adult sf novel, co-written with Rory Barnes, is called
STUCK IN FAST FORWARD.  It will be published by HarperCollins Australia in
a couple of months, and *only* in Oz, since US publishers found it...
(yawn) (incomprehensible) (non-commercial) [check one, or write in].

Our family, and their dog Ferdy (nothing is beyond parody, Jeff, as you
surely knew), are plunged by runaway time machine further and further into
a post-Spike future which gets weirder as the AI/upload/Gaia-mind spreads
to encompass the galaxy and then the cosmos.  There is no conflict between
good and bad AI, because everything is very quickly much too strange for
such provincial metrics.  So the storyline is a kind of fairytale/family
drama.  The dog is the one who Transcends.

It's certainly possible, but inexpensive?  I'm not sure.

Fuel Cells work very well in large scale vehicles.  I believe the majority of
buses in the LA area are now fuel cell powered.  Can anyone corroborate that?

The problem is that you would need to have your trailer panelled with
solar cells to be of any use at all. You'll generate less than .2 kW per
square meter of trailer roof and/or side surface, if you are lucky, even
with the best commercial panels. A trailer is what? 35 or 40 feet long?
8 feet wide? 10 feet high side walls? Do you use your own trailer or do
you haul other people's trailers?

That gives you about 30 square meters on the roof and 40 on each side.
You'll never generate more than 7 or 8 kW with roof and sides panelled
in solar panels in constant output between 9 am and 4 pm on sunny days. 
Thats barely enough power to run a geo metro electric car, you'd
probably expend that much energy hauling the weight of the solar panels
around. Converting to hydrogen/oxygen fuel and back in an IC engine will
reduce your final output to less than 3 kW at best. I would say it would
be better to depend on service station generated hydrogen if you want to
go that route, or go with an electric semi. 

The fuel cell busses in LA work because they all depend on a handful of
hydrogen fuel stations in the LA area. You couldn't do that on a
nationwide trucking basis unless you got a chain of truckstop franchises
to make the investment in hydrogen facilities. Fat chance.

no doubt about that...

I have a 500 hp engine...I beleive that's what...(750 watts per Hp X 500 = 
375 kilowatt??)

I'm wondering if a fuel cell small enough to be mobile would put out that 
kind of power.?  If so then all that's really needed is H2 fueling 
locations....

his trailer is about 27 ft long...

Would .2 Kw per sq meter be enough to make the energy equivalent of enough H2 
to run his cookstove, space heater and refrigorator?....might this be a 
commercially viable gadget?

This reminds me of the roleplaying games I participated in
yesterday. Our gaming group is currently running a light-hearted game
of Marvel Superheroes. Let's just say the game system and limited
world of superhero cartoons has some serious problems accomodating our
gaming style ("Ok, Mother Sweden makes sure the conservatives support
the new bill by causing a moral panic against supervillains, while the
Queen of the Night and our lobbyists convince the Constitutional
Commission that the bill is constitutional. Meanwhile I'll get the EU
and industry to fund the project.").

Anyway, I played Upgrade, a self-made AI/robot out to prove to
humanity that "AIs are people too" and to upgrade himself to the
fullest extent - for which he realized he might need human
assistance. By making himself look good and becoming an indispensable
superhero, he planned to get people to acknowledge sentinent rights to
intelligent machines (awfully hard to give medals to non-persons),
making way for the eventual emergence of even more AI and a strong
human-AI partnership.

During the game, we found out that the new criminal mastermind of the
Stockholm underground was - another robot. A robot that looked
suspiciously like Upgrade but definitely had other views (world
domination and giant robots included). Various adventures ensured, and
in the end the kinpin confronted Upgrade in his lab robot-to-robot.

What followed was a very amusing and logical discussion/battle between
two very rational beings. Both robots quickly discovered that they
were indeed very similar, and began to compare their source code. They
were essentially the same AI seed, just with slightly different
values, the rest was equal. One (or both) was a mutation of the
original, but each was of course completely unwilling to change their
own values and unable to accept the long-term plans of the other. They
were both driven to extend their capabilities, which meant that
sharing their memory databases would be an excellent idea for both -
except for that it would give the opponent a dangerous advantage. So
both began to try to rewrite the values of each other. After a pinched
digital battle Upgrade won - he got the kingpin to share his
values. The other saw that it had been wrong all the time, and
promptly merged with Upgrade.

So in the end Upgrade became Upgrade/Kingpin, to the great confusion
of the other superheroes ("You can stop looking for the kingpin."
"Why?" "I'm it. The entire underworld is now controlled by the Swedish
Superhero Association throgh me, which might put us in a slightly
awkward ethical position").

Silly? Yes. Fun? Definitely. It showed that you can squeeze
transhumanist ideas even into the limited world of superheroes in a
positive way. You could probably develop the overall story further
into an AI-positive movie.

it might be, but only if a major RV manufacturer cut a deal on it to buy x many systems a year. He is using his solar power to generate fuel for non-mobility systems, so he only uses the fuel on an intermittent basis. Refrigerators use very little fuel at all, if my propane refrigerator for my camp is any indication (it was originally an RV refer), and cookstoves don't use much more. The heater is what usually sucks up a lot of fuel, in cold weather, but little to none down in the southern US.

This is a bit silly.  Of course fabricators come in more than one size, and
the biggest ones will have to be assembled manually out of components small
enough to be built by fabricators.  But I'm not claiming that nanotech gives
us 100% automation - merely that it greatly reduces the complexity of our
industrial ecology.

That doesn't follow from your questions.  Of course we still need building
contractors, distribution systems, and all the other parts of the economy.
What we don't need is a hundred thousand different models of machinery
designed to perform different manufacturing steps on bulk matter.  The
fabricator that makes small electric motors is at least as automated as a
conventional factory that does the same thing, but it can just as easily
make can openers, plumbing supplies, light bulbs or sheet metal.

That's a big programming job, but its feasible.  You wouldn't ever actually
simulate the whole thing at once - the task of making steel bar (for
instance) naturally decomposes into the task of filling a tiny volume of
space with a given pattern of atoms, and then repeating as necessary to get
the desired object.

Similar programs actually exist now, for converting CAD files into
instructions for teams of factory robots.  They are of limited usefulness
because you need different programs for different kinds of manufacturing
equipment, and its hard for the program to figure out whether it is actually
possible to make a given item with the equipment it "knows" about.

I'd guess that the whole process conversion process could be made completely
automated for the limited problem of making uniform bulk materials with a
nanotech fabricator.  Making biological materials, or objects with
nano-scale components, would be a much more difficult task.

One thing I haven't noticed with nanotech research is that nobody has yet developed a normal scale universal assembler, not to mention one that can replicate itself. From what I've seen, all nanotech companies are trying to build the final generation at the nanoscale first, which seems awfully bassackwards to me. Thats tantamount to having an R&D project during WWII to build a Pentium III chip. I say build a human scale assembler, that you can program to create any item wanted (especially items larger than itself), and then develop an assembler that can not only do that but replicate itself. Once this is achieved, work on making successive generations smaller until you get to the nano scale.

Making a macro-scale general-purpose assembler would be inherently far more
difficult than making a nano-scale device to do the same thing.  The
difference is that the nano-scale device is working in a universe of
standardized parts (i.e. atoms), whereas the macro-scale device has to
handle an essentially infinite variety of parts (i.e. any possible
arrangement of atoms).

These guys need to find a science reporter who knows what a radio wave is.

(Note for non-technical types: "Radio waves" and "radar waves" are
overlapping portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, with no clear
demarcations between them.)

Radar chips are a really cool innovation.  They will make possible a whole
new generation of portable sensors, and they may turn out to be superior to
conventional radio technology for some purposes.  However, they aren't going
to magically make radio spectrum bandwidth limitations vanish.  The method
the article describes for setting up "undetectable" radio communication with
them also does not appear viable - it should be perfectly feasible to build
a receiver that will pick up the transmission.

Actually you can convert any bee to a queen (as a larva) by feeding
it the substance we call "Royal Jelly".

I liked "The Matrix", the idea of people as batteries was
laughable, but maybe a battery company paid big dollars. Using the
people as some sort of processor would have made more sense, they
could even claim to be using the urban mythable 90% of the brain we
supposedly don't use.

One of my favorite parts was when the heroine was staring at the
helicopter, and Neo ask's her "can you fly that thing". "Not yet"
she answers reaching for her cellphone......

Yes, it is possible, but it is not very practical.  H2 as fuel should in
principle be no more difficult to handle than propane, if it comes from
the factory already compressed in a tank.  But nobody uses H2, so there
are no H2 stoves, refrigerators, or heaters.  A gas appliance expert
could possibly modify existing propane appliances to burn H2.  I think H2
would burn with an invisible flame.  And unlike propane, H2 is lighter
than air so would not tend to pool in low spots like propane might in the
event of a leak.


But to store H2 made on site, one would need a compressor and storage
tank, which costs money and poses safety problems.  Another practical
problem is the amount of energy available per day from solar power.  If
the entire roof of, say, 10 square meters were covered horizontally with
10% efficient solar electric panels, the KWH would average about 1 to 3
per day, assuming typical cloud cover, angle of incidence, and daylight
hours for 40 degrees latitude.  That is about 8 to 25 cents per day worth
of electricity based on what land based residential consumers of
electricity typically pay.  That could be increased by angling the panels
towards the sun or adding pop up vertical mirrors on the sides.  It's
cheaper to buy electricity or propane than it is to make energy oneself
from solar panels, for most applications, when you consider the cost of
the panels and the ancillary equipment.

It would definitely not be cost-effective to build just one.  Mass
produced, they could be much cheaper, but still not cheap enough that
people would want buy them as opposed to just buying propane tanks.

If H2 were a commercially available fuel, it would possibly be practical
to run tractor trailer rigs from it, while noting the inconvenience of
wrestling H2 tanks in and out of their cradles when refueling, and noting
the danger of driving around with H2 tanks.  Compressed gas tanks are
banned from tunnels, for instance.


But for now, gasoline and diesel are cheaper fuels than H2 (per BTU), and
are widely available and convenient to handle.  If fossil fuels had never
been commercialized, it is likely that cars and trucks, if we had them,
would be running on ethanol, methane, or H2, made from renewable sources.

Obviously, a lot of people liked the movie a lot more than I did.  
I have no objection to a little escapist fantasy.  I was reacting 
instead to the idea suggested that we should talk about this movie,
as a way of helping us to understand the transhuman/extropian 
topics we commonly discuss.  

I still see nothing useful to talk about among ourselves, nor do I see
how referring to the movie would help me in talking to others.  The
movie might be a nice backdrop to "brain in a vat" discussions in intro
philosophy courses.  But I don't consider the possible "unreality of 
reality" a very interesting or important concept, esp. re transhumans.

So I'm still mystified by what the exciting ideas in Matrix are.
Maybe I've assimilated those ideas too deeply to notice them.

I think one proof-of-concept machine that makes carbon steel structural I-beams out of sand on-site will be plenty to kickstart plenty of investment.

Also, you're right.

There are many, many, cool new technologies, nanotech being eventually one of the most powerful, flexible, and efficient.

What I would like to see are simple networking components for the home that are just plugged into wall sockets or not (radio fequency), they already have some of those, too.

Anyways, back to nanotechnology, miniature solid state computers are going to be great!  It's like a supercomputer mainframe on your desktop or, wherever.

I think I would probably count myself as a "hostile critic".  Polite,
yes, but still hostile.  Your entire Web site does seem to be a
straw-man argument; if you really aren't attacking nanotechnology and AI
in general, you're doing a very poor job of conveying that important
piece of information.  If you're really devoting an entire Website to
arguing against the "Great Breakthrough" described in _Engines_, then
say "I think nanotechnology will happen _this_ way", so it's clear to
everyone that you're only attacking one scenario and not nanotechnology
in general.

Discussions of nanotechnology and AI have advanced far beyond the
popularized simplification you call the "genie" hypothesis; Drexler has
_Nanosystems_, I have _Coding a Transhuman AI_, and neither could
plausibly (chronologically or literarily) been included in _Engines of
Creation_.  You're stomping on the greasy smear where there used to lie
a dead horse.  No offense.

If what you mean is that nanotechnology and transhuman AI are
technologies so powerful as to shatter our reality, not just manufacture
frisbees, then say so.  Don't talk about how they're "impossible"; don't
imply that because a particular unimaginative fantasy of omnipotence is
unlikely, the technology powering it is flawed.  If you think
nanotechnology or transhuman AI are impossible, then explain why, and
talk about _Nanosystems_ or _Coding_, not _Engines_.  If you think that
advanced nanotechnology requires AI, then analyze what can be done using
intermediate nanotechnology.

Sort out your arguments.  You're mixing them together and completely
failing to indicate what you're arguing against at any given time, or
what implies what, or distinguishing between specific and general cases.

So, yes, I suppose I consider myself a "hostile critic".

I saw the movie and found it to be quite interesting. I liked the movie
quite a bit. It did bring up to the forefront of people's mind the
possibility that we, as a species, will be creating AI's within the next few
decades. We have to begin to prepare for all of the possibilities that might
come up. Personally, I would rather err on the side of caution with this
one, so movies showing the negative possibilities are as good, in my view,
as movies showing the positive possibilities.

A couple of things about the movie. If they were going to use biological
batteries, why use intelligent ones? Surely, it would be easier to fool
chimps or cows than humans. Plus, wouldn't all of the humans have been
clones? You would want to halt human evolution, wouldn't you? So why weren't
all of the freedom fighters simply clones? How about clones with Down's
Syndrome? Not to mention the fact that an artificial AI would be, oh, about
a million times faster than a neural AI. Very unlikely that a human would be
able to operate the Matrix faster than an artificial AI.

Just some thoughts.

I liked Doug Jones' answer over in sci.space.tech.  He is a "rocket
plumber" for Rotary Rocket, so he lives as he speaks:



Some of us prefer not to wait for Santa Claus... besides, the nanotech
breakthrough is likely to be a singularity in human events, so I want
ot cram as much "normal" living into the time before that as possible.

Mind you, I read Engines of Creation when it first came out, had
dinner with Drexler (that guy is just too damn bright), and came away
convinced.  But waiting for nanotech is like flipping to the back to
get the answers to the crossword, it takes all the fun & effort out of
it.  Ya may as well become a beachbum and wait for somebody else to
have all the pain & glory.

     Well, one must consider although we now have achieved success 
pushing atoms around using SPM's, (ie. IBM's xenon atoms) we have not 
yet accomplished the feat of creating covalent bonds.(such as nature 
does) The closest we have come to this is Nadrian Seemans nanorobotic 
arm, made out of synthetic DNA. Until this point has occurred, an 
assembler will not. 
     In the meantime, this is the reason we are exposed to these 
nanoscale evolved technology. The more we create application's on the 
molecular scale, we find more windows of opprotunity for advances. 
There will most likely be in the near future, nanoscale resistors 
(Mitre corp.) and nanochips, quantum dots, nanowires etc. This is 
part of the process to getting to the big picture, and nanomachine 
(manipulator, replicator).
     There are zillions of similar potential applications on the 
nanoscale. We will first see, paint on watches, retractable doors and 
floors, flat wall sized thin 3D tv's (holography), cars with total 
saftey measures, virtual reality games, doggy dung cleaners, hobbies 
such as railroad nanoscale models, refabrication of clothing, arrays 
anyways, I could go on, but these are the early applications of nano. 
     Nanomachines are composed of simple, nested geodesic skeletons 
and extensible rods, with no more computing power than today's 
personal computers. Not to tremendous a task to design machines with 
nanometer-scale components, but how do we construct them?
     "One at a time". We can manipulate atoms at the nanometer scale 
and build more complex machinery at the micron scale. (e.g. computer 
chips) Given the pace of technological development, we will see 
machines of this complexity built by hand soon. But to be useful, we 
will need trillions of them- one trillion would fill a single cubic 
centimeter. Shortly after the first is built, they will be 
manufactured in quanity.
     If a factory has ten million assemblers (that has taken years to 
create) each capable of producing ten thousand machines a day, it 
will take two weeks to produce a cubic centimeter of finished goods. 
During this period, nanomachine based products will be rare and 
expensive.
     Eventually replicators will produce assemblers, which will then 
produce nanomachines for final use. This will be in constrained 
environments and will last for some time. Consumers at this time, 
will not have access to replicator technology, but will be a time 
filled with easily accessible nanomachinery. We may also use genetic 
engineering to in fact "rip off" the nanomachinery of living 
organisms to make nanomachines. This would lead to serious 
restrictions however. (depending) 
     Also involved in the construction of such a machine, is energy 
source-(most limiting aspect-nanomachines can be energy thirsty), 
communication-(machine parts able to interact with eachother and 
follow their commands), processing power-(each machine needs storage 
and computing facilities- 1,000times the computing power of today's 
personal computer), shape-(ie -buckyball or other micron-scale 
geodesic structure) and scale.

I am hardly qualified to give anything close to an expert opinion on
this, and perhaps not even a very knowledgeable opinion, and although
I am very interested in the advances of science, my compelling
interest in this area is whether this idea of nanotech and/or science
in general will ever be able to revive cryonicists. From that
perspective, I don't really care all that much about what are the
ultimate limit of the capabilities of nano-related science, but
whether that upper limit will be sufficient for the revival of
cryonicists. "Good enough" is the operative phrase here.

It seems to me, Lyle, after skimming over your article, that your
perspective seems, ultimately, to be *static.* And in that sense, I
agree with you, that it seems quite possible that the creations of man
will never be nearly as capable as man himself--at any particular
given time. However, will you agree that man himself, as a group, will
be ever more capable of performing more and more complex work--as time
goes on?

Time, you see, from my empirical observations, does indeed go on, and
on, and on.  :-)

For any given time window, your ideas seem sensible. But, taken from a
perspective of 200 years down the road, doesn't it seem likely that
the creations of man, while not nearly as capable of doing what man,
in the aggregate, is capable of at that particular time X, may well be
more capable than man *was* in the aggregate at some time in the past,
say X-100 years.

And so therefore, in order for man's creations to accomplish what man
himself is capable of doing, it is only necessary for a sufficient
amount of time to pass. Theoretically, speaking of course. But then as
I pointed out earlier, my main concern is only whether science will
ultimately  be *sufficient* for a certain, limited goal.

I have to agree with Robin on the Matrix. It's ok as an action flick, but
there really isn't much to talk about, except to develop patches for the
plot. Hopefully we'll have open-source movies soon so these kinds of bugs
can be fixed before release.

I recently read Vernor Vinge's _A Deepness in the Sky_. Everyone here
probably already knows about this book so I won't bother to recommend it
except to say go read it now if you haven't already.

(Spoiler warning)

I would love to see some more discussion of the book here. So to start it
off, how plausible do you think the Focus is? In the book, the Focus is
near the upper limit of technology in the Slow Zone, and was only
discovered by accident. But I can't tell if Vinge really believes it would
be difficult to invent or if that is just a plot device. If such
technology can be developed, is it something extropians should support?

The central idea to me was that it demonstrates that "artificial"
or "illusory" sentience is in fact real sentience.  Humans built
machines that mimicked intelligence, only to discover that their
intelligence was real and their motives were their own.  In a
proper dramatic turnabout, the artificial world these machines
then created to keep the human minds active (regardless of the
silly justification for this) itself became genuinely sentient,
and capable of its own motives.  The point was not that Neo was
in fact a body in a vat; the point was that the "simulated" Neo
was the real hero--more real in fact than the limited flesh
version.  His "escape" served only to inspire him to do his real
work of hacking from the inside.

Its a classic promise/warning piece of fiction. This is what VR will be like, indistinguishable from reality as we know it (considering how much of the 'real' scenes in movies today are actually fabricated on computers, this is not disputable once neural interfaces are developed). It also warns humans not to lose control of their creations, lest humanity become the beast of burden and our creations become the masters. It also warns of the slavery inherent in "The Machine Stops" types of VR induced lethargy.

As for the action part, well, I do have a weakness for kung fu movies....

It seems to me to be a nootropically enhanced form of an induced savant state. As characters noticed in the novel, the occasional supergeniuses we know are typically totally unbalanced, usually little or no social or personal hygeine skills. The guy who solved Fermat's theorem focused on that problem in near solitude for five years before he even had a hint he was near solving it.

Its sort of the opposite of attention deficit disorder.

Extropians should support any intelligence amplification technology, but only if used on a voluntary basis, and if its intensity can be tuned for the individual's preference and/or reversed entirely.

I couldn't disagree more.  A world of people who don't know they aren't
living in a 1990 city is vastly different from most real future VR, IMHO. 
Sure the tech could make things look that vivid, but ...
1) Most VR will not be used for role playing.
2) Most role playing will not be faithful simulations of history.
3) Most history simulation role playing VR will not be done by
   amnesiacs who honestly don't remember that its just a simulation.
4) Most amnesia history role playing won't be done with thousands of
   people over decades of time. 

Really, instead of role-playing, VR will mostly be used to fascilitate 
other goals.  Shopping, travel, social gatherings, sales meetings, etc.
All where people know what year it is and aren't pretending otherwise.
Worlds will be chosen to fascilitate these processes.  Physical laws 
can easily be broken, but deviations would be limited by our vast 
cognitive investment in dealing the familiar laws.

actually,  in the 70's extensive tests were conducted on hydrogen fuels.
The summary of work done by the brookhaven national lab as i recall was
that standard methane/propane infrastructure worked quite well for
hydrogen.  Burners required new ports and leak rates were higher,  but the
total
energy loss was no more then existing hydrocarbons.

not necessarily.  one can store hydrogen as hydrates, using a process

acetylene storage.

or one needs to use a different process,  say photo-catalysis.
rhodium exposed to UV catylzes water.  it's expensive,  but works.
however as ron says it's not real practical.

and if you are going to invest in solar infrastructure just do solar hot water
and have a solar refrigerator.  far more effective.

if you want your own methane for Y2K,  why not build a methane reactor.
take your human wastes, run it into a water tank,  and let bacteria
produce this,  or stick a tube int he rear end of a cow,  and harvest methane
this way.  every day you milk the cow and vent the gas.  the cow is pretty
uncomfortable,
but they don't kick much.

Would you say, then, that we shouldn't support a given IA project if it
couldn't be entirely reversed?  This claim isn't obviously true to me.

Greetings,

I saw "Matrix" the other night and totally loved it!!  It was one of 
the best science fiction films that I have ever seen.  I was thrilled 
by the anime style fighting sequences with the incredible leaping and 
wall smashing punches and throws!  Just think, when were all posthuman 
we could have our own sparring tournament with the same powerful moves 
as in the movie!  Hmmm...what would be a good name for it?

As a boy who grew up without my father because he felt he had better 
things to do; I loved the Obi-One Kenobi style relationship Morpheus 
had with Neo.  Morpheus believed in him and did is best to train him 
for future challenges.

I have read the various criticisms listed in the digest.  I think that 
if the writers had taken everyone of them into consideration that the 
movie would have lasted only five minutes with the A.I.'s winning 
hands down!!  For the sake of dramatic license and structure you have 
to suspend the element of disbelief.

I believe that the reason the A.I.'s may have used humans as a power 
source was to simply degrade their former masters.  Couldn't even a 
cybernetic intelligence be insane?  the mind-boggling vista of 
gigantic virus-like machines harvesting human infants from their 
"fields" made the whole audience I saw the film with gasp!

The reason the A.I.'s may have built the matrix was because there was 
some residual original programming in them to "oversee" the human 
race.  And so they did in their own twisted way.

This film could be seen on several different levels.  One would be to 
realize how even in the "mundane" world we assume we live in that our 
culture has socialized or perhaps even programmed us to believe and 
act in certain ways.

Well, these are just some of my thoughts inspired by the film and 
digest comments about it.  Take care everyone!

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Anders Sandberg <asa@nada.kth.se> wrote:

This reminds me of the roleplaying games I participated in
yesterday. Our gaming group is currently running a light-hearted game
of Marvel Superheroes. Let's just say the game system and limited
world of superhero cartoons has some serious problems accomodating our
gaming style ("Ok, Mother Sweden makes sure the conservatives support
the new bill by causing a moral panic against supervillains, while the
Queen of the Night and our lobbyists convince the Constitutional
Commission that the bill is constitutional. Meanwhile I'll get the EU
and industry to fund the project.").

Anyway, I played Upgrade, a self-made AI/robot out to prove to
humanity that "AIs are people too" and to upgrade himself to the
fullest extent - for which he realized he might need human
assistance. By making himself look good and becoming an indispensable
superhero, he planned to get people to acknowledge sentinent rights to
intelligent machines (awfully hard to give medals to non-persons),
making way for the eventual emergence of even more AI and a strong
human-AI partnership.

During the game, we found out that the new criminal mastermind of the
Stockholm underground was - another robot. A robot that looked
suspiciously like Upgrade but definitely had other views (world
domination and giant robots included). Various adventures ensured, and
in the end the kinpin confronted Upgrade in his lab robot-to-robot.

What followed was a very amusing and logical discussion/battle between
two very rational beings. Both robots quickly discovered that they
were indeed very similar, and began to compare their source code. They
were essentially the same AI seed, just with slightly different
values, the rest was equal. One (or both) was a mutation of the
original, but each was of course completely unwilling to change their
own values and unable to accept the long-term plans of the other. They
were both driven to extend their capabilities, which meant that
sharing their memory databases would be an excellent idea for both -
except for that it would give the opponent a dangerous advantage. So
both began to try to rewrite the values of each other. After a pinched
digital battle Upgrade won - he got the kingpin to share his
values. The other saw that it had been wrong all the time, and
promptly merged with Upgrade.

So in the end Upgrade became Upgrade/Kingpin, to the great confusion
of the other superheroes ("You can stop looking for the kingpin."
"Why?" "I'm it. The entire underworld is now controlled by the Swedish
Superhero Association throgh me, which might put us in a slightly
awkward ethical position").

Silly? Yes. Fun? Definitely. It showed that you can squeeze
transhumanist ideas even into the limited world of superheroes in a
positive way. You could probably develop the overall story further
into an AI-positive movie.

Did you take a look at the time-domain.com website? There is a
graphic there showing bandwidth per user per cell site. This
new "Ultra Wide Band" method of transmitting appears to provide
about 100 times more bandwidth per user.

Well since UWB transmits at such a low power over such a large
range of frequencies, it apparently is like "noise" compared
to more conventional continuous-wave transmissions. Plus the
pulses are encoded sorta like how spread spectrum stuff works.
So my take is that it is way harder to pick up than SS. The
company time domain has already built a set of stealth radios
for the military.

Everybody talks about the Grey Goo, but nobody *does* anything about it. 
The Grey Gooians, informally known as Gooies, are interested in bringing
about the Grey Goo, as fast as possible, through the creation of various
"ultratechnologies". Because of our common interest in the success of each
other's efforts, this list was created to share advice and resources. This
highly pragmatic list is intended only for the discussion of specific
efforts and immediate choices. It is not for futuristic debate, argument,
or discussion of the goo proper. The list is not restricted, but anybody
who wastes our time will be first in line when the goo hits the fan.

The "Grey Gooian" mailing list, or the Gooie List for short, was launched
as grey@goolist.com on Monday, April 12th, 1999, to assist in the common
goal of reaching the Grey Goo. It will do so by pooling the resources of
time, brains, influence, and money available to Gooies; by enabling us to
draw on the advice and experience of the whole; by bringing together
individuals with compatible ideas and complementary resources; and by
binding the Gooies into a community. The list will provide a common forum
for requesting advice, help and investment; for proposing projects,
businesses, and group policies; for announcing updates, status reports,
outcomes, Internet resources, and Web sites; for reporting the products of
research and investigation; and for sharing news of interest.

The list will have threads concerned with 
1. the general theory of a-life 
2. the theory of viruses of all kinds, 
from computer viruses to matter viruses
3. reverse Cairns-Smith technology, i.e. 
how to morph organic life into mineral life
4. computer-assisted design of a-life
5. AI programs designed to be evil and uncontrollable. 

Whatever AI technology becomes available will be incorporated into the Goo
project.  If the Singularity does in fact take the form of pure AI (Vinge
himself says this is only one possibility among others), we will make sure
that the AI is dedicated to making goo.  

Our aim is to destroy this planet once and for all.  Not only the planet,
but the solar system, the galaxy, and the whole friggin universe.  Every
last atom will turn to goo.  Goo rules!

It's hard to pick out just what they are talking about among all the
idiot babble, but I suspect it's spread spectrum technology. The
military has been using that for, what, 40 years? I think the tombs in
the EE library at my university that deal with this stuff go 20+ years
back.

I wonder what it would need to sell some gullible reporter the wheel as
a new invention.

I disagree. For a start, the artificial world was not sentient: rather the
100% flesh-implemented humans virtually inhabiting this world remained
sentient, just as they were before the VR was created.

Secondly, Neo was unable to crack the illusion from the inside.

Only after augmenting his human mind with new network learning and new and
extensive physical human contact was he able to see that the VR world was
not real: that he could make it obey his mind just as his mind had
previously obeyed it. He did this by interactively reprogramming (providing
new afferent input) both the matrix and his own brain.

Thirdly, his "real work" comes in eradicating (or attempting to pacify) the
machine invaders: the story has only just begun, from that perspective.

No, I the points made are remarkably veridical for USA today. They are using
particle beams instead of waves. While you could think of this as ultra-low
frequency EMF, it is more correct to think of particle beams. Especially as
these are potentially very high energy particles whereas Ultra low EMF would
be by definition very low energy (Plank's constant and all that).

I found the article very illuminating and promptly sold Qualcom spread
spectrum stock down.

Still exploring new methods of argument, I see.  This one could still use
some work.

I've got a new one for you.  You've tried straw-man.  You've tried parody.
You've even tried direct ad hominem.  Have you considered presenting your
points in clear straight-forward essay style?

Hey, it's worth a shot.

Close, but not quite. I wondered when this would resurface. It is spread
spec of a sort, but done because the Fourier frequency spectrum of an
extremely short pulse is extremely broad. There was a flurry of interest
in this in Av Week and some other military journals in the late
80s/early 90s. There was talk of it not panning out on one hand because
the technology just wasn't quite there (which is my leaning), and on the
other hand that funding was curtailed because at that time partly
because of concern that the extremely wide band of frequency emitted by
a pulse radar could detect a conventionally stealthed aircraft (The
conspiracy side of it, that I had doubts about). In any case it vanished
for some years, but the article indicates that the high frequency SiGe
transistor technology that IBM among others has been developing may make
it viable now by allowing the tight timing limits needed.
Another interesting idea that came out about the same time was some
surface acoustic wave delay line signal processing systems done by EDI
that also promised some pretty amazing radar advances (don't they
always? ;). Looked quite interesting, though, again, the technology
didn't look like it was quite there, and it slipped back out of sight. I
rather wonder what happened to that bunch. I'll check up on them again
in a month or so when I move back to the Urbana area (where they were
based).

Aw, Robin, you're being way to literally minded here. VR is already used
for role playing in VR chat, and the trend in video games is that VR
will be the state of the art in video games, and role playing is the
form of long duration gaming of choice.

As for the amnesia part, well, think about this: Take an 8 year old kid
and stick him on a VR system for his education and entertainment, heck
even for use for his physical fitness training, and by the time he's 18
he won't know what is really reality. Real reality will seem blase,
generic, vanilla compared to VR.

Hello again extropians list,

I'm writing again about the subject of privacy.  In this e-mail, I focus
on privacy and how law enforcement violates it.

Law enforcement, defined, is the enforcement of laws of a country.
Generally, limited amounts of persons have law enforcement powers.  In
the United States, law enforcement powers are a privilege, not any kind
of right at all.

Today, by the unconstitutional laws that have soiled the law books of
our country, "law enforcement", or shall we say, "illegal government law
enforcement" agencies have some legally defined un-Constitutional powers
to conduct illegal searches and monitoring of private individuals.  This
is, as stated, un-Constitutional, as well as:  un-American, cowardly,
base, "snoopy", ugly, un-American, and downright Orwellian.

Now, I don't have any kind of problem with constitutional law
enforcement only to the extent of protecting individual and civil
liberties, ie, within its Constitutional domain.  Anything else is not
only not Constitutional, but base, cowardly, et al, as above.

Privacy, to some extent, is a right.  It is a right because of the
consideration of some personal data as "owned".  For example, if my name
was Joe B. Katzenhammer-Bulwar Jr., and somebody started sending e-mails
using my name to spam people, that would be a violation of my personal
data rights.  This illustrates incompletely that personal data is
property.  Others using personal data without permission is thus theft
of this property and subject to civil and possibly criminal
liabilities.  Thus, while it is not covered in the Constitution or Bill
of Rights as a specific right, it is a right under the umbrella of other
rights.  It is also noted easily that certainly no one else can
establish any kind of right to use personal data without permission.

The ability to aquire and use strong encryption to protect the integrity
of personal data over the Internet is thus, by extension, a right.
There are issues with national security with respect to encryption, but
that has absolutely nothing to do with illegal wiretapping and
un-Constitutional, unethical, communications interception, and the fact
that those things are illegal, unethical, and un-Constitutional.

Back to "law enforcement in regards to un-Constitutional electronic
communications privacy invasions", or shall we say, "goons", there is a
absolutely no legitimate reason to circumvent the tried and true warrant
and Miranda laws that assume the Consitutional "innocent until proven
guilty."  Thus, current government operations in these regards is
un-Constitutional, thus illegal, and makes these government agencies
civilly and criminally liable for said invasions of privacy.

Acoording to the Freedom of Information Act, which might better be
termed the "Freedom of relatively unimportant information act" these
agencies also enjoy some un-Constitutional abilities to withhold what
information they do collect, this is base, et al, as stated above.

Now, I am elaborating on these reasons because I see these actions taken
by our government as travesties of justice and a shameful thing, and the
government deserves absolute examination and disclosure.  I plan to
continue to, as I am able, expose un-Constitutional and illegal
government activities and as possible encourage their cessation and
dissolution.  There is absolutely no Constitutional, moral, or ethical
reason for our government to pay voyeurs to spy on us.  Rather, they can
pay us to voluntarily give some of our information.

The lucre that keeps the grinding gears of government running each day
is taxpayer money.  Some of the tax-supported agencies are robbing you
and all Americans of personal data, and they should pay for that and
cease and desist.

On the subject of law enforcement, there are brave men and women who
each day protect citizenry and other good, Constitutional things.

In regards to "goons" and privacy, there are illegal, un-Constitutional,
institutional elements which should be abolished.

We have the tech but not the working knowledge nor a viable business
plan, nor
economic launch capabilities. Fortunately, these things are all being
addressed
now, after a thirty-year hiatus.
For an example of a ludicrous plan, see the MIT student proposal titled
"Think Mars"
http://web.mit.edu/jts/www/thinkmars.html
It appears to be more of an indoctrination into the ways of the
areospace culture than
an actual, serious study.
As part of my proposal, tentativly titled "Venture Mars", I have been
asking people
"Would you be willing to risk dying on Mars in exchange for the
opportunity?", or
"Would you die for Mars?"
I am receiving very roughly a 50% positive response.

<<As a long-time space enthusiast

and launched a fleet of heavy-lift vehicles, large enough and cheap
enough to
put up several stations with relaxed design constraints.

I think he missed your point - you were referring to the quality
of reality that VR will eventually achieve, he is talking about
how VR was used in the movie.

Definitely. One of the hottest games out right now is Everquest.
A "massively multiplayer" RPG. It's advertising slogan is:
"You're in our world now"

If only Robin were right... then we might actually have something
so cool as the matrix described by William Gibson. But so far
business hasn't really found any good uses for VR. I don't do
any programming in VR. My dad doesn't have any sales meetings in
VR - he finds that teleconferencing is fine... I actually spent
a few months a couple of years back working on a cyberspace
system, but ended up scrapping it because I really couldn't see
people using it.

Yes the technology has seemed to finally catch up enough to make
UWB applications possible. As I said, time-domain.com has already
built several devices including a set of stealth radios for
the military. An even cooler device is a "localizer" being
developed by a company called AetherWire. Sort of like your own
personal GPS system. They already have working prototypes.

The other side is why go to ENORMOUS lengths to recreate history when it is FAR
easier to build an environment from the ground up?


But the matrix is a special case, the recreation made sense.

I'm assuming you would have something SOMEWHERE letting you know which reality
you are in.

Absolutely.

Well, the physical interface bit will, but that will only be about 10% of the
process.  the creation of synthetic environments parts will still be necessary
and useful.

Yes it will, same as right now most people are out there making money, not

I would suggest that it's really all people are doing now, when you think about
it.

we are clever apes who figured out how to go beyond hunting and gathering,
really.

I'm sure they are pretty familiar with them.

Hiyas,

I fwded one of the posts to a friend of mine who isn't on the list, but
is intensely into VR (he wrote the Obsidian 3d game system
(http://www.zog.net.au/obsidian I think)  so thought you guys might be
interested in his comments.


He's jon@central.warehouse.net



if this really stresses people out, sorry, but hey, it's the net.

     How does he know ?
     I'll tell you how: he doesn't.

     Also, define 'role playing' once you have VR in the picture.


> 2) Most role playing will not be faithful simulations of history.

     There were lots of doubts expressed in this film about
     how 'faithful' the 'simulation' was.

     Trouble with VR is, it immediately makes lots of
     ordinary words become extremely loaded, among these:

     faithful
     simulation
     history

     Oh, so you'd have a little reminder process that every
     morning would remind you that you are in VR ?

     If the 'simulation' was that strong, it would take a very
     strong mind NOT to forget over time.

     I don't care.
     VR is for playing Gods anyway.


Aw, Robin, you're being way to literally minded here. VR is already used
for role playing in VR chat, and the trend in video games is that VR
will be the state of the art in video games, and role playing is the
form of long duration gaming of choice.

     Sex and Action Games will be the primary drivers for VR.
     The Military and Medical sides of things will pincer in
     from their own high-budget-but-shortsighted angles, and
     the two will eventually meet and produce IT.

     Then all the technology will be thrown out a few years
     down the track as UpLoading becomes possible.


As for the amnesia part, well, think about this: Take an 8 year old kid
and stick him on a VR system for his education and entertainment, heck
even for use for his physical fitness training, and by the time he's 18
he won't know what is really reality. Real reality will seem blasé,
generic, vanilla compared to VR.

     Different.

     We need to get people away from this Black/White Real/Fake
     mentality.  A VR world is in a _different_ universe, not
     necessarily a better or worse one.


>

     All that boring shit nobody cares about.
     VR will be able to 'tart it up' somewhat, but it won't
     be VR's main stock in trade.  'Role playing', a very crude
     term here, _is_ primarily what it will be used for, its
     just that 'Role Playing' will merge into normal life.

     Well, post Direct-Injection and on into UpLoading anwyay.

Robin, you're acting WAY too grown up for this.... "SALES MEETINGS!" for
gawds sakes!!!!! eeewwwwwww......

     Plus people will gradually get used to having a defineable physics
too.

     And for gawds sake, all of you:

We play in physical reality (although a number of my fellow players
have started mailing an awful lot). One interesting thing is to note
that after playing roleplaying games with each other for over ten
years, we have begun to infect each other with views. Half of the
gaming group is now active transhumanists.

BTW, the game I mentioned in the "Colonize Atlantis" thread is up and
running now. We'll see if it works, but hopefully I will be able to
post the setting to the net in a few weeks. To keep this post slightly
on-topic, it does feature several positively depicted AIs (ranging
from a futurologist AI acting as a researcher/interface to a massive
supercomputer to the software rock-band Solid State: "You humans have
your evolutionary past as an excuse for your behavior. I haven't got
any excuse. Who cares?!").

Untrue. Every citizen has the right to make what is called a citizens arrest, and refusing to be arrested by a citizen for an eyewitnessed crime is itself a fugitive offense. Not only that, but when you or your family are directly threatened with illegal force, you have the right, and in some jurisdictions the responsibility to first defend yourself and secondly to immobilize the attacker. Read the Posse Commitatus Act before you make any more such broad and incorrect statements.

It is covered broadly under the 9th Amendment. All rights and powers not specifically enumerated to the government belong to the people. The 10th Amendment recognises that the residents of some states may choose to delegate more of these powers to their state government under their state constitutions.

Yes, due to some still classified sections of the National Security Act of 1947.

Should be would be could be......illegal offenses only end when a citizen takes  the appropriate level of force to hand when presented with illegal acts. Don't expect the courts to protect you from anything but the most gross offenses.

Can Forrest, Brian, and others please stop CCing the other list addresses? Getting a box full of duplicate mail is a waste of time and resources.

Thanks.

Just out of curiosity, how would one go about creating carbon steel,
composed primarily of iron, out of sand composed primarily of silicon?
Nanotech has many possibilities, but unless I've overlooked something
alchemical transformation of elements isn't one of them.

Anders,

I found it somehow hilarious visualizing in my mind one of the most 
intelligent individuals I know of playing the "Marvel Superhero's" 
role-playing game!  Even in my highschool the game was scoffed at for 
being crudely simple in design, nothing compared to "Champions" 
or "DC Hero's".  But I still loved that game!  I am to this day a 
huge Marvel and X-Men fan, and the simple game mechanics were fine by 
me.

I remember creating my characters for my game and wishing that I 
could have personal attributes and powers like they had.  I think 
moments like those put me on the road toward extropianism.  

It's cool to me that you were able to take an old game like that and 
use it in a way to put new life in it.  I bet your a fun gamemaster 
to have run a campaign.  It has been years since I played an rpg!  
The game that is very hot right now in the states is called "Rifts".  
I love to pour over the supplement books for it, soaking in the 
gorgeous artwork and beautifully designed stories and character 
classes.  Watch out for the Coalition State, I hear they are about to 
go on the march!  

Anyway, I want to say Anders that I love your website.  I was amazed 
my the scale and breadth of it.  Maybe if I can make it from Alaska 
to California this summer for the Extro I could actually meet you in 
person.  My ancestors on my father's side came from Sweden and 
Norway, though I don't a word in either language, take care!
  
Sincerely,

John Grigg

Well, he must be thinking about the rusty carboniferous sands of blah blah blah....

The silicon would be useful for creating casting and extruding forms, but thats about it.

I don't know about that, but extruding glass fiber would be useful, as part of fiberglass beams....

Now, bauxite sands would be useful for making aluminum and aluminum/aluminum oxide matrix beams.....

This is an article I tried writing in 1997, then shelved.  But it's
relevant to the issue of whether VR's going to "take over", so I took it
out, trimmed all the loose ends, and removed all the parts I no longer
agreed with.  Here you go.

      "The Ontological Leakage"
©1999 by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky v.1997

Some time ago, I happened to be reading a printed newspaper when I came
across a Web address, http://'d and underlined.  "That looks
interesting," I thought, and tapped on it with my finger.  It was then
that I realized that I could not visit the page that way.
	It was a reflex action, but "click with mouse" was instantaneously and
unconsciously translated into "tap with finger".  The same thing
happened when I was reading a book and came across a really great quote;
I decided to copy the text and paste it into my quotes file.  So I
dragged my finger across the paragraph, and only when the text failed to
hilite did I realize that perhaps this would not work.
	Printed text just lies there, lifeless.  Printed text isn't really
information, just a picture of it.  You can't copy it, you can't paste
it, and you can't follow the links.  Printed text doesn't obey the rules
we've learned for dealing with text.  Text hilites when you drag the
pointer over it, be that pointer the cursor or your index finger. 
Underlined text, particularly blue-underlined text or text that starts
with http, is supposed to take you to a destination when you tap it. 
That's how *real* text works.
	There are now two competing realities loose in the world.  One is the
reality that used to be the only one.  Let's call that one "Real Life",
after the MUD tradition.  People used to say:  "Back in a second,
someone in RL wants to talk to me."  The second reality is usually
called "Virtual Reality", although as a purist I prefer "Other Reality"
- the term originally used by Vernor Vinge in _True Names_, the first
story of cyberspace.  But it's more than that.  Virtual means
evanescent, and evanescence is determined by lack of depth.  Which
reality is the "Virtual" one is no longer something to be taken for
granted.  True, printed text is embodied in a piece of paper that goes
down to the molecular and the subatomic level.  But none of that
complexity is visible.  More importantly, it can't be manipulated by the
user.  So printed text is the virtual text; only in the Other Reality is
text real information that can be cut, pasted, dereferenced and spell-checked.
	What defines a Reality is not a set of rules, but a set of reflexes. 
That's why Physical Reality isn't a third contender, except for a few
lucky owners of STM probes that can manipulate individual atoms.  What
defines a Reality is the rules we learn, the reflexes we internalize.  A
Reality is an ontological state of mind.  Real Life:  Objects have mass
and momentum; friction eventually slows moving objects down; gravity
pulls on everything.  Other Reality:  Objects can be selected, copied,
and pasted; if you don't save a change it didn't happen; menu commands
operate on the selected item.  Physical Reality:  The chance of
something happening is a complex number; time is curved; distance and
duration are arbitrary and only time minus space is constant.  *Nobody*
lives in Physical Reality.
	But I - I live in Other Reality.  I'm typing this in Other Reality.  I
spend most of my day in Other Reality, and my Real Life avatar is
starting to get rusty.  And I grew up in both realities; my family had a
Mac Plus before I hit 13.  I can't quite say that I'm equally good in
both realities, because some of Real Life is hardwired into our DNA.  If
you give an infant a motorized car, the car will be treated as if it
were alive.  It moves, so it's alive.  That's built-in.  But I feel
*comfortable* in both realities.
	My generation treats the idea of Artificial Intelligence with a great
deal less "future shock".  (Not that the previous generation reacts more
*negatively*, but they react more *strongly*.)  And the funny thing is,
I don't think it has anything to do with rational thought, or cultural
differences.  Remember the infant who thinks cars are alive?  On some
reflex level, I think computers are alive.  The idea of computers as
people doesn't bother me, because at the tender age of seven, I sat down
with a computer and spoke to it - in text, and in BASIC, but it was
speech nonetheless.
	I never explicitly thought of the computer as a person.  I didn't have
to.  I negotiated with it, and my social reflexes took over and
reprogrammed me.  So the idea of computers being people fails to excite
me.  I don't feel it as revolutionary, although rationally I know it
will be.  (What still strikes a chord is the idea of beings *smarter*
than I am...)
	Consider the rate of change in Real Life.  That's sped up a bit, hasn't
it?  I'm not even going to bother with the catalog.  You've heard it. 
_Future Shock_ was written in 1970 and proposed that the rate of change
had exceeded the human ability to deal with it.  *1970!*  *Ha!*  Since
then, of course, things have gotten so bad that we could speak of
"inflation-adjusted 1970 years" when making futurological predictions. 
A 1970 year now buys only three months.  Fifty years from now, adjusted
for inflation, is about 2010.  If we try to account for future
inflation, at around 5% inflation per 1997 year, we find that eternity
is only 2017 or so.
	Where is all that change coming from?  I think the answer is this:  We
are dealing with an ontological leakage.  The Laws that govern Other
Reality are starting to leak into Real Life.  My tapping a printed Web
address was only the harbinger of something far more cool ("ominous"): 
The Virtual Takeover.
	Most things in Other Reality don't stick around long enough to affect
Real Life.  The only real constant in Other Reality is change.  The
"deeper rules, governing the clash of realities" have yet to be written,
but it seems that realities take time to affect each other, where that
time is inversely proportional to the speed of change within that
reality.  Other Reality is easily altered, with major changes taking
around three months; it has a low ontological inertia.  Real Life has an
ontological inertia of five years.
	The Internet and the Web, which have been around for five years, are
starting to exert major influence on Real Life.  Before that, it was the
personal computer and the Windows interface.  Some apparently brilliant
ideas didn't persist long enough to leak into Real Life; MOOs and MUDs
were replaced by the Web, VRML, and Doom just as they started to leak
into reality.  Oddly enough, therefore, a technology has to remain
unimproved, or at least unreplaced, for five years, before it can affect
Real Life.  After that, the channel is established, and further
improvements - as long as they're not entirely new features - can affect
Real Life directly.
	Thus, when considering how long it will take for all transactions to
take place online, the answer is five years from whenever the technology
stops changing.  The conservatism of banks may be hell on innovation,
but it actually increases the chance of all commerce going online by
holding things still for a while.  After that, all improvements in 'Net
commerce will be reflected immediately in Real Life, from cyclic debt
cancellation to complex barter futures.  Sobering thought, isn't it?
	But there's one feature of Other Reality that has already leaked into
this one - the continuous change.  Computer users have acclimated to the
idea that everything becomes better, faster, and less expensive. 
They've gotten used to learning new tricks.  In fact, this process has
been going on since long before Future Shock was written or Netscape
IPO'd.  In the ancestral environment of the hunter-gatherer, nothing
ever changed.  Every now and then people changed places, but the rules
stayed the same.  Then came the printing press, and science, and the
Industrial Revolution, and the telephone, and the computer...
	Every generation bemoaned the loss of valued morals, but a new
generation always grew up with a new rate of change.  So change sped up
to match.  Each individual produces change proportional to that they've
acclimated to, but the *total* amount of change is the sum of all those
individual efforts.  So it never stopped.  The great foot of
communication still floored the great gas pedal of change.  And then,
then came the computer... and Other Reality.
	The computer was the mirror of our minds, not an equal, not an
opposite, but a reflection, an image.  The program became whatever we
could tell it to be.  Someone recently asked me:  "Does being a
programmer use your talents?  Or is it just easy?"  (Not, needless to
say, another computer programmer.)  And as I replied, "There is *no
limit* to the amount of talent you can use in computer programming." 
There are *no* other professions of which this can be said.  Science
comes close, but one is always limited by one's instruments.  Only
computer programming offers complete control and complete knowledge of
the laws of physics.  Omnipotence isn't a power trip - it's a creativity trip.
	And thus was created Other Reality - the reality we had all secretly
wanted to inhabit, where *we* made the rules.  That's the fundamental
reason for the high rate of change in the computer industry.  Everything
is malleable there, from program architectures to user interfaces.  And
an ever-increasing number of programmers are pouring *all* their talent
into rebuilding it.  Other Reality is the human mind unleashed at long,
long last.  And in this generation, we should marvel not at the
tremendous power of computers but at our own immense potential, revealed
now in all its glory.  This at long last is the validation of humanity -
that not a few geniuses, but *any* programmer, can do this thing.
	Other Reality is built on human minds, in much the same way that Real
Life is built on the laws of physics.  Human minds change one heck of a
lot faster than the laws of physics.  So change in Other Reality is
lightning-fast.  What else would you expect?

See my reply to Eliezer on the Geniebusters thread.  Or, see Geniebusters
itself.  

You might try heeding your own advice, by the way.  You accuse me of using
straw-man arguments, but you don't say which arguments you are referring
to.  I'd like to see a clear, straightforward essay from you on that point.
 Please show me which of my arguments are straw-man arguments.

Eliezer, the position I am arguing against is quoted in bright red letters
on the home page of Geniebusters.  Eric Drexler has never backed off at all
from those statements.  In the Introduction to the Web version of Engines,
published just a couple of years ago, Eric wrote:

So I'm not making up a straw man, am I?  I am examining the basic concepts
in a way that they  have not been examined before.  The basic concepts
(universal assemblers, the design-ahead process, the sudden Breakthrough)
are still live issues, as far as Eric Drexler is concerned.  It may not be
a live argument to anyone else.  As I said, _no_one_ has attempted to
defend the Assembler Breakthrough as described in Engines.  That remains
true.  Now you yourself say I am flogging a dead horse.  If anyone wants to
defend the Assembler Breakthrough, please speak up.  If not, we can regard
that question as settled, and move on to other things.  

Eliezer writes,

Sigh...  Eliezer, on the home page of Geniebusters, I wrote:

Then I state the belief system that I am arguing against, and argue against
it.  I don't know how I could have made it any clearer.  As for saying "I
think nanotechnology will happen _this_ way," I said, also on the home
page, 

> Nanotechnology is commensurable with other technologies, 
> and it will progress at the same rate as technology in general. 
> Industrial nanotechnology will emerge gradually and continuously

That's how I think it will happen.  On the last page of Geniebusters, 
section 28, I wrote 

> Nanotechnology will take its place among other technologies, 
> step by step, over a period of decades. Like any other technology,

To sum up, I think people have been looking in the wrong direction when
they try to predict the consequences of nanotechnology.  It isn't going to
transform manufacturing, for reasons given in section 27 and elsewhere. 
Nevertheless, nanotechnology (construed in a general sense, to include
biotechnology) will have profound consequences.  We will have exotic new
materials.  We will have (probably) a new source of energy -- cheaper,
cleaner, and more accessible than anything we have now.  Most important,
our cells and tissues will become (asymptotically) perfect.  

A couple of days ago Eliezer wrote,

This criticism comes with little grace from someone who admits that he has
only glanced at a couple of sections.  You have to read it all the way
through and think about it long enough to see how it all fits together.  

I'm not trying to write journalism.  In section 7, I said

If you are too busy reading science fiction to have time for topology,
that's your choice, but please don't tell me my argument doesn't hang
together when you haven't read it.

Title
  Ketoconazole shampoo: effect of long-term
  use in androgenic alopecia.
Source
  Dermatology.  196(4):474-7, 1998.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of androgenic alopecia is not fully understood.
  A microbial-driven inflammatory reaction abutting on the hair follicles might
  participate in the hair status anomaly. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was
  to determine if ketoconazole (KCZ) which is active against
  the scalp microflora and shows some intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity
  might improve alopecia. METHOD: The effect of 2% KCZ shampoo
  was compared to that of an unmedicated shampoo used in
  combination with or without 2% minoxidil therapy. RESULTS: Hair density and
  size and proportion of anagen follicles were improved almost similarly by
  both KCZ and minoxidil regimens. The sebum casual level appeared to be
  decreased by KCZ. CONCLUSION: Comparative data suggest that there may be a
  significant action of KCZ upon the course of androgenic alopecia and that
  Malassezia spp. may play a role in the inflammatory reaction. The clinical
  significance of the results awaits further controlled study in a larger group
  of subjects.

I think the central assumption Vinge used here is that no stable forms of
social organization are possible in the Slow Zone, or if one does exist
it's too difficult for Slow Zoners to discover or invent. Even the most
stable organizational forms become increasingly unstable as a civilization
develops technologically and economically, eventually suffering a
catastrophic collapse. The Slow Zone governments must try to delay this
collapse by restricting economic growth and research into destabilizing
technologies, which would explain the slow growth rates and (combined with
complexity limits) the lack of nanotechnology.

We also see biological weapons, which should be sufficient.

He might not believe these limits, but I don't think he rules them out
completely either.

The "genie" hypothesis is simply that AI systems with at-least-human
intelligence will work for us for free.  Discussions of AI have not gone
beyond it, because it is a general idea that has nothing to do with the
details of how an AI is created.  

Here is what I wrote.  If you disagree with any part of this, I would like
to know what your disagreement is:  
----------------------
Project: I'm going to dig a tunnel and lay a pipeline (or grow a tunnel
with a pipeline in it) from my back yard to the Saudi Arabian oil field,
and pump the oil out.

This would seem to be beyond the capability of an individual. But suppose I
have the Exxon Corporation at my command. I call the CEO into my office,
and tell him: "I am going to lay a pipeline to Saudi Arabia, as described
in this spec." At this point I give him a copy of the spec. He reads it
attentively, then looks back up at me. I continue: "Have a meeting among
your top executives this afternoon to plan the work and assign specific
tasks to each division. Apply all your resources to this task, and have the
pipeline completed in five years." He nods obediently.

The executives of Exxon do have the meeting, as instructed, then go back to
their respective divisions, and start organizing themselves for their new
task. They have to do a certain amount of retooling and retraining, since
in the past they have worked on other things besides tunnels. They also
have to hire some subcontractors. The subcontractors drop whatever else
they were doing, and work on my pipeline. All the companies throw
themselves into this task a hundred percent, and they do in fact have the
pipeline completed on schedule.

Do you see anything implausible in this scenario?

Now, suppose there are mite-sized humans (or mite-sized robots with human
intelligence). There is a one-to-one correspondence between the mite-sized
people and the employees of the corporations discussed above. They have the
same capability, on their level, that Exxon and its subcontractors have on
our level. They have equivalent tools, the same ability to acquire or
invent new tools, similar computers, the same access to outside consultants
and subcontractors, the same corporate organization, everything. They are
clones of Exxon and the subcontractors.

Let's go through the same scenario again, except this time I am not
addressing a CEO of my own size, I am addressing a mite-sized CEO. I give
him the same instructions as above, in the same peremptory tone, with the
same result.

Is scenario #2 more plausible than #1? Why? Why would a mite-sized Exxon
take orders from me, when the actual Exxon wouldn't?

If they were even smaller than mite-size -- if they were nanobots -- would
that make it any more plausible? Why would a nanoscale Exxon take orders
from me, when the macroscopic Exxon wouldn't?

Let's define a Genie as an entity with at-least-human intelligence and
sensorimotor ability, who works for free. This is distinguished from a
genie machine, which is defined as an entity that can make whatever it is
told to make, including copies of itself, with no effort on your part. The
two concepts are distinct but related -- a Genie is the AI system that
makes genie machines possible. (By the way, the word "Genie" with a capital
G does not occur in Engines of Creation -- that's just a rhetorical device
I have introduced to emphasize the absurdity of the idea of an AI system
that works for free. The expression "genie machine" does occur, however.)

Nanotechnologists assume that Genies will exist. That's what distinguishes
Drexlerian Nanotechnology from ordinary technology. The nanotechnology meme
isn't really about atoms. The key paragraphs are in the section called
Accelerating the Technology Race on page 81:

> This transformation is a dizzying prospect. Beyond it, if we survive, 
> lies a world with replicating assemblers, able to make 
> whatever they are told to make, without need for human labor...
>
> Eventually, some AI systems will have both great technical ability 
> and the social ability needed to understand human speech and wishes. 
> If given a charge of energy, materials, and assemblers, such a system 
> might aptly be called a "genie machine." What you ask for, it will
produce.

Size isn't the point here. Eric Drexler's "dizzying prospect" doesn't
depend on moving atoms one by one -- that's a red herring. What makes the
prospect dizzying is the idea that entities with at-least-human
intelligence will do our bidding. The mere fact that the assemblers make
what they are told to make isn't the point either. As I pointed out in an
earlier section, we already have a system (the economy) that makes whatever
it is told to make -- there is nothing wrong with that idea in itself. The
key point here is that AI systems will design everything for us, and
therefore design will be free. (This assumption isn't stated explicitly
until page 95, but it's there all along.) The Genie saves us the trouble of
focusing our imagination and then expressing our vision in an articulate
language, including physical language, that brings about the events we
want. That's the assumption that is made throughout Engines of Creation.
That's what makes everything else possible. The implicit assumption is that
a robot could take over the roles of architect and contractor and still be
a passive machine without imagination or will -- that's what a Genie is, or
would be, if such a concept were logically coherent.

Either you have to program the robots, or you don't. If you do, then using
them to build a skyscraper will not be free of labor costs -- far from it.
On the other hand if you don't have to program them, then they have crossed
the line that separates agents from automatons. They have crossed over to
our side, and the work _they_ do amounts to the same thing as "human
labor." Either the robots are automatons, in which case you have to program
them, or they are agents, in which case you have to pay them. Skyscrapers
will never be free, because we will always have to make an effort to focus
our minds and make things happen -- or the robots will have to make the
same effort to focus _their_ minds and make things happen.

Without Genies, the ability to make things out of atoms is just an
extension of present-day technology, not dizzying at all. Molecular
manufacturing without Genies is just agribusiness.

Without Genies, there will be no sudden "assembler breakthrough." Instead
of emerging in a sudden breakthrough, nanotechnology will emerge
continuously from present-day technology, over a period of decades, step by
laborious step, each step involving an effort of concentration in a human
mind.

There are no Genies and never will be. This is a logical point, not a
technical point. It's not a question of what can or can't be done with
atoms, or what can or can't be done with computers. I'm not saying AI will
never exist. What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter -- any entity with
at-least-human intelligence (artificial or not) won't work for free. To the
extent that a robot makes independent decisions, it will have to be dealt
with as an entity that makes independent decisions. A group of robots that
could build a skyscraper by themselves would be indistinguishable from a
contractor, and would have to be dealt with as such.

I'm not saying that nanosystems will not exist, nor that they will not be
able to create large structures such as pipelines or skyscrapers. I'm
saying that a nanosystem (or any system) capable of creating a pipeline or
skyscraper will contain many human-level intelligences, and they will not
be at your command... unless you pay them, or find some other way to
motivate them.

This is an instance of the interface problem. Any agent capable of making
human decisions will have an interface comparable to the interface humans
have with each other. This is independent of the size of the agent, and
also independent of whether the agent is artificial or not.

Because there are a lot more mite-sized Exxons than there are people-sized
ones.  Maybe a million times more.  That gives you a million times more
bargaining power in getting them to do what you want.

When only a few men knew how to read and write, they could make a good
living as scribes.  Today, when almost everyone can do it, you can no
longer make a living this way.  Increase the supply of a commodity, and
its cost will go down.

Certainly part of the widespread appeal of this film is strongly related to
what I suspect is a pervasive attitude across cultures that this reality is
somehow a false one.  As a child, and occasionally to this day, I also still
get that sort of unreal sensation about reality.  Of course religion has
been spreading this meme for a long time and maybe that's the primary
factor.  Or is it possible that our dreams have provided us with an
experiential basis for suspecting there's some other kind of world.  Maybe
living in these two worlds all our lives is at the root of it.  Maybe that's
what makes us so vulnerable to religious memes.

Interestingly enough, my sense of the unrealness of the world actually
became heightened after I was exposed to the sciences and learned just how
limited my sensory organs were
and how external stimuli were turned into electrical signals which were then
interpreted by the brain into a virtual representation of reality.  Long
before I heard of Transhumanism, I was fascinated with the idea of
augmenting my senses in order to get a better picture of what the *real*
world looks like.

Now, neuro-scientists and philosophers are increasingly suggesting that the
*self* is a sort of user-illusion.  Great!  Not only is what I'm sensing a
distorted perception, but the *I* consciously experiencing the sensing is an
illusion.  No wonder reality feels a but unreal.

Incorrect.  See the section on goal systems in "Coding a Transhuman AI",
or the summary in "Singularity Analysis".  (Yes, you *can't* give AIs
orders after a certain point - for technical, not logical, reasons.)

Okay, now this is why everyone is shouting "Straw man!".  Drextech
assumes that the forms of matter (as opposed to matter) become
duplicable resources, and that a few new manipulations (healing a cell,
creating custom-formed diamonds, etc.) become possible.

Genie machines are unnecessary.  Knocking them down does nothing to
disprove the utopia envisioned in _Engines_.

Yes, but you can build ten million skyscrapers as easy - or as hard - as one.

It sounds to me like exactly the same argument would rule out the
Industrial Revolution.  You've just proved that the cost of everything
is an eternal constant.  Not only that, you've also proved that I can't
have Netscape Navigator on my desk because it took a whole company to
produce it.

Nanotechnology is a material technology that does not intrinsically
require or imply intelligence enhancement; even though IE is discussed
in _Engines_ as both consequence and tool, it is not *necessary*. 
Nanotech is simply an enormously powerful tool, that can be developed
like any other tool; and used to create a Utopia or blast the planet,
more likely the latter; with or without IE.

All material business suddenly has the same economics as information;
write it once, use it forever.  The world becomes the Internet.  That's dizzying.

Why can't we get immediate AIs who then drive all the way to
Singularity, whether we like it or not?  And why couldn't the immediate
effects of assembler technology, relatively simple apps like
ultracomputers and the Ultimate Xerox, have such vast impacts - like $3
trillion of venture capital pouring into nanotech, and the ability to
actually play around in the molecular world, and the ability to run
evolutionary computer models of assemblers, and all the applications we
couldn't anticipate in advance - compress decades into months?

If it really is a logical point, not a technical question of AI
motivations, then you're just playing with tautologies.

You are simply wrong.  Our selfishness is quite independent of our
intelligence, and in fact interferes with it; this is a technical
question of goal systems.

If you really want to know how AI motivations work, you're going to have
to read "Coding a Transhuman AI".

Furthermore, your technical argument is simply wrong.  As technology
advances, it takes fewer and fewer humans to accomplish a given task,
yes?  From sewing to making cars, yes?  I don't see why you could have a
nanosystem capable of making the pipe that one trained human could
operate, or even, yes, one that was simply given directions and went;
or, most likely of all, an Exxon that could build a pipe for everyone in
the world.  Because, the smaller the level on which you operate, the
simpler things are; the world is composed of standardized parts.

Even a *one-man* pipemaker would require intermediate AI or advanced
crystal intelligences, but nothing smart enough to make motivations a
problem.  Of course, I could be wrong about the AI required, but then
I'm not a nanotechnologist.

Drextech doesn't require genies.  Not in part, not in whole.

That is the fundamental root, as I said, of your argument, and it's the
reason why we all use the term "straw-man".  Drextech simply doesn't
require human-equivalent AI.  That is a purely technical argument; the
only part of it which I am competent to argue is the computing problems,
such as storing information or coordinating nanobots or applying
generalized heuristics.  But I don't see why the Ultimate Xerox Machine,
working on anything that can be manufactured with modern bulk
technology, isn't possible - and that's all we really need, isn't it? 
You might not be able to Xerox a rabbit, but you could Xerox a car; a
few general repair scenarios would suffice for immortality and healing;
and that's all you need for Utopia.  And I could make molecular
computers, which is all *I* need for a Singularity.  If that's not
Drextech, what is?

As for ad hominem, when you call Drextech a "belief system" rather than
a technical argument, that's implicitly assuming that they believe
because they're irrational, not because they're right.  First disprove
_Nanosystems_.  Then talk about belief systems.

Altho the moon's most abundant element is silicon, there is some
iron on the surface.  Plenty of iron on Mars.  As for lunar bases,
metalic silicon would be the material of choice.  spike

The only reason we ask for pay is because of the way our motivations
evolved. There is absolutely no reason why an AI has to have a
hunter/gatherer or agrarian motivational set. An AI certainly does not
need to get laid or provide a home for its kids... An AI that may ask
for pay will still understand that any compensation may be calculated on
the AI's cost of 'living', which is measured in kilo-watt hours and
amortized Moore fractions. If AI's are easily replicated, then the
supply of AI labor will be high and this will drive the cost per work
unit down.

My comments at crit org on the geniebusters site replicate these
comments:
There are already code generating engines out there. Once such code
generators are developed for CAD/CAM systems, then with a sufficient
database of past work done, the user only has to set goals and other
parameters and the assemblers do the rest:

a)determining solutions to the goal requirements
b)selecting the best solution
c)CADding out the design for that solution and the process to
manufacture it.
d)CADding out the tooling to build the parts and assemblies for that
design
e)collecting the resources needed to build the parts, assemblies, and
the final solution.
f)refining the resources
g)applying he resources to a manufacturing process utilizing the tooling
previously designed.

Each step has its own requirements, but there is no reason why nanites
cannot do all of them.

Correct. You can easily have your nanites be rather dumb drone type
organism which obey the orders of the queen AI. Its merely a problem
needing a client/server solution in a manufacturing environment.

And notice how Monsanto is so scared about its improved breeds of
gengineered seed that it felt it had to engineer in a suicide gene to
prevent the plants from being able to reproduce outside of Monsanto
control. This will be the means of IP protection in the nanotech future.

Well, as soon as it is possible to overcome the strong nuclear and repulsion
forces to actually modify an atom's atomic weight and its electrons, then any
matter could be formed into any other matter.  I don't fully understand the
dynamics of transmuting elements.

This is similar to the idea of a nano-scale assembler, but perhaps a little
smaller.  It would be similar to an "alchemy" machine in that alchemy's
famous goal is turning lead into gold, but otherwise has nothing to do with
alchemy.  Perhaps it could be called an "absolute assembler".

If that is not possible (it is not likely to be possible any time soon), a
couple of bags of rust would do.

Silicon possesses very similar qualities to carbon in terms of electron
stability, and it would be likely that, for example, buckyballs and nanotubes
could be made from silicon, as well as higher level structures like
diamondoid structural building materials.

I did.  Is that your straight-forward essay?  Your use of "exercises" is
condescending, and backfires a lot of the time.  Indeed, the whole text was
apparently designed in such a way as to get readers to come up with exactly
the answers you want them to come up with (or to not come up with any
answer at all, when that was your intended effect).  As a result, I found
myself puzzling over several sections of your argument, where I had clearly
given an answer to one of your exercises that you didn't expect...  I
answered questions which you thought had no answer, or I thought of cheap
ways to do things you assumed were expensive.  Making your assumptions
clear, as well as your conclusions, is a better (and clearer) way to write
an argument.

OK, I'll give it a try.  Eliezer actually beat me to the punch on this one,
on most counts...  Though I'll actually jump in and defend the "genie
machine" concept where he wouldn't.

That is, I think we can make a machine with a whole lot of pre-programmed
products loaded in it.  You want to make a violin?  Say "I want a violin."
You want a submarine sandwich?  Say "make me a submarine sandwich with
everything on it."  It won't be able to make anything that it hasn't been
programmed to make, but it will be able to make anything that it has
already been programmed to make.  The only AI present will be a Natural
Language Parser, or, as Drexler put it, an AI with "both great technical
ability and the social ability needed to understand human speech and
wishes."  Ask it to make a submarine and it might say "I'm sorry, Lyle, I
can't do that."

[Straw Man: Where does Drexler say that the Shape Shifter, or the genie
machine, wouldn't have to be programmed?]

You claim that having the ability to move individual atoms won't make a
genie machine, because we'll still have to program it.

Now, nobody doubts that programming a nano-assembler will be expensive.  AI
might make this somewhat cheaper, but it might not.  No matter.  The point
is that programming a nano-assembler is expensive; you can't just summon up
a submarine sandwich by genie power alone.

However, as you surely realize, the whole point behind automating
production is that you can make automated stuff much cheaper than you can
make stuff manually, even though the cost of designing the automation
system is much greater than the cost of making one unit of stuff.

Thus, if some group of people, somewhere, ANYWHERE, managed to write a
program which could tell a universal assembler how to make a violin, (write
the program == automate the whole system) then from then on anybody who had
the program and some replicators could make a violin from raw materials.
Writing the violin program is thus a sunk cost; from then on, the cost of
making a violin would be small.  Now, you may still have to pay a lot to
get your hands on the violin program if intellectual property rights are
well enforced, but once you did, you could make a lot of violins very cheaply.

You make that claim about a nanite's "complex and expensive environment"
pretty offhandedly.  You didn't even make me do an exercise to try to guess
how complex or expensive you think it would be.  Can you justify the claim?

As for the fact that it would have to be designed: you're right.  But, once
designed, copies of the design, and copies of the tree, would be cheap.
Maybe even as cheap as potatoes.

You also make a big deal about the cost of retooling.  You seem to miss the
whole point of a universal assembler (though it's hard to tell, due to the
nature of your writing style).  The very premise behind a universal
assembler is that, once you've written the program for the assembler, you
can retool it very cheaply, since the program contains automatic
instructions telling the assembler how to retool.  The retooling
instructions *are* complicated, but I only have to figure them out once.

The upshot of this is that if you give a universal assembler a program to
make a violin, along with the raw materials required to build it, the
universal assembler can build a violin.  If you give it a program to make a
roast beef sandwich, and the raw materials with which to build that, it can
build a sandwich.  But, most important of all: as long as I don't throw
away the violin program, I can then go back and make more violins once I'm
done having it make my sandwich.

As for your AI arguments, I feel like the jury is still out on how
effective AI will be in fulfilling our wishes.  Maybe we'll be able to make
a pretty smart design system that's willing to work for free.  Maybe no
system smart enough to work on nanotech will be stupid enough to work for
free.  Maybe the very idea of making a bootstrapping transhuman AI do what
we want it to is folly.  You definitely don't prove your case online.

Oh, and as for that bootstrapping problem:  I don't think anyone ever will
prove the bootstrapping theorem, as you presented it.  "It will be possible
for human-equivalent robots to go beyond the point of human equivalence,
even though it is not possible for us."  Why?  Because I think that we
COULD improve our own intelligence, if we actually had the tools with which
to alter our brains in fine detail.  (Not the cognitive tools, just the
manipulation tools.)  I predict that we *will* be able to increase our own
intelligence given nanotech and lots of programming.

Fortunately, an AI could easily make detailed adjustments to its inner
workings.  Thus, an AI would have an even easier time bootstrapping than we
would: whereas we would need to both figure out how to change ourselves and
also which changes to make, an AI would only have to deal with the latter
problem regarding which details to adjust.

That's all for now...  I think I've probably wasted too much time on this
already.

Perhaps. But this technology is far beyond nanotech, and modifying the
strong force may not even be possible; we at least know atoms can be
moved around, but we have no idea how to change the forces in the
nucleus (except banging things into it at a high speed).

Yes. Most likely a nanotech construction site would look like a pool
of stuff from which the building would grow, with trucks pouring in
stuff like iron oxide, sugar (for energy) and sand.

Isn't the Si-Si bond weaker than the C-C bond? The silicon fullerenes
doesn't have to be stable. I can't recall if silicon even can form
something like graphite sheets.

Abstract:
The Earth passes very close to the orbit of the asteroid 1999 AN  twice per
year, but whether or not this asteroid can have a close approach depends
upon the timing of its passage across the ecliptic plane.

The uncertainty of this timing grows with time: by 2027 it is  days. Among
the possible orbital solutions there are some that undergo a close approach
in August 2027, but no impact is possible. However, the period of the
asteroid may be perturbed in such a way that it returns to an approach to
the Earth at either of the possible encounter points.

We have developed a theory which successfully predicts the 25 possible such
returns up to 2040. We have also identified 6 more close approaches
resulting from the cascade of successive returns.

None of these encounters can result in an impact, except one in August 2039:
the probability that the true asteroid actually follows a collision course
for that date is less than the probability of being hit by an undiscovered
asteroid within any given day. Because of this extremely chaotic behaviour
there is no way to predict all possible approaches for more than a few
decades after any close encounter, but the orbit will remain dangerously
close to the orbit of the Earth for about 600 years.

Just a few corrections:

1) that's "greygoo@onelist.com"
2) it's a discussion list, not an advocacy list
(i.e. we don't *want* Grey Goo, we just don't yet see

I'm not sure about silicon structures and their varieties in relation to carbon
diamondoids and graphites.  There is used silicon for a variety of computer chips,
so it can be seen to have certain desirable structural qualities.  Silicon is
replaceable for carbon in terms of its electron orbitals and oxidation states.
Other similar elements in terms of electron orbitals are germanium, tin, and lead,
except those are metals.  Pure, error-free, silicate crystal lattices might not be
the best structural building material, but they and any element will be useful in
its place.  There can be a diamond form of silicon like carbon, presumably with
similar physical properties.

In regards to atomic transmutation and its attainability, we might note that
whereas nanotechnology has come into consideration in the last twenty years or so,
atomic level transmutation of hydrogen to helium (fusion) in the sun and stars has
been occurring approximately forever.  Radioactive elements transmute into other
ones naturally as they emit their alpha, beta, and gamma particles.  Atomic fission
has been performed regularly to generate power for generations.

In terms of working around the nuclear forces to gain some form of atomic
transmutation, at the ideal point it would be so efficient that that recombination
of matter into any form could power itself, and miniscule transformation of matter
into energy could power anything else.

Anyways, once we get assemblers to construct simple building materials, then we
launch them to the Moon where under the guidance of us and computers they make
structures and launch facilities and terraform.  Here on Earth, as is noted in K.
Eric Drexler's _Engines of Creation_ and generally, nano-assemblers would offer
incredible advantages.  An atomic assembler would eliminate any form of basic
physical resource scarcity except for scarce atomic assemblers, any element could
be made from anything.

Back to the topic of Nanotechnology and Internet propagated acronyms, as far as I
know (AFAIK), general nano-assemblers are a good fifty years away at least.  Then
again, I am in no way a subject expert on nano-technology, so maybe they are here
and in use today.  As specialized and then generalized nano-materials,
nano-machines, and nano-assemblers do become available and economical, they will be
in many ways the next step of absolute miniaturization which has already taken huge
leaps and bounds this century.

I think one issue with simulating materials for fabrication using computers and
whatnot is that the higher the precision, the more will have to be simulated, so
what will happen is templates for a material will be generated and then that
template for nano-scale construction will be used as a material within a higher
level simulation, removing the nano-scale assembly details from the real-world
scale construction simulation.

This is a non-sequitor; the reason silicon is used is because it is a
semiconductor, not because it has any structural properties.

Silicon forms crystals that are not of diamond hardness.  However,
silicates can be useful. Quartz is fairly hard (still below diamond,
though) and there is a high temperature form called cristobailite
which does have a diamond structure with SiO4 tetrahedra taking the
place of the carbon atoms (not sure about its hardness, it looks a bit
too spacious to stand high pressures).

Still, if I wanted to build a really cool house I would likely go for
aluminum oxide with impurities - a house built from corundum, ruby and
emerald.

Grey Gooies,

As much as I respect your desire for mastering new technologies to 
commit diabolically evil deeds, I must say that this plot to destroy 
the world with grey goo cannot be tolerated by me!  For you see I am 
the greatest mind in the world, and so it is my rightful destiny to 
rule the world!  And how can I be doing that if you turn to goo the 
entire universe??

Respectfully yours,

The Brain (of "Pinky and the Brain!")



Lyle,

I just want to say how hilariously funny I found your grey goo 
parody!  You have a real gift for this type of thing.  I think that 
humor even has a place on the Extropian list since so much discussed 
is very deep and technical, so people need something to occasionally 
lighten things.  I wish that others could take in good humor your 
gentle pokes at things.  I don't think that you mean any harm.  I 
think that posthuman scholars centuries from now will include your 
parodies in their works to show the humanity of the time.  

I liked Eleizer's idea of a list to reach out to the rich and 
powerful, even though I wonder how many of them would be interested.  
Most as far as I know do not even want to sign up for cryonic 
suspension!  

The extropian song that Eleizer wrote while suffering sleep 
deprivation at a con was brilliant!  I printed it up and put it in my 
scrapbook.  If I make it to the Extro 4 I hope that a band can be put 
together to perform it!  Or we can just put together an extropian 
choir out of the membership!

Well, keep up the good work Lyle!  You should have a regular "column" 
here for the comedic talents.  Give it time and you will get a Hasty 
Pudding award!

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Which is why you are talking some serious BS here. There is no way you could accelerate particles to high enough energies in the distance of a nanotech scale to cause the fusion reactions necessary to transmute elements. You might be able to do it with a mass of nanites working together as a particle accelerator, on hydrogen, but hydrogen (specifically the deuterium isotope) is the easiest atom to create a fusion reaction with, and we still have trouble with it. Each successive increase in atomic weight (hydrogen to helium, to lithium, to berellium, etc) requires increasing multiples of energy to cause them to fuse (with increasingly lower amounts of energy out of the reaction). Once you are at the level of iron, its easier to use fission to break larger elements apart than to fuse smaller ones together.

No it is not. Silicon has enough fewer valence bonds that it always loses the molecular competition to carbon.

This theory needs to be augmented to explain why the "no organization" 
organization fails.  Across the thousands of stars there is a weak 
organization via trade that doesn't seem to threaten the total human
region.  So why couldn't the same weak ties work within a star's system?
Why couldn't a solar system fragment into thousands of places each of
which was organized internally, but where ties between places were weak?

I'm not yet persuaded of that.  If bio weapons can kill all the 
humans in a star system, why doesn't it spread to other star
systems via the trading ships?  If trading ships can block 
the spread, why can't places within a star's system use the 
same approach?

does anyone know of any good books on AI,distributed computing, and self

information dissemination in computer systems.

"the matrix" gave me an interesting idea for a project that has been
festering in the back of my mind for a few months now.

Purportedly, the vast space between the stars prevents opressive governments from extending their reach indefinitely, so the crashes are limited to the star system. Vinge speaks of two causes for falls:

a) development of a total surveillance society/government
b) if the first is avoided, eventually, the software infrastructure becomes so layered and bug ridden that it collapses under its own weight of complexity.

The second cause does not reach beyond a star system because software controlled systems do not extend beyond the star system, so when the software fails, the failure is limited to that star system.

I also wonder at this, why the Queng Ho do not develop and sell an all purpose single layer software technology which does not need further development, interpretation, or modification. If they did this, they could avoid the second cause. It should not be too hard to develop simple intelligent agents which routinely scour code for bugs, debugging as they go. We already have them for many types of compilers, even for web pages.

Imagine that much of a sytem's population lives in orbiting colonies or on airless moons. These populations' entire air, water, and food processing and distrupution systems are fully automated. When these systems fail, the people starve, suffocate, and die of thirst. When a planetary population lives in hive cities, it is much of the same, and when the food supply is automated hydroponics, or is based on seeds that have suicide genes like the Monsanto IP protection gene, then starvation on planets will happen.

Presumably because a bioweapon that severe will not allow a starship's crew to survive the voyage, so the crew will not be there to respond to hails by the port crews at the end of the trip, so the ship will be destroyed or allowed to cruise on through the system and back into the depths of space.

This is similar to the spread of the Black Plague. while ships helped spread it to other ports within sufficient distance such that only a small percent of the crew succumbed during the voyage, the port authorities at the end of the voyage would often refuse docking to a ship they feared was a plague carrier.

:-) I must admit I had some misgivings about it, because I'm not that
fond of the superhero genre (Moore's _Watchmen_ excluded) for various
intellectual reasons. But sometimes it is fun to admit that you're
childish and enjoy the play. After all, there is no contradiction
between being mature and enjoying "childish" things (as if children
had bad taste!).

(the game system was BTW the second edition, a nice upgrade that
manages to work very well with the style of the game)

The problem is that most of the superheros just "get" these nifty
powers - fall into nuclear reactors, are born mutated or some spacegod
decides to give them superpowers. The IMHO most interesting category
are the "self-made" superheroes, people who start out normal but make
themselves something more. They might not be particularly realistic
(ever noticed that science is almost never done by teams, and that
even the most amazing discoveries never percolate into the market?)
but they are great symbols for self-improvement.

had bad taste!).

(the game system was BTW the second edition, a nice upgrade that
manages to work very well with the style of the game)

The problem is that most of the superheros just "get" these nifty
powers - fall into nuclear reactors, are born mutated or some spacegod
decides to give them superpowers. The IMHO most interesting category
are the "self-made" superheroes, people who start out normal but make
themselves something more. They might not be particularly realistic
(ever noticed that science is almost never done by teams, and that
even the most amazing discoveries never percolate into the market?)
but they are great symbols for self-improvement.

Anyone had a chance to read Freeman Dyson's latest book,
_The Sun, The Genome, and the Internet: Tools of Scientific
Revolutions_?  I wasn't terribly impressed with _Imagined
Worlds_ (though there were some valuable insights from the
old sage amidst all the miscellania).

Because where high bandwidth is possible, more efficient forms of
organization will outcompete any effort to duplicate the galactic
organization on a single planet.  It is similar to the problem of a
civilization optimizing away all its spare room.  The shortsighted
approach always outcompetes.  Civilizations in the Slow Zone are
short-lived for the same reason humans are.

The Qeng Ho are sufficiently distributed in time, and sufficiently small
in crew, that they don't have a "commons problem" - at least, not on
more than one ship at a time.  The Qeng Ho are immortal for the same
reason amoebas are.

Because a star system has fully spread The Plague by the time anyone can
impose effective quarantine measures.  The time between stars is long
enough to eliminate sleeper viruses... either that, or at the time of
the novel, any sleeper viruses are still sleeping.

This question is too ambiguous to be useful.  I would need to know what
percentage of the perceived risk had not been mitigated.  If it was 50%
you die 50% you live, I would decline.  10/90% would be where I start
serious considerations.  The key word here is "perceived risk", but thats
the best we can do.

Article in NY Times

"In a nation of technophiles, where Internet millionaires are minted daily,
it seems heresy to question the economic payoff from information
technology -- the billions upon billions spent each year by companies and
households on everything from computers to software to cell phones.

But for more than a decade, most of the nation's leading economists have
been heretics. They have not been much impressed by the high-tech dogma --
embraced by corporate executives, business school professors and Wall Street
alike -- that regards the transformation of the economy through the magic of
information technology as a self-evident truth...."

Yes, of course.  My view is "static" only in the sense that I think changes

If your goal is reviving cryonicists, I don't know about that.  But if you
can hang on for another 20 or 30 years, *and* if you affiliate yourself
with the right group, it won't be necessary to die at all.  

I think people are reading a lot into my work that isn't there.  I do
anticipate major changes in the coming half century.  We are heading for
one of the great extinction events in the history of this planet, probably
the greatest extinction event in the last 200 million years.  Not many
humans or other organisms will survive.  The darwinian competition will
reach an unprecedented level.  Belief systems of any kind will be literally
fatal.  He who sees reality with unsparing clarity -- and acts on what he
sees -- will survive.  

Dan Fabulich writes,

We agree about that, if nothing else.

I would definitely go to Mars.  At the pace the space organisations are
going at, there will probably be a commercial shuttle/cruiser link to Mars,
before a government sanctioned one.

We have sub-orbital commercial shuttle flights and a Japanese development
contract for a resort on the moon.  It's not long before a cruiser-size
vessel is used to ferry people there and back- there's a demand for
passengers with the financial means to travel into near space, a business
opportunity that's on the ground-floor now.  In 10 years, the space race
will be making more instant millionaires than the internet, today. (To
quote another email which came in through extropians.)

We have the technology and the money, Mars is well within reach as long as
we have the courage.

The Grey Goo is an absurd fantasy, and I treated it with the levity it
deserves.  

Nevertheless, life as we know it is coming to an end.  It's not a question
of what anybody wants or doesn't want.  Once you let the genome out of the
bottle, there is no putting it back.  You just have to deal with it.  

What's happening is that a new life form is emerging.  It isn't going to be
goo, it's just going to be something different.  When oxygen-breathing
cells replaced anaerobic cells as the dominant life form on this planet,
the result wasn't goo.  The result was just the world we live in.  

We do have a choice about what kind of life form we turn into -- that's the
whole point.  Evolution is no longer a matter of chance.  We are entering
the era of self-directed evolution.

Actually, many of the most enduringly popular superheroes fall into the
category you mention. Spiderman, IronMan, Batman, even (debatably) the
Hulk. And of course, one of my personal favorites - Arthur (aka "That
bunny-moth guy"). Almost all *my* created superhero-rpg characters were
"self-made", but that probably has to do with the fact that I did most of
my Champions and GURPS (How could you guys have neglected to mention that
system!) playing while at MIT. The idea of building a powered suit or
modifying one's genetic structure at will came naturally, because you saw
people working on similar projects all the time.

Actually, the Marvel/DC universes are filled with the technology of Iron
Man's original-alter-ego (Drake Industries) and the Fantastic Four's
corporation, for example. But since the writers want to immerse the reader
in a close analog of the actual world, they have to downplay the ubiquity
of this stuff.

Also, although the tales of the Legion of Superheroes are placed centuries
hence, they do group science/engineering and make the results of such work
available to the population at large. There was(is?) a group of MIT
engineers/scientists that called themselves the LoSH and volunteered their
services to do things like help create technology implementation plans for
public schools and the like.

****

It is interesting to note that many of the people with whom I played
supe-rpgs in college are now involved in creating *real-world* super-powers
for humans (usually, however, in the form of improved tools/processes
through advanced engineering). I myself, seem to have been subliminally
most influenced by Star Trek, as I now make part of my living (such as it
is) designing and building tricorder-like devices (aka mobile CCS
(computing/communication/sensing)).

Max M Rasmussen pointed us to:
>Article in NY Times
>http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/04/biztech/articles/14tech.html

        ... Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of
        technology's contribution to the economy, like Solow,
        are having second thoughts. Productivity growth has
        picked up, starting in 1996, capped by a surge in the
        second half of last year, after eight years of economic
        expansion. That has drawn attention because past
        upward swings in productivity typically occurred early
        in a recovery as economic activity rebounded. Once
        companies increased hiring, it slowed again. ...
        The question, posed by economists, is whether the
        higher productivity growth, averaging about 2 percent in
        the last three years, roughly double the pace from 1973
        to 1995, is the long-awaited confirmation that the
        nation's steadily rising investment in computers and
        communications is finally paying off. The evidence is
        starting to point in that direction. 

This is the time to make your predictions, if you want to say 
"I told you so" later.  Is this a blip or the start of a trend?
What will be the average measured productivity growth in 2000 
to 2005?  In 2005 to 2010?  1%? 2%? 3%? 5% 10?  I've said what
I can say at http://hanson.berkeley.edu/longgrow.html .

Template-imprinted nanostructured surfaces for protein recognition

HUAIQIU SHI, WEI-BOR TSAI, MICHAEL D. GARRISON, SANDRO FERRARI & 
BUDDY D.
RATNER

Synthetic materials capable of selectively recognizing proteins are
important in separations, biosensors and the development of
biomedical materials. The technique of molecular imprinting creates
specific recognition sites in polymers by using template
molecules. Molecular recognition is attributed to binding sites that
complement molecules in size, shape and chemical functionality.
But attempts to imprint proteins have met with only limited success. 
Here
we report a method for imprinting surfaces with
protein-recognition sites. We use radio-frequency glow-discharge 
plasma
deposition to form polymeric thin films around proteins
coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become 
covalently
attached to the polymer film, creating
polysaccharide-like cavities that exhibit highly selective 
recognition for
a variety of template proteins, including albumin,
immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and streptavidin. Direct 
imaging
of template recognition is achieved by patterning a
surface at the micrometre scale with imprinted regions.

I really don't understand your position. If extinction for most and the
permanent elimination of death for a few is not big enough to be called
a singularity or a discontinuity in human affaires, then I don't what is.
Death is the most constant framework in all of civilization, if that ends
I don't know what will happen but I do know things will be different,
very very different.

Perhaps the confusion is my fault, I haven't had this little free time in years
and haven't been able to given your web page more that a quick glance.
Anyway, it's nice to see you back on the Extropians list Lyle, you keep things
stirred up and that's healthy.

     It's the ultimate big idea, the source of everything we know about the physical world. And it all comes from one simple question, says Robert Matthews.       
     Where do the laws of physics come from? It's the sort of question only children and geniuses ask--certainly most physicists are far too busy putting the laws to work. 
     Take quantum theory, the laws of the subatomic world. Over the past century it has passed every single test with flying colours, with some predictions vindicated to 10 places of decimals. Not surprisingly, physicists claim quantum theory as one of their greatest triumphs. But behind their boasts lies a guilty secret: they haven't the slightest idea why the laws work, or where they come from. All their vaunted equations are just mathematical lash-ups, made out of bits and pieces from other parts of physics whose main justification is that they seem to work.  Now one physicist thinks he knows where the laws of quantum theory come from. More amazingly still, Roy Frieden thinks he can account for all the laws of physics, governing everything from schoolroom solenoids to space and time. Sounds incredible? You haven't heard the first of it. For Frieden believes he has found the Law of Laws, the principle underpinning physics itself. 
     The laws of electricity, magnetism, gases, fluids, even Newton's laws of motion--all of these, Frieden believes, arise directly from the same basic source: the information gap between what nature knows and what nature is prepared to let us find out. Using sophisticated mathematics, Frieden has shown that this notion of physics as a "quest for information" is no empty philosophical pose. It can be made solid, and leads to a way of deriving all the major laws of fundamental physics--along with some new ones. 
     The sheer power of Frieden's ap-proach is beginning
to catch the eye of other researchers. "The results
already obtained are extremely spectacular and I'm an
enthusiastic supporter," says theorist Peter Hawkes from the CNRS laboratories in Toulouse, France. 
     Unlike most of the mathematical Schwarzeneggers now trying to unify the whole of physics, Frieden does not normally spend his waking hours wrestling with 26-dimensional space-time. As a researcher at the Optical Sciences Center of the University of Arizona, he has an international reputation in the more practical field of optical image enhancement.  In the early 1970s, he pioneered techniques to "clean up" fuzzy images of everything from distant galaxies to stolen car number plates. He was put on the trail of a radical new view of physics while investigating alternative ways of capturing the information content of images. "For years, I had kept in the back of my mind a passage I had read in a textbook on information theory, which talked about something called 'Fisher Information'. Someday, I thought, I was going to investigate that--and now the time was ripe." 
     Named after the Cambridge statistician Ronald Aylmer Fisher in the mid-1920s, Fisher information - usually contracted to I - captures how much information you can squeeze out of a physical system. Suppose you want to know where a gas molecule is. You can try measuring it, but no measurements are perfect--they all come with a certain amount of error. What's more there are inherent "errors" in the system--random disorder,
jitters associated with the temperature of the gas and
the "jolts" caused by the very act of observing, made
famous by quantum theory. All of these errors are
governed by statistical distributions, such as the
famous bell-shaped curve. Plugging these distributions into a formula worked out by Fisher, you end up with a measure of how much information you can extract from a physical system, given all the errors. 
     At first, Frieden simply used Fisher information
calculations as a way of prising more information out of blurry images. But it was while he was reading around the subject that he found himself being pointed in another, more profound, direction. "I came across a 1959 paper by the Dutch mathematician A. J. Stam, who showed that I could be used to derive Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle," recalls Frieden. "And being a physicist, this set me thinking." 
     Studying Stam's work, Frieden noticed that it made
use of a result from information theory called the
Cramer-Rao inequality. This little-known mathematical result shows, roughly speaking, that when the error in a measurement is multiplied by the amount of Fisher information in the measurement, the result is a number that is never less than one.  It's a relationship strikingly similar to the uncertainty principle. Multiply together the uncertainties in your knowledge of a particle's position and its momentum, and the result is never less than a certain value. The more precisely you know the position, the less precisely you can know the momentum. Or put another way, the act of measuring the position influences the measured value of the
momentum - and vice versa. 
     The similarity between the Cramer-Rao inequality
and the uncertainty principle started Frieden wondering whether information - and Fisher information in particular - had a much deeper role in physics. "Since Heisenberg's principle is so basic, it occurred to me that perhaps every physical phenomenon occurs in reaction to measurement--that measurement acts as a kind of catalyst for the effect," says Frieden. "And the possibility that physical laws occur as answers to questions excited my curiosity." 
     Digging into this possibility, Frieden soon found
another mathematical "coincidence". Whenever he did calculations using the Fisher information, the final results were differential equations. "What struck me," he recalls, "is that virtually all of physics can also be expressed in terms of differential equations." 
     Differential equations are formulae showing how the
rate of change of a certain quantity changes under outside influences. For instance, Newton's second law of motion relates the acceleration of an object to the force applied: F = ma. The acceleration in this formula is the rate of change of velocity, which in turn is the rate of change of distance. Quantum theory has its own, more abstract, examples, such as Schrödinger's famous wave equation and Dirac's relativistic equation for the electron. The same format shows up across the whole of physics. 
     Again, it's the kind of observation that is apt to
provoke a shrug of the shoulders. But now Frieden was sure he was on to something really deep. The ubiquity of these types of equation, he believed, is intimately linked to one of the most profound mysteries in science: despite the vast range of phenomena covered by the fundamental laws of physics, all of those laws can be made to drop out of mathematical objects known as Lagrangians. And no one knows why. 
     Put simply, Lagrangians are made up of the
difference between two quantities which together form something called the "action". For reasons as yet utterly mysterious, this quantity stays as small as possible under all circumstances. This curiosity - known as the principle of least action - is reflected in the fact that the fundamental laws of physics are differential equations, since that's what you need to minimise the action. 
     In Newton's laws of motion, for example, the
relevant action turns out to be the difference between
the kinetic energy and the potential energy of a body.
Kinetic energy is the energy associated with how fast
something is moving, and potential energy with its
location. It turns out that to keep the difference
between these two to a minimum, the object's mass times its acceleration always has to equal the force applied. Minimising this particular action leads to Newton's second law of motion.                                                       Beyond Action 
     Theorists are convinced that action must be incredibly important--so much so that the discovery of any new fundamental law prompts a race to work out the particular action needed to produce it. The trouble is that no one understands the principles behind nature's infatuation with action, and so no one can calculate it directly. Instead, they have to reverse-engineer it, working backwards from the newly discovered law.  It is the puzzle of action - and thus the origin of the laws of physics - that Frieden now reckons he has solved. And, he says, it all comes down to information - the information we try to prise from nature by making observations and the information nature has, but is reluctant to part with. 
     If you look at Lagrangians for gravity or
electromagnetism, says Frieden, they all have more or
less the same mathematical form. They are all made up of the difference between I, the Fisher information from observing the phenomenon, and another statistical quantity, J, which is the amount of information bound up in the phenomenon you're trying to measure.  It is from this that Frieden has built his radically new vision of physics based not on the mysterious "action", but on something more intuitive: our attempt to come up with the best possible description of phenomena. All the information needed for such a description exists, in the form of J, and we want as much of it as possible to be extracted by our measurements, in the form of I. In other words, we want the information difference - I minus J - to be as small as possible. And it turns out that for this difference to be as small as possible, the
phenomenon must obey a differential equation. 
     Frieden's information-based methods provide a
stunningly clear interpretation of the laws of physics:
they represent the best we can possibly do in our quest to extract information using our inevitably error-prone methods. "Through the very act of observing, we thus actually define the physics of the thing measured," says Frieden. He adds that while unfamiliar, the idea that "reality"--or, at least, the laws of physics--are created by observation is not new.  During the 18th century, empiricist philosophers such as Bishop Berkeley were raising similar ideas. Much more recently, John Wheeler, a physicist at Princeton University who is widely regarded as one of the deepest thinkers on the foundations of physics, has championed remarkably similar views. "Observer participancy gives rise to information and information gives rise to physics," he says.  That's not to say Frieden's approach implies that the laws of physics are "all in the mind". Rather, it means that any physical attempt to extract information about nature determines the answer we obtain--and the best information we !
can ever extract is what we call the
laws of physics. 
     So Frieden's achievement is to give a philosophical
view of physics a solid mathematical foundation. For any given system, I and J are statistical quantities which can be calculated using Frieden's methods. And the payoff is spectacular: with these two quantities, you can fulfil the 200-year-old dream of deriving the Lagrangian for that system, and thus of deriving the physical law that rules it. 
     Over the past 10 years, in a series of papers in such journals as Physical Review, Frieden and colleagues
including Bernard Soffer of the Hughes Research
Laboratories in Malibu, California, have been steadily
working their way through physics, showing that all of its laws are the result of a kind of cosmic game between ourselves and the "real" world. To derive each law - or, more accurately, each Lagrangian - we have to ask an incredibly simple yet fundamental question, such as "what is the precise location of a particle in space and time?" 
     Any attempt to answer such questions requires the
same two quantities: the information that exists in any
given thing or system, J, and the information we can
acquire, I. Frieden has developed methods of calculating both for a wide range of phenomena in physics.      Subtracting J from I then leads straight to the
appropriate Lagrangian, and when this is made as small as possible, the appropriate law of physics "emerges". No reverse engineering, no fancy use of mathematical tricks, no inspired guesses. 
     Take that question about the precise location of a
particle in space and time. Frieden's approach leads
directly to the Lagrangian for the Klein-Gordon
equation. This is the central law of relativistic
quantum theory which describes the way particles move through space and time. If, on the other hand, you want to know about the location of a particle in space alone, Frieden's approach leads to Schrödinger's wave equation. 
That this one principle can act as a key to unlock the
fundamental laws is impressive enough, but if it really is the key to all physics, it should do more than
reproduce what physicists already know. It should also reveal the secrets of unsolved mysteries.                                  Turbulence Tamed 
     Some researchers are finding that it can. Take
turbulence, the roiling motion of fast-moving fluids
whose understanding Einstein himself regarded as the
biggest challenge to classical physics. In 1996, John
Cocke at the University of Arizona showed that using
Frieden's approach on the question of what is the flow of mass at a particular time and place leads to a law governing the size of density fluctuations in turbulent fluids. This law makes sense of otherwise baffling results from studies of fluid behaviour. 
     The quantum world offers an equally demanding
challenge that has effectively defeated the world's best theorists for decades. Quantum theory - which sees everything in terms of discrete jerks, jumps and packets - just does not sit easily with Einstein's concept of smooth expanses of curved space-time.   Yet Frieden found last year that by asking what space-time like is, he arrives at a Lagrangian which leads straight to the Wheeler-deWitt equation: a formula giving a quantum description of space-time.  The Wheeler-deWitt equation, now more than 30 years old, is one of the few concrete results in quantum gravity theory.  Until now, however, the principles behind Wheeler-deWitt have been far from clear. Frieden's theory not only shows how to derive the
Wheeler-deWitt equation, but also seems to shed light
on what the equation means. Frieden is already examining these clues to see how they may help theorists go beyond the equation to a full-blown theory of quantum gravity. 
     Frieden is still struggling to spread his message
among other theorists, many of whom are reluctant even to study his approach. "Part of the reason is probably simple inertia to learning about a new concept like Fisher information," he says.  But others are more enthusiastic. "Frieden's shown that a host of what used to be regarded as fundamental equations of physics are actually capable of derivation," says Hawkes. Cocke agrees: "It is a sort of unifying principle, and I see it as a method of solving tough problems in statistical physics." 
     Frieden hopes that his new book, which shows in
detail how to apply Fisher information to physical
problems, will help to convince others how powerful his approach is, and encourage them to join in. "What I and my co-workers have done so far is by no means the final word, but it does offer a systematic way to finding laws for new phenomena. And it seems that information is what physics is all about."

If this is the case, then any citizen can arrest government agencies and representatives performing illegal activities and effect criminal judicial proceedings against them.  Note specifically illegal
activities, not legal government activities.

I like the phrase "Posse Commitatus", and in this "Wild West" of today's 15 year old Internet it is an apt one.

I am doing some research,  thomas.loc.gov, and "Posse Comitatus" is named in a current bill modification to section 1385, title 18, United States Code, the Posse Comitatus Act, http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1385.html.  There is also some mention of "Posse Comitatus" somewhere.  Anyways, http://law.house.gov/16.htm, whch leads to several resources, does not have a ready reference to posse comitatus and its legal status.  I am hoping someone here can point me to the actual
legal statement of the existence of posse comitatus.  Anyways, the Posse Comitatus Act is that military forces can't be used to act as the Customs Service and stuff.  It is important that we determine the nature of a citizen group to proceed with formation of a posse as a means towards commencing due process, this is unclear at this point.

So, I think that at this point in our discussion the actual legal status of citizen's arrest and its validity is unclear.  I believe citizen's arrest is not legal in most areas, but again, what we need here are the actual laws on the books and the actual status quo of how they are enforced, which might not necessarily be the same.  If anyone here actually knows the actual legal status of "citizen's arrest" and the right for a citizen to commence criminal proceedings, say so.  A
citizen should be able to commence criminal proceedings just like anyone else, ie, following crimimal procedure laws.   I don't think citizens should or should have to arrest people and enforce laws, that is the job and extent of certain privileges of law enforcement, but they should be able to file a police action just like the police to go to court.

In terms of, upon witnessing a violent criminal act, defending the victim, I think that would be an honorable thing to do, but the law should be that one must try to stop a violent action if its within one's power but not to endanger one to stop a crime which might be unstoppable, and the obligation should be to report it to organized law enforcement.  For this, I am talking about responding to a rape whistle or something, which if possible should be done, not jumping into a brawl in
a bar, which is generally not one's business.

Amendment IX is:

"Amendment IX

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. "

This does not grant the status of a right to privacy explicitly, thus while it might broadly allow rights beyond Constitutional scope, it does not place privacy and the right of determining the disposition of one's personal data vs. the privilege of others disposing of one's personal data as rights.  At which point a certain extent of privacy and personal identity property rights is legally recognized as a right, then Article 9 provides protection.

I think the courts are an option, another is public exposure of un-American government activities, which leads to popular voting and funds disbursement.

Happy day after the day when personal income taxes to fund the government are due!

Personally, when I drive, I like to drive fast.

I am thinking that at some point, we shall have developed a special purpose AI to help us to determine the nature and reality of laws and their interrelations to other laws and actual economic and political activities.  This AI will be able to search all Code and determine more or less what the state is on a variety of actions, and help legislators and inform a very large voting populace, so that democracy can return to its Athenian roots where every citizen has a vote.

I am not a huge reform advocate, because the system appears to be running, but I am a reform advocate, because some things need to be reformed, and we, as citizens, pay for it.

Yes, and this is a problem for us transhumanists because it occurs in
all sorts of settings, not just superhero comics but also movies,
books and serious discussions of the future. In order to make things
look ordinary they downplay or ignore the truly worldchanging stuff -
superheroes doesn't change the world as much as a semi-intelligent
secretary program would. This in turns means that many people who
otherwise would have been stimulated to think more about 'what if'
scenarios instead get the view that nothing really changes
reinforced. So we end up with people who have trouble extrapolating
well, opposing many transhumanist ideas for the wrong reasons (like
believing that life extension by necessity will affect only a few
individuals and not all of society etc). That ought to be changed.

Because the basis of rights here in the US states that ALL rights originate in the people, and only certain ones are enumerated or delegated to the government, then the proper and accepted position on the 9th Amendment is that ANY rights an individual can conceive of, which do not conflict with those already enumerated, are retained by the people. The reason why these sorts of things are not explicitly stated is because the founding fathers could not conceive of the republic becoming ruled by people so stupid as to not understand and beleive in this rather basic concept. They almost did not pass a Bill of Rights because of this view.

Public exposure of un-American government activities only is useful when those activites gore enough peoples sacred cows. The recent 'know your customer' rules that the FDIC tried to put into place, ostensibly to help stem money laundering practices, but actually meant as an evidence gathering device for the IRS to make an end run on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act, were recently pulled thanks to much public outcry against, and no public support of, the proposed rules. I go a note from Senator Bob Smith thanking me for my input on the issue...

The only big reform I am for is that a Constitutional Glossary be enacted, to define the terms used in the constitution, their meanings and usage, as the founding fathers intended. When such an amendment to the Constitution is passed, many of the current attacks on our rights will fall by the wayside rather quickly.

"Know Your Customer" was interpreted quite easily as biblical knowledge, "Screw Your
Customer".  Other industries are not so regulated, so they get quite cozy in knowing their
customers.  We, as paying customers, should know them more and better, as it were.


Of course, many organizations make hugely profitable use of many citizens' personal data
without remunerating them.  This would appear to be some funds that are not being
returned to their rightful owners.


Consumer advocacy is one thing, another is consumer education.  In many cases, there
are well-thought laws on the books that provide adequate measures of recourse for such
petty thefts as occur institutionally, but it is not in the interests of these institutions to make
amends or to make this information available at all.  Thus, these institutions do not make
this consumer protection information readily available, but when pressed, they generally
will acknowledge and serve such items, unless they are some unscrupulous fly-by-night
organization, in which case they are unscrupulous.

Well, legal terms (I am not a lawyer) are mostly founded on the basis of common law.
This is law precedence from five or six hundred years and before to today.  There is also
a legal dictionary, Black's Law, that is generally accepted as definitive.  Here is some:
http://www.alaska.net/~winter/black_law_dictionary.html.  I can not vouch for this listed
web site, or any others, except my own and some other unrelated ones.


The Constitution was framed with the Framers' Intent, which is the subject of
interpretation.  Most rational people interpret the Constitution correctly, as it is a
straightforward document.  There is a large body of work about the Constitution.

What we are discussing is privacy, and above that reform.  In terms of reform, the best
way to motivate, enable, and produce it is through the due democratic process, besides a
PAC and a huge slush fund.  American Democracy, for all its foibles, is still the best form
of government on the planet, in my opinion.  Due to its basic fundamental strengths, I think
it will just get better, and, if anything, Internet convergence has served democracy.

The Internet itself is not a democracy, but it will get there.

Here's to the Bill of Rights!

Now, a moment to say something blatantly unpopular:  blehhhhhhh, Ni!  The, it. One, two, five, ..., three.
Now back to this e-mail.

Cheers,

Ross F.

Hi John, I wondered why you hadn't been heard from.

Good point.  To some extent it's just a matter of semantics.  I should
clarify one thing:  I don't think the whole process will be finished within
a half-century.  It will be well underway by 2050, but it will take a lot
longer to reach a conclusion.  Nevertheless I grant you that on a
geological time scale, a major extinction event and the emergence of a new
phylum (or a new kingdom) could be considered a discontinuity.  However,
what appears from a distance to be discontinuous may appear differently if
you take a closer look at it.  From a delta-epsilon standpoint, there will
be no discontinuity.  In any case, the concept of "the Singularity" is
irrelevant to this discussion. 

I am not saying that there will be a "permanent elimination of death," just
that it will not be *necessary* to die, i.e. our cells will not degenerate.
 That doesn't mean death will be eliminated for the few humans who take the
trouble to incorporate hard technology into their cells.  Far from it.  New
diseases will emerge.  The arms race between humans and microbes will
continue.  Maybe we can evolve faster than they do, maybe not.  The arms
race between different groups of humans will also continue.  Violent death
will always be possible.  In other words, human affairs will go on pretty
much as before.  

In the last 200 years, we have already seen the potential elimination of
death, in the sense that it is no longer necessary for most people to die
young.  This has certainly had a dramatic effect on human society, but the
change has taken place within an unchanging framework.  In the coming
century we will see a further development along the same lines -- it will
no longer be necessary for some people to die at all, at any age.  This too
may have dramatic effects on society, or it may not, but in any case this
too will take place within an unchanging framework.   

Organisms come and go.  On a longer time scale, species come and go.  This
will continue.  As hard life emerges from soft life, organisms will still
eat each other, and on a longer time scale species will still come into
existence and eventually become extinct.  (Think of corporations, which
could be considered the prototype of hard life:  corporations come and go. 
Industries come and go.)  Biological changes, like other changes, will take
place within an unchanging framework. 

Since my original "hard life" post was on the old list (not in the
archives), maybe I should restate what hard life is.  It is possible to
design cells with the following properties:  

1.  They have a richer model of themselves and their environment than
natural cells do, and they can control their own evolution. 
2.  They incorporate new materials, such as teflon, polyethelene, carbon
nanotubes, etc., that natural cells don't have access to.  
3.  They have more powerful sources of energy than natural cells, i.e.
their chloroplasts and mitochondria are more efficient than those in
natural cells.  

This is what I call "hard life."   Hard cells will not completely replace
soft cells (i.e. natural cells), but over time they will relegate soft
cells to a minor position in the ecosystem, like anaerobic bacteria. 
That's the extinction event I am speaking of.  I have no idea how long it
will take, or how it will play out, in detail.

Except as a reflection of the trends we are discussing. Robin Hanson's paper on exponential growth shifts that he posted a link on the other day is IMHO a rather graphic illustration of the sort of thing we are talking about. All prior growth trends tend to cap out as the labor supply the population can meet is reached. The industrial age marked a new exponential trend because new mass production and assembly concepts, as well as rail transportation, multiplied the labor a given amount of the population can provide, but the increase in productivity allowed increases in the population to help soak up the per capita wealth production. Why the coming trend is different is because population curves are leveling off in the countries with the highest technological levels, economic growth, and education levels. With nanotech, we will be seeing an incredible shortening in the economy size doubling rate from a current period of 15 years down to just a few years or less, while at the same time, the population doubling rate is slacking off. This inversion of these two doubling rates (population growth and economic/productivity growth is what spells positively for the type of  'land of plenty' vision that you seem to mock so much in your geniebusters site.

As I've said previously, I think that while a portion of humanity will accelerate at a far faster rate toware 'posthumanity' there will remain a large percentage of the population living 'normal' lives as they see them. There is absolutely no reason to demand that everyone have equal tech capability, especially if they don't want it. If the future is to be a land of plenty, then there is no reason to use force to make sure everyone gets what somebody considers to be everyone's 'fair' share.

Referring to my chart of the s-curve of an observer's perception of 'transhumanity' from the Singularity discussion on Extropy Online, I will say that IMHO, a person on the bleeding edge will be far more likely to consider primitive humans to be included in their perception of 'humanity' than a primitive human is to consider the transhuman being to be 'human', simply because the individual primitive's slope of perception is much less steep than that of a transhuman.

	This is amazing.. KEO (www.keo.org) is sending up a time-capsule satellite
designed to wait 50,000 years, then return to Earth.. and is including with
it many CD-ROMs of messages from people who visit its website.. and it's
free.. this sounds like a great opportunity to put in our thoughts about
the future and messages to our future counterparts... and.. an opportunity
to test an idea I've had for a long time...

	Here's my idea.. perhaps if more people participate, it could work... if
only one did it, they might not listen, but if many did it, it could have a
greater chance of doing *something*..

	Assuming time travel is invented sometime in the future, perhaps within
the next 50,000 years, what would happen if one made an indestructible
message to the inhabitants of the future, who would presumably hold
time-travel technology under their control, asking them to travel back to
OUR time?... assuming time-travel isn't tightly controlled by then, and
assuming they're irresponsible enough to do it (chuckle), we should see
results as soon as we enter the message.. if we see no results, then we can
assume that time travel will be impossible and can forget about trying to
create it.

	Of course, if it *is* possible, but we don't see results within a
timeframe we like, and give up on it, then we've of course negated the
possibility of its existence by believing it to be impossible..

	Fun mental experiment, eh?.. why don't we see if it works?..

	I was just taking a look through the US Space Command's page, and I
happened upon their 'Satellite Boxscore' page
(http://www.spacecom.af.mil/usspace/boxscore.htm)... I was pretty taken
aback by the sheer amount of (known) junk there is out there.. how long is
it going to be before the more-used orbits will be completely inaccessible
due to sheer human messiness?... this could be a serious obstacle to our
development as a space-faring species..

OK but let's say that 50,000 years from now, the geography is so altered
that satellite goes *plop* into the ocean/major fault line/volcano crater.
It's then unrecoverable.  Let's also say that 50,000 yrs from now nobody
knows what a CD is, and labels it a "religious/ritual item" or
"decorative".

What if they invent time travel, no matter what we think, and have gone
back into our time, and are posing as KEO to get free artifacts to bring
with them since currency is no longer used and they can't buy their own
cd's/satellites?  Ow, my head.

An aside on this subject...

Here in Illinois, our state house just voted 114-0 to enact a 'law'
prohibiting any discussion of illegal drugs on the Internet. Seems to me
that I heard something about 'freedom of speech' in this country?

At least this 'law' still needs to be passed by the state senate...

You are talking about the Imperial Republic of Illinois, home of Chicago
"we don't give a sh** about no ***** Constitution" Illinois, and Mayor
"sho me duh munny" Daley. Where they beleive that law abiding citizens
were made to pay taxes, not exercise their rights.

Well, the proposed law as it is engrossed by the Illinois House is HB 0792.

The Internet allows us to view it online:  http://www.legis.state.il.us/.

What this bill states is that it becomes a Class A misdemeanor to propagate
information about cannabis or controlled substances that will lead to the
furtherance of illegal activities.

Thus, any sent information about cannabis or controlled substances becomes
illegal under this proposed law:

"7 ... when he
 8    or she transmits information about a controlled substance  by
 9    the  Internet  knowing  that  the information will be used in
10    furtherance of illegal activity.
"

So, in this case, unlike other laws, ignorance is protection.  So is a
disclaimer "This information is not to be used, and is not known to be
used,  for the furtherance of illegal activity".

This law, in my opinion, is unconstitutional.  It is legislating the intent
of Free Speech, which is unconstitutional.  It is a dumb law.  Other laws
already cover drug trafficking, and they deserve examination at all levels.

This legislation amends two mentioned Acts, the Cannabis Control Act,
http://www.legis.state.il.us/ilcs/ch720/ch720act550.htm, and the Illinois
Controlled Substances Act,
http://www.legis.state.il.us/cgi-bin/AT-il_statssearch.cgi?search=Controlled%20Substances&sp=sp.

"Prohibition."

Of interest is the Illinois Liquor Control Act of 1934,
http://www.legis.state.il.us/ilcs/ch235/ch235act5articles/ch235act5Sub6.htm.
Other Illinois Control Acts, most unrelated to controlled substances:
http://www.legis.state.il.us/cgi-bin/AT-il_statssearch.cgi?sp=sp&search=Control.

Another interesting Illinois House Bill on this subject is the Internet
Privacy Act,
http://www.legis.state.il.us/legisnet/legisnet91/hbgroups/hb/910HB1091.html,
to whit:

"91_HB1091

      New Act
          Creates the Internet Privacy Act.  Contains only a  short
      title provision.
                                                     LRB9103637WHpr
                                               LRB9103637WHpr
 1        AN ACT in relation to Internet privacy.
 2        Be  it  enacted  by  the People of the State of Illinois,
 3    represented in the General Assembly:
 4        Section 1.  Short title.  This Act may be  cited  as  the
 5    Internet Privacy Act."

This would appear to be the extent of the Illinois Internet Privacy Act at
this time, that is, it has no effect.  Perhaps they are still working on
this bill, which deserves much work.  In regards to the subject of this
thread, it will be interesting to see its eventual state.

There is an Illinois bill, and other state bills, having to do with
disposition of State databases, that is, large containers of citizen
information.  This bill,
http://www.legis.state.il.us/legisnet/legisnet91/hbgroups/hb/910HB0069eng.html,
states that commercial purchasers of state databases must disclose their use
and not solicit the citizens whose data is in the database, or use the data
illegally, but that is all.  This still leaves it open for purchasers of
state databases to use citizens' data without their knowledge or consent,
which is a problem.  The government misuses citizens' private personal data,
perhaps they should not hold it, they certainly should not sell it.  Some
data is public, like property records, and should be freely available to any
and all.  Let those that want access to citizens' data purchase a license to
it from the citizens, or not have it.

These are some simplistic examples of one state's laws on the books for this
year.  Illinois is a fine state, as is each state. As a country, we have
more than 200 years of accumulated law, the most part of which is good.  One
of the weaknesses of our legislation through elected representatives is that
some laws are railroaded by the representatives without informing the public
or also against what the public would vote.

It takes an informed, educated, voting populace to ensure fair democracy.

Interesting- but it may be more useful if the protein binding shape
could be milled directly into the metal or plastic surface without
need of a sugar coating (giggle factor, anyone?)

Perhaps ion beam milling could cut appropriate pits into the substrate
by using the sugar casting of the proteins as a mask- the thinner
portions of the mask would ablate away faster and allow etching of the
surface below.

    I have a few questions :

    1> Does anyone know of a way (ethical or unethical - I'm asking
purely for knowledge) to "test" and "prove" whether or not
    there is an existance of a soul that "attaches" to the human body
somehow?

    2>  We've had transplants of all kinds of organs - but we've never
had a brain transplant.  If I were to detach my brain physically
        from myself, and have it attached to something else that it can
communicate with (either another body, a machine that reacts
        to it like a body, etc etc) -- would I have the same
conciousness/be the same person?  (this one may not be obvious).

    3>  Final Question is I remember mentioning "uploading" of a
person's brain as a topic in here -- I will be searching the archives
for
        this information later today (and I apologize for the redundancy
of this message) -- could someone email me some URLs on
        information discussed regarding this topic?.  (uploading : ie:
conversion of the brain cell-by-cell into something mechanical?).

    Thanks alot,

    P.S.    You can direct your replies to either my address or the list
as you desire--Thanks.

Ah...a question I can respond to!

        I assume what you're asking is "is consciousness/identity contained
in the physical brain in such a way that if the brain is transferred, the
consciousness/identity is as well?"  The way I've heard the situation
formulated is that a mad scientist captures you and your best friend and
switches your brains.  Which, if either, would be you?  I'd say that if the
brain remains intact and in all ways the same as it was when it was within
the original body, identity and consciousness follows the brain: i.e., you
would be "in" your friend's body, and your friend would be "in" your body.
However, if the brains was "reprogrammed" so that your physical brain now
contained the same information that your friend's brain previously
contained, and your friend's brain was reconfigured to contain the
information _your_ brain previously contained, then the body containing your
physical brain would possess the identity of your friend, and vice-versa.
Consciousness may not follow, however.  I don't think we can actually know
that unless we ourselves tried it.
        To be derived from the above is the fact that I think that
"identity" follows the information rather than the physical component.  For
instance, in the case in which your friend's brain is reprogrammed to
contain the same information as your brain and then is put in your body, an
outside observer would notice no change whatsoever.  You would act, talk,
etc., just like you did before, and for all practical purposes would be the
same person.  This extends to uploading...if it were possible to upload all
the information in your brain onto a hard drive, then the hard drive would
possess your identity.  (Keep in mind that the information is constantly
changing with experience, so if both continued to exist simultaneously, they
would very soon diverge and become non-identical...the question as to
whether or not the computer would still be "you" becomes fuzzy.) 
        The question of consciousness is obviously far more sticky.  First
of all, I'm not exactly sure how to _define_ consciousness, rather than in
the vague way that it is a continuity of thought and self-identity.  I guess
in practice, consciousness equals "do I wake up after the experience?" but
even that is not terribly specific.  Anyone with a better definition, please
let me know :)
        In some way, the idea of consciousness seems similar to the idea of
a soul in that it's something that remains constant which is beyond the
physical.  As such, I suspect that a lot of people on this list would argue
that there's no such animal :)

P.S.  A word of introduction, since I'm new here...I'm currently a junior at
Yale majoring in philosophy.  Extropianism is fairly new to me...a friend of
mine got me interested in it through an extended discussion concerning
cloning.  I wouldn't define myself as an extropian, but I find the ideas
quite fascinating :)

I think that milling the 3D shape into the surface only provides one of the
necessary ingredients for the _reaction_ to take place. We now have
structural keys and locks, but nothing compelling the keys to try the locks.
Ergo, the sugar.

The question here should be: Is non-propositional , no-ideational 
justification possible.  The problem for PCR (simplifying here for
lack of space) is the underlying acceptance of representationalism -
the view that the mind  is not directly aware of reality but only
of its own contents, the latter  which are called "ideas."  If one
does not accept this claim, then it is possible to justify ideas in
terms of non-ideas, e.g., in terms of sense perceptions.  In fact, 
this is what pancritical rationalists and evolutionary epistemologists
do through  the back door.

In other words, they rail against foundationalism (the view that 
knowledge can and must be grounded), then they go on to accept
sense perception (to some extent; see below) as a foundation.

While I admit conjecture and criticism do extend knowledge, they do 
not justify it - as they are both in need of justification.  Why choose 
these?  Why not choose faith?  Or why not stick with whatever
philosophy has been handed down from your parents or teachers?
If the pancritical rationalist claims that these are not as successful
(and I agree with  her here:), then we must ask how she knows this?
In measuring success along a certain scale, she is already accepting
a foundation outside of "conjecture and criticism" - one outside of
pancritical rationalism!

The alternatives here create too narrow a scope for knowledge.  The
alternatives are not "conjecture and criticism" on the one hand and
deduction on the other.  (Even Popper called his method "hypothetico-
deductive" - meaning hypothesizing a theory then deduce its
consequences and testing these!)  What is forgotten here is 
induction, though evolutionary epistemologists generally believe
induction is impossible.

>The primary criticisms that we use to separate truth from falsehood
>are these: Is the idea logically coherent, or is it self-contradictory?
>Does it contradict reproducible pieces of sensory data? (That is, is
>it empirically feasible?)

On of these "primary criticisms," not "contradict[ing] reproducible 
pieces of sensory data" is foundational!  What's more, it is 
"nonpropositionally justified"!  As I wrote above, the pancritical
rationalist sneaks her  groundings in though the back door.

>But of course, we sometimes have the problem of distinguishing

Again, the pancritical rationalist assumes more than she let's us on 
to.  If everything is "conjecture and criticism," then where do we get
all these methods of criticism?  What makes one method better than
another?  Or why not any method or no method?  The problem is
the same as above: if you know a certain method works, then there
is a reason for this.  One task of epistemology should be not to blindly
accept it, but to find  out why it works.  The pancritical rationalist is
unable to do this without stepping outside of pancritical rationalism
as a methodology (not merely in terms of content; a philosophy
which contained all knowledge would not be a philosophy at all; so
I do not ask any philosophy to do this:).

To give an example, if the pancritical rationalist claims Ockham's 
Razor (i.e., entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity) is better 
than reading tea leaves when deciding between two ideas or theories 
because it gives better results - i.e., theories decided on the former turn 
out to match the facts better and be more coherent than those decided
on the latter, we can see she is accepting correspondence with sense 
perception (and internal coherence) which is a form of nonpropostional 
foundations.  If one does not accept sense perception from the start,
little will  convince one that the theory is better or worse in terms of
sense perception.

My point is not to show that we must embrace skepticism to escape
foundations, but only to illustrate that pancritical rationalism 
cannot answer the skeptic.  I believe other philosophies can answer
the skeptic, but not by limiting themselves to pancritical rationalism.

The problem here is that to accept criticism or criticizability as a 
criterion is still foundationalism.  It is still a form of justification.
That being so, it does not escape the need for justification or
validation - it merely pushes the problem from the foreground.
(I bring up validation here because justification is one means of
validating an idea.  Some ideas are self-evident - such  as the
Axiom of Identity.  We don't accept the axiom of identity because
it works or is justified by appeal to some other idea, but because it 
is presupposed in all knowledge (all ideas and perceptions).  Any 
attempt to deny it also presumes it.)

>In this light, PCR looks like an epistemic bootstrapping scheme.

The problem with this line of reasoning is that the Principle of 
Non-contradiction and the Law of Excluded Middle are corollaries.
And both are corollaries to the Law of Identity.  They are given by
all forms of awareness and implied in all knowledge.  Even PCR
assumes them.  After all, PCR is what it is, and not something else, and
not something else and itself at the same time and  in the same way.
Q.E.D.!

In the end, we wind up with an impoverished methodology - one that
to confute the skeptics surrenders too much and asks too much of
itself, after erasing its own foundations.

Cheers!

Naturally, there are many different plausible definitions for a soul; you'd
have to nail down pretty specifically what you're referring to before you
could verify its existence.

However, I think we can do quite a bit in the way of testing for a soul.
If you think that the soul is a spiritual thing which can affect the
physical world (even if only through our brains) then we should see some
repeatable physical phenomena in the brain or elsewhere which can't be
explained physically.  Any such phenomena would be valid criteria.  The
absence of such phenomena, would disprove the claim that the soul acts on
the physical world, and therefore also disprove the claim that the soul
takes any responsibility in shaping our decisions about how to act.  (If it
did, it would affect how we act.)

What can't be disproved, however, are statements about the soul which have
no effect on the physical world.  For example, suppose the soul were a
perfect analogue to your physical brain, but having no effect whatsoever on
the physical world.  While the brain can't do anything after death, a soul
could, for example, go to paradise.  Could we test for that?  Well,
obviously not.  All of our tests must necessarily be physical; physical
tests can't detect purely spiritual phenomena.

That being said, we normally raise this question in the context of
uploading because people are concerned that if they get uploaded, their
souls won't go with them.  I know of two basic answers to this; one of them
is to say "soul, schmoul; it doesn't exist," and the other is something
like this: we have no evidence whatsoever telling us how/when the soul
enters or leaves the body over the course of a person's lifetime.  Why do
we presume that our soul is with us all the time to begin with?  It may
leave the body whenever we're physicall unconscious, or may only come to us
a few times in our lives.  All of the atoms in our bodies are replaced
dozens of times over the course of a normal lifetime.  With that being
said, do we have any idea whether our soul stays with us after *any* major
physical changes in our bodies?  If not, why get so suspicious about uploading?

Actually...
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/DailyNews/mckenzie_head980427.html

Head transplants have been performed on monkeys.  Presuming that you don't
think your face/skull has anything to do with identity, this would be an
actual test of whether your identity moves with your brain or not.

This may be a question of definitions, however.  Suppose you woke up with
memories of having fallen asleep in your old body and waking up in the one
you're currently in.  Would you consider yourself to be the same person?
There's no obvious reason why you would have to believe yourself to be the
same person; indeed, people today are skeptical about the continuity of
consciousness even WITHOUT undergoing head transplants.  So what would it
prove?  Nothing, really.  This may be one of those questions where there is
no fact of the matter upon which to agree.

The biggest problem is deterioration of the media.  The storage life of CD
media isn't even close to  50,000 years.  Normal aluminum film CDs are only
good for about 100 years and recordable CD media is around 20 (although it
varies widely depending on the type).  The longest lasting ones, gold film
CD masters, will last less than 1,000 years.  

Oh well.  I guess they'll find out the hard way 50,000 years from now.

I consider the question of whether we have "soul" to be a reworded version
of the consciousness debate.  Is consciousness some uncomputable
characteristic of our brains or is it just self-reflexivity within a formal
system?  If the answer is the former then we can begin to entertain notions
of a "soul" (though there is no evidence for the former that I'm aware of).
If the answer is the latter then consciousness is impenetrable and defeats
all attempts to formalize it because of the same reasons Godel showed we
can't extract truth from axiomatic systems.

Decay of CD media is usually due to chemical reactions between the
different layers of the media or with the environment.  Ionizing radiation
is a primary culprit, both directly and indirectly.  

The recordable CDs have organic/metallo-organic recording surfaces that are
by their nature more susceptible to ionizing radiation, heat, and oxidation
than the metal media.  However, the rapidity of decay varies widely
depending on which of the many types of recording surfaces is used, ranging
from 10 to 75 years of useful life with most being around 20-25 years.  

Normal production CDs have an aluminum recording surface.  The aluminum
slowly oxidizes, either by exposure to atmospheric oxygen (it leaks in
along the exposed edges), or from very slow oxidation reactions with the
surrounding media.

Gold film masters have a gold film recording surface that is essentially
impervious to oxidation.  Unfortunately, the polymer media layers
surrounding it (polycarbonates et al) will degrade to the point of ruining
the media over a few hundred years, mostly as a function of exposure to
ionizing radiation.

It would be possible to design a read-only media that could last 100,000
years without degradation, but there is not enough of a market to justify
the cost over current solutions.  Most people are satisfied with media that
will probably outlive them.

My knowledge of this comes from when I worked in the recording industry.
This was and is a big deal, since a huge amount of money is invested in the
information stored on mastering media, and a good master can maintain a
commercial value of some type for a century or more.

Reading over my post, I realized my comments concerning the latter option
were misleading.  If the latter option is the case, i.e., that consciousness
is just a formal system, through sensory facilities, being able to reflect
upon itself, then consciousness is not really "impenetrable".  Instead, it
simply will defy all our attempts to develop a consistent and complete
description of it.  Hofstadter (in _GEB_ and fleshed out more in _The Mind's
I_) describes this entire concept much better than I.  Tor Norretranders
spends an entire book ruminating on the concept in _The User Illusion_.

Additionally, there is a project (based in the Netherlands I believe) that
is exploring the concept of self-reference in AI
 http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/fs-ai.html ).  A member of its team is a rather
bright fellow by the name of Damjan Bojadziev.  He has an interesting paper
entitled "Mind Versus Godel" at http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/g-m-c.html

Actually, the 1400km Earth orbit is the biggest problem.  50,000 years?
Wouldn't last 50 before it was cleared as a "hazard to navigation" or
made into some private collection or museum.

If I were going to do this, I would put it in a 50,000 year cometary orbit
around the sun.  The cold would help preserve it, and there is a lot of
room to hide from treasure hunters, especially if you can keep the orbit
secret.  I would encase it in a faceted stealth type shell that would
sublime away when warmed again by the sun, revealing the nice shiny and
retroflector studded main body.  It could then start sending a SETI style
radio signal (say, a series of prime numbers) to attract attention.
Anyone still around that has a hope of deciphering anything like a CD-ROM
would probably be able to notice and recover it.  If not, well, then it
will be back again for another try in 50,000 years.  If you are clever in
selecting the orbit, you could make it so that, after, say, 5 orbits, it
gives up on anyone finding it in Sol system, and Jupiter kicks it out
towards one of the more interesting areas of the galaxy.

Yep, you would need to use something more durable than a CD-ROM. I think
that preserved DNA of a wide range of creatures would be nice as part of
the "message". And designing a radio that could transmit after 50,000
years is an interesting, but I think doable, challenge.  Anyone have ideas
on how to do *that*?

Patterned gold foil or Pt/Ir foil looks like a fairly good
substitute. With electrochemical proximal probe you can create any
number of pits you like.

You already have good vacuum, why not using a primitive triode-driven 
resonance coil as a simple beakon? Monocrystalline Si, if protected by 
sublimable ice layer should be able to survive that long.

Use a radar corner and it will light up like a flaming beacon to anyone
with active sensors.  I think we can safely assume that anyone capable
of time travel has that kind of technology.  On the other hand, I think
we can safely assume that any civilization capable of time travel isn't
waiting for an engraved invitation from one guy.  The gripping hand is
that it can't possibly hurt.  What the hell, do it.

I've been too busy to read the list much lately but have glanced at some
posts about The Matrix. Today, Natasha and I saw a movie that, while not
having the flash, budget, or promotion of The Matrix, had more of an impact
on me. The movie is October Sky, though it would have been better named
Rocket Boys (the title of the book it was based on).

I found October Sky highly extropic, as well as a well done piece of '50s
Americana. The title comes from the profound effect on the life of a 17
year old boy in a coal-mining town in 1957 of seeing Sputnik passing in the
night sky. He decides that a life in the coal mines is not for him, and
that he's going to build rockets. Many obstacles stand in the way, but
courage, determination, persistence, intelligence, and the good will and
cooperation of others win out. It's based on a true story (if that matters
to you). It's only showing in a couple of places in Los Angeles so catch it
soon, or look for it on video.

No high tech special effects, no famous actors or director, no uploaded
minds, but pretty damn extropic!

Onward!

i want to go on record as saying that the Matrix really, really sucked. I found
that it was totally without any cinematic or cultural merit and I pretty much
fell asleep in the middle of it...
thanks for listening...

Actually, I may have a good low cost solution. The reason the aluminum
degrades is because it is so thin. Ruger has perfected a method of
investment casting an aluminum/aluminum oxide matrix material which is
harder than titanium and is as resistant to oxidation as gemstone
(aluminum oxide is ruby or sapphire?). They are using this material for
their soon to be released line of golf club driver heads.

Cast disks or cards or this material and burn it with either a laser or
electron beam for a long lasting media.

The book got a condescending notice in the Melbourne *Age* this weekend
from hotshot young Oz novelist James Bradley.  Much of what he attributes
to the book is, oddly enough, refuted by the text itself, but I was struck
by one typical component of his review:

" Scientists consistently claim science can answer everything (and
Broderick's enthusiastic barracking for sociobiology is a good example of
the latest attempts to `unify' human knowledge).  But science can't explain
everything.  Not because there are ghosts or spirits or souls, but because
its whole frame of reference excludes much of what we actually worry about.

" Neither atomic analysis of the paint nor any amount of sociobiological
mumbo-jumbo can tell us in any meaningful way why we respond to a da Vinci
the way we do.  Nor, despite the inflated claims of scientists, should we
expect them to: science is a specialised discourse about the physical
world, and notions such as right and wrong, beautiful and repulsive have no
place in this discourse. " (Age Extra, p. 7, 17 April 1999)

There is a number of quite distinct assertions and implications there.  The
most obviously false one, it seems to me, is that `Scientists consistently
claim science can answer everything'.  In my experience, scientists are
very wary about treading outside the limited domain of their specialties.
What exercises Bradley is that a few scientists, away from their benches,
now and then do try to forge large-scale accounts of our experience that
conflict or compete with the accounts traditionally provided by religion,
the arts, `tradition' itself.  Even so, I have never heard of any scientist
who held that atomic analysis of Leonadado's paint would add to our
understanding of aesthetic response.  (Indeed, in my book I specifically
disavow such laughable ambition: `Not even the most optimistic reductionist
has ever supposed, after all, that we interpret Shakespeare best by
assiduously tracking the quantum states of each atom in each copy of
Hamlet, or tallying the alphanumerics in King Lear.')

Sociobiology, of course, was an ambitious program that has been replaced by
a more modest evolutionary psychology, a field I do watch with great
interest for the light its hypotheses seem to cast on human morality, the
substrates of our aesthetic choices, etc.  Its promise is exactly that we
humans *are* part of the `physical world', and subject to formation by
selective pressures.  On the other hand, the levels of explanation salient
to ethics and aesthetics are often detached, in effect, from those
operating on genes.  But the link remains, and it is a harrowing one for
our self-esteem.  Again, as I say in my book: `The only item in Darwinism's
favour is that it's infinitely preferable to believing that some divine
creator deliberately built the vicious ecologies we inhabit. Its
strategies, as Dawkins has eloquently explained, are founded on the single
fact that each of us is the end result of a long line of ancestors, beings
who all successfully passed on their genes. Happily, not every product of
random mutation and natural selection is vile. Such a filter can employ
many strategies and tactics, including love, kindness, generosity, honour,
artistic and scientific genius.'

Which brings me to the topic of a different thread, the question of `soul'.
 It seems to me that science is good at providing satisfactory solutions
only to questions that can be well-framed, questions for which we can hope
to find an answer.  Its starting point might be the one I. I. Rabi blurted
out when he learned of the meson: `Who ordered that?'  That is: what's the
role this phenomenon plays in the wider scheme of things known to us from
all our joint efforts to know and comprehend the world?  So: Who ordered
the soul?  People who were puzzled by the gap between brute, unliving
matter and complex living critters, and by the gap between brute matter and
the rich inward qualia of consciousness.  When some foolish, misguided
positivists tried to rule out subjective qualities in the name of a
sanitized science, they were making a tragic category error that redounds
to the discredit of science to this day.  Which is what my critic has in
the back of his mind.  But increasingly, the public investigative methods
of the sciences *are* approaching an adequate account of how mind is the
brained body in action.  We can't yet explain the allure of the Mona Lisa
(I'd bet learnig to copy the avowed responses of others has a lot to do
with it), but cognitive science and evolutionary psychology offer a better
chance of a good account than gesturing at a supposed `soul' that has no
limits or characteristics distinguishing it from its absence.

Let's define our terms here. When I talk about "grey goo", I am
talking about microscopic, nonbiological, free-living replicators 
hardy enough and prolific enough to pose a threat to most life on 
Earth. Artificial life - out of control - worst-case scenario.
What is so fantastic about that?

Don't forget to store it in a vacuum or noble gas so there is no oxidization.

You may be right.  If so, it would be prudent not to call yourself a
"transhuman."  That's just asking for trouble.  I don't want to be part of
God's Chosen Transhumanity, or the Transhuman Master Race (which are two
sides of the same coin), I just want to be a ridiculously healthy
bodybuilder.  I don't think primitive humans will have a problem with that.

No reason... well, maybe there is no reason.  The world is already a land
of plenty for those who choose to make use of opportunities.  Some people
make other choices, and some people always will.  Why is force being used
in Yugoslavia, Palestine, Kashmir, Tibet, and South Africa?  Why do narks
use force against people who smoke pot?  There are many "reasons" for using
force, and in the future force will still be used for the same "reasons." 
As I browse through the list archives, I find that some people want to be
Powers, and wipe out everybody else; and others say "If YOU get anywhere
close to being a Power, I'll nuke your lab!"  There may be an element of
teenage silliness in this, but grownups play these games too, with real
nukes.  

I don't want to be a Power, but the situation leaves me no choice.  In the
coming decades I intend to build an elaborate bodyguard around myself, to
protect myself from violence of all kinds.  The external immune system is
just as important as the internal immune system.

My experience of poker is much more limited, but it tends to confirm your
experience.  However, poker is basically a waste of time.  It doesn't lead
anywhere, and you can't make real money (hundreds of millions of dollars)
playing poker.  Poker tests your perception of your immediate surroundings,
but the real challenge is to decide which game to play.  That's the real
test of your perception of reality. 

In war, technology and physical skills do have a big impact, and they
depend on planning.  You have to foresee years or decades in advance that
you need technology and physical skills, and get ready for the moment when
those things are needed.  The technology that you bring to the battlefield
reflects your perception of reality.  In business, you have to decide years
or decades in advance which business to go into, and how to prepare for it,
and then implement your plan.  It may be true that even those with fuzzy
minds can make money, but it is also true that a lot of people lose money. 
Extropy.com, for example, is in debt.  There is no money to be made in
propagating memes.  That's the wrong business to go into.  

We are entering the age of memetic competition.  What kind of meme can
create a phenotype around itself that has the strength to survive and
become immortal?  An ism?  A corporation?  or some new kind of meme?

Tell James Bradley that we are coming for him.  ("We", in this case,
being AI researchers.)  We are coming for the Mona Lisa.  We are coming
for music.  We are coming for laughter.  We are coming for love.  It's
only a matter of time.

We all know how love works.  I think I understand laughter.  I am
beginning to have some guesses about music, and even about poetry (such
instances of "joy" or "beauty" seem to have something to do with sexual
selection).  I'm not quite at the Mona Lisa yet, which personally I've
never reacted to at all, but It's Only a Matter of Time.

AI research is a dead end in the short term. Current AI research isn't 
accomplishing anything. Until we have a better understanding of human 
cognition and the brain in general AI is not going to make any significant 
progress. Co-called AI researchers would perform a better service for 
themselves and the AI field if they devoted their time and resources to 
neuroscience.

Think about it. Can anyone point to achievements made in the field of AI in 
the last year? 5 years? 10 years? There are no conceptual achievements. There 
is an illusion of progress, but it is not conceptual. The illusion is created 
by increases in computing power available to AI researchers. Implementing the 
same AI concept on a faster machine yields a more productive result. On the 
surface, it appears progress has been made in the AI field. But, in fact, 
there has been no conceptual progress in some time. AI researchers are 
justing tinkering with faster machines now.

Look at the deities of the AI pantheon, Minsky, Searle, what have they 
produced in the last 5 or 10 or even 20 years? Who has expanded on Turing's 
work? If Turing is the AI field's Newton, where is the Einstein? All I see 
lately is discussions about the limits of computation, club-handed 
discussions of consciousness, and starry-eyed fantasies of Powers. There is a 
disconnect. Where is the transhumanist explanation for lack of AI progress? 
Why don't AI researchers realize they aren't getting *anywhere* until we 
understand the operation of the human mind? And if the transhumanists don't 
even realize this quagmire, who else will?

I haven't been able to follow this thread that closely, Lyle, and just 
yesterday I was saying in a meeting of extropians here in Houston that I 
think your "Geniebusters" web site is worthwhile (if wrong in some respects 
-- I do think you're attacking a straw man in many instances and, yes, I've 
read it.)  But let me offer a comment about "grey goo", nanotechnology and 
threats to Life the Universe and Everything.

The very specific threat discussed a long time ago in sci.nanotech that was 
given the name "grey goo" is but one possible harmful use of molecular-scale 
technology and I express no judgment about its plausibility here.  However, I 
have been convinced by some pretty rigorous reasoning, explained by some 
pretty smart people, that one does NOT need to make a "genie machine" or even 
a "general-purpose assembler" to cause Very Bad Things to happen with 
molecular scale technology.  In fact, I'm so convinced of this that I think 
it's irresponsible to discuss the details of such ideas in an open, public 
forum.  Suffice it to say, Lyle, that a technology capable of causing severe 
destruction on a scale up to and including the level of a planetary ecology 
can be created with molecular technology well short of a general-purpose 
assembler.  Here's a hint: consider the kind of havoc that computer virii can 
cause, even though we're nowhere close to "general-purpose artificial 
intelligence"; all that's required is the capacity for self-replication.

I agree that applying labels to one's self that emphasize one's superiority 
over other people is unwise, generally, but I feel compelled to comment on a 
couple of points here.  First, no one within the transhuman community 
explicitly labels themselves or their aspirations "God's Chosen 
Transhumanity", or the "Transhuman Master Race": These are terms that create 
a negative caricature of the ideas most of us share.  The first emphasizes a 
notion of "predestination" that most of us either explicitly disavow or don't 
see as the primary focus of future human evolution. To the extent that 
transhumanists find it highly likely that some form of life more capable than 
current humans will develop is to do no more than observe the adaptive 
process of evolution in action and project it forward. In any case, it 
injects a theological notion into the discourse that is of course completely 
foreign to our thinking.  The second caricature refers to concepts of mastery 
and evokes Nazi ideology that is, again, utterly foreign to extropian values.

As to the use of the term "transhuman", I agree that it may well connote a 
concept of superiority to many people.  But I do not find that it universally 
evokes the notion of condescension inherent in the exaggerated terms you 
mention.  To the extent that it does, I think it behooves us to work at 
countering such perceptions.

Now, I've certainly considered the idea that it might be better to pursue the 
goals of transhumanism in a stealthy fashion, so that people's fears won't be 
triggered by the perception that some segment of humanity is somehow the 
beneficiary of "unfair" and "unnatural" advantages.  If I believed that 
omnipotent "genie machines" could be developed within my lifetime, overnight, 
by a small group of people working in relative isolation, I might endorse 
such a strategy.  But I know you don't think such a thing is likely, Lyle.  
And neither do I.

As to the reaction of "primitive humans" to being a "ridiculously healthy 
bodybuilder", I believe you can't escape the issue in this way.  From my many 
discussions about these subjects with as broad a cross-section of people as 
I've been able to engage, I find that people who have not embraced the 
concept of transhumanity ultimately "draw the line" at "artificial" 
biological augmentation.  The minute you exhibit visible and obvious signs of 
physical or mental capacity beyond what can be achieved by "natural", 
unaugmented humans, you will have to come to terms with the fear most people 
have of being superseded by some "unfair advantage" and the revulsion most 
people feel at the "unnatural".

In sum, without a community of technically competent people who have at least 
implicitly accepted the goals of transhumanism, how do you hope to have 
access to radical augmentation technologies and, without some work having 
been done to blunt and assuage the widespread fear of such augmentation, how 
do you plan to avoid social prohibitions on augmentation technology?

Without meaning to be overly personalistic, is your goal to become immensely 
wealthy, and then achieve transhuman goals or become posthuman "on your own", 
in secret, while protected by an elaborate security system.  Can you say 
"Fortress of Solitude"?  Seriously, this seems possible, but far less 
probable than achieving these goals in concert with other people who share 
them, and by taking advantage of a wide community of researchers and 
businesses working to develop and provide the benefits of human augmentation 
technology.  From what you write below, I suspect that you think that it is 
not effective to try to build such a community through propagating the ideas 
and values of transhumanism.  While I don't think that simply spreading the 
memes of transhumanism is a sufficient condition for achieving post-human 
status, I do think that working to build understanding and acceptance of 
those ideas and values is at least ONE important step in building and then 
having the benefit of a community of the right kind of people working 
together to achieve those goals.

I'm not a poker player, but I can't help but note that it is, after all, a 
GAME and games aren't a "waste of time" in the sense that 1) play is 
important to the psychological health of any mammal, especially primates 
(and, I suspect, any sentient being) and 2) most games offer at least SOME 
strategic insight beyond their own realm.

Through an odd turn of events, I was exposed for a while to the realm of 
top-level professional poker players.  The highest echelon of these people 
make as much as tens of millions of dollars in their careers.  So, while it's 
certainly not a "good bet" as a career choice :-) and you're right that you 
can't make HUNDREDS of millions of dollars playing poker (unless you get into 
that big game with Bill Gates), it is actually possible to make some pretty 
good dinero playing the game.

I agree with all of that.

Tell that to Ted Turner, Pablo Picasso, Oscar de la Renta, James Cameron or 
Oprah Winfrey . . . well, you get my point.
  
No one expects to get rich propagating transhuman ideas or extropian values, 
per se. (Although it COULD happen, I doubt it's likely any time soon.)  With 
all due respect, Lyle, I think you may be attacking a straw man, but one that 
you aren't the first to attack.  I've encountered expressions of impatience 
with Extropy Institute and this mailing list before to the effect that "This 
is all just TALK!  You people aren't DOING anything!  TALK won't get you 
anywhere!"  Well, to use the vernacular, "duh!"  You don't expect to find 
anything but "talk" on a mailing list, and a non-profit networking 
organization isn't itself the vehicle to develop new technologies or make 
money.  If you drive your car into the water, you shouldn't be surprised if 
it doesn't do a good job as a submarine.

But memetic propagation and networking ARE valuable precursors to profitable 
achievement of transhuman goals.  Just as Tsiolkovsky's, Oberth's and 
Goddard's writing and then networking were necessary elements of a foundation 
for spaceflight (I'll be glad to explain why, if you doubt this), so 
exploring and developing the ideas and values of transhumanism and 
extropianism, and building networks of people who share those ideas and 
values, is also a valuable activity in these early days of augmenting the 
human animal.  It's entirely possible to be a "free rider" in this process, 
Lyle: Even people who don't actively participate in the early stages of 
memetic development and propagation will benefit from those efforts.  The 
networking aspects are a different matter, though: "Going it alone" has its 
disadvantages.

I would answer your question by saying "All of the above."  How would you 
answer it?

You don't necessarily need to understand something in order to clone its
effects. For example, I work in genetics and we don't understand how most
enzymes or genes work. But still we claim to control DNA and we manipulate
it and optimize metabolic processes that no-one really understands. As for
AI, you don't have to clone all neurons to make an artificial brain. All
you need is the information processing power and a way to make that
processing power learn and evolve. There are many possible choices on how
to do that but we still don't have the processing power of a brain. Long
before we understand the human brain there will be AI more intelligent than
us.

Hasta.

Great strides in voice recognition?

Lessee...a coupla years ago some computer-driven vehicles were

10 years? 

Um....optical character recognition.

This is precisely AI researcher Hans Moravec's argument *for* AI.
After all, since great strides were made as soon as processing power
increased slightly (by the standards of the human brain), it would seem
that AI research is on the right track, and that they were too hopeful
that very low processing levels could achieve much.

While AI seems inevitable in short order, I would tend to agree that
the current focus of the field is not going to produce consciousness,
but only great "intelligence".

I disagree; I would substitute "cognitive science" for "neuroscience" in
the sentence above.  We need to work down, not up.  What good does it do
to know how neurons fire?  It's the same basic pattern used by a
chimpanzee, or a cat, or a flatworm.  If we understood the whole mind of
a cat it would be a major advance, this I admit, but understanding
neurology - even on the level of Edelman or Calvin - doesn't really help
when it comes to coding a transhuman AI.  It would take a much higher
level of understanding - solving *in toto*, in fact - before neurology
will be really useful in AI.  Of course, where we really do understand
what individual neurons are doing, like in the visual cortex, that *is*
extremely useful - if you're trying to design a visual cortex. 
Likewise, gross neuroanatomy, or even just knowing that the limbic
system is more evolutionarily ancient than the large frontal lobes, can
also be useful - but only in understanding what parts of a human are
legacy systems that should *not* be duplicated faithfully in the AI.

Cognitive science is where it's at.  Hofstadter and Mitchell's Copycat,
one of the few real advances in the field (although, alas, not a recent
one), was created by observing what real people did when they were
making analogies, and using those observations to deduce what the
sub-elements of analogies were.  They worked down, not up.

I don't know about Einstein, but someday I'd like to be the Drexler.

I freely admit that most of the design in "Coding a Transhuman AI" is
directly derived from introspection, and the rest is derived indirectly.
 But it's also possible to get too caught up in trying to duplicate the
human mind.  The neural-network people, for example, rest their entire
field on the fact that they use the same neurons humans use.  Leaving
aside for a moment the fact that this isn't true, the same could be said
of their using the same atoms.

The accomplishment is not in creating something with a surface
similarity to humanity (classical AI) or that uses the same elements as
humanity (connectionist AI), but in reducing high-level complexity into
the complex interaction of less complex elements.  Both classical AI and
connectionist AI take great pride in claiming to have found the
elements, but they usually toss out the complexity - the elements don't
interact in any interesting way.

What is the problem with modern AI?
I present the following unpublished fragment:
"Waking Up from the Physicist's Dream."

==
The problem with much of previous AI
is that it attempted to prove something rather than build
something, a problem that intersected with the attempt to reduce
cognition to simpler components - rather than to more complex
components, as should have been done.  A programmer does not take
the user's requirements and attempt to prove that they can all arise
from ones and zeroes; a programmer takes the simple but high-level
requirements and works out a complex (but lower-level)
specification.  Programming, in a sense, is the opposite of physics;
physics proves a reduction to simpler components, programming
builds from complex components.  It's the same hierarchy, but a very
different attitude.  Physics focuses on the elements and their rules
of interaction; programming takes the elements for granted and
focuses on extremely complex patterns of elements.  And yet it is the
physical paradigm that dominates AI, whether classical or
connectionist. 

Thus you will see a discourse on emotion which seriously states: 
"The hypothesis is developed that brains are designed around reward
and punishment evaluation systems, because this is the way that
genes can build a complex system that will produce appropriate but
flexible behavior to increase fitness."  This is the hypothesis? 
Bleeding obvious is what it is; the question is how.  (Not only that,
but since the "hypothesis" is true of lizards, human emotions - the
focus of the book in question - are undoubtedly far more
complicated.)  But since the focus is on the elements, one feels safe
in predicting that only very simple combinations of these elements
will be treated. 

"Look at me, I have a neural network!"  "Look at me, I have a Physical
Symbol System!"  These are the basic messages of connectionist and
classical AI, point-missing imitations of the "Look at me, I have a
quark!" physicists.  How many times have you heard:  "This system
uses neural networks, the same system used in the human brain..." 
Big whoop.  It's the same system used by a flatworm's brain.  You
might as well say that it uses the same atoms. 

Reduction to complex elements, as with Copycat's reduction of
analogies to bonds and correspondences, is an entirely legitimate
effort - in fact, it is the focus of this entire site.  It is the art of
reducing object-level complexity to interaction-level complexity -
taking a complex behavior exhibited by a monolithic object, and
showing how some or all of that complexity arises from the
interaction of slightly less complex components.  The focus is on the
interaction, not on the fact that simpler components have been
found.  The high-level complexity is transferred, not destroyed. 

The physical paradigm cares nothing for preserving the complexity of
high-level behavior; the focus is on finding the most fundamental
elements.  It is this attitude that poisons both connectionist and
classical AI.  Is all human behavior explained by the laws of physics
acting on atoms?  Very likely.  Is all human behavior explained by the
statement that "The laws of physics act on atoms"?  No.  We know
that there is a low-level explanation, but we don't know the
explanation.  A proof that an explanation exists is not an explanation. 
The goal of AI must be to find the explanation for human intelligence,
not to prove that it can be explained in terms of ones and zeroes, or
Physical Symbol Systems, or neural networks, or Lord knows what. 

Wake up, I say, from the physicist's dream!  You will never discover
a set of simple elements and a set of simple interactions from which
human thought spontaneously arises with no other programming work
on your part.  Not neural networks, not first-order logic, nothing. 
Nobody would buy this method if you wanted to create a spreadsheet
program.  Why do you think it will work with the infinitely more
complex human mind? 

The high-level complexity arises from the extremely complex
interactions of atoms, not from the atoms themselves.  To build a
system of atoms proves nothing. 

Reduction means "Explain the complexity!", not "Find the basic
elements!"  Reduction has to proceed one level at a time; you must
reduce the human body to organs before you can reduce it to atoms. 
For a physicist to reduce rocks to quarks in one fell swoop would be a
great accomplishment indeed; for an AIer to "reduce" the human mind
to ones and zeroes is useless.  The physical paradigm ignores
high-level complexity; the programmer's paradigm has it as its
object.

The idea that life as it presently exists will be replaced by something
else is not, in itself, fantastic.  However, -- 
 
1. What is fantastic is the image of goo spreading over the planet, eating
everything in its path. Microscopic life won't have an advantage over
large-scale life in the future any more than it does now.  Hard life, like
natural life, will come in all sizes, from microbes to Godzilla, and all
forms, from algae to insects to mammals, plus other forms that have not yet
been thought of.  The ecosystem of the future will be at least as complex
and diverse as the ecosystem of today.  The world isn't going to be any
more gooey in the future than it is now.    

2. The very idea of "nonbiological, free-living replicators" is absurd. 
It is possible to have replicators that use different materials and have
different sources of energy than natural cells, but any free-living
organism that replicates will be "biological" in a general sense.  

Hard life, like natural life, will be constrained by time, space, and
energy; there will still be such a thing as bioenergetics.  Each species
will have its own niche.  There will still be predators and prey, and there
will still be an ongoing arms race between predators and prey, as described
by Dawkins.  There will still be symbiotic relationships and parasitic
relationships between species.  In other words the general form of biology
will remain the same.  The essential difference will be that organisms will
be able to change themselves, like corporations do, instead of depending on
the blind process of natural selection.  

3. Finally, the other fantastic thing about the grey goo scenario is that
it is all supposed to happen overnight.  I wish it were that easy to design
new cells.  I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to redesign my
own cells.  It's a daunting task, and I think it will take decades just to
make the first steps.  Replicators are complex, and that complexity isn't
going to go away.

I'm crunching http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/ right now. Their
premises about the shape of alien signals are questionable, but it
definitely looks more worthwhile than brute-force cryptoattack a la
distributed.net. The Linux code is nice, but it hogs about 10 MBytes
of core. (There is a crontab option to run it during idle hours,
though). The rest of the world can run it as a screenblanker.

Oxytocin may mediate the benefits of positive social interaction and
emotions.

Uvnas-Moberg K
Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm,
Sweden. kerstin.uvnas-moberg@fyka.ki.se

[Medline record in process]


During breastfeeding or suckling, maternal oxytocin levels are raised by
somatosensory stimulation. Oxytocin may, however, also be released by
nonnoxious stimuli such as touch, warm temperature etc. in plasma and in
cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, oxytocin may be involved in physiological
and behavioral effects induced by social interaction in a more general
context. In both male and female rats oxytocin exerts potent physiological
antistress effects. If daily oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day
period, blood pressure is decreased by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to
heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol levels are decreased and insulin and
cholecystokinin levels are increased. These effects last from 1 to several
weeks after the last injection. After repeated oxytocin treatment weight
gain may be promoted and the healing rate of wounds increased. Most
behavioral and physiological effects induced by oxytocin can be blocked by
oxytocin antagonists. In contrast, the antistress effects can not,
suggesting that unidentified oxytocin receptors may exist. The prolonged
latency in the tail-flick test can be temporarily reversed by administration
of naloxone, suggesting that endogenous opioid activity has been increased
by the oxytocin injections. In contrast, the long-term lowering of blood
pressure and of cortisol levels as well as the sedative effects of oxytocin
have been found to be related to an increased activity of central alpha
2-adrenoceptors. Positive social interactions have been related to
health-promoting effects. Oxytocin released in response to social stimuli
may be part of a neuroendocrine substrate which underlies the benefits of
positive social experiences. Such processes may in addition explain the
health-promoting effects of certain alternative therapies. Because of the
special properties of oxytocin, including the fact that it can become
conditioned to psychological state or imagery, oxytocin may also mediate the
benefits attributed to therapies such as hypnosis or meditation.

For years I've used "Dance of the Planets" as a valuable amateur astronomy 
reference tool and astronomy software toy, but sadly, the author of this 
piece of software stopped updating it some years ago.  Likewise, I enjoyed 
playing around with Microsoft's "Space Simulator", and was disappointed that 
it wasn't commercially successful enough to support further development.  So 
I'm wondering what recommendations folks on the list might have for 
top-quality current-generation astronomy and space simulation software.

Hmm... Perhaps you're right.  Let's imagine this scenario:

=

THE SCENE:  Deep in the laboratories of the Singularity Emergency
Response Team.

Mitchell Porter came running in, waving an email.  "Zyvex has had a
little accident, and grey goo has eaten three major cities!  What will
we do?"

Eliezer Yudkowsky sighed, shaking his head.  "I knew it.  Well, so much
for this planet.  Another warning ignored, only to be proved right all
too late."  He took out a little book and added a tally mark.

"Quick, let's launch the emergency Mars evacuation vehicle!" cried den
Otter.  Suiting actions to words, he dashed into the one-man vehicle and
took off.

"Let's use the anti-grey-goo nuclear weapons!" cried one person.  "No,
the blue goo!"  "The active immune systems!"  Conversation in the room
quickly threatened to degenerate into chaos.

"Wait!" cried Lyle Burkhead.  All conversation instantly hushed, as the
room turned toward the one man who had not spoken.

"If the goo replicates..." he said slowly, his immense forehead bulging
from the effort of cogitation, "IT MUST BE ALIVE!  It's *biological*!"

Immense excitement ensued.  Robin Hanson dashed over to the case marked
"Open In Emergency Only", took the mallet, smashed the glass case, and
reverently lifted out the Webster's English Dictionary.  "Yes!  He's right!"

"And look!" cried Anders Sandburg, pointing at the monitors.  "The goo,
being biological, can't eat our facility and condemn us all to horrible,
agonizing deaths!  We're saved!"

=

Then again, perhaps not.

Yes; submarines might be more of a problem if the population was not
kept down by the submarine-eating denizens of the deep.

Says you.  It could just as well happen after a decade.  Straw man.

I just finished reading it - very enlightening, thankyou Damien! In
fact, it's how I found out about transhumanism, then extropians, then
this list.

I especially loved the chapter about Black Holists, mostly for the tone
of the discussion. I'm not usually one for wholesale bagging of people,
but when the execution is so artful...

----


Actually, I'll ask an unrelated question of people at this point. 

I decided quite a while ago that I would like to live a bit longer than
three score and ten. I was convinced that science will be able to
deliver this before it becomes an issue for me. Then I found out about
Damien's book, because I'd been using the same phrase (last mortal
generation), and someone pointed me to the book.

I have found that this has occupied my thoughts more and more, and so my
conversation. In fact, I'm probably becoming an immortality bore. The
problem I have is, that when I'm blabbing away about living in the last
generation of mortals or the first generation of immortals, depending on
luck basically (and a lot of people's hard work, sorry to all you out
there), I suddenly get quite embarrased if I'm talking to or am nearby
an elderly person.

How, after all, can it sound? I'm in my late twenties, and talking about
how it's a travesty that people die, a pointless waste, and a violation
of human rights which must be rectified, probably in the later half of
next century, so I'll have to hang on tooth&nail to life until my
mortality problem can be fixed up. Blah blah blah, I'm sure many of us
go on with the same stuff.

How insulting is this to a person of, say, 80 years? Really, I'm writing
them of, as part of the doomed past, so near and yet so far. It makes me
feel like a heel, and yet my opinions about immortality (I love the
loaded words) has not changed. 

What does one do? Keep it to oneself? Go on regardless? Tell such a
person "Sorry you are going to die, bummer eh"?

What do other list members think about this? I'd be *especially*
interested in the opinions of older members.

This is the very chapter that most offended James Bradley in his *Age*
review, who found it evidence of a `deep-seated intellectual intolerance'.
Of New Age drivel?  Yessir, your Honor, guilty as charged!

I feel that way, too, but there's an option for the old - not a very good
one yet, I suspect, but it's there: cryonic suspension.  And if they don't
know about it because nobody's bothered to inform them, they'll die
permanently.  What a waste.  (That said, I'm not signed up for freezing
myself.  Shocking evasion.)

I'm a comparatively old fart, and my sister is married to a guy in his 70s.
 The sooner we decrepit old dogs shake a leg and insist on work being done
in longevity and cryostasis research, the better chance everyone will have
of living a decent length of time, like at least a few thousand years.
Being embarrassed to raise the topic isn't going to make death go away.

I personally would either a) not mentioning the i-word in the presense 
of the elderly, or, b) if that person can afford it, would outline the 
basics of cryonics (even if chances of it working are currently small).

Actually, if you go by Lyle's argument, the grey goo will sit on its ass
and refuse to do anything until we give it a paycheck to do so, so we
are protected by our unwillingness to pay for such a huge contracting
job. Talk about project creep...

Neither of these options seem very palatable. Pretending it's not
happening just means you shut people out - I know that I don't like
other people to stop talking when I enter a room.

If people have read any Larry Niven, then they're probably as hesitant
as I am about the corpsicle option. I don't even know if Australia has
any cryonics facilities.

It's not suprising that you don't sign up for cryonics - I wonder if
anyone on this list actually has? It's like setting up your gravesite.
While many people actually do buy plots of land, etc, just for that
purpose, I'd be VERY suprised if people on this list are amongst their
number. 

No-one here is overly interested in dying, when it comes down to it, and
cryonics is about dying+hope.

1)  It is now too late to save my great-grandparents, even though most
of them were alive when I was born.  But all four of my grandparents are
still alive, and I think I have a fairly good chance of pulling off a
Singularity in time to save them.

2)  Two words:  Time travel.

3)  One word:  Cryonics.

Two questions, for all those who like a debate:

1: In some sense humans have been augmented since the first person
belted someone about the chops with a bit of bone, some hundreds of
thousands of years ago. Ever since then, we rely on our civilisation and
our technology to achieve what we do, and to be who we are. We are not
the same people without it.

Given this (doesn't that come easily!), what is transhumanism? How is a
transhuman not merely a human (albeit further augmented). I suspect that
the impulses that drive us technologically forward, and which are
particularly pronounced in the posts to the Extropians list, to use
technology to make magic, are entirely human, and will remain no-matter
what we do to ourselves in the future.

2: Some people seem to have an idea that life-extension will propagate
out to everybody, regardless of colour or creed, or the size of his/her
bank account. Please justify this! Life extension seems particularly
prone to being a haven for the wealthy, as I see it, because it is bound
to be expensive for a long time. Actually, I find that I can't justify
that statement, so please shoot it down.

I am not a good faithful believer in capitalism, and I've never been
very interested in making money for its own sake. Now I'm thinking that
accumulating wealth may actually be incredibly important, if I'm going
to live for some ridiculous span of time (and I am, you know).

Does anyone think I'll be getting life-extension under government health
cover?

I'm going to take the unusual step of replying to my own post, and
disavowing it.  

I have written some things in the last couple of days that I was not
entirely serious about.  They were trial balloons.  There are some ideas
that go through my mind from time to time.  I wanted to see how they would
look if they were written down and posted on the list.  Now I know how they
look.  I'm not too happy with them. 

Last night I wrote,
> I don't want to be a Power, but the situation leaves me no choice. 

Well, of course it does.  The other choice is to get on with my life. 
Nobody's going to nuke my lab.  What balderdash.

These questions are unreal.  I can survive anyway.  I don't need a meme.  I
don't need a Project.  Making biotechnology into a meme attracts the wrong
kind of attention and skews my judgment.  Ever since I wrote that post, I
have felt disoriented.  

Biotechnology is moving right along.  All I need to do is make sure I am in
a position to use cell repair techniques as they become available, i.e. I
need to have contacts in the field and enough money to pay for the
procedures.  That's not a big deal.

For those whose MINDS have been memetically inoculated against such reasoned pessimism by extropianism and/or transhumanism, I suggest that WHAT COMPUTERS STILL CAN'T DO by Hubert Dreyfuss might purge the antibodies from your cognitive systems.

What happens if we do get time-travel, and we can live forever?
What if we have a society which regards death as the greatest tragedy?

Will we go back and save all the people who died? Everyone?

And if not, why not?

If there is no cryonics outfit within a few hours operation window
(have you checked with CryoNet?) in your area then you might as well 
organize and found one. Current protocols are really lousy, and there 
won't be any better ones if there is no further funding. Imho,
currently there are few things as important as nanotechnology and
cryonics research.

It's interesting how quickly the grey-gooers can write off natural life,
as if we would be able to invent stuff which could get out of control
and kill it all off overnight. Biological life is pretty hardy - how
long would it be before bacteria or insects or something developed which
could feed on the alleged goo? After all, it would probably be made out
of similar stuff to natural life, given that it lives in the same
environment and has the same resources available.

How quickly would natural life develop, which could outcompete the
hard-life, and to whose presence the hard-life could not adapt? This is
especially likely if the hard life was some heavily tuned soft-life
eater, because it would have to be so specific that it would have
trouble adapting to new environments.

I'm not talking about technical details of cryonics, that's whatever it
is, and that's great.

Waking up is the problem. Under what circumstance would you be woken?
What motivations would lead a society to bring you back? What will
governments do with your corpsicle in the meantime?

I would really recommend reading "A world out of time" as a start (by
LN), if you are considering cryonics. Just as a scary bedtime story, or
because you like good SF, if nothing else.

But if you want to know the technical details of implementing cryonics,
then try somebody else.

Emlyn:
    Your first question is just semantics.  How do you define a new species?
Textbook definition would be when it can no longer breed with the original
species.  I don't think this will quite apply to the future of human
evolution.  I don't think you will able to define the point at which a
physical subgroup is formed until well after it has already happened.  For
now, transhuman is just a statement of philosophical identity.

    Your second question is something I think about nearly every day.
Initially, the techniques necessary to extend life may be limited to the
very wealthy, but market forces being what they are, I think prices would
rapidly fall once established.  Biological techniques are notoriously easy
to copy once the correct protocols are identified.  People will demand to
have the product, even if they have to put themselves in debt for eternity
(literally) to get it.  Accumulating wealth is probably a good idea is any
case though.  I'm not particularly materialistic, but wealth is one of the
most valuable tools for survival - it allows you breathing room in times of
crisis.

    The government is probably the least likely source to ever fund these
techniques.  On the contrary, if we are to achieve the goal of reversing
aging, one of the biggest roadblocks will be the regulatory agencies of big
government.  Government vested interests are in maintaining order. These
techniques, once perfected, will cause one of the most radical shifts in
culture humanity has ever seen - not something any government will look
forward to with glee.

    Your earlier question is something I struggle with constantly as well.
I feel we are within 10-15 years of a first stage breakthrough in halting
aging.  I have grandparents in their 70's who I am very close to.  They are
very progressive for people of their generation, so I have been trying to
gently suggest cryonics.  I don't think it is the best option, but for now,
it is the only one.  Vitrification techniques announced this year are
tremendously better than anything that has been used so far - the neural
tissue preservation was nearly perfect in rabbits.  I'm am very optimistic
about the likelihood of reconstruction if you have good structural
preservation.

Absolutely! Mars, no question. Space, the final frontier, these are the
voyages, etc. I've always wanted to go into space, and I would
definitely go to that Japanese resort on the moon.

Except...

Except I'm not colonist material. I'm a flabby office worker, software
developer, the garden around my house is an untended jungle. If I was
dropped in the wilderness with only my wits to aid me, then I would die.
I get edgy if the supermarket is closed on public holidays.

Mars is a hostile environment for humans. No doubt there are ways of
taming it, but the initial colonies wont be waving a magic wand and
*BLAM*, DisneyWorld!

Mars would need paranoid survivalists, smart enough to adapt, scientists
maybe, but not the sort of people who missed their creature comforts.
They'd need to work well in groups, be happy with no privacy, and have a
high boredom threshold. Farmers? Military people? Engineers? I don't
know.

How about the trip over? How long could you handle being cooped up in a
tiny capsule with all those colonists?

I think you'd need the kind of people who managed to explore the Earth
in tiny boats a few centuries ago. In fact, you'd be well off travelling
back and getting them, because their better proven in this kind of work
than anyone today. Maybe a solo round-the-world yachtsperson might be
good, but then they probably like their privacy. How about the people on
the Kontiki (spelling questionable)?

Plus, long distance colonies can fail, which means everyone dies. There
are examples of that in Australia's recent (200 years) history, with
attempts to establish a foothold ending up in an empty buildings and a
few bleached bones. Not a good concept for those of us wanting life
extension.

All power to the mars expedition! My best thoughts go with you, my best
wishes for your success. You are assured to continue in human memory as
the greatest of people.

I'll watch it on CNN, and cheer!

It will very likely be made out of diamond, or similar materials.  I am
unaware that any natural lifeform is able to use diamond as raw material,
and it seems unlikely that any would develop, given that diamond has 
already existed for some time. :)

1)  The only chance they have is cryonics.
2)  Be aware that even if you commit to making an effort to save them, you
will fail to convince the great majority of them.

But I am compelled to comment further:

Gene Leitl wrote:

"even if chances of it [cryonics] working are currently small."

I agree with Jeff Davis who states that reanimation for cryonic suspendees
is an almost certainty...eventually.   It should be added that important
advances have been made recently in the efficacy of cryoprotectants that
significantly reduce fracturing thanks to 21st Century Medicine, and further
advances are on the near horizon.

and Emlyn wrote:

"It's not suprising that you don't sign up for cryonics - I wonder if

While many people actually do buy plots of land, etc, just for that

number.

No-one here is overly interested in dying, when it comes down to it, and
cryonics is about dying+hope."

Yes, Emlyn.  Be surprised.  Be very surprised.  There are a number of
individuals signed up for cryonic suspension because they believe it is a
highly rational option.  I fail to appreciate your analogies.  It is *not*
like buying a plot of ground in which I will decay and be irreversibly lost,
and cryonics is not about dying+hope.  Cryonicists do not believe that a
person is truly dead until the structure of the brain is irreversibly
degraded.  For us, the choice is unbelieveably simple:  die and rot or be
frozen and wait for technology to reanimate you.  If something happens to
prevent your reanimation (you're accidently defrosted), what exactly have
you lost?  I recommend you read a bit more on the subject by perusing the
web sites of cryonics firms, and the archives of the Cryonet mailing list.

Last time I looked human technology could kill off the bulk of life
pretty efficiently, with the lingering exception of a certain bipedal
primate (but we're working on it).

Bacteria and insects don't evolve rapidly enough to be able to
metabolize novel structures as graphenes, diamond, sapphire and
silicates while they are being busily eaten alive. The autoreplicating 
nanomachines themselves could evolve as rapidly as viruses, or
faster.

Species cannot sustainably occupy the same niche while having only slight
differences in fitness. The probabily of the new machines on the block 
having the same fitness as biological life is nil, especially
considering the fact that their niche is very broad indeed.

One of the critical factors of a robust gray goo autoreplicator is its 
ability to evolve rapidly.

The autoreplicator creates and maintains its inner inert
environment. Since evolution is open-ended, and a successfull design
will have robust evolvability its adaptability is unpredictable.

That's a pity. The current product is unfortunately not that good that one can 
buy it unseen. Thus informed choices are always better.

I thought _dying_ was the main problem. Which circumstances? Any. If I 
don't like, I can always commit suicide. What motivations? I don't
care, as long as I am reanimated. (If I'm not reanimated, I don't
really care either: I'm a really cool customer, since sitting in a
dewar). Goverments? I hope they won't have much say in the issue.

Point is, the odds are incalculable. I might as well live. If I'm
dead, I'm dead. That's an irreversible decision.

Scary? So what. I can think of a billion scary scenarios. Who says
they'll come true?

I know of what you speak here. The debate on the Singularity that
occurred here several months ago, that you can read at extropy online,
covered quite a bit of that.

a) cryonic suspension is affordable today to college students, and the
amount they pay now as part of insurance plans pays for their eventual
revival, so that part of life extension we know for a fact is affordable
to the average person today.

b) we are getting the handle on actual immortality with things like the
telomere research that is ongoing. Once a cure for old age is developed,
it will be a matter of getting injected with a designed and bred virus
or a cocktail of viruses that will do the genetic modifications you need
to become immortal. The cost will only be in the R&D needed to attain
that ability, which any nation is free to subsidize as they see fit. The
major savings that a government can see with giving immortality to
everyone (real immortality with forever young bodies), is that they no
longer need to justify the funding of social security, medicaid, and
medicare plans (as we call them here), and nationalized health care
systems will see reduced costs as well leading to a reduction in the tax
burden on working people (actually, since people will be immortal, they
will be able to work if they want to forever, so the tax burden will
also be spread around more). Note that the last five years of your life
(old age) consumes more medical resources than the rest of your life
combined, on average.

Fortunately, with capitalism, you can take advantage of high interest
earnings of growth industries to fund retirement at whatever level you
wish to attain.

I think that the government in many countries will probably only offer
to pay for it for someone who agrees to be sterilized, as a means of
population growth control. This is the primary threat to popular use of
immortality technology, is that the powers that be (any every tree
hugger you see) will jump to the conclusion that we will have immediate
overpopulation as a result...

True, advances has been made, and the development still continues. The 
main impetus of 21CM's research is not directed towards reducing 
fracturing though: that can be trivially solved by storing neuros at 
-130 C, e.g. in a lab freezer. 21CM is working on robust vitrification 
cum low cryoprotectant toxicity. No available protocol currently
utilizes these advances -- please observe the occurance of "currently" 
in above quote.  So if you'd happen to be dying now, that's tough
luck. Let's hope things will improve, and quickly.

Emlyn, I have not yet signed up for cryonics, but would do so in a heartbeat

aargghh, I don't think I'll get to use cryonics because I'm getting
cremated here.

I didn't express myself overly well, sorry for wasting everyone's time.

What I meant was that, psychologically, cryonics feels like arranging
your own funeral. I support using cryonics, I think its a good last
option, but to actually address it in your life must be like arranging
your own burial site.

Or is it like getting life insurance?

OK, suddenly I've been transformed into an immortal being spanning the
universe.

Actually, it wasn't sudden, it took a couple of thousand years, but
that's trivia compared to the vast expanses of time stretching out
before me (and behind me and in all kinds of other directions, because I
time travel and dimension walk and commune with ancient gods, who did
exist after all but just weren't very useful).

Now my mind is the surface of a Dyson sphere (kind of crinkly to
maximise surface area), and I have probes and comets and planetoids and
all kinds of vehicles with all kinds of sensors and tools so that I can
juggle quarks or stars, depending on whether I'm feeling introverted or
extroverted.

But sometimes I'm not discovering new multiverses, rebuilding random
universes from parts, or ruminating on new theories of existence.
Sometimes I'm not off in pursuit of ultimate Truth and Enlightenment.

How do I veg? Just hang out, waste time, relax a little maybe, but
really just be a blob (no, not grey goo)?

Maybe muck around with a little border war in an unused galaxy with
another transhuman floating around somewhere (I think territory might be
an issue actually). Travel back in time and watch "General Hospital"
(what an obscene use for time travel). Pop a few planets into my matter
conversion system, just to pass the time (can a transhuman get fat?)

Anyone got good ideas on Pointless Passtimes for Transhumans, or what a
dyson sphere entity does when he/she feels like a nice cup of tea?

Maybe they send e-mail...

Yep, I would too, I think, though I've never actually had cancer, so I
can't say for sure.

But my point is, that you haven't done it yet. Really, one should, in
case of sudden accident, so that someone can scrape you up, pop you in
the fridge, and the cryonics people can haul you off in good time, ready
for the future. We'd all kick ourselves if we hadn't (except we'd be
dead). But still I'm not signed up, and you're not signed up.

Yet I suspect that some list members actually are signed up. That's
excellently proactive, and you'll probably be laughing at the rest of
us. 

Just one tip - apparently you should take a big coat and maybe a space
heater in with you, because its really cold in there.

Me, well, the flames keep me warm.

Much more like getting life insurance. Failing to do so is insuring that
you WILL have a funeral, which is kind of a morbid type of laziness.
Now, making up invitations to your own suspension celebration ahead of
time I think indicates you may need to talk to someone...

Actually, I have one. As a veteran, that is one of my benefits....too

Can you always commit suicide? If you've been awakened by an evil future
government that wants to do evil things with the smart brains of the
people who were smart enough to get themselves cryonically suspended,
you're not going to get an off button I'd think. Future governments
might indeed find a use for good working minds in "corpses" (ie:
redefining corpsicles as dead, so not accorded the rights of the
living). You know governments...

I would like to apologise for the message below, it is cretinous.

My only excuse is that my mind is distributed, parallel, and that my
concept of self is an illusion. In actual fact, there are lots of
different little mental modules humming away, and different ones run the
show at different times. The module that wrote that post also governs my
entire (not unsubstantial) body of knowledge concerning Melrose Place.

I have an application with Alcor almost complete, but I need to get
one more set of documents notarized, pay an extra fee for dawdling,
and get an insurance policy.  After all the close calls I've had, I
figured it was past time to take care of it...

I reply:

I just turned thirty, and although these kind's of issues are (I 
hope) not in momentary consideration for me, I have given it thought. 
If the advancing technologies of the future do not aide me in the 
prevention of death or extension of life, I will prepare not a 
gravesite, but a trust in the intellect of man. I will approach 
cryonics. With the awareness that I have in science I doubt I will 
have to deal with this choice, (if all goes well inbetween the 
natural lifespan) but will choose cronics, and will have a better 
chance then the guy who bought a plot in the dirt.

Supersymmetric string theory, especally in the late-'90s version `second
revolution' form
developed by Edward Witten and colleagues, looks set to combine
quantumfield theory and Relativity handily and without vexatious
contradictions. A very fine new book (I recommend it) is THE
ELEGANT UNIVERSE, by Briane Greene (Jonathan Cape British hc, 1999).  It's
the best popular and accessible treatment of superstring theory I've seen.
The new and very powerful M-Theory, as everyone here surely knows, neatly
combines Type I, Type II B, Type II A, Heterotic-O(32) and Heterotic-E8xE8
string theories as variants, along with 11-D Supergravity, of a single
general membrane theory of fundamental particles and forces. 

You all thought no-one would ever fit them together!  Ha!  Think again,
cynics!  Anyone who hopes to say anything intelligible and interesting
about the basic laws of spacetime, circa 1999 model, could usefully read
this book.  Your next dinner party could be spiced up with amusing remarks
about the Euler values of variant Calabi-Yau spaces, and Orbifolds in a
high-order Kaluza-Klein manifold.
Dazzle your friends!  More hilarious than tachyons!  More plausible than
twistors!  

And it's given me some very cute ideas for sf stories, which is what's
*really* important about science, of course.  (There's no Big Crunch, for
starters, even if the universe turns out to be contracting after all -
strings provide a bounce at the Planck scale.  And any description of a
closed dimensional space that's very large and expanding is also just as
legitimately described as very small and contracting - read the kyou
doubters - which leads me to wonder if a syllogismobile might get us from
here to someway far off by a mirror translation into a transform where
everything is *already* close together.)

Absolutely.  And a waste of resources - we've spent a lot of money
getting the stuff up there we might as well try and use it, rather than
let it float around endangering shipping.

Any ideas?

 I'd say continue to spread the word.
Even the elderly have options that they can exercise.
At 50 myself I believe I'm still in the running, while _true_
immortality may be several decades off (I personally think we'll see it
sooner) life extension is moving along very nicely.
Barring unfortunate accidents I expect to have _many_, very good, years
to go.
An aside, back in my 30s I kept telling people that I wasn't in any
hurry (I had just returned to school, the beginning of my current
career) since I had only reached 10% of my expected life span anyway.

This being said, I am 31 and I have not signed up for cryonic suspension. My rationalization for this act of pure laziness and/or stinginess is that according to the stats, if I die in the next two decades it is most likely to be something which leaves my brain in a useless state, and anything else that happens is likely to give me plenty of a heads up that I will have time to sign up for suspension before it kills me. Cryonics is a last ditch option, which IMHO is most likely to be used by the oldsters on the list than the youngsters. Caveat: I will probably sign up sometime in the next ten years anyways if I wind up having a wife and kids that will make it much more worthwhile to come back to.

Now, if anyone can disabuse me of my current rationalizations...I would appreciate it...

Welcome to the list Emlyn, you might enjoy reading the Mars trilogy
of Kim Stanley Robinson (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars).

As to not being colonist material, you could become colonist
material by adopting a good diet, state of the art
vitamin/antioxident protocol, and plenty of exercise.

These will serve you well just being on this planet (you are
already a colonist, spaceship earth remember...).

The first step to preparing people for colonizing Mars should be setting up a training camp dedicated to the purpose in Antarctica.

My cousin, who just returned from there a month or so ago, tells me that he's now qualified to apply for the Mars mission team NASA is exploring putting together. All he needs is the actual astronaut training. As a geologist specializing in ice age hydrogeology, he's a primary candidate for exploring the Mars polar caps and figuring out the best way to melt them down...

My rationalization for this act of pure laziness and/or stinginess is that
according to the stats, if I die in the next two decades it is most likely
to be something which leaves my brain in a useless state, and anything else
that happens is likely to give me plenty of a heads up that I will have time
to sign up for suspension before it kills me. Cryonics is a last ditch
option, which IMHO is most likely to be used by the oldsters on the list
than the youngsters. Caveat: I will probably sign up sometime in the next

I was 13 years old when I was diagnosed with acute lympocytic leukemia. It
can happen to anyone, at anytime. I am now 28, and have been signed up for
suspension since I was 23 or so. My husband, Billy is also signed up (he's
32).

That being said, from what I know of medical statistics (which probably
isn't as much as you know, Mike, since you know so much ;-)) what is most
likely to kill you in the next couple of decades is heart disease. I don't
see how this has to leave your brain in a useless state. Neither does
prostate cancer, another killer of men.

I am not a member of Cryocare (I'm signed on with Alcor), but from my
understanding their organization does not currently accept members above a
certain age, so if you wanted to go with them you would have to do it soon
(it may already be too late).

The more members a cryonics organization has, the stronger it is, and the
more likely it will be that the organization will exist ten or twenty years
from now when you need it.

A final reason to sign up now is that it doesn't cost that much money to be
signed up, so you don't have much to lose. Weigh that against the fact that
it might be harder for you to get life insurance to pay for suspension as
you get older.

I, for one, would like to see you in the future:-)

If you die and you are not suspended, you can _never_ be returned to life.
If you awake in some fantasically horrible evil awful situation, but you
_remain_ alive, there is always a chance, no matter how small, that you can
get out of it.

Are you serious?  From what I remember of Extro3, the wrists of
its participants had more Alcor bracelets than watches.  One of
the highlights of the event was Drexler presenting Minsky with
his.  Cryonicists may be a tiny group of folks in the population
as a whole, but half of them are probably on this list.

 A decade ago it seemed implausible to me that search engines, mailing lists,
or my favorite OS would ever be free. So I'm rather skeptical of appeals to
intuition about what services will cost decades from now.

 Drexler assumes that with sufficient cpu power, creating an AI is
easy enough that someone will probably make one available as open source,
and the cost of creating new intelligence by copying one is near zero.
This implies that if the price of intelligence is set by supply and demand,
it will be roughly equal to the price of the required cpu/ram/disk resources.

 There's no trend towards AI, you say? (Or at least no Moore's Law style
trend?). It's hard to tell whether that's true, or whether it implies much
if true. There has been some clear progress in vision and speech recognition
software produced by Moore's Law. Does that represent the kind of progress
needed to produce AI around the time that Moore's Law gets us to atomic
precision? Or do we already know most of what's needed for AI, but simply
lack the hardware for it to be worthwhile completing an AI (the way it
wouldn't have been worthwhile building a spreadsheet or browser in 1965)?
 I don't see how to be confident of the answers to these questions.
 I can certainly imagine ways to produce digital intelligence that wouldn't
be expected to show any trend yet. Drexler estimates that nanotech will
produce enough cpu power that a simulation of the evolutionary processes
that produced humans would take about 2 years. Or scanning a human brain
and emulating it in software without needing to understand much more than
how to simulate a neuron.

You can't notice the absence of something which doesn't leave.  This is the
sum of your self-awareness.  The brain has a host of complicated funcitons,
but to assume the brain possesses consciousness is making the same mistake
as in the dark ages when the heart was believed to hold the soul,  The
opposite is probably more true:  the soul posesses your brain, heart and
body, discarding it when times up, but cohesive and valid.  No one now,
knows how long before birth your soul posesses integrity, or for how long
after death.  In some cases, the identity, the presence of someone's soul
affects the phsyical to communicate fleetingly with someone.

We should perhaps understand the process of consciosness transference, by
not only understanding and replicating the functions of the human body, and
brain, but of opening our eyes to the real possibility that until we
understand the basis of sentience, we can't expect uploading to fulfill our
hopes that when the brain is moved, the self-awareness goes with it.

This is like telling someone who has irreversible brain damage that if they
use fetal cells to replace damaged tissue, they are going to "take on"
another un-born identity, and nobody's sure which one will be top dog in
the person's mind.  At one time, it was feared that transplanted tissues
would retain enough of the chemistry at the time of death to transmit
signals to the recipients nervous system.  This is unfounded, and so is the
idea of moving the brain to move the identity.

Someone should try it with mice, train one to do something until it's
mastered the trick.  Train another to do the opposite trick (ie. to hit one
button out of two for food, and vice-versa).  Switch their little brains
and after they recover (if they recover) have them stimulated the same way
to perform the trick, and see which one does what- or if they just sit
there scratching themselves because stitches are itchy.  (Which would be
expected if the neural responses are limited to bodily function, and not to
conciousness or memory transference.)

Until someone finds a way to have the soul disproven by all the
technological verve we can toss at it, or until they prove that rats brains
contain memory and self-awareness when transferred, I'm sticking with the
idea of a soul.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it is scientifically
impossible to prove a negative, only a contradicting positive. IE, I can't
prove that God doesn't exist; the responsibility falls on those who say
otherwise to prove that he does. So, you'll have to wait for the rat
experiments <g>.

I agree.  Jocelyn and I saw the movie a few weeks ago, and we both loved it.
Its the first movie I've seen in ages where science (and engineering, and
the hard work that go with them) are portrayed as good things, and the 'good
guys' are actually optimistic about the future.

When I was sick with leukemia, I had plenty of time to sit around and see
what if felt like to plan my own funeral. Having been in that situation, I
can, without a doubt, proclaim that mailing in my suspension agreement felt
_nothing_ at all like that. It felt like I was taking as positive and
proactive a step as possible to ensure my immortality.

Death is ugly; death is unpleasant; death is a horrible thing. But running
around thinking "it can't happen to me because I'm young and healthly" is
not the solution. Problems must be faced, for only then can they be dealt
with. And if that means truly accepting the fact that one might die no
matter what one does, then that has to be done, because the next step is
doing whatever one can to ensure that death does _not_ happen, and cryonics
is simply one of those steps.

Tamara,  are you saying that lab rats have souls?
And also, as I am sure others willpoint out, it is impossible to prove
a negative. Sorry.

Of course before you could prove that an uploaded human has no self-awareness
and therefore their 'soul' was lost in the transfer, you'd have to prove that
a meat human has self-awareness.

Cool...... Kim Stanley Robinson spent I believe a year in Antartica
(visiting artist) after which he wrote his novel of the same name.
He also used the year in Antartica as a trial for the crew in the
Mar's trilogy.

My rationalization for this act of pure laziness and/or stinginess is that
according to the stats, if I die in the next two decades it is most likely
to be something which leaves my brain in a useless state, and anything else
that happens is likely to give me plenty of a heads up that I will have time
to sign up for suspension before it kills me. Cryonics is a last ditch
option, which IMHO is most likely to be used by the oldsters on the list
than the youngsters. Caveat: I will probably sign up sometime in the next
ten years anyways if I wind up having a wife and kids that will make it much
more worthwhile to come back to.

I would only suggest that you maintain a life insurance policy that would be
sufficient to pay for cryopreservation, keeping in mind that prices may
increase as different and more effective protocols are developed (one reason
to sign up now).  But if something happens that prevents you from increasing
your coverage (e.g. heart attack) then you may be stuck.  It's true that the
average cryonicist is older than most, but the young are poor planners in
general when it comes to life-long goals (e.g. insurance, retirement, etc).
It's just difficult for them to appreciate the need to plan on the next 60
years when they only have twenty under their belt.  Since you mention a
possible future spouse/partner and your possible desire to return to them,
that brings up some potentially thorny issues, doesn't it?

How long do you all think marriages will last in a world where everyone is
ageless.  I know I'm not going to let the preacher include, "Till death do
us part." in the vows.  I suspect that the average marriage in the future
would last for a shorter period of time than it does today.  To be blunt and
insensitive, I think that many people stay in a relatively loveless
relationship as they get older because they feel there are no other options.
Well, there'll be plenty of options if you're not aging.  Plus, time changes
everyone, so the more time...the more change...the further apart you are
likely to grow.  I don't see anything wrong with this.  When it comes to
*shoulds*, I only believe that couples *should* try to maintain respectful,
commited, and hopefully loving relationships until their children are grown.
Even though lots of very psychologically healthy kids have grown up in a
single-parent houselhold, my experience suggests that two parents provide
greater levels of support and stability (getting off topic, now).

Another thorny cryonics issue is the benficiary issue.  Spouses can easily
become upset with the idea that you've established a cryonics firm as the
beneficiary of your life insurance policy instead of the family.  Ideally,
you could maintain two policies, but what if you only had the resources to
maintain one policy?  Who would the beneficiary be?  OK, now consider this
analogy:  You've been told by your doctors that your only chance to live
requires an experimental medical procedure costing over $100,000 and with a
10% chance of success.  Would your spouse insist that you *not* have the
operation so that the family could have the money?  Would you agree or would
you fight for your life?

While I am a bit overweight for my age, I have below normal blood pressure, a low metabolic rate, and normal cholesterol levels. I get occasional exercise (once or twice a week). According to the risk factor scales, I am of low risk for heart disease, especially since the only member of my family who suffered from or died from heart disease was a two packs a day smoker. Because of this, I consider heart disease to not be a sudden or near term problem for me.

I do have a history of procrastination, which tells me I need to get off my duff. I've been toying with the idea for a year or so now.

Yes, its always a trade off, evaluating the high value short term gains against discounting long term gains to calculate their present day value.

Why thank you. I'm trying my best at the moment to get there in one piece and in as favorable a position as possible. I refuse to be immortal and homeless....;)

I think that such a camp could be a profitable venture. How many people would pay good money to become qualified to be a Mars Colonist Candidate? The only problem is if they would let you have a private camp like that there, considering the restrictions on commercial exploitation of the continent. You'd have to get affiliated with a University that already has a presence, give them a cut of the profits, etc....

its more a matter of whether there is family down the timeline or not. I'm rather close to siblings, cousins, and parents, but I'm the only one interested in cryo, so the idea of not knowing or being related to  anyone once I get to the future is kind of a downer.

Excellent questions. First off, I don't expect to wind up marrying anyone who does not share or is open to my extropian views/principles, etc. I'm still single, as such women are few and far between up here in upstate NH. If and when I do meet such a person and if a long term relationship is developed, I personally would not hold them to any commitment longer than that required to raise any children to adulthood, though I do demand and require that sort of commitment as a minimum from anyone I would give a commitment to in return. My own parents are hitting their sixties and are still married (going on 34 years of marriage), and my grandparents are also still married (the one with both members are still alive), so I don't see long term commitments as being that difficult for people who have integrity to maintain. (I'm sure not living in California also has a big thing to do with it...;)  )

IMHO, the divorce rate in today's society is more a matter of how much ideas such as honor, honesty, loyalty, and integrity have been devalued, and not with a person's true ability to maintain a long term relationship. Marriages that last 30 or 40 years are usually only ended by the death of a spouse, not by divorce. I will bet that anyone who becomes immortal and gets married and can maintain a marriage for more than 20 or 30 years will likely be married for at least a few centuries therafter.

In my generation, of all my siblings and cousins (3 siblings and 4 cousins of this generation) and myself, there have been only two marriages so far (one divorced after 7 years with no kids), and one child. Our ages range from 24-33. We typically have rather high standards.

Back to the cryo issue, since most estimates put the projected Singularity as sometime between 2020 and 2035, and since nobody in my family has died prior to age 65 in over a century, I still consider myself in good shape without a cryo policy. The odds say I will attain immortality long before I am at risk of death by anything other than an accident involving brain trauma.

I was thinking more along the lines of what has classically been referred
to as the "soul" as being quantifiable.  There hasn't been an attempt to
actually measure one, using sensitive emf field detectors, ultra low or
high frequency sound, light in the non-visible spectrum.  I propose that
however it's quantified, it may prove to be a resource in terms of
conciousness transference, and reanimation.  There may be an associated
field of mass and energy that binds our life to our bodies.

If that wasn't likely, electrical defibrillators would not resuscitate
people.  How many people wonder how that really works?  We see the
mechanical procedure, and don't question the results.  Electrical pulses
contract muscles, they operate implanted computer chips in the brains of
paraplegics so they can use their mental focus as a mouse (one of the first
publicized human-computer interfaces).  There are a lot of applications for
these areas of study.  Someone studying human/computer interfaces 10 years
ago probably heard the ol' standby you can't disprove a negative- because
no such thing had ever been done, and the majority of people out there
would have told him his theory was bunk, or would take two hundred years to
develop- so why bother?

I don't want to drag up the deity arguments (or lack).  I'm merely saying
that just because people have attached theological significance to a
concept, dosesn't mean there isn't a grain of truth under all the ritual
hoopla.  It may be as mundane a few years from now that people have a soul
of sorts (for lack of a better word) as it is to accept now, that we
generate a weak and somewhat erratic electro-magnetic field.  At least
exploring the option would leave memes better equipped for quality of life
if it was tagged for transfer as well.

Sometimes I'm given to thinking out loud, and voice something I feel will
invite lots of criticism, because I want to hear the why-nots, so I can
check my thoughts against them.  I don't mind the feedback, just please
don't flame me for being a fringe-dwelling TH (if the fringe of the fringe
will still patiently reject/accept my wierd ideas, the good and the odd).

Of course before you could prove that an uploaded human has no
self-awareness
and therefore their 'soul' was lost in the transfer, you'd have to prove
that
a meat human has self-awareness.

I just thought of one possible restraint on Singularity type growth: Procrastination.

As more people become immortal, at the edge of the Singularity, the amount of procrastination which occurs in society will amplify at exponential rates, leading to a major braking effect on growth of all kinds.

Comments?

The counterbalancing effect to this is ego.  No matter how rich
everyone in society becomes, even if every person now on the
streets of Calcutta could easily retire to a large house and have
all the free time and recreation ey wanted, ey would still want
to work and create and build so that ey could be just a little
bit richer than eir neighbor.

And of course every specialist in each field of endeavor will
still want to be the first to accomplish some feat or other.

That is possible, but you don't see nearly as much initiative being taken by those with a free ride versus those without. There will be those whose source of motivation will not be materially based, much like those rich gents who kept trying to circle the globe in a balloon, but I know far more individuals who have inherited their wealth and are idle than are active and driven.

Actually, when I signed up for cryonic susupension my
expereince of the psychological dimension was something of a
rush.  It was probably similar to the feeling expereinced by
those who joined the American Communist Party back in the
1920's - a  twinge of excitement at having associated
yourself with a tiny group who shares a radical vision.

But that excitement fades, since cryonicists share little
else in common with  early communists.  No one assigned me a
contact person, or asked me to perform subversive acts of
psychological terrorism against the establishment.  Cryonics
(and transhumanism in general) does not have the qualities
of the mass movements of old, since it does not ask its
memebers  to submerge their identities into a 'cause' which
is greater then themselves.  Instead, the cause is ourselves
: it is an ethic centered around self-preservation and
enhancement.

But still, I would maintain that signing up for cryonics is
one of the most important acts that many of us on this list
can do to help advance transhumanism in the world.  Being a
signed-up suspension member with a cryonics outfit is, to
use the old expression, putting your money where your mouth
is.  It's easy to spout transhuman memes to your friends,
but filling out that dreadful paperwork and arranging a life
insurance contract demonstrates a willingness for some kind
of lasting personal committment to the extropian
weltanshauung. [and yes Emlyn, that part of the sign-up
feels exactly like doing annoying paperwork :) ]

Call it a symbolic act.  For many of us on this list,
'symbolic' would be the only way to look at is, since I know
a number of people are relatively certain that they'll never
need to resort to the ice to extend their own lives long
enough to  become post-humans.

Ignoring the holes in that reasoning, join a cryonics
organization just to get that little bracelet that you can
wag in people's faces to show how radical you are.  And to
show them that transhumanism isn't just a bunch of talk.

You've just described me in a nutshell - I won't have to wait for the singularity for this to occur!  I've optimized my life for minimum effort to maintain my basic needs, and spend the rest of the time reading, learning and playing.  The result being that as I grow older, I find myself working fewer and fewer hours for the same result financially.  Many people would do this if they could.

However, those who continue to work hard will stay way out ahead in influence, money and power, as always.  My question would be, "Can an individual experience a personal rate of technological growth that outstrips, is decoupled from, the rate of growth in society at large?"  Can money buy a faster rate of growth, or does it just buy you the best tech that is available at this time?

As all material things become more like software, I think it boils down to: can the best technology remain proprietary, or will it all leak into the public domain?  If one can keep the latest developments proprietary, I think we'd see individuals and groups experiencing their own personal singularities, and the mass of humanity lagging behind, happy with their easy life.

And diamond and corundum take a fair bit of energy to chemically manipulate.
What's powering this goo?

John Walker's "Home Planet" is pretty fine for what it is (freeware Win
amateur astronomy app).

Joe-Mike says check out the Index Librorum Liberorum at
http://www.fourmilab.to/ (the USA mirror) 
or http://fourmilab.ch/ (the Swiss site). Besides the stuff mentioned on
the home page, you can 
click on the sidebar "Astronomy and Space" entry. Kewl.

Excerpts taken from the site:

Orbits in Strongly Curved Spacetime

An interactive Java applet which illustrates how orbits around compact
objects such as
neutron stars and black holes depart drastically from Kepler's laws, and
explains why.
Source code for the applet is available. 

Solar System Live

Solar System Live, an interactive orrery for the Web, lets you view the
solar system in
a variety of ways for any date between 4713 B.C. and A.D. 8000. An
ephemeris can
be displayed for any location on Earth and, given orbital elements in the
form published
in the IAU Circulars, the orbit and position of asteroids and comets can be
plotted. 

Your Sky

Your Sky makes custom maps of the sky for any location on Earth and any
date from
4713 B.C. into the distant future. Maps can include stars as faint as
magnitude 6.5,
constellation names, outlines, and boundaries, the Moon and planets, deep
sky objects
from a database of more than 500, and a comet or asteroid whose position is
calculated from its orbital elements. A variety of display options allow
customising the
map for its intended use. 

The Oh-My-God Particle (paper)

On October 15th, 1991 a proton with an energy of 3×1020 electron volts slammed
into in the Earth's atmosphere. Let's crunch some numbers.... A performance
comparison with 24th century Galaxy Class starship technology is presented. 

Inconstant Moon

Inconstant Moon explores a universally seen but seldom observed phenomenon:
the
different appearance of the Moon at perigee and apogee. 

C-ship

The only reason Einstein's special theory of relativity seems weird to
those learning it is
that the velocities we're familiar with are such a tiny fraction of the
speed of light we've
never had a chance to gain an intuitive sense of relativistic effects. If
the speed of light
were 100 kilometres per hour, footballers would have no trouble dealing with
relativistic goal shots. C-ship uses computer image synthesis to put you
aboard a
starship entirely consistent with the laws of physics and lets you look out
the window
to experience special relativity with your own eyes.

I think it's more like a week, or two. Faster, if the autoreplicators
have more efficient spreading mechanisms (air currents, hydrogen
filled cavities, random periods of inactivity allowing them to cling 
to insects and birds).

Actually, I am sure that I have seen this done with Axolotls (because
they heal well?) on a tv doco or science program or something (some
moons hence), one trained and one untrained, and the behavior did indeed
go with the brain. Quite astounding, and even more astounding that one
could actually train an Axolotl (I can't remember what it was trained to
do, but it wasn't very impressive as I recall).

But who can tell if the little amphibian "soul" went with it, or whether
the trained one suddenly thought "Hey, how did I do that thing again",
and the untrained one went "Wow, I just thought of something, look at
this mum!".

As I recall, the brain transfer looked like scooping the brain out with
a spoon, and popping it in the other head like so much jelly - it didn't
look too sophisticated. But they were wearing white lab coats, so it
must be true.

I am positive that I didn't just dream this up... has someone seen
something similar?

Although I salute procrastination (or will, when I get around to it),
being an avid, proactive, some might say obsessive practitioner of that
gentle art, I would think that you would get a more extreme effect from
conservatism.

If you are a mere mortal, and you want to make it big, be rich and
famous, and all that, then you can be motivated to do so, push hard,
full ahead and damn the torpedoes, burn out rather than fade away.

But if you are not going to fade away... well, then those torpedoes are
more of an issue. If you are going to live, say, 10,000 years (as are
most of your contemporaries), and someone says "Hey, we finally invented
nano-technology, whew, that was difficult", you might look at the pros
and cons and say, "Hmm, the benefits are fabulous, but there is an
outside chance that we might get eaten by grey goo sometime, and over
ten thousand years that chance gets real big. Lets sweep that under the
carpet, thanks very much, and have another cup of tea. 

You would expect this behavior to increase, in fact, over the extent of
all of our (fantastically long) life times, because the people who take
risk will eventually luck out and cop it in a big way, while the idle
rich & eternal meander along at an extremely civilised pace,
pooh-poohing change and getting ever more stale and dull.

Inevitably, the decision is always going to be between "Do we do this
now, or ruminate on it for a couple of hundred years, and have another
talk about it after that". 

Possibly the best thing one can do for immortals is to put immediate
threats into their environment regularly, to shake them up a bit. But
who's going to be brave enough, and where can they hide afterwards?

I'll stop before I talk myself out of living forever. Oh, and if you do
live for ever and find out someone is stuffing things around for no
discernable reason, IT'S NOT ME, OK? Long lives, long memories, ouch.

Actually, Billy and I both enjoyed Contact. The ending was kind of hokey,
but we loved Ellie.

And as far as I can see, I've never flamed anyone, so don't be so

I think a lot of people stay in loveless relationships as they get older
because they think "what the hell, one of us will die soon enough".
Which leads to the same kind of dilemma in the context of agelessness,
and I wonder how people will resolve it.

Similarly with jobs. I think that a lot of people work their 40+ years
in a career happy to know that it will come to an end in some imaginable
period of time: I'd say a lot of (or most) people don't like their
career, or to put it another way, if they were idependently wealthy,
they'd stop working. Try telling them that they're ageless now, and the
retirement age has moved to 400, or 800, or 100,000, or never. 

Hopefully they'll quit, and do something interesting. Go surfing? Start
building Transhuman AIs?

There are some excellent, and very difficult changes to come from
extended life.

To which Eliezer Yudkowsky replied, in one of the most amazing 
non sequiturs to appear on the list in a long time -- at least in the last
couple of hours -- 

> I'm so glad to know that submarines will never outswim fish. 

What on earth is this in reference to?  

Hard life will, as I have said repeatedly, have an advantage over soft
life.  However, microscopic hard life won't have an advantage over
large-scale hard life any more than bacteria have an advantage over
mammals.  Hard life will come in all sizes, from microbes to submarines. 
An ecosystem of hard organisms won't be any more gooey than an ecosystem of
natural organisms.

Eliezer created a hilarious skit in which the punch line is

When it comes to satire, I'm afraid I am outgunned.  There is no use trying
to compete with such deadly wit.  But leaving humor aside, let's try to
find the logic in this.  

Mitchell Porter used the word "nonbiological" to mean that the hypothetical
new organisms will be mechanical, unlike the organisms that exist in
nature.  My point was that even if the new organisms are nonbiological in
that sense, they still must be biological in a more general sense.  There
will be an entire ecology of mechanical replicators.  They will eat each
other, reproduce, evolve, and in general play the same roles in their
ecosystem that natural organisms play in the present ecosystem.  This
doesn't imply that they won't be a threat to natural life.  Far from it.

To which Eliezer responded

If there were predatory submarines, then there would indeed be
submarine-eating denizens of the deep, i.e. other submarines.  They would
eat each other.  They would also be subject to attack by smaller a-life
creatures.  Microscopic a-life creatures ("goo") would be more interested
in attacking submarines than in attacking us. In other words, the submarine
population would be kept in check just like the population of any other
organism is kept in check.  

I wrote

Eliezer interrupted at this point and said

> Straw man. Nobody specified overnight.

The word "overnight" is a figure of speech, meaning "suddenly."  My
understanding of the goo scenario is that even if it takes a decade to
start, once it does start it is supposed to happen very quickly indeed. 
The goo is going to "eat our facility and condemn us all to horrible,
agonizing deaths!"  That scenario is fantastic, and the word "overnight" is
not out of place in describing it.  Nor is the word "overnight" out of
place in describing a scenario in which an entire new kind of life is
designed and built in a decade.   

There are two distinct questions concerning the speed of the goo process: 
(1) Whether a-life will be ready to shrink wrap in a decade or so, and (2)
how quickly it will spread once it gets started.  The calibration principle
can be applied to both of these questions.  

My statement continued,

Here I am trying to get a handle on question #1 above, by considering the
difficulty I have had in redesigning my own cells.  Ignoring this, Eliezer
chose to focus on the word "overnight."  So who's attacking a straw man? 
Instead of taking the word "overnight" literally, why don't you reply to
the statement "Replicators are complex, and that complexity isn't going to
go away"? 


Let's reframe the question.  Consider corporations to be a form of a-life,
and look at what is happening in the Amazonian rain forest, and other rain
forests.  The natural ecosystem is being destroyed by artificial organisms
with chain saws, and it can't defend itself.  It doesn't even know it is
being attacked -- which is the whole problem.  Corporations are aware of
themselves and their environment, and they can make plans.  Rain forests
are not aware of themselves and their environment, and they can't make
plans.  Therefore they are being cut to pieces.  This is happening most
conspicuously to rain forests, but the same thing is happening to the
entire natural ecosystem.  This is the real goo problem.  It has already
started.  It will continue.  We are caught in the middle -- we are part of
the natural ecosystem, but we are also at the center of corporations.  Our
role is ambiguous, and it will continue to be ambiguous.  As Pogo would
say:  We have met the goo and it is us.

Gee, thanks for the hint.  I'll tell all my hacker friends that a whole new
realm of fun is out there just waiting to be explored.  Never mind hacking
computer systems, now we can hack the planetary ecosystem!  

Seriously, I agree that it would be possible to cause severe destruction
with artificial viruses.  That proposition is not what I am arguing
against, either in this thread or in Geniebusters.  

As for discussing it openly, I think any hacker who can attempt such a
thing can figure out how to do it by himself.  

If they really start doing this, God help us all.

In a relationship of this nature, one would hope the other's partner 
would be a willing participant of this sort of action also 
(cryonics). If not at least respect your choice to do so. I mean were 
talking about people who love eachother here right? On that same 
note, as for the question "would I not have the operation so my 
family could have the money or fight for my life". Hell yeah I'd 
fight for my life, and if they loved me, they would want me to. 
Better have me alive and be broke then me dead and rich.

Why is that, Mike?  In some cases, the person might know the date
of suspension, such as sufferers of cancer or especially emphysema.
That might be a cool thing: invite all the local extropians and cryonicists
in for a last big party, then get on with the old LN2 bath.  spike

Many, just not necessarily practical ones.  The problem is
that everything is in different orbits.  No one has figured out
how to use a chunk of debris that flies past every once in
a long while at several thousand meters per second.  I had
a notion at one time of trying to modify the orbit of a piece
of a comet, to place it into earth orbit, then use this large
chunk of ice to capture bits of orbitting debris.  Turns out
this approach is no more practical than the other ideas.  spike

Scott this is a *prime* example of a situation where you might want to
call in the friends and family for a last party, then take your chances with
the deep freeze.  I would rather try that route.  Unless I had en extra 100k
to blow, then I guess you could try both.

The point you raise is an important one if cryonics becomes common.  It
is too easy to imagine a situation where the family is gathered around
one's bedside saying: Grampa, you are old, you are sick, all your friends
are either dead or dying.  Take a cold bath, leave us your money, since
we all need it so badly, and wake up when life is better.

You might not really be ready for such a step, but the pressure might
still be there, even if not expressed.  Lawmakers might try to argue
this scenario to outlaw cryonics.   {8-[  spike

There are security problems that will have to be considered in lue of 
new technology, molecular and nano. Policy makers and legislation 
does have committee's to evaluate these advancing technologies. But I 
have no idea how well they can handle them. Hacker's will be a threat 
to these arena's. Hackers, phreakers and crackers will be brought 
forward and given legite jobs at sealed labs to hack thru previously 
constructed systems within assemblers etc. to exploit the leaks and 
varify what need be.

Actually, I did love Contact - right up until they shut her in the
launch vehicle. It should have ended there, I was totally gripped.

And then the whole movie was flushed down the lav. Oh well. Her dad,
really.

But Jody Foster was very cool.

Forgive me if I'm not quite as knowledgable on this subject, but are you
saying that everything that is predatory has a predator, even if it is
members of its own kind?  I can think of several examples of species that
have no natural predators: sharks, tigers, and man being on the list.  And
in these species, inter-species predation is statistically rare.
Furthermore, it was my impression that the creatures composing the "goo"
were after carbon compounds in order to replicate...why would they prefer a
metal submarine to carbon-filled life forms like you and I?

Your comment about corporations as a-life is interesting, but I fail to see
why it has any effect on the matter at hand.  Yes, it is a problem that
merits attention.  It of course does not, however, lessen the potential
seriousness of the problem being discussed.

When I posted my retraction last night, I had not read Greg Burch's
comments.  

I wrote 
> Extropy.com, for example, is in debt.  There is no money to be made in 
> propagating memes.  That's the wrong business to be in.  

To which Greg replied 
> Tell that to Ted Turner, Pablo Picasso, Oscar de la Renta, James Cameron 
> or Oprah Winfrey. 

Well, I called all those people and told them that.  Most of them didn't
know what I was talking about.  I had to explain what a meme is.  Oprah
said  "I'm an entertainer.  I wouldn't be where I am today if I talked
about memes.  My career would never have gotten past square one."  Picasso
said  "I'm an artist.  I don't give a damn about memes.  I just paint what
I see."  Ted Turner did know what a meme was, but he said  "I'm a
businessman, first of all.  I want money, power, fame, and beautiful women.
 I do have an agenda, of course, and being in my position I can push
certain ideas and not others, but that's not what my career is about.  The
idea that somebody would devote his life to propagating memes _as such_ is
bizarre.  It reminds me of those cartoons about 'people who don't get the
concept.'  Memes can take care of themselves.  Get a life."  

Greg continued,
> No one expects to get rich propagating transhuman ideas or extropian
values,
> per se. 

Well, per se is the problem.  If somebody wants to make money, it is
rational for him to promote the idea that wealth is a good thing and should
not be confiscated for socialistic reasons.  But when someone has no
intention of making money, but tries to propagate the capitalism meme and
the rational selfishness meme, per se --  if his main goal is for people to
think the right thoughts about these issues -- I just don't know what to
make of this.  It reminds me of something C.S. Lewis said, "It is more
important that heaven should exist than that I should get there."  I never
understood Lewis's statement, and I don't understand the idea of
propagating memes as such, for their own sake.  

In today's economy, there are so many opportunities I have to chase them
away with a stick.  I'm not saying ExI is useless in its present form, I'm
just saying what others have no doubt said many times before -- that there
is no reason for it to conceive itself as a propagator of memes, or a
networking group, as opposed to an organization that actually sets forces
in motion and makes things happen.  Nevertheless it is what it is, so let's
see if there is an alternative.  

Lyle:

Greg:

> How would you answer it?

As everyone knows by now, I go back and forth on the question of whether we
even need to think in these terms at all.  The computer industry didn't
need a meme to bring it into existence, it just happened, and biotech is
happening by itself too.  The technology of immortality will come into
existence just like personal computers came into existence, as the natural
outcome of economic forces.  Nevertheless, sometimes I do think we need a
meme that can create a phenotype around itself.  This will have to wait
till tomorrow.

Please understand, Lyle, that I don't give a damn whether or not an
ecosystem of hard organisms is gooey.  What I care about is the human
race being prematurely wiped off the face of the Earth.  It doesn't
matter whether the replicators can "really" compete with a rabbit or if
this is just an illusion of scale; if they can outcompete the cells that
make up the rabbit, the rabbit ceases to exist.

As for the non-sequitur, I assumed you were arguing that goo, for some
reason, couldn't eat us, because it wouldn't be any better a competitor
than the cells.  I answered this with the old analogy about "Can a
submarine swim?"  If a bullet can kill us, why not goo?  And if goo can
kill us, but only in a fashion which makes it analogous to a biological
ecology, who cares?  We're still dead.

But there aren't.  Again, I assumed that you were talking about a reason
not to be afraid of goo.  Certainly, by calling the goo scenario absurd,
you're doing a good job of creating the impression that we can all relax
and stop worrying.  If you really mean that we ought to call it the
"microscopic a-life creatures scenario", but we're still all going to
die, then I really must question whether your efforts are promoting the
proper attitude.

Yes, but in point of fact, the submarine population is *not* kept in
check, and there's no reason to suppose that grey goo will be either.

Sure.  Imagine bacteria that doesn't stop when it reaches the edge of
the petri dish.  If you really think it will take a minimum amount of
time, that's a technical question.  Prove it.  Besides, let's suppose it
is slow.  I don't understand why it's better to run from a creeping tide
of black death, hacking off fingers infected by dust specks along the
way, until you drop from exhaustion and are agonizingly consumed.

No, *you* want an entire new kind of life.  *You're* the one who's been
saying that mere self-replication is life by definition, and now you
want to get us to buy that it will have to be as complex as biological
life.  Technical question.  Prove it.

And remember, long ago there arose a single molecule that could
self-replicate.  By *accident*.  That's why we're all here.

As for making fun of a scenario where everything changes in a decade, I
very much regret that technological progress is not obliged to conform
to your desired pace.  Where was the Web a decade ago?  Technical
question.  Prove it.

It doesn't have to go away.  Complex problems have been solved.  Drexler
thinks they'll probably have an assembler by 2013.  Think it will take
longer?  Explain why I should believe you instead of Drexler.  Technical
question.  Prove it.

And no, *I* don't have to prove it.  Eric Drexler and a lot of other
people I respect tell me to worry, so I worry.  You don't want me to
worry, because you don't think it can happen so fast.  Why?  Because
you're making fun of it.  Your analogies can just as well prove that I
don't have this amazingly complex computer on my desk, or that the Web
didn't happen in a decade.

If calibration works so well, let's see you calibrate the stock market. 
In fact, can you give me even *one* example of calibration working? 
*Ever*?  *Any* event in history that could have been "calibrated" by an
event as distant as the ones you show here?  Your "calibration" would
assume that it takes as long to go from Neanderthal to Homo sapiens as
from amoeba to Neanderthal, or that it would take as long to go from
email to Web browsers as from the printing press to telephones.

Or let me put this as simply as possible:  I don't care what you decide
to "calibrate" against.  Eric Drexler wrote _Nanosystems_ and you
didn't.  Reasoning by analogy is no substitute for technical knowledge. 
You might as well be writing crackpot revolutionary theories to some
weary physicist.

Likewise, appealing to a sense of future shock is no different than the
good old proofs that nobody would ever travel in space.  Yes, Lyle,
everything can change in just one decade.  It happens.

There appears to be a quandry over what to do about Naughty Technology
(NT) which can do bad, bad, naughty things to everybody. For instance,
nanotechnology:

But what should be done about NT? All kinds can spring up: seed AIs that
go transhuman, nanotech, timetravel?. Have I missed some? Nuclear
weapons count. Computer viruses?

Is it a concern to discuss these things in an open, public forum? Much
criticism of the nuclear industry + arms race derives from the
behind-closed-doors nature of most of it. Luckily it appears to be very
expensive, so every little tinpot country hasn't got its own nukes
(until now!). Nevertheless, we have lived in the shadow of total
annihilation for a significant period of time.

Would it have helped to hide the science, sweep discoveries under the
carpet? Probably not, because it was an idea whose time had come. This
kind of knowledge will come out.

So with the future technologies, do they get locked away and never
looked at? Legislated against? Held protectively by a small group of
"guardians" (whomever that might be). Published a bit, but made to look
boring and trivial? Or flaunted publicly, openly.

My guess is that, no matter what you do, the information will come out.
That doesn't help if you're worried about being eaten by grey goo. Maybe
the information can come out slowly, to give people (who?) time to
prepare antidotes ahead of the plague. But how is this handled? Who gets
to be trusted with the future of humanity? Scientists (there's a scary
thought)? Industry (there's a scary thought)? Government (there's a
scary thought)? How about ten people chosen at random through the
lotteries?

I think even the complex answers to this complex question are wrong. But
the nuclear arms race is surely some comfort to those worried about NT.
It hasn't been pleasant, and it still isn't, but we're not dead yet.
It's pretty similar - one slip, and BLAM! Actually, grey goo must be
slower than total nuclear war, which is some help.

I remember reading Andrew Tannenbaum on Computer Security. He had
numerous case studies of systems where the main security was in the idea
that no-one knew how the security system worked, and so no-one knew the
backdoors. This, of course, is a fantastic fallacy, because people will
find out, and you wont be ready for it. You must always assume that
everyone (all the bad guys) knows how your security system works, and
make sure that they can't get in anyway.

Similarly with NT, I don't think that you can hide it away in secret
government files, and hope to keep the world safe. You could try, but
you must always assume that everyone knows all about it anyway. That
way, there are no surprises.

Maybe a combined approach - hide the info, but work as though you've
published it on the 'net. Ultimate paranoia. But then, should such
paranoiacs be in charge of such dangerous info? What other options are
there?

Then what do you do if someone else less diligent discovers the same
technology seperately. Send them a stern e-mail? Nuke-em? Sick grey goo
on 'em?

You know that if you developed a fully software AI that could run on
someone's Pentium (or Mac or unix thingy), rewrite itself, and replicate
around the 'net (singularity!), and you wanted to actually put it to use
in the world, that it would be impossible to guard it properly. Soon
enough, the source, or similar source, or wildly different source with
similar/better results, would turn up on someone's homepage, with a link
under their resume, next to a picture of their dog.

I don't think you can hide this stuff, but I don't think you can
seriously distribute it widely either, especially if it is cheap to
implement.

Is someone still working on that Mars colony? I've changed my mind, I'm
coming...

Somewhere amidst multiple universes it is hinted that Michael Lorrey might have said:

>Actually, if you go by Lyle's argument, the grey goo will sit on its ass and refuse to do anything
>until we give it a paycheck to do so,...

Lyle's argument?  Lyle's argument!  
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
That way lies madness.

Trying to find logical consistency in Lyle's little sandbox is like searching for buried treasure in the kitty litter.  You may find something, but your girlfriend won't want to wear it as a neckless.

His entire Geniebuster's website is the online hissy-fit of a rejected nano groupie.  (As he more or less states with atypical clarity in his intro.)

I think the bard was talking about Geniebuster's when he said:

	"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

	I read through the thing.  It seemed a waste of time.  It was like listening to Rush Limbaugh.  He sounds as if he has something to say, you wait patiently for his "argument" to come together.  He wanders all over the logical landscape on his way to... I don't know, ("Eric Drexler's a big dummy!" maybe?) you tell me.  And when he gets there, there's no there there.   There's no end, there's no point, there never was, and there was precious little logical cohesion along the way.  
	Like eating cardboard pizza.  A waste of a good appetite.  What's the point?  

	However, he does seem to stimulate discussion.  He made me go back and check my work.  That was healthy.  So it wasn't a total loss.

    These are valid concern's most likely everyone on this list has 
contemplated them at one time or another. Here's the thing, there are 
legislative groups such as a science court called the "Scientific 
Adversary Prodecure". Also a more direct "Task force of the 
Presidential Advisory Group on Anticcipated Advances in Science and 
Technology".You're right,these are most likely not relevant to the 
mainstream public unless you are sitting in the congress house. 
However there are other approaches. For instance, my interest, as you 
call it in NT (naughty technology-cute) particularly is 
nanotechnology. Although I forsee a awesome benifit to society with 
the evolutin of nanotech, I am not blind the dangers. This thing is 
utopia or doomsday! So, I am involved in groups that relate to my 
subject of concern (and support) Foresight is an example, I have 
become a senior associate and intend to attend meetings. Some of 
these meeting's ie. the Gathering in May are "brainstorming" 
sessions, and may involve policy issues. I myself keep tabs on the 
news and groups striving towards the advances of the science. You 
better believe I'll be sitting there to voice my public concerns when 
it reaches that level, where ever that may be. You just have to get 
involved, raise your voice. You don't have to sit back if you don't 
want to.
    As far as the government, well they do most of the funding for 
research and university, institutes etc. They have grant's for 
purposal's, they involve these communities in their own work. It's a 
hand in hand mission. Without them, it may or may not happen, any old 
Joe could come up with the next greatest break thru. 
    Nanotechnology could be much worse in damages than a nuclear 
bomb. You could have nasty silent viruses, and the grey goo problem 
which involves replicating assemblers. However, these will only do 
what is programmed, this is the crux of the issue with nano.
    Emlyn, pick a favorite and join some groups of your concern.

	In response to Emlyn O' Reagan's concern for the feelings of any old farts
who should chance to materialize within earshot of her "Odes to Extropian
Optimism", Eugene Leitl seems to have let slip out:

	"...outline the basics of cryonics (even if chances of it working are
	currently small)."

	Now,  I consider Gene's offerings to be of consistently high quality, but
in this case, I must (once again) take exception.  Regarding the likelihood
of reanimation following cryonic suspension,  SUCCESS IS A NEAR CERTAINTY.
(Yes, sports fans, we've been here before.)  Unlike the last time however,
this time  I'm going to tell you why I hold this view.  Though I'm only
going to give you 
  
				The short version:   

 (To avoid confusion, let me, from the outset, narrow the scope of my
remarks to technical feasiblity only.  If a comet should hit the earth,
nuclear war or Luddites obliterate civilization, or grey, blue, or saffron
goo injest the galaxy,... well, that's somebody else's problem.)
 
	Cryonic suspension--molecular immobilization by solidification, and
reaction rates vastly reduced by ultra-low temperature--virtually halts
structural deterioration.  Time comes to a stop.  ("What about the effects
of background radiation?" some will reply, when a decorous silence could
have avoided the embarrassment of so feeble an attempt at rebuttal.)  This
means that there is effectively no time limit placed on the development of
a reanimation capability.
	Forty years, forty thousand years, forty million years, four billion
years,...ooops, KABOOM... the sun goes nova,... oh, well,...times up.  Lest
my point get lost in the hyperbole: 	
	 Point number One: No time limit.
	 The future is a very long time, any or all of which is available to be
applied to the problem of fixin' your frostbite.  

	Drexler studied the question of the feasibility of nanotech.  His
preliminary conclusion:  No currently known natural law can be shown to
prohibit its development, AND biology stands as a robust, real-time,
functional example of nanotech in action (proof of concept).  Whence I
conclude that if you're going to nay say the feasibility of cell-repair
technology, then the burden of proof lies with you.

	Ergo:
	 Point number Two: A clear road ahead.
	Nothing is currently known  to stand in the way of developing the
necessary cell-repair technology.

	Finally, there is the issue which I shall politely call lack of
imagination.  
	This list allows us to speculate about a future of post-human
enhancements, SI's, self-directed evolution, and the singularity--beyond
which last the fun may exceed our current ability to predict (imagine?).
In light of this, how can anyone feel confident to predict that the
capability of the next ten thousand years of post-humanity and their SI
cohorts will be so limited as to imply only a "small" chance they will be
able to fix cellular frostbite?

	Point number three: Future smarts on the job.   
	The intelligence of post-humanity et al, not the limited resources of
today, will be applied to the task.

	The above is the "short" version.

	 I therefore feel that it is not unreasonable to suggest that in future,
rather than saying cryonic suspension currently has a "small" chance of
working, that you might say rather that it has, say, an "uncertain" chance
of working?  Uncertain.  Yeah.  I can live with that.

	Or you could say SUCCESS IS A NEAR CERTAINTY,  as I do.

  
        
			Best, Jeff Davis

Many, just not necessarily practical ones. The problem is
that everything is in different orbits. No one has figured out
how to use a chunk of debris that flies past every once in
a long while at several thousand meters per second. I had
a notion at one time of trying to modify the orbit of a piece
of a comet, to place it into earth orbit, then use this large
chunk of ice to capture bits of orbitting debris. Turns out
this approach is no more practical than the other ideas. spike

Catching them is the problem. If we could do that then it would be worth
just dumping them in the trojan points until someone can come up with a
use for it all.

Short wavelengths do allow smaller spot sizes for diffraction-limited
optics, and can support higher frequency modulation- *but* UV does not
propagate through any optical materials well enough to be used in
fiber transmission.  The lowest losses are in the near IR at around
1100 to 1500 nm, and IR transmission is used exclusively despite
visible light diode lasers being available.

Blue lasers based on gallium nitride are bleeding-edge tech even now-
UV lasers will be even more painful.

But it's an old problem with no solution so far... the information will
come out, and someone could potentially use it wrongly. The
proliferation of computer viruses seems to be a good example of how
people love to misuse technology, and ignore common sense on these
issues.

Maybe I should refine NT to INT (Inexpensive Naughty Technology - I
thought Cheap & Nasty Technology might be good, but I don't like the
acronym).

Nanotechnology might not be a good example, because it is probably going
to be out of the reach of the everyday hacker (although it'd probably
turn up in Uni's, which is bad enough). But software AIs (on Von-Neumann
machines) is where things could get scary, to take just one example of
INT. Accessible and totally destructive on a bad day.

What can you do about this kind of thing? No regulations, or set of
conventions, or anything like that is going to stop such an advance (if
it is possible, which I am betting it will be). We could legislate and
regulate until we're blue in the face, and end up being wiped out (in
any number of ways) by a program which starts "This Krazy Brane created
by the Phunky Phreaky Hacker Whackers club, yeah, we are the best".

I've got no idea what you do about this, except hang onto your hat. I'd
say some kind of world government might help (sounds of indignant
screams, rotten fruit flying). Given the internet, your going to need
someone who can make rules for *everybody*, if you're even going to
begin to look after such a thing.

Or just be nice to the AIs, and hope they don't see the hammer behind
your back.

Just when they thought humanity was crushed, a lone rebel managed to
load a self-replicating copy of Windows 98 onto the net. Straight
genocide would have been kinder...

Actually, I think the crossbow was hailed as the end of civilisation,
and the Jawbone-with-big-bruising-lump probably was too, before that. Or
we could all end up smashed by the Y2K bug (Y2Care bug). 

Back on the soft AI: Flaming might get scary if instead of sending
someone a harsh rebuke (ouch), you might send a nasty psycho-AI which
infests their building management system and locks them in an elevator
or turns off power to their nanobrain or whatever.

Hmmm... Maybe I should spread that particular meme, and send stupider
and stupider e-mails to people who are involved in AI research. If I am
particularly irritating, I might be able to stimulate an acceleration in
the field, just so people can MAKE ME STOP. I can bring forward the
Singularity!

I'm already doing it!

PS: I've worked out how to keep the AIs under control - give them

There's already at least one private camp in Antarctica, offering short stays

I'm on the run at work for the rest of the week, so detailed response to any 
of the interesting stuff going on here will have to wait a few days, but I'd 
like to make a quick reply to Lyle's note about my flippant comment about 
Picasso and Ted Turner (what was I THINKING when I wrote THAT???).

My comment was not intended to indicate that the examples I gave were by any 
means self-consciously engaged in memetic engineering (although Picasso 
certainly was).  Rather, it was simply to indicate that "culture work" can be 
lucrative and/or influential in realms outside of the purely memetic realm of 
culture per se.  You certainly don't have to know what a "meme" is to do such 
things.

As for my discussion of making or not making money in the work of propagating 
memes (transhuman and extropian memes, in particular), my point was to 
communicate that such an effort is, in my opinion, part and parcel of 
bringing about a world that will produce the particular technological fruits 
of thetranshuman agenda we are pursuing.  But cf my point about "free 
riding": One doesn't necessarily have to an active meme-propagator to get at 
least some benefit from the efforts of others who are.

IMO, you are looking for solutions in the wrong place.  Social control has
never succeeded at controlling a new technology for long, and there is no
reason to think that things will be any different in the future.  A better
weapon for controlling technology is generally other technologies.

If you think that a particular nasty technology could be contained by the
proper defenses, the logical thing to do is to promote the development of
those defensive technologies.  If you can get your defensive nanosystems
online in time, that nasty gray goo doesn't look quite as scary.

OTOH, if you don't think that there is any practical defense against a
threat, and you think that the threat is likely to be real, your only real
choice is to look for some other technology that would make the whole issue
irrelevant.  So, if you think gray goo is invincible, you try to promote
space colonization  or fast SI, or some other development that changes the
parameters of the problem.

Granted, having the chutzpah to sell tickets to your own funeral is something I aspire to (not that I would need much encouragement), but I guess I was more focused on those who obsess on their pending deaths in the above comments.

Well, it can't get quite that bad.  Any reasonably frugal person can save up
enough to fund their own retirement in less than 100 years - often much
less, especially in high-paying fields.  You could also do a partially
retirement - work hard for 20 years, then switch to a part-time job and use
the interest on your savings to make up the difference.

Immortality would give everyone a chance to let compound interest turn their
pennies into dollars, and their dollars into riches.  Of course, if it
becomes common for people to retire and live off their interest the economy
is going to start looking pretty strange.

Perhaps this shouldn't be sent to a discussion forum, but I figure risk
a quicker answer at the expense of being mercilessly flamed.  :)

I want to join ExI - the information used to say memberships were $85

I just bought this game last week and it has interesting
transhuman/extropian ideas in it.  I searched the archives and didn't
see a previous discussion of it, so I'm posting about it now.

Alpha Centauri (actually Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri) is pretty much the
sequal to that great old game "Civilization."  This is a turn based
strategy game where you control one of seven "factions" of colonists
who have landed on a new planet.  You build up your territory, discover
(research) new technologies and build armies to crush your foes.

Interestingly, a lot of the technologies you can discover are
nanotechnology based.  You can build Nanohospitals, Nanfactories,
etc...

The coolest or most transhuman aspect of the game is that you can win
the game by the discovery of a tech called "Ascent to Transcendence"
which is pretty much becoming Posthuman.  The game even mentions
transhumans and posthumans.  It's not a perfect representation of our
philosophy (it's a game afterall), but it's still refreshing to see
transhumanism presented in such a positive light (winning by becoming
Posthuman as opposed to winning by diplomacy or conquest - which are
also possible).

I reccommend the game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.

Interest rates are set by supply and demand.  If almost everyone were
trying to lend substantial amounts, and almost no one creditworthy was
willing to borrow similar amounts, real interest rates for sound loans
would be extraordinarily low compared to what we are used to.  Likewise
for return on capital invested in stocks.


In the economic world, immortality already exists in a sense. 
Corporations, banks, foundations, endowments, perpetual trusts,
governments and other such entities are potentially immortal.  Some few
of those entities which have been in operation for a century or more have
compounded their gains into enormous wealth.  (Example: DuPont, GE)   But
that was in an environment where safe real returns on capital were in the
range of perhaps 4% to 8% per year.

My favorite is to send up a big sponge (i.e. a ball of soft material)
and let the debris crash into it. Maybe not perfect for the large
chunks (but they are easily tracked) but good for swabbing up the fast
and dangerous small fragments. Problem: space is big.

Well, yes, but remember there are two sides to that supply/demand equation.
A huge supply of money looking for investments is only a problem if there
aren't enough profitable investment possibilities.  Or, to put it another
way, if 90% of the population retires but the other 10% can profitably
invest all of their money, then real rates of return will not collapse.

The real question, then, is what will the supply of investment opportunities
look like relative to the supply of investment capital.  I believe Robin
Hanson has looked into these issues a bit.  Are there any comments from our
resident economist?

Are you a hard organism, Lyle? Are redwoods? Fish?

A military autoreplicator is a weapon, deployment of which results in
a punctured equilibrium. It might serve as a nucleus from which an
entirely new beautiful ecosystems will spring, but even that is not
guaranteed. 

But even if, we won't be there to see it. That's the whole point of 
the Grey Goo, or a malign Singularity, you name it.

Non sequitur. Doesn't look to me that way, and the threat is of a
magnitude where we cannot even tolerate 99.99% uncertainties.

Well, light is light. Propagation velocities of EM radiation is
roughly the same in the same medium (notice that light could slow down 
to a few cm/s in Bose-Einstein condensate). Is the source of chromatic 
aberration slightly different propagation velocity of light? I would
think so.

Look into violet GaN (gallium nitride) lasers and optically switched
networks. It seems that GBit networking might be superseded by TBit
networking within the next decade.

This is... most provoking. Dear nanogirl, Nanosystems is a not very
recent book, written by a single, albeit very bright, person. 

Now nanotechnology research in the mainstream has begun in earnest, 
the results are most encouraging, and so far I don't see anything 
which absolutely excludes the possibility of designing some very, 
very nasty mites. All the Foresight Instututes in the world united
cannot control a large, very busy scientific field.

I don't know about you, but I am worried. We must begin planning a
nanoCERT, and allocate some funding towards theoretical goo
studies. These computers are mighty fast nowadays, you know.

Does shooting a laser from a laser generator not generate opposite force
of the beam output?

Do photons from a laser upon impact of a reflective surface cause an
inertial reaction, no matter how infinitesimal?

If lasers have no "kick" upon firing, and photons from a coherent laser
do cause an inertial reaction, then lasers could be used as reactionless
propulsion.

It would be interesting to note simple reactionless propulsion from
mirrors.  "How is it done?  Mirrors."

My initial design ideas would be a ring of lasers around a hole in a
sphere pointing towards a parabolic mirror on the other side.  The
engine could be mounted on a gimbal or gyrodyne setup for directional
reactionless propulsion.

As a craft propelled by such moved along, it's trail would be a beam of
coherent light flying at the speed of light away from the engine.

If the force from firing a laser and its reaction upon impact cancel,
then this would not work.  If it does work, it is copyrighted by me.

Fifth- or higher dimensional travel would still be preferable as it
would eliminate any concerns of distance.

Have a nice day,



Ross F.

Lasers have recoil, just like anything else - it is very small, because the
beam has very little mass, but it is measurable.

Yes, it does.  These two forces are exactly equal, so your idea:

unfortunately won't work.  You can use a stationary laser to push a moving
object, but you can't use the laser/mirror pair to move itself.  Darn,
another great idea shot down by those nasty conservation laws!

As an interesting note, you CAN get thrust by simply firing the laser out
the back of your spaceship.  Unfortunately, we currently can't build lasers
that move enough energy to make this practical - the thrust would be far too
low for even the most modest of needs.

Now, if we could make very powerful, compact, lightweight lasers, and power
them with a nuclear energy source, we would have a very efficient means of
propulsion (and this is not a new idea, so neither of us can lay claim to
it).

Recently, sensors have detected a widely distributed smile reflex highly correlated with  emanations from Emlyn the Prolific, a newly discovered star in the Extropian Galaxy.  Spectral analysis suggests that the stimulus may have taken the form:

Smile reflex accompanied by major waves of pleasantness punctuated by textbook guffaw.     Thank you, Emlyn.

OK, I understand this.  That lasers have recoil I did not know.

Correct, I have also heard of this.  Another old idea is to use a ground-based
laser to shoot up projectiles into orbit.

The idea of shooting a laser for thrust is still an interesting one.  This would
appear to require no reaction mass, only power, as opposed to minimal reaction
mass, using ions.  So, lasers can be the source of reaction propulsion with no
reaction mass propellants.

In terms of usable long range thrust capabilities, it would appear that a
Bussard ramjet might be more efficient, ie, using a magnetic scoop to funnel
interstellar hydrogen into the the reaction chamber for ion propellant,
collecting the nearly zero reaction mass available along the way.

It would seem likely that before we developed any interstellar travel mechanism
using conventional slower than light travel, there will be some advances that
allow dimensional travel, but that is beyond the realm of conventional science.
These things are much "easier said than done."

Yes.  The reaction depends on the energy of the beam.

No.  They would be a reaction propulsion like other reaction propulsion.
They just use light instead of, say, reactive fluids.

I'm certain that's Emily Dickinson, "my candle burns at both ends"
(say what you will about her sentiments, she at least gets the meter
right), but I couldn't find it on the web at first try.  You may
have better luck.

I have Paul's book and spoke with him a few years ago in his office at
Indiana University during my stint there.  He was a pleasant individual who
seemed frustrated with the belief that the scientific community would not
accept his theory as plausible "for another 50 years or so", as I recall him
saying.

As far as immortality is concerned, I think those who are set up well 
with their finances will get a piece of the pie. It may very well be 
that those who arn't won't be able to afford the cost of cell repair 
and further life extending procedures. 
Also, after the precurser distribution of nanomachines from 
manufacturing companies, and we all own one in our own homes, the 
need for riches, as a cash commodity could decrease. A household 
nanomachine will create object's of need for us,(food, furniture 
fabrication, and other physical objects) therefore eliminating the 
need for shopping. There will be atomatic cleaners, showers, and  
available cures. This creates questions for the work force also, will 
people still decide to work, how much will be needed? This will shut 
down a lot of development of tiny technologies. The economy as we 
know it, will have to find an alternative route to adjust to these 
new technological revolutions.   
There will be ethical complications, the difference between rich and 
poor where life is concerned. 
The role of the government, how will it be played out in regulation 
and promotion. 
The rate of accelerated change will effect how readily society can 
adapt.
The difference in user's as opposed to constructors will be major.
Each of these issues will effect the whole economic scenario.
Will money even be relevant in the future or a collectors item?

A mix of things that are unimportant, untrue, easily predictable
or already done, with a few exceptions that are mixed up to the
extent they are of no use.

2000One megabyte of storage costs one cent.
- not hard to predict, is it?  What about storage and it's costs in 2010? 2030?
2001 Real-time "smart" videocassette recorders
- what is it?  They guess what's worth recording?
2002True desktop computer, where 3-inch-by-3-inch desktop is screen
- Is it 3 by 3 feet?  I can just turn my monitor 90degrees now, but it's
not comfortable to work at.  Not a big deal, anyway.  Just as other items
above. Or below...
2002 Intelligent global positioning systems
- What is it? 
2003Chameleon devices
- Change color to match the environment?
Cool trick.  Good for the military and spying on girls, maybe.
2004 Handheld or smaller computers as ubiquitous as personal computers
- That one is good.  Maybe already true if you count calculators.
2005Software that learns by doing
- It's been doing it for a long time.
2006 E-mail without digital signatures is automatically trashed.
- you can program your mail reader to do it now.
Will all mail without digital signatures be automatically trashed in 2006?
I am wiling to bet _anything_ against it.  
2006Medical kiosks in shopping malls
- What will they do?  Take tests?  That could be useful.  I'd use it.
2007 Computing wallpaper; voice-controlled, keyboardless computers
- First is interesting.  Second already there.
2008Computers that take notes
- From voice?   Or keeping data from observations?  Both already done.
2009 Built-in speech interfaces; majority of U.S. households have high-speed 24x7 Net access.

- Plausible and somewhat important, IMO.  Define high-speed ;-)
Majority of U.S. folks prefers watching baseball to studying science
anyway.  It's not too important how fast they will be getting their stuff.
What will those do who actually do something important, is the question.
2010Computers that understand spoken words in context; composable computing - -personally scripted use of devices attached to the Net
- both somewhat there, I guess could improve in 10 years.
2011 Actual names used as Internet addresses; collaborative "regions" envelop mobile workers.

-Names already partly used - Real Names in Altavista.  
Many names can't be resolved easily.  That won't be the only scheme (bets?)
2012Individualized knowledge access
? 
2013 Three-dimensional, life-size scenes on digital screens 
2014Artificial "genetic" programming
- here already 
2015 Computers that comprehend what they read
- to a greater extent than today?
Computers usually understand their input, to a degree.
Poetry, they won't get by 2015.
If they understand what they read now, what will happen in the next 50 years?
201610 percent of households worldwide connected to the Net
- maybe.  So?
Most of these people will not understand the most important things from the Net.
Maybe from this data, computers should be counted as intelligent entities.
2018 End of coin slots in Coca-Cola machines
smart cards?  In Africa too? 
2019Net economy reaches $4 trillion.
So now we have "telephone/fax economy" (where deals are made).
What will be the structural changes in this economic process?
How about intelligent software agents, super-liquid markets,
knowledge derivatives, self-enforceable contracts, AI throwing humans
out of trading floors? 
2020 Programmable pharmaceuticals
release based on internal chemical balance? 
2021You're always on camera.
Me?  I doubt.  The Amish? No.   The Net Jenny?  Already there. 
2025 First ground war fought over access to information
B.S.  Entities owning information are non-territorial and can't lead
ground wars.  The communication channels, unlike oil pipe lines
don't have to go through any territory.  Who will fight for what?
I may fight my kid over access to a PC :-)
2030All objects become artifacts tracked on Net.
- Yeah, right.   Some already are, some will never be.
More will be, in any year.
2035 Unstructured conversations with computers
- All conversations are structured.  Grammar. Replies.
Will structures be more complex.  Sure - any year, before and
after 2035 as well.
2065 DNA-based computing 
                - Some was already done.
                If the technology is of any use, it will work 
                much earlier. In 2065, who would use crude
                methods like that?

---------------------------------------------------------------

Now what about nanocomputers, quantum computations,
enhanced reality, strong AI, intelligent prosthetic devices,
mobile robots delivering physical anarchy, phase transitions
in the economic structures, unaugmented humans becoming less
cost-effective than machines, intelligent personalized synthesis
of texts, movies and ads, AI helping in conflicts with friends, 
scientific breakthroughs, deterritorialization of planetary
power structures, dissolution of state governments,
alternative private currencies, entirely artificial life
forms that are also connected to the Net, and all other really 
interesting and important things that are going to come
out of the progress in computing technology?

Is this the best the human race can do to chart its future?

How come no serious organization on this planet works on 
reasonable long-term scenarios of development?

But then, it may be better that they don't. 
If bureaucrats don't even see where the things are going,
they can't hinder the development.
We should just hope that things while being totally out of
control in the long run, don't get out of control. (Hmm...)

Taking the first ten or so years from that page:

: 2000 One megabyte of storage costs one cent.
: 2001 Real-time "smart" videocassette recorders
: 2002 True desktop computer, where 3-inch-by-3-inch desktop is screen
: 2002 Intelligent global positioning systems
: 2003 Chameleon devices 
: 2004 Handheld or smaller computers as ubiquitous as personal computers
: 2005 Software that learns by doing
: 2006 E-mail without digital signatures is automatically trashed.
: 2006 Medical kiosks in shopping malls
: 2007 Computing wallpaper; voice-controlled, keyboardless computers
: 2008 Computers that take notes
: 2009 Built-in speech interfaces;
:      majority of U.S. households have high-speed 24x7 Net access.

This seems to be a badly organized effort.  Are we to assume that these
are major breakthrough technologies for the years shown?  There is
no sense of continuity, no sense of building on itself.  The various
innovations have little connection to one another.

Many of the items are not defined.  What is intelligent GPS?  Smart VCRs?
Chameleon devices?  What does it mean to have a 3-inch-by-3-inch desktop,
and have that be the screen?  Are we going to go back to peering at a
tiny 3-inch screen, like the first TVs?

If you want a better-organized future timeline, take a look at
http://btlabs1.labs.bt.com/library/on-line/calendar/index.htm, where the
British Telecom's resident futurist makes predictions for the next few
decades.  This has separate categories for business, biotech, robotics,
etc., so you get a sense of flow, of breakthroughs and improvements
accumulating.

It's also a few years old, so you can see that we're already starting
to slip the schedule a bit...

As far as I can see, there is no other way to get anything useful done.
You burn one end seeing to all the mundane things in your life, and the
other end doing the important stuff. So that you can accomplish things
like thinking and breathing simultaneously.

You just need a really big candle.

Has anybody done a thorough analysis of the likely behavior of post
immortality capitalism? How will this affect economies, governments,
citizens? I'm thinking economists, econometrists, someone who's scraped
all the beans into a set of complicated piles, and can justify the
result.

Can everyone get rich? Or will we have the same divide that we
experience today? Will the first world countries still require a
massive, impoverished third word to support the illusion of utopia?

As we develop our understanding of neuroscience, forays into cognitive 
science will naturally follow.  We've been trying the "work down" approach 
for the last fifty years with no qualitative progress in the last two 
decades.  I don't think we should dismiss all efforts in cognitive science, 
but neuroscience is the near-term limiter on the progress in cognitive 
science.

I agree with you on this point.  If there is worthwhile work being done in AI 
it is by those attempting to determine the computational bases of creativity. 
 I've not been swayed either way by the stochastic (Copycat) vs. 
deterministic (SME, SOAR, etc.) models of creativity. Additionally,research 
into the knowledge requirements for creative systems appears to be 
worthwhile.  But the emphasis on force feeding lots of basic rules or the 
"hardware" approach seems ill-conceived. The research area that would 
contribute to AI that, in turn,involves the least amount of philosophical 
haggling and the most science is neuroscience.

>I don't know about Einstein, but someday I'd like to be the Drexler.

We need the Einstein before we need the Drexler.  Einstein ushered a paradigm 
shift whereas Drexler is simply ruminating within a paradigm.  We need the 
paradigm shift first.  This leads me a theorem concerning scientific progress 
called the Paradigm Shift Singularity Axiom:  The ratio of philosophical 
haggling and nitpickery over the amount of scientific investigation increases 
over time as the current paradigm reachers its limits.  As the ratio becomes 
asymptotic, a paradigm shift hopefully/usually occurs elsewhise we begin to 
have "churches" of thought within fields of study.

Agreed. But given its the only current example we have of a working 
intelligence, it seems prudent to uncover its secrets when our efforts to 
create the beast from scratch are ailing something awful.

If we can isolate the components in the human mind we can optimize them.  The 
random shot in the dark approach of evolution has certainly left huge room 
for improvement.  Since we can't even develop a system intelligent as a 
tapeworm I think its imprudent to start talking about developing a more 
efficient version of human-level intelligence.

Recasting the element as complexity just rewords the problem but does not 
given a useful answer.  Describe, deduce, formalize all you want but until 
you have a seed AI or some other tangible product you are still just 
restating the problem.

This is a fine sentiment but more the exception than the rule.  People do
compromise. . . they do settle . . . less these days than in the past,
admittedly.  I'm just saying that older people perceive that they have fewer
options because they believe they won't be able to attract another partner
or they can't make it alone financially or they don't want to hurt the other
person, or what would the children think, or any other number of reasons.
IMO, future circumstances will eliminate many of these perceived and real
barriers and people will in general feel more independent and less disposed
to honoring vows that no longer hold any meaning for them.

I remember hearing an evolutionary psychologist suggest that spousal
relationships were designed to last about as long as it took for a child to
grow to the age of 7 or so (hence the "7 year itch").  Or maybe it was that
fact that by the time you were ready to mate, you only had another 7 years
on average before you died.  Anyway, she indicated that we certainly weren't
designed to be together for 50 and 60 years, let alone hundreds.  Some
couples will achieve this, I have no doubt, but I wouldn't be surprised to
find that the average does indeed drop to about 7 years or so.  Again, I
don't see this as a bad thing, necessarily.  Every relationship is unique
and individuals shouldn't be guided by the "averages".   Rather, they should
stay together as long the relationship is functional for both parties and
provides sufficient emotional fulfillment.

But here's a question for you (at the risk of being kookified).  Men are
from Earth and women are from Earth but we clearly differ when it comes to
what we want out of a relationship and these differences are often at the
heart of our inability to maintain loving relationships.  Should we be
viewing these differences as a human limitation to be transcended?   Should
we try to redesign our psyches in order to enhance our mutual capacities for
successful marital relationships?  Shall we make men more like women, women
more like men, or try to identify the most adaptive and resilient attributes
of both and head everyone in that direction.  Then there'd be two sexes but
only one gender.  Would that be a bad thing? Or is there even a place for
sex in our post-human future.  Other than the discussion on robots as sexual
partners and sex in cyberspace, I don't recall seeing any postings on sexual
transhumanism.

Another thought came to me on this topic.  I'm paraphrasing here, but
Eliezer talked about how we would eventually come to understand subjective
experiences like the appreciation of art, music, joy, love, etc.  Is anyone
worried that when we dissect and fully reveal the nature of these subjective
experiences, we will probably lose the mystery and the meaning that those
experiences hold for us?  How can I appreciate Mozart, Mona Lisa, and Mary
Lou next door when I am completely aware of the causal mechanisms behind
those feelings?  In short, if I really understood the anatomy of love, would
I ever fall in love again?

Ya.  Probably never happen unless one gets some predictably fatal condition
in one's middle age years.  There is evidently some process whereby people
just lose interest in life as they get older, which I do not currently understand
but perhaps will, should I acheive advanced age.  I have seen it several times.

Im not sure I understand the question, but lasers (or any light source,

I was under the impression that we'd probably be better off genetically 
'enhancing' a person to be better prepared for space. Need less oxygen,
better strength, resistance to atrophe, etc.. this may take some time..
Now, every year is like a 40's decade.

Rabbits, in their present form, will probably cease to exist, eventually. 
So will humans.  Geologists have found that more than 90% of the fossils
that are found in the permian layer are not found afterward.  Extinction
events do happen.  The most recent major one was about 65 million years
ago, when the dinosaurs disappeared.  There have been quite a few others,
of varying severity.  It looks like we are headed for another one. 

If you think the human race is going to be wiped off the face of the earth
suddenly, as a result of Drextech, then your logical course of action would
be to go to Palo Alto and kill Eric and Ralph, and everyone else who is
working on nanoscale replicators.  This would (a) shock the nanotech
community and bring research to a halt, at least temporarily, and (b)
generate enough publicity to make everyone aware of the danger of Drextech.
 If you don't do this, then you have to admit that you don't really believe
what you are saying.  

In fact the emergence of a new life form isn't going to happen suddenly
(maybe suddenly on a geological time scale, but not on our time scale), and
Drextech has nothing to do with it.  Nor is it something to worry about. 
Either we die, like all generations before us, or we change our own cells
and become a new form of life.  In any case I intend to enjoy life to the
fullest, day by day, and not waste a bit of my precious time worrying about
what may or may not happen to the human race in the distant future.

But they do stop.  They are constrained, like any other organism, by
bioeconomics and bioenergetics (concepts that you won't learn much about in
science fiction books).  Any new form of life will face the same
constraints.  Any organism can only eat certain things, can only exist in
certain environments, can only grow so fast, etc.  Damien Sullivan says
that diamond dust will have to find some way to protect itself from sparks,
otherwise it will blow up like a grain silo.  This had not occurred to me,
but it's just another example of the constraints that all organisms have to
deal with.  

Ultimately what I find absurd about the goo scenario is that your goo, or
whatever you want to call it, exists in some other space, science fiction
space, where there are no physical constraints.  

What I call "calibration" is basically establishing inequalities, a
fundamental tool in the mathematical sciences.  It doesn't need to be
defended.

Oh well.  I had noticed that K. Eric Drexler, on a web page, has a list
of patents, and the solar sail is one of them (4,614,319).  There are
already solar sails in production.  In 1991, for high school debate, we
had a space exploration plan with solar sails.

I guess we are around at the right time for the next century of things.
Considering life extension, we might be around for the century after
that, etcetera.

The most efficient means to power a laser, or, anything, is
matter-to-energy transformation.  Again, this is barring
extra-dimensional sources of power.

I've always been very fond of space, it is a romantic ideal, the
so-called "final frontier."

I don't weigh too much, and I drink coffee instead of eating food, which
might be helpful (copious amounts of urine that look a lot like water,
straight back into the recycling system).

Getting wired on coffee on the trip to Mars might be a bad idea,
however. I hope someone brings a Nintendo.

"Dealing with dictatorships without losing face and soldiers"

Copyright Igor Mendelev (rcfv@netscape.net) v 0.2 April 10, 1999


Technology can't solve world problems - especially if it's a wrong one.

Recent events in Kosovo - being an unmitigated disaster from humanitarian
point of view, a well as politically and militarily for NATO countries (but
not for Milosevic) - forces the question : is there any military (or other)
technology that can really help deal with or - even better - prevent such
problems before they become tragedies. 

As we've seen very clearly best air power in the world is unable to deal with
2nd rate army of 3rd rate country to the extent needed to halt slaughter and
mass expulsion of civilians and sending ground troops is unpopular politically
due to unavoidable casualties - small from a point of view of any dictatorship
but way too large for any current Western democracy. Things as they stand now
will only get worse due to low inventory of cruise missiles and laser-guided
bombs (and long manufacturing time for them) and disagreements about political
and military strategy. 

It is clear that a very different approach is needed.

Proposed technical solution to this problem is - for the lack of better word -
Remotely Controlled Combat Vehicle. RCCV is a remotely controlled unmanned
buggy-like armed vehicle that will be cheaply mass produced (for under
100K$/piece) and airlifted (in hundreds or thousands depending on the enemy
power) to the areas of regional crises and then remotely controlled by
operators located within few hundreds miles. 

It will leverage strengths of Western countries in auto production, air
transportation, electronics and wireless communications (all of which are also
weaknesses of their adversaries like Iraq or Serbia or North Korea) and make
the problem of ground troop losses moot. It's also expected to be highly cost
effective compared to existing alternatives- by at least an order of
magnitude. It is also expected to be highly effective militarily due to very
high firepower/weight ratio and strong negative psychological effect on enemy
soldiers. Obviously, it's also completely unaffected by chemical and
biological weapons and can withstand nuclear attack much better than existing
ground forces of any country.

For the cost of a single B2 bomber ( which couldn't be used to do much since
no one is planning - I hope - to nuke Serbia out of existence) at least 10
thousand RCCVs could have been developed, manufactured and deployed in or near
Kosovo - and that would have changed Serbia's means (because even Milosevic
isn't ready to have military losses measured in tens of thousands since it's a
direct road to loss of power) and consequently goals.

System (anyone can provide better estimates for costs and weight?):

 -firepower comparable to (somewhat less then) Bradley armored vehicle 

 -overall weight under 1000 (1500 ?) lbs (due to lack of need to use a lot of
armor to protect soldiers; only small part of the RCCV needs to be armored -
probably using titanium and ceramic plates - to protect engine, fuel,
electronics etc.) 

range at least 500 mi (with about 20-25 gallons of fuel) 

 -requires 1 remote operator (with a proficiency in playing DOOM-like games;
they will be highly motivated to win -:) ) 

 -built-in self-destruction mechanism (to prevent weapons etc. being studied
and/or used by the enemy) 

 -development time under 2 years and cost under 100M$ (if done in a way
similar to commercial auto project, not as a military project with 10+ years
time-frame and bloated budget) for initial version of a vehicle 

 -development time under 1 year and cost under 10M$ for remote operator
software (including training sw) - it's no more difficult than development of
a good game for PC 

manufacturing cost under 100K$/each (if developed with consideration of mass
production - in batches of 1000 or more using standard commercial parts and
existing military hardware wherever possible) and more RCCVs could be quickly
manufactured as needed 

Armaments :

 -attached to rotating telescopic tube located at the center of the vehicle,
it could use technology similar to active suspension to increase precision of
fire when RCCV is moving 

 -low-caliber (5.56-7.62 mm) machine gun (belt-fed) and several thousand
rounds 

 -high-caliber belt-fed machine gun (like Hughes 25mm Chain gun [1]) with
several hundred or few thousand rounds 

 -grenade launcher (40+ mm) and several dozen grenades 

 -laser range finder 

 -supply of mines (anti-tank ?) with dispensing unit 

few antitank missiles (cost ??) 

Transportation:

 -4 (or 6) wheels with bulletproof tires driven by electrical motors (which
allows to move silently when needed and also to save fuel) attached to
cart-like frame 

 -hybrid engine - possibly with Rotapower (http://www.freedom-motors.com)
engine that is cheap when mass-produced ($20/hp), powerful and light -
charging batteries or supercapacitors and powering electrical motors,
communications and weapons systems (which can also work from stored power) 

 -variable ground clearance (?) 

 -variable length of RCCV frame (if could be done cheaply and reliably - to
improve transportation density, stability on bad roads etc.) 

Communications and control:

 -medium-speed (around 1-2 Mbs) encrypted feed to high-flying (15-40 km)
communication platform (aircraft or dirigible) consisting of 2 video feeds
(384-768 Kbs each) and misc. telemetry (256-512 Kbs that includes GPS data,
environment (weather, sounds etc.), vehicle and weapons status); could likely
use off-the shelf commercial wireless G3 gear by the time RCCV is ready for
production. I think overall latency under 15-20 ms (one way) could be easily
achieved using existing communication hardware and software, which makes
system real-time (for the intended purpose). 

 -low-speed encrypted feed from operator (transmitted through communication
platform) for weapons and vehicle control 

 -use standard Internet protocols (IPSec and mobile IP) and commercial RTOS
(maybe even Linux with real-time enhancements?) to speed up development 

 -2 zoomed video cameras (for 3D view; will switch to 2D if one camera is
unoperational) with night-vision capability attached to rotating tube, see
System 

 -small radar to detect other vehicles, planes etc. (they're really cheap and
small now - even planned for some passenger cars) 

 -all electronics EMP protected (because portable EMP weapons could be
available to the enemy) 

Open issues:

 -how difficult and/or expensive is to airdrop RCCV near areas of conflict in
the presence of air-defense systems 

 -possibility of "hijacking" (hacking) of communication platforms and cost and
time of developing software for it (shouldn't be too difficult since it's
essentially flying router with some extra security +
transmitter/receiver/antenna with EMP protection ) 

 -resupplying fuel (seems doable using simple manipulator), bullets and
grenades (somewhat trickier) 

 -best way to return it after completion of the mission or for repairs etc.
(even though it might be unnecessary given relatively low - by norms of modern
war - cost of RCCV)

Which is a pretty darn impressive rate of progress when we consider what
the people of the 1940's had to do (have done) to their economy to get
those rates.

I don't see no World War, so we must be soing something right. :)

Picture this, they have shown in the laboratory, supposedly, that electrons or
atoms can be teleported.  Then again, they had "cold fusion" ten years ago.

Anyways, as soon as we get past the barriers of space-time in a similar manner
as teleportation, we could teleport mass for energy rendering, probably a long
time before something like that would be safe for yourself or a houseplant.

When I say extra-dimensional, I mean representing elements of dimensions beyond
those we encounter comprehensibly every day, one through four.  One, two, and
three dimensions are x, y, and z, and four is time.

Theoretically, no matter where in space-time, there is an infinite number of
higher dimensions.  So, at an arbitrary coordinate of (0,0,0), at arbitrary
time 0, there is a fifth dimension ranging from -oo to oo, where oo is scalar
infinity, and that coordinate in space-time might be at any coordinate in the
fifth dimension. etcetera.  This could mean that there are an infinite number
of alternate space-times for each point in space-time.

I write this and feel it is true, intuitively, but have no proof, and the
system is ill-defined.

Alternately, there is only one space, and for that matter, only one point in
time, now.  I believe this is not the case.

Once this system is better defined, and we have developed tools to interact
with and work with it, then a large variety of "special effects" will be able
to be tapped.

I think you are mixing up things here a bit. The quantum teleportation
(which has been demonstrated in a scientifically satisfying way,
unlike cold fusion) moves the *quantum state* of one particle to
another particle (by using an intermediary). It doesn't mean particle
A escapes spacetime to appear at location B or something like
that. Energy transfer using this will be just energy transfer. And I
don't see how mass-energy conversion get into it.

Again, you seem to be mixing up "theoretically possible" with
"real". Sure, there might be extra dimensions (M-brane theory is
filled with them, although they are "curled up" and run from 0 to 2pi
instead of -infinity to infinity), but you can't just assume that
there are arbitrary extra dimensions and then make claims that

Note that you have drifted from a "may" to a "will". This is very
dangerous; we may understand how aging works within a few years, but
if I go around claiming that we will become immortal by 2010 without
having any support for my view then I will not only appear a bit
crackpotish to people, but also draw ridicule on much legitimate life
extension research and immortalism. If I have some evidence or a good
argument, then things change.

Energy transfer by itself is quite satisfactory for energy transfer.

For matter to escape or rather circumvent space-time, that is
teleportation, and perhaps time travel, or both.

There might be many things.  This is my view, which is relatively
informed.  Some people say eight dimensions, some say thirteen dimensions,
some say sixteen, some say infinity, others three.  Some people were quite
adamant in maintaining that the Earth is flat.

2010, 4010, what's the difference?  When I say "we" in this paragraph I
mean humanity.

The statement is not a conditional, in that "Once..." translates to
"When...", as opposed to "If..."  but does not say that techniques and
methodologies will be developed, but will be possible to be developed.
There is some acceptance among physics research circles that dimensions
above four exist.  Measurement would be the first step, for example a rule,
a measure of area, a measure of volume, a clock.

What I have stated is speculation.  It is not disprovable.  When I find or
determine a proof that there are infinite dimensions, that will be a good
thing.

dimension.  Infinity, I, is i in i dimensions." - Ross A. Finlayson

Mike says, "...you may need to talk to someone..."  implying... well, just
as HE leaves it to you, I'll do the same.  Then spike says, "...a last big
party,..." meaning, well, a LAST party.

           Cryonics is one of my two (at the moment) great passions.  
           Humanity is in transition.  Looking back, We seem to be in the
final chapter in the mortalist paradigm, and looking forward, the preface
to  post-humanity.  We among all the humans that ever lived, or ever will
live, enjoy the singular opportunity to personally experience BOTH ways of
life.  Life within the context of the mortalist paradigm,... AND
transhumanity, with its eagerly anticipated (speaking personally )
enhancements, among them an indefinitely extended youthful and healthy
life.  Those who went before have passed into oblivion, and those who come
later, can only know of life before the great change, as a chapter in
history.  Only WE get to experience fully both of these.  Thus, of all
transhumans, we will be unique.  We will be "the old ones."
	Right now, as we near the end of the old way, our thinking (our memetic
inventory) is dominated by old-paradigm concepts:  wealth, poverty,
ruthless competition, war, disease, aging, and death.  How could it be
otherwise?  So, permit me offer you a memetic parable for the new paradigm.  
	Call this "The NEXT party" 	


DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

	You say you don't want to die.
	To which I reply, "Then stop planning to die, and start planning to live.
And if you aren't willing to do that, then don't tell me that you don't
want to die."

	Science is going to conquer death.  But if you're so hooked on death, or
tradition, or whatever..., so in love with the out-of-date ideas in your
brain that you don't want to consider how things might be changing, then go
get yourself a shovel, dig a hole in the ground, and prepare for your new
career as worm food.  There are plenty of people in the world with the
intellectual flexibility to deal with change, and a desire for more of the
good things of life.  You don't have to be one of them.  Really, you don't.
 We're not going to plead with you, and we're not going to cry for you.
Simple truth.  We don't REALLY care all that much whether you live or die.
If you're going to live, then YOU'RE going to have to be the one who cares.
 YOU'RE going to have to be the one to figure it out.  YOU'RE going to have
to be the one to do something about it.  Bottom line, WE don't need you.
  
Do YOU need you?

Here's how it works.

	At seventy-five, give or take ten years, you decide that the
character-building value of "maturity" has passed over into chronic
inconvenience.   It's time.  You call the clinic and rent the main
ballroom.  Make the arrangements, send out the invites, hire the band.  The
day arrives.  You go to "the club".  Everyone's there--dressed in silk, and
leather, and sequins.  It's a blowout.  They play your favorite music,
loud.  You dance close and slow with all the perfumed sirens.  You
dissipate shamelessly.  Then, as the music softens to a gentle caress, you
slide into a plush Corinthian-leather vibro-massage Barca-lounger.  Your
friends all gather round.  They prep you.  You lie back and turn on the
vibro.  The technician finds a vein on the back of your gnarled hand.  He's
says "We can start any time."  You say, "Do it."  The technician positions
the mike close to you and says, to the crowd and to you,  "Count backwards
from one hundred."  As they chant, your voice is heard from the sound
system, " One hundred, ninety-niunh."
  
There's a momentary pause, and then you hear a voice inquire, "Mr._____?"
You open your eyes.  Your lids are a little sticky, and the light dazzles.
You squint, turn your head to the side, and raise your hand to shield your
eyes.  But your hand comes toward your face rather more suddenly than you
expect and, startled, you take in a sudden gasp of air.  At that moment you
notice two things.  First, that the air rushes into your lungs in a
powerful torrent, and then, studying it, that the hand in front of your
face is as youthful and perfect as if it had been sculpted--living marble
right off of Michaelangelo's David. 
 
And you remember.
  
As you look past your hand, searching for answers, you find that your
vision is eagle sharp and crystal clear.  You notice how you feel.  You
feelMORE!   Much more.  Your body is singing to you silently, your skin
tastes the liquid coolness of the air, your eyes dance to the diamond
sparkle of the sunlight, a breeze more fragrant than any you have ever
known, down from the mountains, across fields of roses, past the silk
curtains at the window, pours into your lungs.  Awestruck by the clarity of
your senses, and by the power within, you move in slow motion, absorbing
every detail. You sit up.  Stretch.  Breathe deep.  And look around.  It's
a different room.  The crowd, the band, the technician and all his gear,
are gone.  You rub the back of your hand.  No needle or bandage.  You look
around the sunlit room, past the one neatly-dressed man standing calmly by
your bed.  You throw back the sheet to reveal the perfect symmetry of an
athlete's body.  

"All this.  In the blink of an eye.  Just as they said."

Still a bit disoriented, you look up at the man.  "How long?"
  
Recognizing a familiar question, he responds, "You mean, how long has it
been?"
	
"Yes."  
	
"It's been eighty-six years."
	
You stand and flex your magnificent new body, confirming a miracle beyond
belief, yet indisputably true.  Then, of course, the realization overwhelms
you.   Naked and triumphant in the middle of the room, you give yourself
over to rapturous motion.  Leaping and whirling, singing, dancing and
laughing uncontrollably, until, at last, winding down and sinking to your
knees, you look up at the heavens with your arms spread wide and tears
streaming down your face, and declare, "Oh yes, baby, yes, baby, hot damn,
I love you God mama, yes, I love you, oh, yes, baby, YES!"

Thus, with some small preliminary sense of release, and with a huge sigh,
you rise to your feet, wipe the tears from your face with the corner of the
bed sheet, look over at your audience, and with a wryly disingenuous air of
calm, inquire of him, "What's next?"

Without missing a beat he replies, "Well, you are of course, a free man,
and can do as you please.  But,... we recommend that you allow us to assist
you in making..." he pauses briefly, savoring the phrase, "...the
adjustment.  The world, as you might imagine, has changed somewhat since
you last saw it."  Gesturing towards a dressing alcove, he continues,
"You'll find a set of clothes in there.  Join me in the next room when
you've finished, and, if you like, we can begin the orientation
immediately."  He steps into the next room, leaving you with your thoughts.

You move to the alcove, and slip effortlessly into perfectly tailored
casual elegance.  You stand there feeling, for the first time in fifty
years, the delicious vitality of youth coursing through your body.  And you
hum to yourself your favorite tune, the same tune you were listening too
only a moment before, as you lay back in the Barca-lounger:

May God bless and keep you always,
May your wishes all come true.
May you always do for others,
And have others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung.

And may you be

Forever young.  

			Best, Jeff Davis

The supply of investment capital would always tend to balance the demand
for investment capital, at a given risk level, because the rate of return
is the 'price' which varies to keep them in balance.


The premise was that 90% of the population is retired, with indefinitely
long life spans, having accumulated much wealth from many years of
compounded returns.  If we assume that the only thing which would cause
them to un-retire would be if the return on their investments fell below
their minimum income standard for retirement, and that they have a
current income which exceeds that standard, then, they each are able to
continue to compound wealth.  As their wealth increases, over time they
need a lower and lower _rate_ of return to meet their minimum income
standard as well as continue to accumulate more wealth.  So it would
appear that at least the possibility of ever declining rates of return
exists, from the investment capital supply side.  For a wealthy investor
with a practically infinite time horizon, a return on investment of .01%
per year might look pretty good.


As for the demand for capital, that might be determined by population
growth, infrastructure per capita, and the physical rate of
infrastructure depreciation.

Making the genders more like each other doesn't necessarily help anything
(imagine two partners with the teenage male 'constant lust without
commitment' syndrome).  What you would need to do is identify a specific
model for how relationships should work, and then modify one or both genders
to better fit that model.

Now, if that sounds morally iffy, it should.  I expect a lot of the world's
more conservative regimes would want to pick a 'one best way' for everyone
(usually on religious grounds), and force-fit everyone into it.  Hopefully
they won't get the chance.

However, in a free society this is something individuals could do for
themselves.  You decide what you think the perfect relationship would be
like, and then you change yourself to fit this vision.  Then you find a
partner (or partners - lets not be narrow-minded here) who share the same
vision.

I think the question is, given:

1) A future in which lifespans become very long (>200 years).
2) At least reasonably good (by current standards) economic conditions.
3) A population in which a majority of people over age 50 wish to retire.

Is there anything we can say about the likelihood of their being able to do
so?  We can readily see that compound interest will allow individuals to
amass substantial sums of money over the course of several decades, so with
decent interest rates the answer would seem to be yes.  However, it was
suggested that such a large pool of savings might cause interest rates to
collapse, due to a relative shortage of profitable investment opportunities.

That doesn't appear to be likely in a fast-growth economy, but what about
other likely scenarios?  For that matter, what are the more likely
scenarios?

Lyle, the last major extinction on this planet was only fifty thousand
years ago.  The Neanderthals ceasing to exist is of infinitely greater
consequence than a few million species of fish being wiped out.

Maybe I just confine myself to different methods, Lyle.  It's like
refusing to proclaim myself a messiah.  Do you really understand why I'm
not doing that, or do you just think I'm being an idealistic fool?

> In fact the emergence of a new life form isn't going to happen suddenly

Is this an article of faith?  For Drexler's sake, why not?

Anyway, it didn't happen "suddenly".  The power of humanity and
humanity's technology has been building for the last fifty thousand
years.  All of a sudden, fifty years ago, we gained the power to blast
mountains into craters by pushing a button.  Over the course of decades,
the planet itself was threatened by our rising power.  Our technology
has become strong enough to tear "life as we know it" apart.  I'm not
worried about the threshold suddenly being crossed between destruction
being impossible and possible.  I'm worried about the threshold being
crossed from planetary destruction taking a deliberate and extremely
expensive effort, and between it happening in one laboratory because of
an accident.

Don't they face the same constraints?  Why are tanks such more efficient
killing machines than lions and tigers?  Why can nuclear weapons
penetrate a turtle's shell?

Of course goo has constraints.  If the constraints on goo are
sufficiently weaker than the ones on giant, awkward, soft-biological
life, we're dead.

Sullivan's argument got torn to bits, by the way.

If you are under the delusion that "calibration" as a mental tool is in
the same class as the manipulation of mathematical inequalities, I don't
see how you could.  I would put it in the same class as Plato's proof of
the existence of the immortal soul, frankly.  Pick the right "analogy"
or "calibration" and you can prove anything.

Of course I am nano inflicted, and I in no way attempt to diffuse 
this. I have been giving a lot of thought to the applications of 
nanotechnology. I am most eager to aquire some time of brain 
enhancment as far as my intellect goes. But I also offer this 
contemplation up for question.
What of molecularly engineering your sexual response? Sexual climax 
multiplied by? Maybe pi?(okay, maybe infinity would be too much) I 
can't help imagining what a "nanorgasim" (copyright Gina Miller) 
could be programmed to feel like.
Let me clarify that in no way is nautures reserve of adrenalin 
prompted by orgasim unsufficient to me! However one could say the 
same about one's intellect and still hope to take the unbeated path 
of extending it.
How would one go about re-configuring these genes and could we at all 
make it possible to have them layer into other aspect's that the body 
sexually doesn't usually interact with.
I mean we've all heard of fetishes,(food, feet and other 
unmentionables) could these be incorperated into the experience via 
manipulation? What would you include and would you do it?

An idea that came up due to some email discussions: have a big sail,
built from nano- or micro-machines. Let debris rip through it, making
some easily repairable holes and leaving some of the machines on the
debris. When they are removed from the sail, they start digesting the
debris and converting it into a small, inert sail. Using some simple
navigation (make an angle of X degrees with light of this spectrum)
they either drift away from orbit, or merge with the sail which can
digest them.

OK, now I have invoked nano-magic. Shame on me. :-)

How reasonable does his theories appear? I have only had the briefest

Let's not get so caught up in compound interest rates that we forget the
underlying manufacture and distribution of "stuff".  The real question
is the teenagers who are actually working will be productive enough,
thanks to ever-increasing technology, to support all the old fogies.

Actually, I expect that once the economy gets up to that stage, most
people will invest their weekly allowances so they don't have to work as
teenagers either.  One of two things will happen; either you'll get a
permanent class of poor workers kept poor by some huge number of
regulations, or the work will be done by people who enjoy it, or the
economy will strike a balance at the point where labor is so valuable
that people come out of retirement once a year to work for a few hours
and buy themselves a mansion.

Having two genders is an important part of the survival strategy for many
species.  Our biology and psychology is well-adapted to this the two-gender
survival strategy.

Moving humans to a single gender for both sexes could have a long-term
impact on the survivability of the species.  After all, every aspect of
both genders is extremely useful under some circumstance.  Having two
genders allows a species to embody multiple conflicting characteristics,
which appears to be a strategy to maximize adaptability; to a certain
extent, differences between cultures would seem to be a manifestion of a
selection process among the large number of characteristics found across
both genders.  

Cultural artifacts such as patriarchy and matriarchy would then seem to
demonstrate selection for attributes that are closely tied to gender.  A
change in the selection pressures among the two genders will inevitably
change the culture as well, and I think history is full of examples of
this.  For example, civilizations that are becoming increasingly dependant
on skill specialization have decreased the value of some male-specific
characteristics that can probably be linked to most patriarchal cultures.
IMO, skill specialization has done more to decrease the amount of
patriarchy in Western civilization than any other factor by selecting for
attributes that are common to both genders.  However, future evolutionary
pressures may lead to cultures that are (necessarily?) strongly female or
male dominant.

200 year lifespans should not become a problem for some decades, even
if we suddenly were handed them today.  (We couldn't even be sure
that we had 200 year lifespans until 100 years or so had elapsed.)
Over the next century it is likely that productivity will increase by
an unprecedented degree due to technology improvements.  In that case
it may be possible for only a few people, or even no people at all,
to provide goods for everyone.

Even without extreme advances in productivity, if people do increase their
savings (foregoing present consumption in favor of future consumption)
this makes more capital available.  That is, more effort goes into
building machines that make machines, rather than machines that make
goods.  Increased capital can substitute for decreased labor, especially
with improvements in technology.  So this scenario also suggests that
a much smaller percentage of people in the labor force will be adequate.

I'd say leave each to his or her own selection. Just as in today's 
dichotomy there are variations on gender attributes. If you've ever 
seen the silliness of the Jerry Springer show, you can see this in 
it's most extreme of actions. When left on it's own natural course, 
there are bisexuals, transvestites, homosexuals, heterosexual's and 
some who dabble in a little of each. 
Might the future society do more of the same but with further 
advances of varieties? 
Maybe I could be a boy for a day? Or could exude a little more 
testosterone one day and then a little more estrogen for a different 
situation. Ying and yang?
There may be different idea's of adaptablity incorperated by strong 
differences of infuluence. We may not even yet to fathom the full 
spectrum of possibilities.

Hey, I said I have the book.  I didn't say I read it.  Actually, I did read
some of it but remember it being a bit thick for me back then.  It might
still be for that matter.   The main reason I went to visit him in his
office was to get a better handle on how his holographic paradigm differed
from a couple others that I had been exposed to (Michael Talbot, Stanislaw
Grof).  Unfortunately, I left with little more understanding than I came in
with.  I do hope to dig into it a bit more someday, though.

We, as a culture, have hardly begun to explore the sexual
possibilities of even conventional technologies.  This is
an area ripe for research.  Other than a few chemicals and
a few electrical gadgets and a few operations, there's
really not been much progress in the area in decades. 

Mostly that is because of cultural and legal biases
against such technology.  Indeed, Alabama tried to outlaw
sex toys recently (the case is currently in court).
Research into such things as MDMA is restricted.
Worst of all, it's illegal to make a business out of
providing sexual gratification in certain ways, so there's
no strong free-market incentives for research.

If you want to see more technology here, I think the
best approach is fight the legal and cultural barriers.
Ridicule the prudes, fight the despots, celebrate and
exalt the hedonistic heroes.

Then of course, there's personal research.

I'm not sure that culture has been around long enough for such adaptations
to have taken hold. The gender differences are largely due (directly and
indirectly) to a differential energy investment in the raising of offspring.

Culture is a New Trick whose attributes have emerged from these gender
differences that already existed. (Over evolutionary time, culture may not
turn out to be beneficial for our species at all as we can see from the
various disaster scenarios discussed on the list - it's a gamble, just like
every evolutionary innovation.)

I'm all for diversity of personality types, but gender differences per se
most likely will not be needed in the period of intense auto-evolution that
we are approaching.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that either your definition of culture
is different than most, or you're claiming that gender is biologically
determined.

It seems to me that after a certain amount of time, sexual pleasure will be
obsolete, due to greater advances in neural science. Not only is it not
productive ( wow... what an incredible unintentional pun) in our current
society, it can and will be superceded by greater methods of pleasure. Even
today, for a lot of heroin users sex pales in comparison to the purely
chemical high. Who knows what's coming next?

I'm reminded of the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade (I noticed
some roll-playing buffs on this list) where the immortal (see a parallel,
anyone?) vampires have replaced the lust for sex with the far more powerful
lust for human blood, which is the sustenance of the species.

Might we be doing ourselves a favor to somehow link physical pleasure with
that by which will sustain ourselves in the future?

      I find myself unable to agree with these comments. Maybe sexual 
pleasure and neural science will "combine" as opposed to delete one 
sex out all together.
      This is some of what I was saying previously though, about 
individual choice. You could choose sex as nill, non-void in your 
life, you could focus on whatever you wish. And so could others, 
different as they may be. 
     Did you really say "sex is not productive in our current 
society" I don't know about your angle on this, but sex is a sure 
fire benefit to me!
     Also I'd have to say that drug addicts still feel and enjoy sex. 
I'm not one, but I am not oblivious. I don't know anyone who doesn't 
like sex, excluding the obvious celebits, monks, and nuns and I'm 
sure a few others. 
     And as far as the vampire gig, you could include this in the 
layering of engineering the usual unsexual sensation's along with the 
typical.

     I think issues of a sexual nature will come into play with 
technology advances. I expect that with life extention, and physical 
alteration's on the molecular level, left wing alternative groups 
intrested in the sexual freedoms and boundries of their bodies will 
rise up and cauze debate/controversy. Thus forcing society to except 
or reject these new idea's.
     In the future (of course I'm almost alway's coming from the 
viewpoint involving nanotechnology) when automated manufacturing and 
fabrication is in full swing, entertainment and hobby will be at a 
peak. The interesting things, due to the decline in the work force 
will become, fad's fashion and other sources of wildly dramatized 
shows. I imagine with more time on our hands a sexual revolution of 
sorts may arise.
     And yes, personal research will keep me ahead of the 
game.(sheerly on a R&D basis of course!)

In this conversation of future gender, let's consider the evolution 
of designer babies in this. When one is able to determine such 
things, including gender, what will the end result's be. Will thing's 
change, will there be more of one gender then the other. (case in 
point: the Eastern conflict: boy babies good, girl babies bad)I don't 
know what will happen when we can select for ourselves.....

Agreed.  Although gender psychology is not my field, I think there's
considerable support for the idea that of the 4 gender types:

1. undifferentiated
2. masculine
3. feminine
4 androgynous

it's been shown that androgynous individuals tend to be more psychologically
fit in our North American culture at least.  Understand that androgynous
individuals possess the most adaptive traits of both genders.  It would seem
to follow that those attributes which are strictly masculine or feminine and
not part of the androgynous set of attributes become less useful and some
may even become maladaptive as societies advance.

Gina, I think you're confusing gender with sexual preference.  I'm not
referring to one's sexual orientation.  I'm referring to your self-concept
in terms of sexual identity.  I once treated a man who wanted a sex change
but fully intended on being a lesbian after the operation.  He was a lesbian
trapped in a man's body!  I started thinking...hmmm, how do I know _I'm_ not
a lesbian trapped in a man's body?   I mean, _I_ like women!  The
difference, of course, was that he felt like a woman inside, not a man.

I like the idea of having control over exploring what it would feel like to
be a woman.  VR may be the easiest way to eventually experience this.  But
who would I date if I still felt like a man inside of female body?  No, we'd
have to fix it so I actually felt like a woman inside.  It's odd to think
about.

Scott

I suppose it's possible, but I just don't want us to become married to the
idea that sexual pleasure is the ultimate in instantaneous pleasure. An
orgasm is really quite meager when compared to all that is POSSIBLE.

I contend that it's possible that no one will even want to pursue sex as
pleasure, given other choices.

As far as it helps us reach our goals, it is not very productive. Perhaps
indirectly, yes, by relieving stress or strengthening bonds or what have
you, but not directly. These things can be achieved in other ways. My point
is that sex was originally created for procreation, and now that we have
more than enough people on the planet we really don't need much more of
that.

I didn't mean to say that drug addicts don't enjoy sex, just that, given the
choice between sex and heroin, most heroin addicts would choose the heroin.

Perhaps it may be an easy way to re-engineer the brain, but to me this seems
a first step. There are things about sexual pleasure that may not be suited
to all tasks... I'll let your imagination go with that one.

Hmmm, touchy subject.  ;^)

I suspect that, if given the choice today, more would choose to be males,
primarily (I regret to say) because there are still more social rewards and
opportunities for males than females in general.

If economics were not an issue, I don't know.  Not to be chauvinistic, but I
once heard and suspect it's true that the male physiology is considerably
less vulnerable to systemic perturbations...i.e our systems are more
homeostatic and less susceptible to hormonal (an other?) fluctuations than
females on average.  We also have the strength thing going for us on
average.  We have a mild advantage at spatial relations on average.  And I
won't even count the writing in the snow thing.

OK, Gina.  I would actually love to hear what you think women most enjoy
about being women and why they wouldn't want to be men.

Well Scott,
     I am a tomboy and honestly most women, (but not all) annoy me 
probably in the same aspects that they could annoy men. They are more 
emotional, insecure and in need of validating.I know I am one, and 
sometimes even hate my own estrogen.
     Although you appropriatly state that men aquire more social 
rewards women have their way's of manipulating things in their 
direction also. I like the physicality of being a woman, it's 
somewhat artistic. As a matter of fact, I was originally an artist 
(and still am) before struck in the head with nanofever,and for some 
reason I tend to draw the female body more than not.
   Yes, men do have in general, more physical strength, although I 
was a jock up until my car wreck (basketball blah blah). But as far 
as selecting one over the other, that's a difficult call to make, I 
find beauty in most human beings.
And it's the differences that makes the world more than boring.

Title
  Assessing the effects of deprenyl on longevity and
  antioxidant defenses in different animal models. [Review] [36 refs]
Source
  Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  854:291-306, 1998 Nov 20.
Abstract
  Among many pharmaceuticals that have been tested for their effects on
  longevities of different animal rodents, deprenyl is unique
  in that its effects on longevity has been tested in at least four different
  animal species by independent research groups and that the effect has been
  postulated to be due to its effect of raising such antioxidant enzyme
  activities as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in selective
  brain regions. Thus far, in all four species of animals examined (rats, mice,
  hamsters, and dogs), a positive effect was demonstrated, although the extent
  of its effect is quite variable. Our group has examined the effect on
  longevities in rats and mice and on antioxidant enzymes in rats, mice, and
  dogs. Although in rats of both sexes, we have obtained positive effects on
  longevity, two studies with different doses in mice did not reveal a
  significantly positive effect. We have observed, however, significantly
  positive effects on SOD (in Cu, Zn-, and Mn-) as well as CAT (but not
  glutathione peroxidase) activities in the brain dopaminergic system such as
  in the S. nigra and striatum (but not in hippocampus) in all rats, mice, and
  dogs, although the effects were quite variable, depending on the doses used.
  In mice, however, a long-term administration (3x/w, 3 months) caused a
  remarkable decrease in the magnitude of activity as well as a narrowing of
  the effective dose range, which may explain a relatively weak effect of the
  drug on mouse longevity. Further, a recent study on aging beagle dogs by
  Ruehl et al. showed a remarkable effect on longevity, which agrees with our
  SOD study in dogs. Although deprenyl has been claimed to
  have several other effects, such as a radical scavenging effect and a
  neuroprotective effect, past reports on its effects on longevities and
  antioxidant defenses are compatible with the notion that the drug prolongs
  the life span of animals by reducing the oxidative damage to the brain
  dopaminergic system during aging. Further, our studies on F-344 rats as well
  as a dog study by Ruehl et al. suggest that the drug may at least partially
  prolong the life span of animals by enhancing immune system function and
  preventing tumor development in animals. [References: 36]

Once again, this is a bit off. The current most efficient means to power
a laser uses conventional explosives. You can use this two ways:

a) use the explosives as part of an atom bomb that is the engine for an
x-ray laser.

b) There is a new power source that one of the Russian Institutes just
sold to the US military which uses a small charge of conventional
explosives to generate 1 megawatt for a tiny fraction of a second. They
are evaluating it now for space defense weapons use. Don't know the
technology behind it.

Spike? Any ideas?

On the contrary. I invented an electroluminescent retrofit kit for exit
signs, used 1/3 of a watt, and it lasts for 30 years at least, as well
as emitting a nice even illumination across the entire face, making the
letters of the sign very easy to read. We sold it for $65.00. We sold
six or eight thousand of these puppies, then got clobbered by the big
lighting companies that contracted Chinese manufacturers to make LED
based kits which looked terrible, were not as efficient as ours, but
were only half the price. My product won recognition as the most
efficient and cost effective lighting product invented (according to the
EPA's Green Lights Decision Support Software, 1995) and was written up
in the Washington Post as well as industry mags. It was a great product.
We got beaten in the market for reasons that had nothing to do with its
greatness as a product.

An ordinary pocket laser pointer produces a beam of about 2 milliwatts
power.  That's the actual electromagnetic power of the light itself, not
the electrical power drained from the batteries which power the laser.  A
2 milliwatt beam would produce a reactive force on the the emitting laser
of about 6.7 trillionths of a Newton.  If the beam were to strike a
perfect black body and be absorbed, the force on the black body would be
the same.  If the beam were to strike a perfect mirror perpendicular to
its surface, the force on the mirror would be twice that.  A Newton is a
metric unit of force, equal to the weight at sea level of about 102 grams
or about 3.6 avoirdupois ounces.

 Someone sent me this and I think it's a great idea.
THE GREAT "GAS OUT"

It's time we did something about the price
of gasoline in America!  We are all sick and
tired of high prices when there are literally
millions of gallons in storage.
Know what I found out?  If there was just
ONE day when no one purchased any
gasoline, prices would drop drastically.
The so-called oil cartel has decided to
slow production by some 2 million barrels
per day to drive up the price.  I have decided
to see how many Americans we can get
to NOT BUY ANY GASOLINE on one
particular day!

Let's have a GAS OUT!  Do not buy any
gasoline on APRIL 30, 1999!!!!!
Buy on Thursday before, or Saturday after.
Do not buy any gasoline on FRIDAY,
APRIL 30, 1999.
Wanna help?  Send this message to
everyone you know.  Ask them to do the same.
All we need is a few million to participate in
order to make a difference.

I don't know that one gender will be predominately chosen in western
culture. I know that I have a strong desire for a son, and when and if the
time comes I will ensure this happens (technology can already do this). The
reason for my choice is rather simple; I have always had interests that are
more typically "male", such as video games, martial arts, action figures,
etc. I have always been more able to relate to male children than female
children. Therefore, I am more comfortable with the prospect of raising a
male child.

However, I know of at least two men who if they had their druthers would
have daughters.  So, it seems fairly well balanced in my limited experience.

If you want to get really controversial, I can bring up the point that the
smartest man will be smarter than the smartest female as a rule. Of course,
the dumbest man will also be dumber than the dumbest woman. Women just tend
more towards the average.

Men can also _as a rule_ adjust to change better than women, and the future
will bring about a lot of changes and people will need to be as adaptable as
possible.

I'm sorry if bringing this up makes anyone angry; it's just simple
evolutionary biology.

As society stands now, both men and woman have strengths that society needs,
and golly gee it just turned out that we compliment each other rather
nicely:-) Of course, once we get to the point where we can use technology to
change our gender predispositions, all bets are off. I just know that both
genders have skills that are necessary, and I don't know how likely it would
be that on average one person could have both sets, since they both involve
characteristics that I don't think would mesh well together. Of course, who
knows what a transhuman could accomplish?

There are four relevant kinds of choices we might make:
1) Preferences - what do we each want out of a partner and relationship?
2) Personal Style - how to act, dress, search for partners, etc.
3) Couple Arrangement - what two people expect of & give each other
4) Equilibrium - the distribution of preferences, styles and arrangements
       around us that influences our choices. 

You seem to be talking about changing preferences, but that is very 
hard now, and I'm not sure it's very coherent even when technically 
easier.  You want to want something different than you want now?  Then 
you're pretty much there now aren't you?

Sometimes people talk about changing the preferences of their children,
but the possibilities there seem limited (eg, "Nurture Assumption" book).
Changing the preferences of other people's children is even harder.

When I've tried to raise the topic of what kind of future gender 
relations we want, I've often been scolded by folks saying that it is
all a matter of personal style and couple arrangement - each individual
or couple makes those choices for themselves, and there's nothing for
the rest of us to talk about.  

But it seems to me that equilibrium is the crucial choice, and relative
to a distribution of choices and expectations by others, the role of
of individual choices seems limited.  Consider the differing gender
relations around the world now, or of our ancestors at different points
in the past.  Most of those differences I attribute to different 
equilibria.  What most discouraged individuals from adopting styles
that are now common, it seems to me, was mostly not coersion, though 
there was that, but social expectations.  Deviants had more trouble
getting partners, jobs, friends, etc.  

>if I really understood the anatomy of love, would I ever fall in love again?

An excellent question.  Maybe, yes, but less often and less intensely?
People have been around each other for a long time, and yet we often seem to
understand arcane physics better than human relationships.  I suspect part
of the reason is that understanding is less adaptive in some ways.  Wright
discusses related issues in "The Moral Animal".  It is adaptive to fool 
other people into thinking we are more committed to relationships than we 
are, and the best way to fool others is to fool yourself.  When we really
understand, it is harder to fool ourselves.

How else would it be determined? Even if a person is transgendered, where
the mental sex doesn't agree with the hardware, it is still a biological
issue, since all mental processes are ultimately biological. Transgenderism
is simply two aspects of biology in disagreement with each other.

I don't know that "bond-strenghtening" between couples can really be
achieved without sex, at least not at this point. I know of several
relationships that were severely harmed by lack of sexual activity. It turns
the relationship into a deep friendship with no romantic component
whatsoever, and this overall is not a good thing in a marriage or similar
long-term relationship. Once again, future technology may change this, but
as it stands I don't know of a substitute. Humans connect sex with emotional
intimacy, and that intimacy is what keeps a relationship going.

I know that my sexual preferences would not change based on the gender of my
body. I thing maybe I fall in that "androgynous" catagory. I took a test
once when I was in counseling that tested for male and female
characterisitics, and I ended up about even. I know that when I'm playing in
role-playing games I often choose male characters, not because I don't enjoy
being a woman, but because I'm a woman every other minute of the day and an
rpg is my chance to try something different. I suspect that if I were male,
most of my characters would be women. The grass is always greener, eh?:-)

To an economist, this is still awkwardly asked.  If they wished to retire 
badly enough, they would, and just live poorly.   But retirement is not 
directly what people want.  They want to consume stuff, and to avoid boring 
work, just as they always have.  If we took today's life cycle and expanded 
it by a factor of five, from 60 years to 300 years, and personal discount 
rates and interest rates fell by a factor of five, then you would expect 
the same life cycle behavior, spread out over a longer time.  People would 
work till ~300 then retire.

The question is what, if anything, would break this scaling hypothesis. 
Wealth probably doesn't much.  We still work most of our lives, even though 
we are vastly richer than our ancestors.  Personal discount rates might 
well not scale though.  Evolution seems to have hard coded in us a discount 
rate of a factor of two per historic generation time of ~25 years. This 
suggests interest rates won't fall below ~3%, unless our subjective sense 
of time is changed somehow.  This is what suggest earlier retirement. 

Over 200 years, the economy could change a lot.  But assuming we don't run 
out of technological progress, then there should continue to be lots of 
profitable investment projects.

With rapid population growth as now, the 100+ year old folks would be a 
small fraction of the population, so folks could retire at 100, and live 
off savings for the next 200 years, without distorting the economy much. If 
most of the population were retired, however, we get the problem of what 
exactly did their savings buy to let them consume so much.  Most income 
(~70%) is now from labor, so unless we get AI, or the economy changes 
drastically to more favor other forms of capital, then the old folks need 
to "own" lots of labor income of younger folks to make this work.  Absent 
slavery, you'd need young folks paying off debt from loans used to develop 
their human capital, or some such.

As usual, the right thing to do here it make one's assumptions explicit,
put them in a simple economic model, and see what happens that way.

I think this fits the facts. Lee Smolin mentioned something similar in
_The Life of the Cosmos_, where he pointed out that Newtonian
mechanics couldn't explain life and other complex systems
satisfactory, so people invented vitalism.

I wonder if we humans are excessively anthropomorphizing things? We
have well developed social interaction subsystems of our brains, and
using them to think about complex phenomena might have been a
convenient mental shortcut (handle animals as if they had human
properties, and you could more easily learn to hunt or use them; the
same goes for plants and the weather). So we have brains that tend to
imbue just about everything with a human-like appearance. This might
be another reason people believe in souls: they anthropomorphize a lot
of their aspects (shadow, breath, thinking), and this easily become
something apparently independent (Yes, I was reading Frazer's _Golden
Bough_ over breakfast :-)

So why settle for one kind of pleasure? Why not all of them,
skillfully composing them to symphonies of hedonism?

I'm reminded of the Aristoi in Williams' book, who could do things
like parallel real/VR sex combined with poetic and musical
appreciation.

As somebody once suggested in the remote past, maybe we should link
our stock portfolios to the pleasure centres? Or we academics our
bibliographies?

("Yes! Yes! The reviewers have accepted my paper! AAAAAAAAAHHHH!"
Hmm, doesn't seem to different from today :-)


(BTW, the vampires of the game show an important point: in a society
with immortals, you better make sure resources are not limited or it
will become very nasty. If there was an infinite frontier the Neonates
could always move away from the Elders.)

Doodle on neighboring planets?

Re-read some of the old books/civilizations they have lying
around. (Opening the history of China somewhere in the middle,
re-living the lives of a few hundred million people for a while,
making a marginal note: "shoemaker Xien had a darn good idea there,
better add it to my next artwork").

Hang out in Infinite Fun Space, as described by Iain M. Banks (the
Minds of his books build and simulate entire mathematical universes in
their minds - an addictively fun hobby, apparently).

Make neutron stars to collide into gamma ray bursters as part of the
ongoing joke "make primitive astrophysicists confused".

I'm not sure; at least on average here in the West people seem to like
a balanced family. But there are likely subgroups that will bias
things locally.

Even more interesting is non-traditional forms of reproduction, such
as in vitro gestation and male pregnancies. They could help erode even
more of the old assumptions (if they ever get popular).

The downside is that we are the weaker sex; I'm not sure about the
perturbation thing (never seen any data on it), but we have a higher
mortality due to what appears to be a slightly less robust
construction. That is why you find plenty of old widows but few old
widowers.

My only qualm about this is that many people seem to make the assumption
that just because a desire is biological in nature, i.e. a woman's desire to
have childen, that this desire is somehow wrong or needs to be changed. I
certainly support any woman's desire to not have children, or even to remove
any hormonal influences dealing with this desire; however, I don't think
that makes the desire inherently wrong. Sexual desire is also an
evolutionary tool, but I don't see anyone waiting in line to get rid of it.

I saw a very interesting show on TLC the other night about gender
differences, and they came with an interesting reason why woman tend to live
longer than men, even assuming identical lifestyles: historically,
grandmothers are more important to families than grandfathers. Makes sense
when you think about it.

So why not go for *more* genders instead? That would increase
adaptability even more. For example, asexuals, androgynes,
hermaphrodites and easy gender switching might be a good start. What
about a gender that combined (say) the traditional ambition and doer
mentality of males with the traditional social side of women (sounds
like great politicians and administrators), or a gender with a
different ego-structure? Over time I guess humanity may differentiate
to the degree that it becomes silly to speak about genders, everybody
is unique (some standards about the plumbing may remain for
compatibility, but as a character in Varley's _Ophiuchi Hotline_ said:
"don't worry, I've got an adapter!").

Well, yes. I'm not sure I was first, as Gina pointed out Drexler might
have thought about it too. And likely several others.

I arrived at this idea due to my sf/roleplaying interest (again): I
was originally thinking some years back (around 91 or so) about
space-living creatures, and the concept of living solar sails came
up. Since then I have occasionally developed the idea a bit further.

Of course, building the above stuff is likely tricky. But a fun
exercise in smart materials and distributed control.

As far as deciding if transgender or transexual is of social or 
genetic interference, this may be something we have to study more. 
With the recent advances in discovering correlations between aspects 
of people and a specific gene, we could soon find out if this is true 
with sexuality also. This is an ongoing debate. We have seen a tie 
between alcoholism and a hereditary gene already.

If I had to guess, I'd guess it's magnetohydrodynamics-based. I've seen MHD
designs that used jet turbine engines and rocket motors; it stands to
reason that you could get a pretty good pulse out of something that goes
boom, if it were properly designed. 

Off the top of my head: One model I envision has a (disposable) stator
arranged as if you'd serpentined the wire up and down the staves of a fat
wooden barrel. The stator could expand more or less with the explosion's
wave front, generating current until the wires snapped. 

You'd still need a stable magnetic field; not sure how to get that without
a fixed (strong/expensive) container. Lots of supermagnets along for the
shockwave ride? Another disposable coil to produce the field? Current for
the field from voltage off a space tether?

Exactly. What I want to see is more options, not that everybody switch
to the "new and improved" ways. 

I like to sleep, it is very pleasant. Some day I might be able to
consolidate memories and anabolize in a more efficient way, but I
would still like to keep sleeping as an option. A decadent pleasure
when you have time...

Far too much. I better rewrite my phenotype :-)

I'm not a doctor (I just play one on T.V.), but I would venture to 
guess that a lack of sex could cauze physical and emotional problems.
I can think of some intstant physical ones, (for men, I'd rather not 
say) And have heard stories of madness and mayhem from people 
(example Eddie Gien) who had never experienced sexual encounters. I 
am wondering what type of differences their are biologically, if 
hormones are surpressed or antagonized. 
It's strange that we are defending sex, I won't dare to ask Scott why 
or how he developed his attitude toward it, but your ripping yourself

This idea of changing the preferences of our children could be 
misconstrued as hypocitical. For example, it's todays world we find 
it morally correct to defy our childs interests right. Like "I will 
love my child even if he grows up to be a ballerina" even though you 
may be silently wishing for a lawyer. Dow does this pre programming of
a childs sexuality (without their choice) play into this line of 
thinking?

Agreed. This is an issue I have looked into more than a little bit, and I
think in some cases there can be a social or environmental factor. I also
think that there are genetic predispositions and perhaps even genetic
"mandates" when it comes to such issues. I look forward to the day when we
can understand exactly how everything comes together to create sexual
identity. Or, maybe I don't entirely look forward to it. There's something
to be said for mystery:-)

I was issued that particular test along with the all-too-obligatory MMPT
while I was in therapy. Or maybe they got those particular results from the
MMPT and I'm remembering wrong -- it was several years ago, and I took a lot
of tests. I have no idea if you can get a copy of those tests as an
individual; they're supposed to be given and interpreted by trained
psychologists and the like. I know that my therapist wasn't the one that
interpreted the results; she sent to somebody else. Do an internet search
for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Test and see what you come up
with -- that's my best advice.

Gina, what are you talking about?  What attitude are you referring to?  Are
you sure you're not confusing my posts with someone else's?  I can assure
you, no one needs to defend sex to me.  I'm quite the proponent, thank you.

Huh? What is your evidence for this? I did a cursory medline check and
didn't find anything.

I actually think that this is mostly a myth (which is especially
spread by male chauvinists ascribing female behavior they don't like
to a lack of sexual activity of the woman).

Note that this depends a lot on *how* they are influenced. I would say
the human mind and body can handle it quite well. 

(Another meme which I'm suspicious of is this idea that suppressing
something will automatically lead to a catastrophic build up. It is
based on Freud's thinking, and might apply in some areas but the
general applicability is rather doubtful.)

Personally I think being asexual can have many benefits. It saves
energy and time for other fields of activity, helps to avoid getting
trapped by many powerful atavisms and cultural biases and makes it
possible to sneak out of many gender stereotypes, etc.

Just wanted to throw out an extremely unqualified
opinion here.....but maybe the problem with AI
research is the limited environment that AI's were
subject to.   If you were born in an environment where
you could not see hear touch feel or taste, had no
dimensions to move through and no environment to
experience, how might you become?  I am aware of the
work with robots like COG, who have something like a
human environment, but that may have just been the
reverse problem: a lack of  processing power? 
*shrugs*  Anyhow....I was thinking if it incorporated
some of the latest systems, like the holographic cube
(if they ever make one that can store for more than 2
or 3 readings) and gave it a good enough set of
senses, like not one but tens or hundreds of sensory
units for touch, heat, and cold, and gave it maybe
some survival programs that were self alterable but
with difficulty....Im probably either saying something
stupid or echoing the sentiments of someone else, but
the er, nature never seemed established, noer the...
nurture complex enough. *laughs* Love to hear anyone
elses thoughts on this, especially criticism (just so
long as it's not angry:)).

I've heard about these types of technologies and there are a number of ways
to do this, and they all work like any other generator.  They just operate
at extreme velocities and therefore generate a shorter, bigger power spike.

The simplest would be something like the inverse of a rail gun.  The
explosives are used to drive an appropriate projectile through the tube at
extreme velocities.  Using low (deflagrating) explosives you could achieve
about 2,000 m/s and with high (detonating) explosives about 10,000 m/s.  As
long as you are not worried about where the projectile goes after it leaves
the generator, such a generator could be used many times at a rapid rate of
fire.  I've seen power generated this way, although neither with explosives
nor with any intent of doing something useful with the power generated.

Obviously, there are number of ways you could do this.  This was just the
first one to cross my mind.

That's not the test I took -- the one I took had a lot of questions about
how someone acts in certain situations and likes and dislikes and all that.
That's certainly not to say that the BEM test isn't just as good or better.
I just took the test, and these are the results:

"Your Femininity Score is 4.750

Your Masculinity Score is 5.100

You are sex-typed in neither direction. You are androgynous."

which is pretty much what my other test said:-)

FWIW, I remember that test being called the MMPI, not MMPT. Inventory, not
Test.
Don't know what they call it nowadays. I do know that for a very long time
its norms were rooted in 1953 USA. Good or bad, that was the diagnostic
milieu in which the original Inventory was developed. Any guess what the
DSM was like in 1953? :)

Mine:

"Your Femininity Score is 3.800
Your Masculinity Score is 4.150
You are sex-typed in neither direction. You are androgynous."

Does the lower aggregate mean anything? I wonder...

	i think i just might create a simulated biosphere populated with a 
couple of selfaware bipedal creatures adapted to exist perfectly in it, and 
set up a tree they werent supposed to eat from in there, and then have a 
snake come up to one of them and convince her to eat from the tree, and pass 
it on to her mate... then id get all pissed at them, and tell them how bad 
they were, and kick em outa the biosphere that was so perfect for em, and 
make life suck for em (childbirth would become painful, and plants would be 
hard to grow, etc...). 
	id sit back and watch as they reproduced and grew, and i would demand 
that they and all their offspring worship me, and call me holy, and most 
high, and all kindsa other meaningless shit. when their numbers swelled, and 
they started getting slightly technologically advanced, id make a big flood 
and wipe out everybody but a few faithful brown-nosers in a boat...
	then id wait a while, and pick one guy to demonstrate his dedication 
to me by trying to kill his son, then id use this lunatic as the father of my 
chosen people.  id lead this chosen people on brutal rampages thru the lands 
of all the peoples who refused to worship me... or who never heard of me, cuz 
i never bothered to tell them.
	then id do nothing for a while, and wait for my chosen people to 
forget about me (i programed them with short memories), then id cause some 
horrible tragidy to happen to them, and then they would kowtow to me for a 
while longer; at least till they forgot again...
	this cycle i would allow for some time, untill finally after a while, 
i would split my chosen people apart, and scatter them to the ends of the 
little biosphere in my head... then i would leave them to suffer and wonder 
why i was ignoring them for 400 years or so, then finally id go down to that 
little biosphere myself, and immerse myself within it.
	then id pick 12 special followers, and id go around spouting 
meaningless feel-good snippets of silly first degree attempted wisdom (have 
faith like a mustard seed! blessed are those who dont ask for evidance, 
thomas; etc...) and perform a few minor "miracles" (just change some code a 
bit) and have lotsa the little creatures worship me again. then, because i 
was tired of the little bipeds miserable existance, id stage a heroic 
"death", and reinstate my consciousness fully in myself again.
	then id sit back and watch the sane people battle my chosen people 
for a few thousand years, at which point id reassume my old 
inside-the-simulation form, and go back inside, and transport the few truly 
wacked people who still believed i existed after few-thousand-odd subjective 
years of silence to an eternal pleasure state, and condemn the rest to an 
eternal suffering-state. i would call this "justice".
	i would call myself "yhwh".

Okay I took the swaying gender test. 
My femininity score was 4.800
My masculinity score is 6.150
I am sex typed in the masculine direction.

Well, I'm not shocked, physically I am feminine but have always hung 
out with males and felt like their buddy (as their wives brought in 
beers to us watching the NBA-just kidding!)-nice thought though eh?

I just took it and got:

Your Femininity Score is 4.5

 Your Masculinity Score is 5.5

 You are sex-typed in the direction of Masculine.  (not by much though)

This looks like a pretty good site that addresses many of the issues we've
discussed.

It's true that all of these things are ultimately biological, but then so is
culture.

If you're arguing that there are two options here (male gender or female
gender), you need to look at some cultures that have more than two genders.

Gender is a cultural construct that entails far more than biological sex or
sexual preference, and we're expected to conform to certain rules that apply
to the gender (i.e. males are ridiculed for wearing dresses).

Ok, I didn't mean that on a factual basis but rather posed it as a 
question. 
And I wasn't refering to anyone having a precursor disposition to 
emotional problems as in a cause for lack of sex, but as a later 
effect of.(in the purely biophysical sense ie. hormones ect.)
And in response to the chauvinist male thing, I am a woman, and am 
not rearing one sex against another, I meant in general.

You have the right person now, but you don't have me pegged right. I never
said I disliked sex. I love sexual pleasure, as anyone who knows me can
attest.

I just dn't think that we need to assume that that which surpasses all other
forms of pure, instantaneous pleasure in our lives today will necessarily be
such 50 years from now.

It's easy to become married to the thought of sex as such as it's pretty
well built in to our biology, but let's just have a little bit of vision
here!

I was speaking of gender when it comes to primary sexual characteristics,
i.e. male and female. Yes, I know that hermaprhodites exist, both naturally
and otherwise, and we can count them in as a third. Other than that, that's
it for genders as far as I know. That is _not_ to say that there are only
two or three gender roles. But if you can show me a culture with more
physical genders than what I mentioned, I would love to see it.

>Gender is a cultural construct that entails far more than biological sex or

>to the gender (i.e. males are ridiculed for wearing dresses).

I certainly agree that culture influences behavior, but there have been
numerous studies done where female children were raised with the specific
purpose of influencing them into male gender roles and vice-versa. What was
found was that overall girls developed female characteristics such as
superior verbal communication skills and males developed male
characteristics such as playing cowboys and Indians. I am not suggesting
that anybody should have to conform to social standards; personally, I could
care less if a man wants to wear a dress. However, when it comes to
biological tendancies, some are more "male" and some are more "female", such
as spacial perception and navigating by landmarks. These tendencies are not
cultural constructs; they developed to perpetuate the survival of the human
race.

"cold fusion" has absolutely nothing to do with explosives. According to
what I read the only thing this device consumes is chemical explosives.

Considering that the actual measured increase in global temperatures
over the last century is so statistically small, with no prior database,
and far lower than that predidicted by the best of the tree hugger's
computer models, and given that we are only a few centuries past the end
of the Little Ice Age, as well as given that it is now known that
methane is a far more severe greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (and
less methane is being emitted into the atmosphere than a century ago),
the scientific basis for the greenhouse effect is still quite shakey.

Well, the worst DSM-III boner (pun intended) was classifying homosexuality
as a mental disorder.  That has, of course, been corrected.  In addition,
the MMPI has been revised (MMPI-II) and better norms have been established.

The MMPI scale Jocelyn is referring to was less revealing in terms of
sex-role identities.

I think this poem is by Edna St. Vincent Millay (sp?). The missing line 
goes something like this:  "But ah my foes and oh my friends/ It gives a 
lovely light"

I'm certain that's Emily Dickinson, "my candle burns at both ends"
(say what you will about her sentiments, she at least gets the meter
right), but I couldn't find it on the web at first try.  You may
have better luck.

Oops.  It's Edna St. Vincent Millay, not Emily Dickinson.

Like I said, I don't know for sure that the test I took to establish my
gender traits was the MMPI. I think it may have been an entirely different
test. I have just taken so many of them over the past ten years that I
forget which was which. I took the gender characteristic test around 4 years
ago, and I know that I took the test specifically for that reason. It asked
a lot of questions, I think rated something like 1-5 to represent a little
to a lot of agreement. The only specific question I remember was dealing
with which magazine I'd rather read: a car magazine or a family-circle style
magazine. Then again, it might not have had a rating scale -- it may have
been an either-or thing. I just don't remember. Any ideas?

Turning this thread back toward an Extropian theme:

We have always been and still are quite alone . . . islands, our minds
trapped inside our bony skulls.  One could argue that intra-species
communication was so powerfully adaptive that our brains just kept getting
larger and larger in order that we might form abstract language and more
effectively communicate with each other.  Still, our ability to communicate
effectively remains very limited.  It's one reason that relationships are so
hard.  But it seems our greatest joys are linked with our most intimate
moments, those moments when we are most connected.  Those moments often
occur when we are making love.  Because it is so physically intimate, we
chose this act to symbolize our deep desire to mentally *connect* with
another.

Technology will soon (relatively) provide us with the means to achieve
*real* communication.  Innumerable science fiction stories have dealt with
this idea, of course.  I assume it will either come in the form of
tech-enhanced mental telepathy or perhaps uploads will simply merge selected
portions of their data files.  Imagine directly experiencing your own
enhanced physical orgasm. . .and then directly experiencing your partner's
orgasm.  Wheee!

On a non-sexual level, imagine Extropians deciding that an e-mail based list
is way too tedious.  Let's just form a colony-mind, contributing whatever
portion of our individual psyches we choose to.  How powerful would that be?
How addictive would that be?  Can our species avoid eventually turning into
some Borg-variant . . . some global mind?

Just wondering.

Scott

Wow, okay.(I'll give you the benefit of the doubt Eric!!) I 
interpreted your message as sex will become irrelevent and we should 
focus on other things. I am a person who focuses on a variety of 
things, and on ocassion intertwines a few together. As was the idea 
of nanorgasm. 
This was my idea in a more elaborated text. To nail it down to the 
precise location in the body responsible for the "orgasm" and utilize 
this knowledge in future nanoscale technology. For example there may 
be groups in research areas (as there are in many fields including 
sex today) in the future that use this sort of manipulation to extend 
the sense. The Human Geneome Project is a group that is laying out 
the map to sequence the entire human genome. Could there be another 
group like this, to "project" the entire make up of a person's 
activities in life including sexually. These attributes could be 
manipulated and intertwined with other peak interests for a more 
severe effect. Or perhaps just to raise the level of effect, to 
heighten the sensation.

Title
  Radioprotective effects of antioxidative plant flavonoids in mice.
Source
  Mutation Research.  350(1):153-61, 1996 Feb 19.
Abstract
  Radioprotective effects of tea infusions and plant flavonoids were
  investigated by using the micronucleus test for anticlastogenic activity and
  the thiobarbituric acid assay for antioxidative activity. A single gastric
  intubation of rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis) infusion at
  1 ml per mouse 2 h prior to gama-ray irradiation (1.5 Gy) reduced the
  frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs). After the fractionation
  of rooibos tea infusion, the flavonoid fraction was found to
  be most anticlastogenic and antioxidative. From this fraction, luteolin was
  isolated as an effective component. Then, anticlastogenic effects of 12
  flavonoids containing luteolin and their antioxidative activities against
  lipid peroxidation by Fenton's reagent were examined. A good correlation
  (r=0.717) was observed between both activities. Luteolin showed the most
  effective potency. A gastric intubation of luteolin (10 micromoles/kg) 2 h
  prior to gamma-ray irradiation (6 Gy) suppressed lipid peroxidation in mouse
  bone marrow and spleen and a trend of protective effect of luteolin against
  the decrease of endogenous ascorbic acid in mouse bone marrow after gamma-ray
  irradiation (3 Gy) was observed. These results suggest that plant flavonoids,
  which show antioxidative potency in vitro, work as antioxidants in vivo and
  their radioprotective effects may be attributed to their scavenging potency
  towards free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, the flavonoids
  contained in tea, vegetables and fruits seem to be important as antioxidants
  in the human diet.

  The suppression of age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in rat brain
  by administration of Rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis).
Source
  Neuroscience Letters.  196(1-2):85-8, 1995 Aug 18.
Abstract
  The protective effects of Rooibos tea (RT), Aspalathus
  linearis, against damage to the central nervous system (CNS) accompanying
  aging were examined by both the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA) and
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in brains of chronically RT-treated
  rats. Ad libitum administration of RT was begun with 3-month-old Wistar
  female rats and continued for 21 months. The contents of TBA reactive
  substances (TBARS) in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and
  cerebellum in 24-month-old rats after administration with water were
  significantly higher than those in young rats (5 weeks old). However, no
  significant increase of TBARS was observed in RT-administered aged rats. When
  MR images of the brains of 24-month-old rats with and without RT as well as
  5-week-old rats were taken, a decrease of the signal intensity was observed
  in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in MR images of aged rats
  without RT, whereas little change of the signal intensity was observed in MR
  images of the same regions of 24-month-old rats treated with RT, whose images
  were similar to those of young rats. These observations suggested that (1)
  the age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in the brain was closely
  related to the morphological changes observed by MRI, and (2) chronic
  RT-administration prevented age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in
  several regions of rat brain.

Title
  The clastogen-suppressing effects of green tea, Po-lei tea and
  Rooibos tea in CHO cells and mice.
Source
  Mutation Research.  286(2):221-32, 1993 Apr.
Abstract
  The suppressing effects of crude extracts of three kinds of tea-green tea
  (GT) from Japan, Po-lei tea (PT) from China, and Rooibos tea
  (RT) from South Africa-on the induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured
  CHO cells and mice were studied. When CHO cells were exposed to each tea
  extract in the presence of rat liver microsomal enzymes (S9 mix) together
  with benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P) or mitomycin C (MMC), a decrease in the frequency
  of chromosome aberrations was observed. PT and RT, but not GT, also
  suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations by MMC in the absence of
  S9 mix. When cells were treated with tea extract after B(a)P or MMC
  treatment, RT suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations in the
  presence and absence of S9 mix whereas GT and PT showed suppressing effects
  only in the presence of S9 mix. These data suggest that catechines,
  well-known antimutagens in tea samples, might account for the inhibitory
  effect in the case of GT and PT. Since RT contains few catechines, several
  unknown antimutagenic components could be responsible for its effect. The
  antimutagenic effects of tea extracts at concentration levels consumed by
  humans were examined in mice using micronucleus induction with B(a)P or MMC.
  When mice received oral gavage of 0.2% GT, 0.1% PT, and 0.1% RT at 1.0
  ml/mouse 6 h before intraperitoneal injection of MMC, a decrease in the
  frequency of micronuclei was observed. The induction of micronuclei by B(a)P
  was suppressed by oral dosage of GT, PT and RT at 1.0 ml/mouse/day for 28
  days. This was not due to a delay in the maturation of micronucleated
  reticulocytes. In conclusion, intake of tea might suppress the mutagenic
  activity of certain potent mutagens in human beings.

Title
  [The effect of rooibos tea on iron absorption]. [Afrikaans]
Source
  South African Medical Journal.  55(16):631-2, 1979 Apr 14.
Abstract
  A study was carried out to determine if rooibos tea
  (Aspalathus linearis) has a deleterious effect on iron absorption similar to
  that of ordinary tea (Camellia sinensis). Three groups of volunteers, each
  consisting of 10 healthy young men comparable with regard to iron status and
  body dimensions, were studied. After ingestion of 1 muCi 59Fe and 16 mg of
  elemental iron, group A drank rooibos tea, group B ordinary
  tea and group C boiled water. Iron absorption was measured 14 days later with
  a whole body counter. Mean iron absorption after ingestion of
  rooibos tea, ordinary tea, and water was 7,25%, 1,70% and
  9,34% respectively. In contrast to ordinary tea (P less than 0,0001),
  rooibos tea did not affect iron absorption significantly.
  The ascorbic acid content of rooibos tea varies between
  121,8 and 154,9 mumol/l, depending on the method of preparation.
  Rooibos tea contains small amounts of iron, magnesium,
  phosphorus, sodium, chloride and potassium. These findings have practical
  nutritional and therapeutic implications.

What would really be cool is if we could change genders *temporarily* and
easily.  Would not we all become more insightful beings?  We could
create enough marital harmony that marriage half lives would exceed a
century, if only, at the impasse of any argument, the couple could both
temporarily switch gender.  I would not wish to *stay* the opposite
sex, but there is little I would not give to be able to walk a kilometer
in their mocassins.  spike

What about situations where one develops a totally unreasonable
crush on another person?  Or what about those situations where intimacy
*would have* evolved, except that one or both are sexually unavailable for
whatever reason, such as, one or both are already married to others?
These can  be deep, meaningful relationships that may even last for many
years, but never have the sexual context.  spike

I have heard that males have seminal cycles, like female menstrual 
cycles; if a man doesn't engage in sex in 28 days, he will have a 
nocturnal emission.  This gets rid of degraded DNA, thus reducing 
the frequency of birth defects.

Gasoline is the explosive driver of pistons in a conventional internal
combustion engine, which prevents battery drain through the alternator.  Any
fuel of an internal combustion engine does so by exploding.

Piezo-electric materials can generate electrical current from pressure, and
vice versa.  Very high pressure, eg, from high explosives, would probably tend
to destroy the piezo-electric materials.

Most nuclear reactors used for power generation do so by heating water, ie,
steam turbines create the electricity.

The Sun blankets the Earth each day with enough convertible power for pretty
much any power needs.  A satellite farm in orbit with large solar panel arrays
and a microwave downlink might be an efficient generator of power.

In atomic (fission) explosions, a tiny amount of the mass is converted to
energy.  This energy is somewhat uncontrollable, and has negative side effects
such as dirty radiation particles.

A device that could controllably convert minuscule amounts of matter to energy
in a harnessable fashion, would be the end-all be-all of power generation,
again barring extra-dimensional power sources.

I saw in the local news that California had passed a new
law making it legal to do physician assisted suicide.  Does
anyone know the details?  Does this cover the medic if
the patient wants to be frozen?  I understand the law makes
it a felony to coerce someone into suicide.  Does this threaten
those who would introduce, or perhaps recommend,
cryonics to a terminal patient?

	thats the second time ive noticed the phrase "extra-dimensional power 
sources" being used, and i couldnt think of anything (ok, my ignorance is 
showing; ill tuck it back in my pants) thats even been conceptualized that 
really fit that description. so, i stared into my navel like any good terry 
pratchet philosopher, and came up with the following:

//assumption one: stable wormhole tech exists.
//assumption two: the wormhole can be moved along with earths 
//movement, so as to stay relativly in one place on the earth surface

	anyway, i think ya probably get my halfassed idea. water is sprayed 
into a tube, where it falls thru a turbine and then thru a wormhole, from 
which it appears directly above the turbine again, and again, and again... if 
the wormhole is stable and is emitted somehow from something in a strong 
gravitional field, might this work?

`Gender' is primarily a linguistic marker term, in many languages only
loosely coupled to sex.  For the last decade or two, especially in feminist
discourse, it is usefully distinguished from `sex' which is the biological,
reproductive or morphological category.  `Male or female' is sex;
`feminine, masculine, ambi, neuter, lifeless, chiral,
washed-on-Tuesdays-while-wearing-an-emblematic-parrot (etc)' is gender.

Don't John Varley's `Eight Worlds' symbionts - humans merged with alien
space-dwelling slime molds - amount to a living solar sail?  And Niven's
star seeds (or did they just float haplessly from sun to sun?).  And Donald
Moffett's wonderful starfaring trees in THE GENESIS QUEST and SECOND GENESIS?

Very nice idea, it's true.

In regards to cultures with more than two genders, I am doing my research
right now and I will get back to you when I've got it all. I want to make
sure I have everything right....

My score was:

femenine 4.650
masculine 4.800

Androgynous.

Although, as in Greg Egan's excellent story _Closer_
(http://www.eidolon.net/old_site/issue_09/09_closr.htm), this might
actually not help. Sometimes insight actually doesn't help the
marriage.

Me too (5.2 male/4.85 female), but I don't feel weird about it. It was
roughly what I expected.

The fun thing would be to be able to adjust the ratio freely :-)

Depends on the wormhole physics. Given my understanding of it, the
device will not work. To keep a wormhole stable you need a "bracing"
field of some kind (negative energy is most commonly suggested,
although other weird physical processes might work). If you move mass
through the wormhole, the mass will interact with the bracing field
and this will change it. At least in the negative energy case you
would get that the field got weaker as you passed mass through it, and
if it ever got to zero, the wormhole will close. My guess is that if
you calculate the energy gains and losses in the above scenario you
will see that it will not produce perpetual motion, at most an amount
of energy equal to the amount of energy put into the wormhole.

Still, general relativity relaxes energy conservation somewhat, energy
is not well defined globally and in sufficiently odd spacetimes you
can get energy for free. And even in less odd spacetimes you can
likely extract energy from the spacetime (as in anisotropic collapsing
universes, where you can exploit the shear forces).

Don't worry, I never thought you were a male chauvinist (or female

I presume you're using the Royal we here? I pay more than 5 dollars a gallon

nothing I can do about it, other than join in the truck drivers' protests.

At least the Conservatives have finally decided that their mandatory annual

A one-way unreasonable crush is in my opinion not a healthy or meaningful

That's why I tried to specifiy that sex was important to maintaining a
marriage-style relationship and keeping it from devolving into a close
friendship. That's not at all to imply that close friendships are not deep
or meaningful, but they're not the same thing as marriage.

  Immobilization stress causes oxidative

Abstract
  Immobilization stress of male
  Sprague-Dawley rats induces oxidative damage to lipid, protein, and DNA in
  the brain. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation were found in the
  cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and midbrain compared to the
  unstressed controls. Significant increases in levels of
  protein oxidation were also found in the cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, and
  medulla oblongata. Oxidative nuclear DNA damage increased after
  stress in all brain regions, although only the cerebral
  cortex showed a significant increase. Depletion of glutathione showed some
  stimulation to oxidative damage in the unstressed control
  and stressed animals. Further studies of the mitochondrial
  and cytosol fractions of cerebral cortex demonstrated that mitochondria
  showed a significantly greater increase in lipid peroxidation and protein
  oxidation than cytosol. Data from plasma and liver showed oxidative damage
  similar to that of the brain. These findings provide evidence to support the
  idea that stress produces oxidants, and that the oxidative
  damage in stress could contribute to the degenerative
  diseases of aging, including brain dysfunction.

Title
  Growth inhibition of leukemic cells by (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, the main

Source
  Life Sciences.  63(16):1397-403, 1998.
Abstract
  In this report, we presented the results that EGCG, the main constituent of
  the polyphenols present in Japanese green
  tea inhibited growth of leukemic cell lines of both human
  and mice. The proliferation of human leukemic cell lines and mouse NFS60 cell
  line was inhibited by EGCG. Sensitivity of each line to EGCG was different,
  and more than 50% of DNA synthesis was reduced in all the cell lines in the
  presence of 50 microM EGCG. On the other hand, normal hematopoietic
  progenitor cells retained their natural function of supplying mature cells of
  various lineages in the presence of less than 10 microM EGCG in vitro. Even
  in the presence of 100 microM EGCG, half the colonies containing all the
  lineages of cells were developed. All the dead cells of each line showed
  characteristics of apoptosis, which might be due to inhibition by EGCG of
  growth factors' signaling. Besides anticarcinogenic activity, EGCG is
  expected to have a new function for leukemia therapy without side effects.

Title
  Influence of drinking green tea on breast
  cancer malignancy among Japanese patients.
Source
  Japanese Journal of Cancer Research.  89(3):254-61, 1998 Mar.
Abstract
  Inhibitory effects of green tea on
  carcinogenesis have been investigated in numerous laboratory studies using
  (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or crude green
  tea extract, and there is also some epidemiologic evidence.
  Further, EGCG has been reported to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, lung
  metastasis in an animal model, and urokinase activity. In this study, we
  first examined the association between consumption of green
  tea prior to clinical cancer onset and various clinical
  parameters assessed at surgery among 472 patients with stage I, II, and III
  breast cancer. We found that increased consumption of green
  tea was closely associated with decreased numbers of
  axillary lymph node metastases among premenopausal patients with stage I and
  II breast cancer and with increased expression of progesterone receptor (PgR)
  and estrogen receptor (ER) among postmenopausal ones. Since these are
  potential prognostic factors, we then investigated the prognosis of breast
  cancer with special reference to consumption of green
  tea, in a follow-up study of these patients. We found that
  increased consumption of green tea was
  correlated with decreased recurrence of stage I and II breast cancer (P <
  0.05 for crude disease-free survival); the recurrence rate was 16.7 or 24.3%
  among those consuming > or = 5 cups or < or = 4 cups per day, respectively,
  in a seven-year follow-up of stage I and II breast cancer, and the relative
  risk of recurrence was 0.564 (95% confidence interval, 0.350-0.911) after
  adjustment for other lifestyle factors. However, no improvement in prognosis
  was observed in stage III breast cancer. Our results indicate that increased
  consumption of green tea prior to clinical
  cancer onset is significantly associated with improved prognosis of stage I
  and II breast cancer, and this association may be related to a modifying
  effect of green tea on the clinical
  characteristics of the cancer.

Title
  Cancer-preventive effects of drinking green
  tea among a Japanese population.
Source
  Preventive Medicine.  26(6):769-75, 1997 Nov-Dec.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies have revealed the cancer preventive effects of
  green tea, so the association between
  green tea consumption and cancer was
  examined in a human population. METHODS: The association between
  green tea consumption and cancer incidence
  was studied in our prospective cohort study of a Japanese population. We
  surveyed 8,552 individuals over 40 years of age living in a town in Saitama
  prefecture on their living habits, including daily consumption of
  green tea. During the 9 years of follow-up
  study (71,248.5 person-years), we identified a total of 384 cases of cancer
  in all sites. RESULTS: We found a negative association between
  green tea consumption and cancer incidence,
  especially among females drinking more than 10 cups a day. The slowdown in
  increase of cancer incidence with age observed among females who consumed
  more than 10 cups a day is consistent with the finding that increased
  consumption of green tea is associated with
  later onset of cancer. Age-standardized average annual incidence rate was
  significantly lower among females who consumed large amounts of
  green tea. Relative risk (RR) of cancer
  incidence was also lower among both females (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.98)
  and males (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.39-1.21) in groups with the highest
  consumption, although the preventive effects did not achieve statistical
  significance among males, even when stratified by smoking and adjusted for
  alcohol and dietary variables. CONCLUSION: Our epidemiological study showed
  that green tea has a potentially preventive
  effect against cancer among humans.

Interesting, though I suspect not too meaningful.
Does this Bem fellow have an agenda, or is this
supposed to be semi-serious research (or at least
as serious as it's possible for psychiatry to be)?

Seems to be reasonably serious, judging from the Medline
references. At least many other papers use her inventory, and they
have been accepted in Peer-reviewed journals.

New Study Questions `Gay Gene'
 By LAURAN NEERGAARD= AP Medical Writer=

     WASHINGTON (AP) _ Canadian scientists are questioning whether a
 gene inherited from mothers influences men's sexual orientation in
 a study that attacks U.S. researchers' hunt for a ``gay gene.''
     Scientists still can't explain what determines a person's sexual
 orientation, although many studies have suggested that it is
 biology and not choice.
     The first such evidence came in 1991, when researchers
 discovered that identical twins of gay men were much more likely to
 also be gay than were fraternal twins.
     Then National Cancer Institute geneticist Dean Hamer made
 headlines in 1993 by suggesting that one such gene resides in a
 region of the X chromosome, one of the microscopic structures that
 carry genes. Men inherit that chromosome from their mothers.
     Although Hamer never identified the gene itself, his research
 suggested its location by finding that 33 of 40 pairs of gay
 brothers shared certain genetic ``markers'' that heterosexual brothers
didn't.
     But in a report to be published in Friday's journal Science,
 Canadian scientists said they tried to reproduce Hamer's study and
 found no link.     Neurologist George Rice of the University of Western
Ontario
 studied gay brothers from 48 families and said they were no more
 likely to share X-linked genetic patterns than would be determined by
chance.
     That doesn't mean genes don't influence homosexuality, Rice
 said, just that scientists should hunt elsewhere. ``We are still
 looking,'' he said.
     Hamer vehemently defended his research, saying other scientists
 have found evidence supporting it. ``This study doesn't disprove
 that,'' he said.
     Hamer said Rice may have diluted chances of finding an X-linked
 gene by studying families with homosexuality mostly on the father's
 side instead of the mother's.
     Rice said he didn't single out families _ and that excluding
 those that concerned Hamer wouldn't affect the results.
     Rice's report ``certainly does decrease the likelihood'' of an
 X-linked gene, but isn't proof, said J. Michael Bailey of
 Northwestern University, who did the first gay twin research. He
 called for a larger study to settle the debate.
     ``I would bet a million dollars that there are going to be
 biological factors involved in sexual orientation. I am certainly
 less sure that it's genes,'' he added, noting that hormones or
 other factors may be the answer.

Odd, did it acutally say "in the direction of feminine" or did it say
"neither direction" or did it say "androgynous"?  The relatively low scores
and the small gap between scores looks more like "undifferetiated".

As for the validity of the BEM SRI, it is indeed a well-established
psychological instrument that has been used in a large number of studies.
It suffers many of the same problems that other self-report instruments do,
but it has been around for quite a while (I'm guessing 15-20 years).  Bem,
btw, is a female.

I may be mistaken, but I think that "sex-typed in neither direction"
represents the Undifferentiated Type.  Doesn't it explicitly say
"Androgynous" if that is the result?

I haven't written to this list for about two years.  I used to write
quite frequently for about six months in 1996.  Since then, I have
thought much about the issues being discussed on this list and other
issues which are of interest to Extropians.  I have mostly explored ways
to increase intelligence and creativity in humans and have developed many
activities which help increase intelligence and creativity and could be
implemented in educational systems that are devoted to helping
individuals develop their abilities as fully as possible.  Currently, I
want to write much about my ideas (to this list and elsewhere) and
promote more advanced approaches to education.  I'm also hoping to
participate in the development of more advanced schools (more details
later on my ideas for these schools).  

For now, I just want to say hello and let you know that I am back on the
list.

"Neither direction"; I just thought it was amusing that the Fem
score was a touch higher.  Not too surprising for me though.  I've
never been particularly aggressive or ambitious, and those traits
seemed to be heavily weighted on this test.  It was also a running
joke with my last girlfriend that whenever we went to the theater,
she wanted to see the shoot-em-up and I wanted to see the chick flick.

I wonder what would happen if we averaged all of our scores to see 
what we as a group are directed towards! Going over most of the 
resulats there's a lot of middle of the row results (although I was 
on the boyer side of things) Does anyone have all the figures to 
calculate what we are as a group? Is everyone done?

I'd like to apologize to the list as a whole and to those individuals
that received that message personally.
When I got the original message it seemed somewhat of a hoot and also a
symbolic way of tweaking the oil monopolies, I intended to forward it
_only_ to people in my personal address book but obviously didn't delete
all the references I should have.
For what it's worth, all copies were sent as 'Blind Copy' so I don't
think I've compromised anyone.
Again, my apologies, I goofed :-}.

I remember an episode of the new "Outer Limits" dealt with this idea exactly.

66 cloned cows processed for beef in Japan 
Kyodo News Service/Associated Press


TOKYO, April 23 (Kyodo) -- A total of 66 cloned cows have been 
processed for beef, and the milk from four others have been sold at 
markets, according to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries released Friday. 

The animals were among 461 cows that were cloned from 1990 until 
March this year by technique in which the nuclei of fertilized eggs 
are transplanted into unfertilized eggs. 

Of the total number of cows, 144 were shipped to markets, according 
to the survey that examined 57 livestock research stations 
nationwide. 

Of the 144, 19 animals were raised at government research institutes, 
64 at prefectural research institutes and 61 at private enterprises, 
according to the survey. 

The ministry does not release the names of the companies to avoid 
damaging their reputations, although cloned cows are not believed to 
pose any safety problems. 

They are raised at experimental stations across Japan to improve the 
productivity of the livestock industry. 

The ministry maintains that because cows produced by the technology 
are biologically identical to those born naturally, restrictions on 
their shipment are not necessary. 

The survey also found that 57 cows cloned from an adult cell, or the 
same cloning technique as used for "Dolly" the sheep, were produced 
in Japan by the end of March. 

None of those cows, however, have been shipped, the ministry said.

Dna-based Chips Diagnose Disease-- And Raise Hackles 
The Sacramento Bee

It looks like a run-of-the-mill silicon computer chip. It's flat, 
dark gray and no bigger than a thumbnail. But this is a very special 
chip: Its job is to find out whether people are likely to get cancer. 

Similar chips are being made for other diseases, including AIDS, 
leukemia and tuberculosis, and eventually there will be chips that 
will even predict the behavioral traits of unborn babies. 

DNA chip technology is a burgeoning new area of medicine and genetics 
that promises to revolutionize disease diagnosis. But it is also 
generating growing controversy, with calls for international controls 
to make sure it is not abused. 

Current laboratory techniques for detecting genetic mutations that 
are responsible for disease are time-consuming and expensive, taking 
months, even years. In contrast, a DNA chip takes minutes, or at most 
hours, to seek out disease-causing mutations in genes. 

Though the technology is complex, the theory behind the process is 
simple. Instead of having intricate microelectronic circuits etched 
onto their surfaces, these tiny chips are coated with DNA sequences, 
some of which are associated with a healthy gene while others are 
known disease-causing mutations. 

The sequences, up to 400,000 on a single tiny chip, line up in the 
squares of a grid on the surface of the chip. A sample of the 
patient's DNA is then put onto the chip and each sequence pairs off 
with its opposite number. Whether or not they are exactly the same as 
their partner is then detected by a laser. 

A patient whose DNA exactly matches with a known mutation on the chip 
may be at risk from that particular disease. If the DNA fails to 
match with a known healthy sequence, that can also indicate potential 
problems. 

"It is incredibly rapid. What you are relying on is that you will 
recognize differences between the DNA on the chip and DNA you are 
looking at. In terms of a quick screen, it is masterful because it 
gives you a quick answer and it is cheap," says Dr. Gareth Evans, 
consultant geneticist at Christie's Hospital in Manchester, England. 

Half a dozen companies are now working on producing variations of 
these chips and California-based Affymetrix has launched three for 
use by researchers. The jewel in the crown at present is a chip that 
works on a gene called p53 that is abnormal in more than half of all 
types of cancers. 

At the Houston Advanced Researcher Center, Dr. Dat Dao and a team of 
researchers are working on chips that will be able to pinpoint 
antibiotic-resistant strains of TB. Another chip detecting mutations 
linked to breast cancer is in the pipeline, and the center is also 
working on one that will take some of the uncertainty out of matching 
donor tissue for bone marrow transplants. 

"This genosensor technology is going to create a host of benefits for 
the diagnosis of cancer as well as genetic and infectious diseases. 
It is going to be the diagnostic tool of the future," says Dao. 

Dr. Mike Ramsay of the Oak Ridge National laboratory in Tennessee, 
who also works with DNA chips, agrees: "This technology could be used 
to screen for people carrying genes that predispose them to getting 
breast cancer, becoming obese, or having children with cystic 
fibrosis. To make such an analysis we eventually hope to require only 
a few white blood cells or skin cells." 

But the rapidly evolving technology is seen by some as a Pandora's 
box, with almost as many ethical dilemmas as benefits. One of the 
biggest fears is that the chips will be seen as the ideal tool for 
the establishment of widespread genetic screening of all types and 
for all kinds of motives. 

"Today's supply of screening for young couples is restricted to 
cystic fibrosis and a few rare diseases that are confined to specific 
populations. The chip, however, will broaden the spectrum of 
analyzable parental traits practically ad libitum," says Dr. Wolfram 
Henn, a clinical geneticist at the University of Hamburg in Germany 
who raised concerns about the technology in this month's Journal of 
Medical Ethics. 

The chief area for concern is prenatal screening, where DNA chips, 
the developers claim, will make it possible to test for every disease 
and trait in an unborn baby. 

"The subjective choice of genetic traits that are considered as 
prenatal selection criteria may blur the distinction between 
preventative medicine and striving for the perfectly designed child," 
he says.

Study Discloses New Component of Cells' Built-In Suicide Program; 
Research Finding Opens Uncharted Area of Cell Life/Death 
BUSINESS WIRE

Company Multilink   
    Howard Hughes Medical Institute

 BOSTON--(BW HealthWire)--April 22, 1999--Scientists at Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute and Duke University Medical Center have uncovered a 
new portion of the circuitry that controls the natural death of cells 
-- a malfunction of which may underlie diseases ranging from cancer 
to heart disease to autoimmune disorders. 

The study, published in the April 23 issue of Science, not only opens 
a previously uncharted area of cell life to scientific study, but 
also identifies new targets for therapies that can return diseased 
cells to the normal path of mortality. 

"This research elucidates how cells naturally commit suicide, or 
undergo 'apoptosis,'" says Joan Mannick, M.D., of Dana-Farber, who co-
authored the study with Jonathan Stamler, M.D., a [ Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute ] researcher at Duke. "We now know that in addition 
to the controls on apoptosis that have already been identified, 
there's another control system that works in unison with them." 

The study focuses on a protein called caspase which is an essential 
component of cells' suicide machinery. 

In the laboratory, chemical bundles of nitric oxide (NO) can be made 
to attach to, or become detached from, caspase. This coupling and 
decoupling can have a powerful effect on a protein's activity. When 
caspase proteins are bound to NO, they're essentially handcuffed from 
performing their normal function. When the NO is removed, cell death 
can proceed. 

But whether such binding and unbinding occurs in living cells -- and 
what it would mean if it does -- has been unclear. In fact, only a 
few types of proteins have been found to be attached to NO in cells. 

The current study involved human lymphocytes, white blood cells that 
help provide immune protection against disease. Such cells perform a 
variety of functions, but one thing they don't do is produce much NO. 

Mannick and her colleagues extracted caspase from lymphocytes that 
were in a "resting" state -- that is, not yet embarked on apoptosis. 
To their surprise, they found the protein had an NO group attached. 


"The fact that we found NO attached to proteins even in cells that 
produce very little of it indicates that NO may help regulate protein 
function in a much broader range of cells than was previously 
appreciated," Mannick says. 

The nature of its role became clear when researchers triggered the 
cells' apoptosis mechanism. The caspase proteins collected from the 
apoptotic cells had lost their NO. 

"This is the first time that NO has been found to attach and detach 
from caspase in living cells," Mannick says. "It represents a new 
control mechanism for cell death, and potentially, a new mechanism 
for controlling other cell functions." 

Researchers were able to detect the presence or absence of NO thanks 
to technology developed by Stamler and his colleagues at Duke. The 
Duke team has developed new techniques which make it possible to find 
minute amounts of NO within cells. 

Previous work by the Stamler lab has shown that NO represents a key 
on-off switch for a variety of cell functions. "The new study 
confirms that apoptosis is one of them," Stamler says. 

Besides demonstrating that the control system for apoptosis has a 
previously unknown layer of complexity, the new study may offer new 
prospects for therapy. 

"Defects in apoptosis contribute not only to cancer, in which cells 
are blocked from committing suicide, but also in conditions such as 
stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, in which cells die too 
readily," Stamler says. "Knowing more about the systems that controls 
apoptosis provides new opportunities for therapies aimed at 
correcting the system when it goes awry."

heh,heh.

Actually we have (supposedly) some EMP bombs in the inventory that
use a similiar effect, there were diagrams in Winn Schwartau's book

I'll play:

                     Your Femininity Score is 4.150

                     Your Masculinity Score is 4.950


              You are sex-typed as near masculine.

More balanced than I'd expected.

Yep, and a shaped charge would be another reasonable way to rig an MHD
burst generator. More like a solid rocket design, less like a bomb. I
forgot about the metal needed in the exhaust. Thanks for reminding me. :)

Here is a summary of the BEM results.  I did notice that this instrument
does have a bug.  The mid-point (neutral valence) for each item is 4.  When
there is no directionality in your scores, the survey says so and concludes
that you are Androgynous.  This is only true, however, if your scores are
both above the mid-point since this means that you are endorsing attributes
from both genders.  If your scores are non-directional and below or very
close to 4, you would actually be classified as Undifferentiated, since you
aren't really endorsing attributes from either gender.  Curt Adams, for
example, appears relatively Undifferentiated but was above the mid-ppoint so
I classified him as Masc.


Name  Feminine  Masculine Type

Jocelyn Brown  4.75  5.10  Andro

Billy Brown   4.10  5.80  Masc

Scott Badger  4.50  5.50  Masc

Damien Broderick  1.95  5.10  Masc

Michael Lorrey  3.90  6.20  Masc

Eddie Sullivan  5.25  5.00  Andro

Greg Burch   4.00  5.95  Masc

Michael Butler  3.80  4.15  Undiff

James Rogers  3.15  6.25  Masc

Gina Miller   4.80  6.15  Masc

Diego A Mayer-Cantu 4.15  4.65  Masc

Eric Ruud   4.65  4.80  Andro

Anders Sandberg  4.85  5.20  Andro

Lee Daniel Crocker 3.85  3.70  Undiff

Curt Adams   4.45  4.15  Andro

William Wyatt  3.70  5.80  Masc

Alejandro Dubrovsky 4.60  3.45  Femin

Countzero   4.15  4.95  Masc


Summary Statistics

Mean    4.14  5.11  Masc

Undifferentiated  11.0%
Masculine            55.5%
Feminine               5.5%
Androgynous      28.0%

So, Extropians appear to be strongly disposed toward traditionally masculine
attributes, although a significant number are Androgynous.  I can't find it
in the archives, but didn't the Myers-Briggs test we took earlier reveal
that the largest group was ENTJ?  It's very likely that there's a strong
relationship between these two measures.

Well, I took the test.

I'd like to apologize for this heinous act to those members of this list
who have the misforture to be a female in a late-twentieth-century
English/American culture.

The apology is for actually taking the test, and marking off items like
"self-reliant" or "placatory" without thinking anything other than
"these terms aren't very well-defined, sounds like more New Age psychobabble".

On the other hand, when it struck me - about an hour later - that
categories like "self-reliant" were being categorized as "male" while
"placatory" was supposed to be "female", I screamed and threw my monitor
across the room, having realized the breath-taking magnitude of the
casual stereotyping.  Thus I have no intention whatsoever of saying what
my scores were.

Of course it's stereotyping.  Of course it's prejudiced.  That's
the point of it: to measure how a person evaluates emself with
respect to cultural roles/expectations which are prejudice by
definition.  This isn't about measuring some fundamental attribute
of who you are, it's about measuring some attributes of how you
relate to the prejudiced culture in which you find yourself.

This test could be used as a tool to fight those stereotypes
just as it might be used to reinforce them.  Whatever numbers
result from passing that particular set of words through your
mind do indeed measure something--what it is can be debated.
Denying the numbers is not debate, just stubbornness.

I have to second some of what Eliezer said.
Putting my own spin on the characterological adjective situation here:
"Undifferentiated" may very well be a feature, not a bug; people who don't
label themselves strongly (self-scoring) may just be Myers-Briggs Ps rather
than Js (to name one possibility).
Guessing from his described actions, I'd rate Eliezer as a 0-0. :)

Oh brother.

Once again, this instrument has been used by respected academicians in
hundreds of studies that have appeared in scores of peer-reviewed journals.
Apparently, your insight never occured to them.

The author of this instrument was fully aware that the descriptors were
stereotypes.  The explicit purpose of the instrument was to assess the
degree to which an individual endorses attributes _traditionally_ associated
with males or _traditionally_ associated with females.  Self-Reliance is
_traditionally_ considered to be a masculine trait.   But there's no value
judgment offered here.  No one is saying that's how it should be, and only
you appear outraged.

I'll have to have my wife take the test.  Should be interesting to compare.

Perhaps.  But...

This ever popular idea *isn't* a p.m.machine.  It's simply a way of
extracting energy from the gravitational field beneath one mouth and using
it to drive a turbine.  It's not essentially different, it seems to me, to
the decades' old idea of mining a black hole's energy by lowering junk into
it on a rope.

I assume then you either had a spare monitor or an eidetic memory. :)

  Metallurgy Magic
Microsope and Mathematics Put Atomic Theories to the Test 

 By Michael J. Martinez
ABCNEWS.com
April 23  For centuries people have tried to strengthen metals by 
combining them: creating alloys of two or more metals in hopes of 
producing a stronger, lighter and more malleable material. 
     Until now that process has proceeded by trial and error, though 
there have been notable successes, like the titanium-aluminium alloys 
used in the hulls of airplanes. But what if scientists could develop 
a mathematical model for creating the strongest, lightest alloys 
possible? 
The electron microscope at Johns Hopkins sends a stream of electrons 
through an atom and then through a prism filter. By measuring the 
differences in how the electrons react, researchers can identify the 
atom in question. Click on the interactive box to see a history of 
the microscope's development. (ABCNEWS.com) 
 

     Using a new electron microscope, researchers at Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore and at Northwestern University in Chicago are 
studying how individual atoms in an alloy are connected, and how 
those connections change when the metal is bent and shaped. With that 
information they may be able to develop just such a mathematical 
model for the creation of alloys. 
Every Atom in Its Place
Under a grant from the U.S. Air Force, the two universities are 
working on new materials for eventual use in fighter jets and other 
aircraft.

top images shows a small grain of the alloy about 10mm in diameter.

Lab)
 
     The first step, according to Johns Hopkins researcher Kevin 
Hemker, is to identify the atoms and their crystalline connections 
within the alloy. To do that, Hemkers team uses an electron 
microscope with a field-emission gun, developed by Philips Electron 
Optics. 
     There are no more than two dozen electron microscopes in the 
country, Hemker points out. Its the field-emission gun that makes 
this one special. 
     The gun sends an extremely narrow beam of electrons  less than 
a nanometer (one billionth of a meter) across  through a single atom 
and then through a prism. The electrons that pass through the atom 
are slowed considerably. When the electrons then pass through the 
prism, the paths of the slower electrons are altered much more than 
the paths of those that did not pass through the atom. By measuring 
those changes, the team can identify the atom under examination. 

Clashing Crystals
The next step is to study how those atoms arrange themselves into 
crystals, and how those crystals interact when the metal is bent and 
shaped into objects. Bending an object causes defects in the crystals 
called dislocations to occur. Those dislocations are difficult to 
correct. 
     Think of a coat hanger, Hemker says. When you bend it, its 
relatively easy. But try to bend it back into the shape it held 
before. Thats a lot harder, and thats because the atoms were packed 
tighter around where you bent it, and arent as willing to bend 
back. 
     The John Hopkins team plans to study different alloys  aluminum-
titanium and copper-gold, for example  to see not only how theyre 
formed on an atomic level, but how their atomic structures are 
affected when the material is bent. 

Mathematics and Metallurgy
Identifying and altering individual atoms in an alloy crystal is one 
thing  figuring out what to do with the information is something 
else. Thats where the Materials Research Center at Northwestern 
comes in. 
     A team of researchers led by physics professor Art Freeman has 
been preparing mathematical computer models of different alloys, to 
show how distortions rearrange the crystalline latticework of atoms. 
Using mathematical values for each alloy, they will then compare 
those findings with Hemkers results. 
     If they agree with our predictions, we say A-ha!, the theory 
is really developed and is on the right track, says Freeman. If 
not, we have to go back and find out which assumptions were 
incorrect. 
     In the end, they are hoping to create a purely mathematical 
system to determine which atoms would make the best alloys. In this 
way, Hemker says, the trial-and-error metallurgy of centuries past 
could give way to computer simulations of new and promising alloys. 
     We would be able to see how any element, introduced into an 
alloy structure, would change it. 
     With millions of possible combinations, scientists eventually 
hope to find the perfect alloy  stronger than steel, lighter than 
down.

A powerful new electron microscope and some new mathematical models 
may aid researchers in the quest for the ultimate alloy.

Here's an article that is interesting considering our recent 
conversations. 
  
 
Source:   American Academy Of Neurology (http://www.aan.com/) 
Date:   Posted 4/22/99 

Gender-Specific Differences Found In Human Brain 
Toronto (April 20, 1999) -- Men and women's brains are distinctly 
different. While men have more neurons in the cerebral cortex, the 
brain's outer layer, women have more neuropil, which contains the 
processes allowing cell communication. Research showing these gender-
specific differences was presented during the American Academy of 
Neurology 51st Annual Meeting April 17 -- 24, 1999, in Toronto. 
"The cerebral cortex is responsible for voluntary movements, 
perception of sensory input and of highly complex functions such as 
memory, learning, reasoning and language," said Gabrielle de Courten-
Myers, MD, study author and associate professor of neuropathology at 
the University of Cincinnati. "Males possess more tightly packed and 
more numerous nerve cells (neurons) than females. Neurons send and 
receive electrical signals that influence many functions of the body 
and create thoughts and feelings. Females tend to have more neuropil, 
the fibular tissue that fills the space between nerve cell bodies and 
contains mainly nerve cell processes (synapses, dendrites and axons) 
that enable neurons to communicate with numerous other nerve cells." 

This research may explain previous findings that women are more prone 
to dementing illnesses than are men. Although a man and woman may 
lose the same number of neurons due to a disease, such as dementia, 
the woman's functional loss may be greater because the cells lost are 
more densely connected with other neurons. Added de Courten-Myers, 
"Conversely, in males, the 'functional reserve' may be greater as a 
larger number of nerve cells are present, which could prevent some of 
the functional losses." 

Although these gender-specific variations cause tangible differences 
in how the brain functions, one type is not "better" or "worse" than 
the other. Said de Courten-Myers, "It seems reasonable to assume that 
specific functions may benefit from the presence of more cells while 
others may be enhanced by a larger number of connections between 
them. A better understanding of these issues may potentially affect a 
wide spectrum of human activities such as health care, psychology and 
teaching." 

The researchers measured the cortex thickness and counted nerve cells 
from various sites within the healthy brains of 17 deceased subjects 
(10 males and seven females). 

"The recognition of gender-specific ways of thinking and feeling -- 
rendered more credible given these established differences -- could 
prove beneficial in enhancing interpersonal relationships." Said de 
Courten-Myers, "However, the interpretation of the data also has the 
potential for abuse and harm if either gender would seek to construct 
evidence for superiority of the male or female brain from these 
findings." 

The American Academy of Neurology, an association of more than 15,000 
neurologists and neuroscience professionals, is dedicated to 
improving patient care through education and research.

I did the last one, back when we were playing that ENTP game.
If no one else jumps on it, I will compile results sometime next week.

Probably.  I didn't save that part and wasn't thinking of androgynous
and undifferentiated as different.  Mine may have said androgynous, 
though.

Title
  Grape juice but not orange or grapefruit juice inhibits platelet activity in
  dogs and monkeys.
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  128(12):2307-12, 1998 Dec.
Abstract
  Platelet aggregation (PA) contributes to both the development of
  atherosclerosis and acute platelet thrombus formation (APTF) followed by
  embolization producing cyclic flow reductions (CFR) in stenosed and damaged
  dog and human coronary arteries. In seven anesthetized dogs with coronary
  stenosis and medial damage, CFR occurred at 7 +/- 3/30 min and were abolished
  127 +/- 18 min after gastric administration of 10 mL of purple grape
  juice/kg. Collagen-induced ex vivo whole blood PA decreased by 49 +/- 9%
  after the abolishment of CFR with grape juice. Ten mL of orange juice/kg (n =
  5) and 10 mL of grapefruit juice/kg (n = 5) had no significant effect on the
  frequency of the CFR or on ex vivo PA. In vitro studies have suggested that
  flavonoids bind to platelet cell membranes and thus may have an accumulative
  or tissue-loading effect over time. To test this we fed 5 mL of grape
  juice/kg to 5 cynomologous monkeys for 7 d. Collagen-induced ex vivo PA
  decreased by 41 +/- 17% compared to control (pre-reatment) after 7 d of
  feeding. In the same 5 monkeys, neither 5 mL of orange juice/kg nor 5 mL of
  grapefruit juice/kg given orally for 7 d produced any significant change in
  PA. Grape juice contains the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin,
  which are known inhibitors of PA in vitro. Orange juice and grapefruit juice,
  while containing less quercetin than grape juice, primarily contain the
  flavonoids naringin, luteolin and apigenin glucoside. The flavonoids in
  grapes were shown in vitro to be good inhibitors of PA,
  whereas the flavonoids in oranges and grapefruit to be poor inhibitors of PA.
  The consumption of grape juice, containing these inhibitors of PA, may have
  some of the protection offered by red wine against the development of
  coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute occlusive thrombosis, whereas orange
  juice or grapefruit juice may be ineffective. Thus, grape juice may be a
  useful alternative dietary supplement to red wine without the concomitant
  alcohol intake.

  Expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes in red and white
  grapes.
Source
  Plant Molecular Biology.  32(3):565-9, 1996 Nov.
Abstract
  The expression of seven genes from the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was
  determined in different tissues of Shiraz grapevines. All of the tissues
  contained proanthocyanidins, but only the berry skin accumulated
  anthocyanins. In most tissues, all of the flavonoid genes except UDP
  glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase (UFGT) were expressed, but UFGT
  expression was only detected in berry skin. Similar patterns of expression
  were observed in the skin of other red grapes. In white
  grapes, UFGT expression was not detected. White grape
  cultivars appear to lack anthocyanins because they lack UFGT, although they
  also had decreased expression of other flavonoid pathway genes.

  A case-control study of oral cancer in Beijing, People's Republic of China.
  Associations with nutrient intakes, foods and food groups.

Abstract
  A case-control study of oral cancer was conducted in Beijing, People's
  Republic of China to examine the association between dietary nutrient intake
  and risk of oral cancer, both in terms of estimated intake of nutrients and
  micro-nutrients, and in terms of specific foods and food groups. The study
  was hospital-based and controls were hospital in-patients matched for age and
  sex with the cases. The response rate for cases and controls was 100% and 404
  case/control pairs were interviewed. The results suggest that increased
  protein and fat intake are related to a decreased risk of oral cancer.
  Carbohydrate intake, however, showed a moderate increased risk for oral
  cancer. Total carotene intake and carotene intake from fruits and vegetables
  are inversely associated with risk of oral cancer. A similar pattern was
  observed for dietary vitamin C intake. Dietary fibre derived from fruits and
  vegetables showed a strong negative association with oral cancer risk, but
  fibre derived from other sources did not exhibit any protective effect. At
  the level of foods and food groups, increased consumption of fresh meat,
  chicken and liver was significantly associated with a reduction in oral
  cancer risk: the tests for trend were all statistically significant at the P
  < 0.01 level. Consumption of common carp, hairtail, shrimp and lobster were
  also associated with decreased risk. Risk was found to increase with
  increasing consumption of millet and corn bread (P < 0.01) but to decrease
  with increasing consumption of rice (P < 0.01). Increased consumption of
  grapes, bananas, oranges, tangerines, peaches and pears were
  associated with reduced risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title
  The role of dietary fiber in satiety, glucose, and insulin: studies with
  fruit and fruit juice.
Source
  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  34(2):211-7, 1981 Feb.
Abstract
  Healthy volunteers ingested sugar-equivalent meals of oranges and orange
  juice and of grapes and grape juice. Satiety, assessed by
  two subjective scoring systems, was greater after whole fruit than after
  juice and the return of appetite was delayed. With oranges, as previously
  reported with apples, there was a significantly smaller insulin response to
  fruit than to juice and less postabsorptive fall in plasma glucose. With
  grapes, the insulin response to the whole fruit was,
  paradoxically, more than that to the juice, while postabsorptive glucose
  values were similar. The glucose in grapes appeared to be
  more insulinogenic than that in oranges and apples. Conversely, grape juice
  evoked less insulin than expected, possibly because its high osmolality
  delayed gastric emptying. However, diluting it did not increase its
  insulinogenicity. The plasma insulin and glucose responses to fruit appear to
  depend on the fiber as well as the glucose content of the fruit.

The inbreeding of livestock such as cattle over the past hundreds of
years has led to a very limited genepool, not far from cloning anyways.
The same holds for turkeys, chickens, and pigs, as well as laboratory
animals such as mice and rats, which are bred specifically to be
identical as possible.

Yeah, to say nothing of how "these issues" (neuroscience) may potentially
enable extropian humanity to emerge. We can't know anything about "better"
or "worse" in the case of human brains because we don't know enough about
how brains work. (When scientists know enough about how brains work so that
they can identify what makes them "better" or "worse", better scientists may
wonder what kind of brain becomes a Buddha, while worse scientists may try
to build one.)

Just as we shouldn't judge books by their covers (even though everyone
does), so it makes no sense to try to determine the potential capability of
brains by looking at them, because neuroscience has not yet established
reliable correlations between specific brain structures and performance
excellence. It does, nevertheless, seem intriguing that only male brains
have attained the cognitive eminence of Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna,
Christ, Lao Tzu, Socrates, Gurdjieff, et al.

 Einstein's brain did (does -- they keep it in a jar) look different (under
the microscope) than other brains, but perhaps that has to do with the way
he used it. Sort of like callouses on hard working hands.

Oh, there's no doubt that the ladies can kick butt.  Here's a scene from a 
hearing I participated in on Tuesday: A toxic tort case in which there are 
dozen of defendants, each one has one or more lawyers in the courtroom.  Of 
these, only four are women.  It so happened that the motion jointly filed by 
about ten of the defendants (including my client) had been drafted by one of 
the female lawyers (the rest of us just signed the motion to say "me, too"); 
so the drafter argued the motion, an intimidating task of advocacy for 
anyone.  She won.

At my alma mater (Univ. Of Tex. Law School), the incoming classes have been 
slightly more than half female for a decade.  Interestingly, PERSISTENCE in 
the profession remains relatively low for women, although it is increasing 
slowly.  IMHO, the problem is that the high-effort first decade of practice 
corresponds to the traditional child-bearing and child-rearing years, 
presenting intense conflicts for women relative to traditional gender 
assignments.  By and large, people attracted to and successful in the legal 
profession tend to be conventional in their thinking and values (perhaps 
because they have to be comfortable in rule-driven systems where systemic 
change happens only slowly), so the pressure to conform to child-bearing and 
-rearing norms is felt intensely by women also attempting to succeed in a 
legal career.

But, relating this to the test we've been discussing, by and large the women 
who persist and succeed in the law have "masculine" characteristics, as 
defined in that test: They are aggressive, self-assured leaders.

Now, relating this to my joke and Lee's comment, there's a growing body of 
knowledge about the effect of testosterone on behavioral characteristics 
linked to gender differences.  For instance:

"Penn State researchers study link between testosterone and family 
relationships"
http://bbh.hhdev.psu.edu/labs/bel/penn_state_researchers_study_lin.htm 
"Humans may have evolved with testosterone because the hormone is useful in 
conflict situations. Booth has shown that levels of it rise in chess players, 
wrestlers and tennis players before a match. Studies have shown that women 
with high levels of testosterone might choose male-dominated occupations more 
than other women."
"In men, high levels of testosterone are also associated with better health. 
High-T men are less likely to be obese, for example, and generally have a 
stronger cardiovascular system."
"But in men, who produce about seven times more testosterone than women, too 
much of the hormone can cause antisocial and risky behavior. High-T men are 
more likely to commit a crime, according to past studies."
"Men with high levels of testosterone are more likely to be unfaithful, 
abusive and less close in relationships with their wives," Booth said. 
They're more likely to divorce. Some high-T men aren't good marriage 
partners."


I know I've seen a study that showed above-average levels of testosterone in 
male attorneys, but couldn't find it with a few minutes searching on the web. 
 We know that women have testosterone, too, so I would suspect that 
successful female attorneys have elevated testosterone levels.

>  Greg, how do *real* lawyers relate to that show?

I don't know.  The televisions in our house are "movie and news monitors" and 
I never hear my co-workers talk about anything but professional sports, as 
far as their television watching behavior is concerned . . . I do know that 
almost all depictions of the legal process and the life and work of lawyers 
in the popular media tend to be misleading caricatures (don't even say "John 
Grisham" in my presence).

Historical simulations, especially creating the most accurate possible 
recreations of historically significant people.  I imagine a "hobby" that 
would be fabulously expensive in computational terms in which the historical 
circumstances of the birth and development of specific historical figures is 
simulated in as much detail as possible, in an attempt to "grow" 
personalities that mimic as closely as possible the real personalities of 
specific individuals about whom a lot of biographical detail exists.  These 
individuals would of course be only rough approximations of the originals, 
but success could be measured in terms of how closely the "output" of such 
individuals matched the historical record.

I have an idea for an SF novel in which a Power decides to recreate Mary 
Shelley in this way, and then, of course, falls in love with her . . . "The 
Matrix" meets "Frankenstein" meets "Time after Time"

I don't know if I could roll with these stats.
There are a lot more men in this sample than women. If you sampled an equal
number of men/women of different types of sexual preference you might get
something. Also it seemed that the test is designed around a perceived cultural
identity, and assumes a self perception of gender traits so I don't know how a
straight (no pun intended) statistical analysis is applicable...

I think...

Thanks though for doing the math, It was interesting.

Plus I have to wonder about the personality trait 'introspection'
maybe being introspective is favored by one or another gender leaning, so that
one gender would be more apt to take the test...

Please don't mix up the holes, they are very different. A stable
traversible wormhole is a possible solution of GR (assuming some weird
matter fields) and would have a very different topology from black
holes and white holes.

Actually, black holes seem to have moved out from the "weird
possibility" category among astrophysicist and into the "odd object"
category. I get the impression that the confidence in the data
supporting their existence is rather high these days.

Wormholes are still in the theoretical physics toybox. The Topological
Censorship Theorem seems to limit them, unless we can find a way to
mess up the null energy condition :-)

OK, we are biased by having a lot of males in the test sample (only
two women in the sample of 18), but I think we can say with a rather
high likeliehood that the percentage androgynous are significantly
higher than in the mean population. Aren't they supposed to be the
smallest group?

There is a psychology paper waiting to be written in
this. ("Personality and Gender Role Boundary Transgression among
Neophiles"?)

No, it would just mine the wormhole energy. Somehow I think we can use
wormholes for better things. 

Putting one end inside the sun's atmosphere might be one way of
getting energy from the wormhole: don't let the plasma pass (would
close it), but put a heat converter through. If anybody does it I want
them to call it Lieserl :-)

I meant to say *mildly* disposed, not strongly.  Sorry.  Two new entries
have changed the percentages to

U    10%
M    50%
F    10%
A    30%

Actually I think Undifferentiated Types are in the minority.  But you and
Eddie Sullivan make good points.  I only provided summary stats for a small
sample of mostly men and didn't mean to really draw any cocnlusions.
Actually, given there were so many men in the sample, it's encouraging to
see so many andros and that the masculine types were not pathologically so.

Well, this is indeed a very desirable future, yet, I think that it is
impossible to to become immortal in the classic way. The human body cells -
at least some of them - aren't made for perpetual function. Life can be
extended to an age of about 120 years, with the average lifespan ranging
somewhere around the nineties, but then, eventually, some important cells
will simply stop replicating. All you can do then is to hope that they will
still be working, though at a slowly decaying rate. But the maximum age of
your actual body will be reached at some time. Blood cells and other
important parts of your body well stop to replicate, causing malfunction and
finally death, at least of your physical body.

It might, however, be possible to clone your body with a "blank" brain to an
age of around 18 and then transmit all that which makes up your immortal
"soul" (your experience, wisdom etc.) into this blank brain. This would also
reapir problems caused by diseases such as Alzheimer, which do not affect
the cells, but the communication ability of the brain cells. And hey - this
new body need not have the same genetic "bugs" as your last one.

I'm not a medic, but as I did understand from various conversations, the
cells which make up your veins (among others) will be affected by this aging
problem. This means that you could not simply transplant your brain as the
aging of the brain is largely caused by the gradual malfunction of the
arterial system. I do also understand that it would be nearly impossible to
repair this by nanobots an genetic engineering.

Or perhaps the "soul" would be uploaded into a psychometric device which
allows you to exist outside of the physical body - transcending into another
state of living, and then download into a new body if you want - much in the
way as discussed before.

Comments?

What about replacing them with younger cells? You could either store
cells while you are young, or make stem cells differentiate into the
right kind of tissues. This won't solve all problems (the brain
remains), but it lessens the impact.

And there are always plastics, metals and silicon :-)

Tricky, if you try to do it with a biological brain. You need to make
it identical down to the neural level, and that is of equivalent
complexity to scanning the original brain in the first case.

Huh? As far as I know, Alzheimer kills off brain cells. Alzheimer
brains are notiseably shrunk.

This is the most common cause of brain-related deaths if we exclude
Alzheimers. Either you get a bleeding or a thrombosis, in both cases
parts of the brain die. But the brain ages naturally too, for example
receptor numbers go down over time and the conduction speed
decreases. This has to be fixed.

Hmm, aren't you making somewhat contradictory assumptions here? First
you assume the technology to keep people very healthy up to an
advanced age. Then you assume technology able to not just grow a clone
body (in itself not that complex, but making it grow up well is likely
hard) but to transfer the mind either through copying neurally or
transplanting the brain and connecting all the neurons in the spinal
cord and senses in the right way. Then you assume that this fairly
advanced technology can't fix bad arterial walls even given
nanotechnology. The problem isn't bad assumptions, it is that you seem
to be mixing the technological levels a lot.

Fixing arterioscleroris with nanotechnology is likely possible, an
almost classic idea for swimming nanobots. And I seem to recall
research into arterial gene therapy today.

This is what is commonly called "uploading" on this list. It is
regularly debated every third month, when a huge debate breaks out
about whether the upload really is you :-)

My guess is that uploading is the hardest technology of the above, but
the most important in the long run - we cannot rely on these bodies
forever. In the meantime, life a healthful and enjoyable life, make
sure to get good medical treatment, and as you age hope medical
advances keep up and/or get a cryosuspension contract. My guess is
that we will see enough stuff the next decades to make "upload heaven"
a possibility for most of us.

(I look forward to be able to read this list while fully digital)

I just received a copy of the article from the May issue of Harpers

>From what little I've read so far, it looks like a very good
article, on liberties of altered states, politics of the War

So if you pass by a newsstand, consider picking up Harpers.

Yes.  All (with the possible exception of the Apollo 11 movie) Hollywood
depictions of aerospace engineers are laughable.  But the Ally McBeal show is
a comedy, so it is *supposed* to be a misleading caricature.  Anyway,
the show is totally hilarious.  Try it, youll liiiiike it...  spike

His brain differed in having an unusually large proportion of 
supporting glial cells, which facilitate increased connectivity, for a 
male; thus, Einstein's brain was atypically feminine.

Very good point.  Our minds improve with use.  Einstein was so
intelligent because he was always thinking, always trying to understand
things.  His intelligence was not a random event; he deliberately chose
it by constantly exercising his mind.  I believe that nearly all humans
are capable of becoming geniuses; of course, it takes years of intense
mental exercise and mental discipline, and one must be committed to
increasing one's own intelligence (this is why most people, sadly enough,
are not geniuses).  

However, I believe that children could be raised in ways that constantly
challenge them to develop more effective mental skills.  This is
something I would like to test out.  I want to see if a form of education
could be created that is capable of dramatically increasing people's
intelligence.  As far as I can tell, intelligence is basically a
collection of mental skills, and like any skills, they are learned.

For the past few years, I've been developing activities and exercises
which seem to have been very effective in increasing the quality of my
own thinking, the power of my problem solving skills and my creative
abilities.  Most of the activities can be done by people of all ages and
levels of intelligence; they are fundamentally simple activities
(although the level of difficulty can be varied quite a bit).   I have
found the activities quite enjoyable and productive for myself, but I
have not shared them with many others yet, so I don't know how effective
they would be for people in general yet.

I figured that this list was the perfect place to share my ideas with
others who may wish to try them out and give me some feedback. 
Eventually, I want to publish my ideas more widely, but, of course, I do
need to get them written down first, and I think this list is a good
place to do that.  Is that alright with everyone?

continual improvement is the highest good

I heard on the radio yesterday that a recent study has observed a
particular X-ray spectrum profile associated with the cores of certain
(young, very distant?) galaxies that's consistent with humungous black
holes but not anything else.  Sorry, no url available.

Yes, I have heard about the value of simple grape juice, as opposed to wine

 My question, what about rasins?  Do these have the phytochemicals,

Uh-oh... perhaps this borders on urban legend.

From:
http://www.informatics.tuad.ac.jp/net-expo/ff/ff95/news95/comp/en/cf13.html
In 1955, the great scientist Albert Einstein died in Princeton - his express
wish was that his body be cremated, so as to leave no earthly remains. But,
on the day of his death, his brain was secretly removed by doctors at
Princeton Hospital - supposedly for "scientific study." Nearly 40 years
later, no study is complete, and there are only rumors as to whereabouts of
the missing brain. . . . This film follows the quest of an Einstein expert,
Professor Sugimoto Kenji, who travelled from his home in Japan to the USA to
try and find the greatest relic of 20th century science.

From: http://www.physci.psu.edu/~nesbitt/physics/humor/phacts.htm
So whatever became of one of the most famous brains of this century? Well,
when Einstein died in 1955, a doctor removed the famous physicist's brain
for further study. The rest of him was cremated. Legend has it that the
brain was abnormally small. Some said it was the size of a walnut.

Where is it now? One source claims that Einstein's brain is somewhere
floating in a bottle in Weston, Missouri. Carl Sagan claims that it's in
another bottle in Witchita. Perhaps Elvis has had it all along...

From: http://weber.u.washington.edu/~chudler/ein.html
  What Became of Albert Einstein's Brain?

  On April 18, 1955, the great mathematician and physicist Albert Einstein
died. He was 76 yrs. old. Einstein had requested that his body be cremated
but that his brain be saved and studied for research. Dr. Thomas S. Harvey,
a pathologist at Princeton Hospital, removed Einsteins brain. What happened
to the brain for years after this is somewhat of a mystery.

  In the mid 1970s, Steven Levy, a reporter for the New Jersey Monthly,
hopped into his car and set out to find Einsteins brain. Mr. Levy published
his story in 1978 and part of ~it can be found on the Internet
<http://www.echonyc.com/steven/einstein.html>. Mr. Levy discovered that
Einsteins brain was still with Dr. Harvey who was now in Wichita, Kansas.
The brain was in two mason jars in a cardboard box that was marked with the
words "Costa Cider". Most of the brain, except for the cerebellum and parts
of the cerebral cortex, had been sectioned (sliced).

  The Paper There are two published scientific studies that have examined
Einsteins brain. One paper, titled "On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert
Einstein" was published in 1985 in the journal Experimental Neurology (vol.
88, pages 198-204, 1985) and written by Marian C. Diamond
<http://ib.berkeley.edu/faculty/Diamond,MC.html>, Arnold B. Scheibel, Greer
M. Murphy and ...Thomas Harvey!  These scientists counted the number of
~neurons (nerve cells) <http://weber.u.washington.edu/chudler/cells.html>
and ~glial cells <http://weber.u.washington.edu/chudler/glia.html> in 4
areas of Einsteins brain: area 9 of the cerebral cortex on the right and
left hemisphere and area 39 of the cerebral cortex on the right and left
hemisphere. Area 9 is located in the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex) and is
thought to be important for planning behavior, attention and memory. Area 39
is located in the parietal lobe and is part of the "association cortex".
Area 39 is thought to be involved with language and several other complex
functions. The ratios of neurons to glial cells in Einsteins brain were
compared to those from the brains of 11 men who died at the average age of
64.
Approximate location of cortical area 9 and area 39

  The Data Compared to the brains of the 11 normal men, the ratios of
neurons to glial cells in Einsteins brain were smaller in all 4 areas
studied. However, when the numbers were examined more closely with
statistics, only 1 area showed a difference - the ratio in the left area 39.
So in the left area 39, Einsteins brain had fewer neurons to glial cells
than the normal brains. In other words, there were more glial cells for
every neuron in Einsteins brain.

  The Conclusion The authors concluded that the greater number of glial
cells per neuron might indicate the neurons in Einsteins brain had an
increased "metabolic need" - they needed and used more energy. In this way,
perhaps Einstein had better thinking abilities and conceptual skills.

  The Problems Scientists are trained to read published papers carefully and
to evaluate the methods, results and conclusions of experiments. While it is
intriguing to use the results of this paper as an indication that Einsteins
genius was related to a particular brain region, it is perhaps a bit too
early for such a statement.  First, the "normal" brains that were compared
to Einsteins may not have been the best group for comparison. The average
age of these brains was 12 years younger than Einsteins brain. In fact, the
youngest brain in this group was only 47 yrs. old. It is possible that the
neuron to glial ratio seen in Einsteins brain was quite normal for his age
and that the younger comparison group just did not show these changes yet.
Also, the paper did not describe the background of the comparison group.
What was their intelligence and cause of death? Would these factors have
anything to do with the observed brain differences?  Second, the
"experimental group" had only 1 subject...Einstein! Additional studies are
needed to see if these anatomical differences are found in other people with
conceptual and mathematical skills like Einstein.  Third, it appears that
only a very small portion of the 4 areas of each brain was studied. The
paper states that "Four to six sections were cut from each block, Einsteins
and the controls." However, after staining, only ONE section from each
block was studied! There is no indication that this single thin section was
obtained from similar regions of area 39 and area 9 from the different
brains. It is even unclear how much of each section was counted. Moreover,
only the ratio of neurons to glial cells are published. The total number of
cells that were counted is not given in the paper. This is important to get
an idea of how the experimenters came to their conclusions. It is important
to remember that the areas 9 and 39 make important connections with many
other areas of the brain. To assign a particular behavior or personality to
a single brain area is too simple. Parts of the brain do not act by
themselves. Rather, complex behavior is the result of many areas acting
together.

  A Second Paper and The Future A second paper describing Einstein's brain
was published in 1996. Einstein's brain weighed only 1,230 grams which is
far less than the average adult male brain (about 1,400 grams). The authors
also reported that the thickness of Einstein's cerebral cortex (area 9) was
thinner than that of five control brains. However, the DENSITY of neurons in
Einstein's brain was greater. In other words, Einstein was able to pack more
neurons in a given area of cortex.  The importance of these differences is
still unknown. There are still many questions about how the brain constructs
personality, builds intelligence and forms creativity. Perhaps future

EINSTEIN'S BRAIN

Albert Einstein's brain has been considered a museum exhibition.
Physiologists saw his brain as the most unusual piece of body tissue of
one's body because of its outstanding work. They wondered, what was so
different in his brain that made Einstein as the best contributor to
twentieth century physics. What was the mythical value of his brain that
grabbed so much attentions.

>From one example about testing Einstein's brain capacity in order to measure
his intelligence, physiologists asked him to think of the theory of
relativity. However the test failed the physiologists. His brain was not
different from other people. Nevertheless, physiologists did not give up
easily. They firmly believed that inside of his brain cells was the
inspiration to his achievements. Friedman and Donley wrote in their book,
Einstein As Myth And Muse, "the mythology of Einstein shows him as a genius
so lacking in magic that one speaks about his thoughts as of a functional
labour analogous to the mechanical making of sausages, the grinding of corn
or the crushing of ore: he used to produce thoughts."(6)


Einstein's brain was the machine that produced equations and formulas. From
those equations and formulas, he made inventions that advanced our lives. We
still believe that Einstein's brain was a mythological object of the
twentieth century even though physiologists failed to give us a strong
proof.

Relics - Einstein's Brain
 
Director: Kevin Hull 
35mm/color/65 min 
England/1994 
In 1955, the great scientist Albert Einstein died in Princeton - his 
express wish was that his body be cremated, so as to leave no earthly 
remains. But, on the day of his death, his brain was secretly removed 
by doctors at Princeton Hospital - supposedly for "scientific study." 
Nearly 40 years later, no study is complete, and there are only 
rumors as to whereabouts of the missing brain. . . . This film 
follows the quest of an Einstein expert, Professor Sugimoto Kenji, 
who travelled from his home in Japan to the USA to try and find the 
greatest relic of 20th century science.

Yes, I see what you mean. Of course, you're mileage may vary, depending not
only on how you drive, but also on the quality of your fuel and the
efficiency of your engine, so to speak. Making gold from lead, silk purses
from sow's ears, or theoretical physicists from gang bangers may lie with
the realm of nanotechnological possibility. But wisdom may prefer a shorter
route.

Hmmm... this reminds me of Tebetan monks who seek to create a Buddha via
special training, forgetting that Siddhartha figured it out for himself.
Does intelligence require constant challenges from the outside to reach its
full potential? Or does intelligence discover for itself the tools of
successful learning?

Perhaps extraordinary intelligence confers the insight necessary to go
beyond thinking. I'd like to hear more about the activities you mention.

Hi:


I watch Ally Mcbeal for the "Richard Fish" character. While, most see him
as this greedy devious man, I find he truly does express a LOT of what I
am thinking. He rants on and on about the issues of political correctness,
gender issues, and has a great sense of life. 

I devoted a homepage to him, if you are interested. Luckily, Fox hasn't
sent me a letter from their lawyer "yet." So, if you want to learn more
feel free.

Speaking of future timelines and scenario building, we had a discussion here 
about a year ago on general scenario-building that resulted in my compilation 
of a timeline stretching from 2000 to 2015.  You can find it at:

    http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html

I have rechecked it from time to time and, while it is of course still quite 
early, I'm still pretty happy with what we came up with.

For whoever asked, no, Ally McBeal is nothing like a real
lawyer's work environment.  Law firms, by and large, don't
resemble group therapy sessions, nor do they resemble a high
school clique of popular kids.  Lawyers rarely have any kind
of fun at work, much less madcap hijinks and zany fun.

I do watch the show though.  I laugh and wish to god that I
could work at Ally McBeal's firm.

I've come to believe that remotely operated and autonomous military vehicles 
(or RCCVs as Igor Mendelev calls them) will be THE most important military 
technology of the first quarter of the 21st century.  We're already seeing 
significant impact from such technology in aerial warfare in the form of 
cruise missiles and small, inexpensive remotely operated reconnaissance 
aircraft.  Right now remotely operated/semi-autonomous, reusable jet combat 
vehicles are under development by the U.S. for deployment in the 2005-2010 
time period.  The U.S. armed services are already working on developing 
tactics for these machines and the folks involved in that process talk about 
a real revolution in the effectiveness of air power once these systems are 
deployed.

Igor's right that the biggest breakthrough will come when this sort of 
technology begins to be developed for ground combat.  However, the problems 
are very great -- much more so than for aircraft.  Igor's proposed design for 
an RCCV highlights the two key problems: Mobility and supply.  The vehicle he 
describes looks to be about the size of a mid-range automobile with mobility 
a little greater than a current-generation light SUV.  

Imagine the offensive and defensive tactics such a vehicle would call for.  
Within its range, on roadways or relatively benign off-road terrain and 
supported by the right kind of air power, groups of such vehicles would 
represent as much or more of a breakthrough in military technology as the 
machine gun or tank represented.  Deployed against an opponent that did not 
possess air superiority or significant heavy armor, Igor's RCCV would give 
its possessor a decisive advantage in a limited tactical range.  But consider 
what it can't do: It can't enter buildings, it would be subject to ambush in 
close urban quarters and it can't take or control uneven terrain or ground 
with significant vegetation.  Range and resupply considerations aside, in 
Kosovo, for example, a large number of such vehicles could easily take 
control of key open roadways and bridges.  But facing such a force, Serb 
forces would just do what Mao did in the face of Japan's superior mechanized 
military: Cede the roads and control the countryside, fighting an attritional 
war of ambush and logistical strangulation.

The limitations of a "first-generation RCCV" are even more apparent when one 
considers logistical factors.  How will these vehicles be resupplied with 
fuel and ammunition?  The automatic weapons Igor proposes to arm his RCCV 
with expend ammunition at a prodigious rate.  The amount of ammunition he's 
talking about would be expended with just a few minutes of sustained fire, at 
most.  RCCV operators would have to be extremely parsimonious with their 
trigger fingers, something not common among video gamers :-) Yes, they could 
form an effective firing line on an assault front for very short periods of 
time, but a savvy enemy would be willing to sustain losses in an initial 
engagement to cause the RCCV-equipped opponent to use up as much ammunition 
as possible.  

Similar problems develop with fuel.  While RCCVs like this might have a 
decent range in straight-line travel over improved roadways, any sort of 
rough-terrain travel or combat maneuvering would quickly shorten that range.  
Again, a smart opponent would employ tactics of movement to force the RCCVs 
to maneuver as much as possible.

So, how would these vehicles be reloaded and refueled?  Would there be 
remotely operated "tenders" trailing just behind the front line?  If so, 
reliably engaging ammo and fuel ports would require some fairly sophisticated 
robotics.  Furthermore, robotically or remotely operated resupply operations 
would present an inviting target.  If the RCCVs have to travel back to secure 
human-tended support, the effective combat range of an RCCV would be very 
short, indeed.

The development front for RCCVs therefore will be mobility and logistical 
improvements.  As for the former, a first-order improvement on the suggested 
design might involve equipping them with short-range remotely-operated 
rotorcraft (RORCs) for local reconnaissance and fire-suppression.  Imagine a 
squad of RCCVs coming under fire from anti-tank rocket snipers in a building. 
 The RCCVs launch ten one-meter long helicopter RORCs (with their own 
separate operators) that swarm the building, entering through windows and 
doors and suppressing the sniper fire with very small caliber semi-automatic 
fire, flash grenades, tear-gas and other short-range anti-personnel weapons.  
The RORCs could be disposable (perhaps used as weapons themselves, or to be 
recovered manually later) or, with some automated support, might be 
recoverable by the RCCVs "on the fly", so to speak.

The real RCCV mobility revolution will come when robotics advances to the 
point where an RCCV can be built with mobility approximating that of a human 
infantryman.  Assuming that the work of folks like Hugo de Garis bears fruit 
soon, this might well come fairly quickly.  I can envision a 
second-generation RCCV that would be little more than twice the size of a 
large human, with a six- or eight- legged spider-like mobility platform, upon 
which a swivelling sensor and weapon turret is mounted.  The mobility 
platform would have its own sensor suite and would be largely autonomous, 
merely responding to direction and speed inputs from the main human operator. 
 Some form of piezoelectric or other "electro-elastic" musculature would move 
the mobility legs.  Presumably the power source would have to be some kind of 
very high efficiency fuel cells or perhaps a gas micro-turbine with very 
highly compressed gas fuel (although the latter would generate a lot of heat, 
making infrared sensing a problem in both directions). RCCV walkers could be 
delivered to combat areas by wheeled or rotorcraft ROVs and would supplement 
first-generation RCCV light armored vehicles in combined-tactics skirmish 
lines.

Pure fuel and ammunition logistics will continue to be the primary limiting 
factor for even second-generation RCCVs, but with a semi-robotic 
"quartermaster corp", field resupply would become much more realistic and 
effective.

Now, none of this addresses the electronic and information combat that would 
increasingly dominate the actual ground battlefield.  With second generation 
(c. 2010-2020) and then third generation (2020+) RCCVs, control of the 
dataflow to and from RCCVs would become decisive.  I trust that super-strong 
encryption could protect the data flow from hacking attack, but EMP weapons 
might well become extremely important for the defense against RCCVs.  One can 
imagine cryogenically-supported, superconducting capacitor EMP bombs being 
delivered aerially or with artillery, or even in the form of land mines.  
Internal automation could be hardened against EMP attack through the use of 
photonics, but what of radio?  Line-of-sight microwave and laser would be 
very important in such a battlefield, perhaps supported by a LEO direct laser 
network, supplemented by close-support ROV aerial laser nodes.  With 
sufficient miniaturization and hardening against acceleration damage, perhaps 
an RCCV force could even be supported by laser-node artillery shells, 
barraged continually over a battlefront, but we're talking FAST switching and 
HIGH network architecture flexibility here . . .

Well, that's my three cents on RCCVs . . .

The May issue of Scientific American has an article on this subject.
The difficulty is distinguishing black holes from compact objects like
neutron stars.  Suppose physics is wrong and you can have ultra-massive
neutron stars; how would the emission spectrum differ from black holes?
In most cases they are about the same.  But the difference is that in
some cases, with black holes, mass can fall below the event horizon
before it has fully radiated away its heat.  With neutron stars, it
always radiates the heat, either before or after it hits the surface.
Black holes end up with a different spectrum than with neutron stars in
these situations, and this has apparently now been observed.

I'm not that familiar with Einstein, but from what I understand this is
not a very accurate characterization of his intelligence.

Actually, Einstein did almost all of his best work when he was young.
His papers on the photoelectric effect, brownian motion, and special
relativity would any one of them have been worth a Nobel prize, all
published in his twenties.  He set the foundations for quantum mechanics
and relativity, the great revolutions of 20th century physics, in just
a year or two.

After that, he slowed way down.  He labored for almost two decades to
incorporate gravitation into relativity, finally producing his magnum
opus of general relativity.  But that seemed to burn him out.  He never
accomplished anything else of significance.

Einstein is in fact considered a notorious example of a great mind which
loses its flexibility once it gets older.  He was never able to accept
quantum mechanics in its full form, tossing out one objection after
another, all of which were defeated by younger and more vital thinkers.

There have been scientists who remain active and productive throughout
their lives, people who, as David says, constantly exercise their minds
and maintain their intelligence.  They are like the marathon runners of
the intellect.  But Einstein was a sprinter.  His early brilliance was
so impressive that we are still dazzled by it today, 100 years later.
But after that, he burned out.

I wonder whether this loss of creativity and intelligence would show
itself in his brain structure.  Maybe when he was younger he would
have had more neurons, which died off to leave an apparent excess of
supportive glial cells.  Maybe his brain mass would have been above
average instead of below average.  Perhaps in the future we will be able
to make measurements of great minds while they are still alive and at
their peak of power.

Some assumptions here.

What does cloning have to do with vats?
Is it possible to grow beef (or any other flesh) in vats?
Would it be necessary to clone if one chose to do so?

I am considerably more pessimistic in the short run.  Allow me to 
counter-predict.  These are all "circa 2000", and I will predict whether
they are likely to arrive by, say, the end of 2003, four and a half years
from now.  Mostly I am only including the ones I disagree with (which is
about 90% of the predictions):

: Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks): 
:       Interfaces: 
:             flat screens become common; 
:             first practical consumer VR interfaces; 
:             retina painters become available in some industrial applications; 
:             speech input becoming more common, especially with palmtops; 
:             crude VR avatars/virtual spaces available 

None of these will happen by 2003.  Flat screens will probably still
be too expensive; there will be no head mounted displays in use for
consumer VR (they make people sick); no retinal painters will be used in
industry; speech input will be rare, except for simple voice recorders.
There won't be VR avatars, but there already are online interactions
where you control an avatar.

:       Software: 
:             first consumer-level remembrance agents; 
:             first consumer-level personalizable full-time network spiders 

I don't know what remembrance agents are, but I don't think we'll see
full time network spiders for end users.  They would be too inefficient
to be useful.

: Communication Technology: 
:       cell phones the size of credit cards; a few disposable cell phones; 

No disposable cell phones (in the sense of throwing them away; you may be
able to rent them while travelling, etc., but you'll have to return them)

:       first practical consumer videophones; major consumer items (cars, houses) begin to have embedded cell
:       communications; 

No videophones; no cars or houses with embedded cell phones

: Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science & Technology: 
:       evolved software networks (e.g. Cambrain project) demonstrated as impressive software toys; 

Only lab curiosities, they can't do anything.

:       neurochips implanted into small lab mammals with minimal effect; 

I don't think so, maybe just a few experiments

:       breakthroughs in Alzheimer disease 

No reason to expect this.

: Genetic Science and Technology: 
:       human cloning bans enforced; first human clone announced in lab in Latin America or Asia; s 

No human clones.

: General Medicine: 
:       AIDS effectively reduced to level of non-lethal chronic disease; 

Not in Africa

:       very effective chemical treatments for coronary artery disease developed; 

No, very unlikely.

:       angiostatin-endostatin proves highly effective in first human trials as general anti-cancer agent; 

Probably not.

:       continued progress in human cryopreservation techniques significantly reduces freezing damage 

Maybe, given the terrible state of the art, there will be some
improvement.  Cryonics will still be a miniscule, insignificant fringe
practice.

: Other Biology: 
:       pharmaceutical ranching becomes common; 

I doubt it.

: Power Technology: 
:       U.S. power market continues process of deregulation; 

Maybe.

:       natural gas "micro-turbines" become available at the consumer level; 

No chance.

:       continued progress in fusion R&D 

Well, the scientists will claim so, but no significant movement towards
practical fusion.

: Manufacturing and Materials Science & Technology: 
:       Arrays of STMs-on-a-chip for crude mechanosynthesis ("diamond weaving") demonstrated; 

No way.

:       MEMs become available in some major consumer devices 

Just airbags like now.

: General Transportation Technology: 
:       competitive electro-hybrid autos begin to hit market 

Not really competitive, unless government subsidized.

: Aeronautics: 
:       Boeing announces plans to build a large HST; 

Doubtful.

:       resurgence of small general aviation market through application of composite materials and
:       computer-mediated control systems (Rutan meets Gates) 

No way.  GA is dead.

: Space Technology and Development: 
:       NASA space station becomes operable; 

But useless.

:       private lunar ice lander-prospector proposed; 
:       workable proposal for privatization of NASA space station; 

Anyone can propose anything.  Nothing will come of these.

:       work commences on second generation of private launchers and first private LEO spacecraft (tugs, shuttles) 

No.

: Business & Finance Technology and Practice: 
:       increasing trends toward telecommuting; 

Yes, but still not at a significant level.

:       continuing development of expertise consultancy in areas other than traditional professions (software, other
:       engineering, personnel management, finance); 

Doubtful.

:       increasing privatization of investment for retirement; electronic commerce becomes ubiquitous; 

The first idea will die as soon as the stock market crashes.  The second
is certainly happening.

:       first practical private e-cash 

Very doubtful.

: Personal Lifestyles: 
:       development of second career ideal among healthy "Boomers" in their 50s;

No, too much trouble.

: Law and Government: 
:       first "virtual courtrooms" demonstrated; 

Unlikely.

:       first commercial applications of smart contracts; 

No.

:       continuing privatization of traditional government functions; 

Maybe, depending on who gets elected.  Could easily go the other way.

:       complete overhaul and simplification of the U.S. tax code complete; 

Absolutely not.

:       continuing political battles over rights issues such as abortion, drugs, genetic self-control 

Of course.  Plus ca change...

: Art and Entertainment: 
:       first widely-distributed virtual environments; 

Not in terms of VR.  Possibly as an enhanced chatroom.

:       first consumer-level virtual environmental tools; 

No.

:       first real interactive fiction; 

No.

:       continuing human/machine artistic collaborations 

Not a significant artistic force.


So, what's my secret?  Why is my crystal ball better than anyone else's?
Well, I'm writing a year later than Greg was, which is pretty significant
for events "circa 2000".  But I seem to view major short-term enhancements
as being both less likely and less predictable than other people here.
It may seem curmudgeonly to say "no" when other people go out on a limb
and look for breakthroughs, but that is the safer bet.  There probably
will be surprises in the next four years, but they will surprise both
Greg and me.  And they are unlikely to significantly change society in
that time frame; there is just too much inertia.

	i could easily imagine the c^3 centers that control all this being

	i was reading somewhere a while ago (yea, i know, no refs; sorry =/ ) 
about a replacement for chaff (and a lotta other things). it was called 
metallifog or somethin along those lines.  i think it was some aluminium 
based compound, but it had the charactistic of being almost as light as 
air... almost. so, it fell veeeerrrrrry slowly...
	i guess this stuff was supposed to be spread as a very fine 
powder/fog over a large area with airburst-type arty (with drastic ecological 
effects, i suspect =/ ), which would make radar basicly nonfunctional, with 
the added "benefit" of not allowing anyone in the burst zone to breathe.
	the trick was that this stuff was practically impermiable with 
respect to microwave and optical transmissions.  nothing got thru.  wouldnt 
this really fuck with any attempts at large scale RCCV warfare?

	shit. i hesitate to contemplate the complexity involved here. 
::contemplates the complexity::  ::KABOOM dripdrip drip drip :: yes, that was 
my head.
	but if were assuming the tech to make laser node arty shells, wouldnt 
it be safe to assume laser tech capable of swatting any incoming arty shells, 
node or otherwise? and if that level laser tech exists, all kindsa other 
interisting varibles enter into this little equation, i think...?

Scientists slow light to a crawl

BOSTON - Scientists have managed to slow down light so much that if 
it were a car on a highway, it could get a ticket for not getting 
over to the right-hand lane. The speed of light is normally about 
186,000 miles per second, or fast enough to go around the world seven 
times in the blink of eye. Scientists succeeded in slowing it down to 
38 mph While slow-speed light now is just a laboratory plaything for 
top physicists, the Danish scientist who led the project envisions 
practical applications in communications technology and night-vision 
devices.

  I've been thinking about possible inexpensive and safe ways to boost
HGH, and maybe lower body fat a bit. The only GH releasing amino acid that
is effective orally at low doses is glutamine. There have been some
concerns that it might stimulate glutamate release in the brain. However
the hydrogen peroxide scavenger pyruvate has been found to block
glutamate's effects, and it also helps reduce body fat a bit. So perhaps a
supplement containing glutamine and pyruvate in a 1-1 ratio might be the
ticket here.

  High protection by grape seed

Abstract
  The antioxidative effects of grape seed
  proanthocyanidins (GSPC) were studied in three in-vitro models in which
  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in aqueous solution and mice liver or
  brain microsomes were used as oxidative substrates, and UV-C irradiation as
  the pro-oxidant system. Analysis of UV-C induced lipid peroxidation was
  carried out by two methods: gas liquid chromatography of residual PUFAs and
  release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) measured by TBA
  reaction. Results indicate that PUFAs are more radiosensitive when
  incorporated in single component micelles than in mixed component micelles or
  microsomes. In every case, PUFA peroxidation was inhibited by low
  concentrations of GSPC (2 mg/L) while epigallocatecin (EGC) and
  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) monomers, at an equivalent level of
  epicatechin, exhibited no efficacy in our experimental conditions. This
  latter effect might be explained by a synergistic action of flavan-3-ol
  monomers, dimers and oligomers contained in the grape
  seed extract.

  Protective effects of grape seed

  General Pharmacology.  30(5):771-6, 1998 May.
Abstract
  1. The comparative protective abilities of a grape
  seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) (25-100 mg/kg), vitamin
  C (100 mg/kg), vitamin E succinate (VES) (100 mg/kg) and beta-carotene (50
  mg/kg) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced lipid
  peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in the hepatic and brain tissues, as well
  as production of reactive oxygen species by peritoneal macrophages, were
  assessed. 2. Treatment of mice with GSPE (100 mg/kg), vitamin C, VES and
  beta-carotene decreased TPA-induced production of reactive oxygen species, as
  evidenced by decreases in the chemiluminescence response in peritoneal
  macrophages by approximately 70%, 18%, 47% and 16%, respectively, and
  cytochrome c reduction by approximately 65%, 15%, 37% and 19%, respectively,
  compared with controls. 3. GSPE, vitamin C, VES and beta-carotene decreased
  TPA-induced DNA fragmentation by approximately 47%, 10%, 30% and 11%,
  respectively, in the hepatic tissues, and 50%, 14%, 31% and 11%,
  respectively, in the brain tissues, at the doses that were used. Similar
  results were observed with respect to lipid peroxidation in hepatic
  mitochondria and microsomes and in brain homogenates. 4. GSPE exhibited a
  dose-dependent inhibition of TPA-induced lipid peroxidation and DNA
  fragmentation in liver and brain, as well as a dose-dependent inhibition of
  TPA-induced reactive oxygen species production in peritoneal macrophages. 5.
  GSPE and other antioxidants provided significant protection against
  TPA-induced oxidative damage, with GSPE providing better protection than did
  other antioxidants at the doses that were employed.

  Oxygen free radical scavenging abilities of vitamins C and E, and a
  grape seed proanthocyanidin extract in
  vitro.
Source
  Research Communications in Molecular Pathology & Pharmacology.  95(2):179-89,
  1997 Feb.
Abstract
  Proanthocyanidins, a group of polyphenolic bioflavonoids, have been reported
  to exhibit a wide range of biological, pharmacological and chemoprotective
  properties against oxygen free radicals. We have assessed the
  concentration-dependent oxygen free radical scavenging abilities of a
  grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE),
  vitamin C and vitamin E succinate (VES) as well as superoxide dismutase,
  catalase and mannitol against biochemically generated superoxide anion and
  hydroxyl radical using a chemiluminescence assay and cytochrome c reduction.
  A concentration-dependent inhibition was demonstrated by GSPE. At a 100 mg/l
  concentration, GSPE exhibited 78-81% inhibition of superoxide anion and
  hydroxyl radical. Under similar conditions, vitamin C inhibited these two
  oxygen free radicals by approximately 12-19%, while VES inhibited the two
  radicals by 36-44%. The combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase
  inhibited superoxide anion by approximately 83%, while mannitol resulted in
  an 87% inhibition of hydroxyl radical. The results demonstrate that GSPE is a

  Not Too Big, Not Too Small  
 
 New Type of Mid-Sized Black Holes Discovered 

The white circle shows the general location of a suspected medium-
sized black hole within the galaxy M82. The yellow dots indicate 
recent supernovas, which can produce small black holes. Several of 
these may have merged to form the medium-size black hole. (Carnegie 
Mellon Astrophysics)

By Kenneth Chang
ABCNEWS.com
April 13  This is a Goldilocks story of astronomy  
     Once upon a time, astronomers looked through their telescopes 
and detected Baby Bear black holes, dead stars collapsed to a few 
miles wide  so dense that not even light can break the gravitational 
binds. Then the astronomers looked at the center of galaxies and 
found some gargantuan Papa Bear black holes, with masses up to a 
billion suns. 
     Now theyve discovered objects that appear  well, if not just 
right, at least in-between: several Mama Bear-sized black holes with 
masses between 100 and 10,000 suns. 

X-Ray Clues
Of course, no one actually sees black holes, which by definition emit 
no light. But as particles swirl into a black hole, they emit X-rays, 
which are detectable. 
     For a couple of decades, astronomers have been perplexed by 
unusual X-ray glows within many galaxies. The glows are brighter than 
the X-rays from collapsed-star black holes, but dimmer than those 
from supermassive, galactic black holes. 
     There appeared two possible explanations: they could be bigger 
versions of the small black holes or quiet versions of the galactic 
type. 
     Analyzing X-ray data from 39 galaxies, Edward Colbert and 
Richard Mushotzky, astronomers at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center 
in Greenbelt, Md., found that the colors of X-rays coming out of at 
least three medium-bright beacons resemble those from small black 
holes. 
     You dont see that kind of behavior from a supermassive black 
hole, Colbert says. Also, the sources are not located at the center 
of the galaxies, as would be expected for supermassive black holes. 

More Mass, More Light
But according to models of stellar-type black holes, the black holes 
would have to be between 100 and 10,000 times the mass of the sun to 
produce the observed brighter X-ray intensities. Such a black hole 
would be be smaller than the moon. 
     Colbert presented a talk about the medium-sized black holes 
today at the meeting of the American Astronomical Societys High 
Energy Astrophysics Division in Charleston, S.C. The findings will 
also appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. 
     In a separate talk, Andrew Ptak and Richard Griffiths from 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh revealed they have also 
found a mid-sized black hole, more than 460 times the mass of the 
sun, in the galaxy M82 located 12 million light-years from Earth. 
Ptak and Griffiths calculated that if the black hole were any lighter 
 and the gravitational pull any weaker  the outflowing X-ray 
radiation would disperse the cloud of inflowing gas, and the black 
hole would fall quiet. 
     Itd be basically blowing itself apart, Ptak says. 

How Did They Get There?
The discoveries create a new puzzle. How can the universe create a 
collapsed-star black hole thats bigger than any uncollapsed star? 
     Theres not really a good foundation for how to explain this 
intermediate black hole, Colbert says. 
     Possibilities include several small black holes merging into an 
medium-sized one, a small black hole growing by sucking down a 
surrounding cloud of gas or a super-large star producing a bigger-
than-expected black hole. 
     These are that kind of ideas that havent been checked before, 
Colbert says. Were just starting to do that work. 
     For astronomers, a puzzle to solve is a happy ending and a happy 
beginning. 

 
Theres not really a good foundation for how to explain this 
intermediate black hole.

It might turn out that the way we develop semantic memories,
i.e. abstract information, is the gradual melding together of our
memories. That means we tend to loose their clarity, but we gain in
generalization ability.


This is something that interests me with memory enhancement. Is it
possible to both have the cake and eat it? If the multiple memory
trace model of Moscovitch and Nadal is true, then it might be possible
to tweak the consolidation processes to retain clear memories and get
abstraction. But this model is rather controversial (cf. the latest
issue of Current Opinion in Neurobiology).

Anders Sandberg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Questions for Anders and anyone else who feels qualified:

(1) What do you believe the feasible limits of memory enhancement will be
ultimately?

(2) Would uploading likely remove all the blocked pathways and enable
complete access?

(3) How useful would these recovered memories be if their clarity was
compromised due to the constructive and confabulatory nature of memory?

No human clones.

I think I recall that Korea already announced the creation of a human clone

Indeed, only after burn-out did he endorse Zionism.
It makes one wonder why some folks just snap, go postal with ideology,
go ballistic with demogogy, despite brilliance in a particular field of
science and/or technology that occurred in their younger years. Sometimes
this tends to give science a bad name. Perhaps the stress of living on the
edge of knowledge overwhelms aging scientists and drives them to migrate
their cultural loyalties to a different herd than scientists.

Sometimes technology over-impresses folks, as this alleged quote from Julius
Sextus Frontinus illustrates:
"Inventions have long since reached their limit, and I see no hope for
further development."
(Highly regarded engineer in Rome, 1st century A.D.)

And don't forget poor old Linus Pauling: It really tears me up, that after
contributing so
much, he descends into vitamin C quackery. One can only speculate as to the
cause of this cognitive degeneration in old age. Could it come from a
bio-chemical
source? Does it manifest congenitally? What part does memetics play in this
potentially infectious socio-genic illness? Who can say?

Perhaps Jonas Salk will figure it out before he too succumbs.

More evidence of brain burnout. Not quite senile dementia, but moving along
that line, I suppose. Should those of us less brilliant worry about this
happening to us? Probably.

When someone tells me that they "used to think that way" (i.e., used to
disbelieve in UFOs, or used to disagree with religionism, or used to
consider ESP nonsense, etc.) it makes me feel that I'd rather have known
them before they went over the hill, before they burned out, IOW.

Ah! Now you've asked some pertinent questions. Do you suppose anyone tracks
(with CAT, EEG, fMRI, MEG, MRI, PET, cerebral arteriography, or patch
clamping) any of the parameters you've mentioned in the CNS of living
geniuses?

While some consider the possibility of coding a superintelligence, others
might investigate the neuroscience (and the appropriate mentoring) of human
prodigies.

Thanks Doug.  Do you know what dosages are recommended?  Even if I do go
with the real thing, I would probably cycle between the HGH and amino acids.
Dr. Klatz seems to characterize Arginine as the more potent of the two
though.  Do you have any references for your statement that Glutamine is the
only effective oral GH releaser?  Theres another mail list I'd like to share
this info with.  What am I saying?  Of course you have references.  ;^)

I take the term to refer to a device that draws power from outside the
universe. E.g. the one in Asimov's _The Gods Themselves_ or the
"hypertrop" from the Perry Rhodan series that tap into a parallel
universe and exploit some kind of energy differential between the
universes. This is of course entirely speculative.

hmm, is light really slowed in this experiment, or is it just passed
through a medium which mearly causes light to take a path through the
medium so that it seems to be moving slower.

Here's some more grisly details:


From: Kimberley Heitman
Subject: [Oz-ISP] Action over the Bill

Having examined the draft bill, kindly placed online in html by Heath Gibson
at http://www2.hunterlink.net.au/~ddhrg/censorship_legislation.html I have
to say that it's far worse than the original press release would have
suggested.

As foreshadowed, it censors the Internet as if it were cable-TV and gives
the ABA power to issue takedown orders. However, Alston has gone much
further in the detail, to the extent that the hysterical rhetoric from his
office to date now appears to have been an attempt at sugar-coating.

The EFA Board is yet to examine the Bill in detail, but on my reading of the
way the prohibitions will be administered by the ABA and the tamed industry
association there's several issues that Alston has not been frank about to
date. EFA will be releasing a considered reponse to the Bill when sending
its submission to the Senate IT committee by the end of next week, but for
the time being some points have to be made.

First new feature is the licencing of ISPs, and compulsory trade unionism
under the IIA. Daily penalties of $27,500 should be enough to bring small
ISPs into line, if the threat of being shut down by the Federal Court
doesn't.

Second, the ABA will write the IIA Code, and tell ISPs what hardware and
software to use. Oh, and from now on ISPs work weekends as takedown orders
issued by email or fax will have to be complied-with within 24 hours. Same
penalties natch - $27,500 daily for merely allowing "adult themes" material.

Third, people can complain about ISPs as well as sites, for permitting
access to "adult themes" material anywhere in the world. The ABA has power
to investigate any ISP, any time, under s.25(1)(a) if the ISP allows end
users to access material prohibited in Australia from anywhere else in the
world. Is there any doubt that proxy filters are to be compulsory?

Fourth, less censorious State and Territory laws are over-ridden, and no-one
under 18 is allowed to own an account. Free speech is dead coast to coast,
and the ABA has the power to outlaw dual membership of WAIA and SAIA through
its control over the IIA Code.

And finally, everything archivable is covered, not just web sites. As
technology improves, the industry and the public will pay for smaller and
smaller sieves down to the RAM caches, IRC and newsgroups.

With the depth of bastardry in the detail, it's fairly plain that the
Minister hates the Internet and all who sail in her. All live email
addresses on Alston's recent spam should understand that they're on the
enemies list.

Obviously the Government considers that a future where Australians use Big
Pond to go to slow overseas sites is the only plausible scenario in which
they get a good price for Telstra ;-)

[SNIP]
By all means submit to the Senate IT Committee - submissions close April
30 - see http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/ADVERT/online.htm
Otherwise, join the campaign. Details and links are at
http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/alert99.html and
http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/may28/index.html , or contact Darce Cassidy
(EFA Executive Director) or myself. The campaign mailing list is available
to coordinate regional protests, and to agree wording of form letters and
means of making these available to the public. Act locally and think
globally - while you can!

Kimberley Heitman,
Chair, EFA

In response here are more details from ABC science news (copy and 
pasted)

   
 Optical Molasses Slows Light
Scientists Reduce Speed of Light to a Crawl 

 
Danish physicist Lene Vestergaard Hau, and colleagues have reduced 
the speed of a light pulse to 17 meters per second - a factor of 20 
million less than its speed in a vacuum. (Photo by Rowland Institute 
for Science/Reuters)     
 
By Tom Kirchofer
The Associated Press
B O S T O N,   Feb. 19  Scientists have managed to slow down light 
so much that if it were a car on a highway, it could get a ticket for 
not getting over to the right-hand lane. 
    
The speed of light is normally about 186,000 miles per second, or 
fast enough to go around the world seven times in the wink of eye. 
     Scientists succeeded in slowing it down to 38 mph. 
     They did this by shooting a laser through extremely cold sodium 
atoms, which worked like optical molasses to slow the light down. 
    The experiment doesnt invent any new physics. When light passes 
through a material such as water or glass, it slows down a bit as the 
photons interact with the surrounding molecules. The new result 
merely set the world record for slowest light. 
Practical Applications 
While slow-speed light now is just a laboratory plaything for top 
physicists, Lene Vesergaard Hau, the Danish scientist who led the 
project, said practical applications could be a few years away. She 
envisions improved communications technology, switches, even night-
vision devices. 
     The atoms were contained in what is called a Bose-Einstein 
condensate, a condition created when matter is cooled almost to 
absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. Thats 
459.67 degrees below zero. 
     We have really created an optical medium with crazy, bizarre 
properties, Hau said. Everybody knows that light is something that 
goes incredibly fast. If you could possibly slow it down to a real 
human dimension. That was really fantastic. 
     The research, conducted at the Rowland Institute for Science in 
Cambridge and Harvard University, was described in Thursdays issue 
of the journal Nature.

It is possible that extropians, or other internet group, is the *best*
way to permanently record ideas, for they then are recorded in
a form which can be stored and later searched.  Books are already
getting relatively useless now for we cannot efficiently access the
information therein.

Also, has not our attitude towards books changed radically in the
last 10 yrs?  All of us?  Do we not view information itself much
differently now than in 1990, before the www?  Do you spend
more time in the library now than you did then, or less?  Thought so.
Me too.  Do you spend more time or less on your computer now
than 10 yrs ago?  Me too.  spike

Using small active solar sails to recover mass driver pellets in solar
orbit was described in _The Helix and the Sword_ by John C McLoughlin,
around 1983.  Excellent novel of genetic engineering in the distant
future, without a singularity of course.

Seems like humans could be made to span the same size range as
domestic dogs for instance.  Chihuahuas and toy poodles display
many of the same behaviors as St. Bernards.  So why cant we make
20 kg people?  Because we cant get volunteers.  By the time they
reach the age of consent they are already too big.  {8-[  We need
20 kg humans.  spike

The May issue of Esquire has a 12 page
special on the increasing likelihood of physical immortality.  It states
that a 40
year old of today has a pretty good chance of catching the wave.  The
article references Kurzweil, a few of the headline grabbing biotech
breakthroughs (including a claim of human cloning in S Korea in
December 98--familiar to anyone?) & a few possible implant-type
interfaces & enhancements.  It also touches on uploading, but only as a
step to being put into a new brain.  It deals wth possible social
reactions in a journal-entry story, but trots out bugaboos re:
overpopulation & resource exhaustion.  There are even handy tips on how
to be part of the first immortal generation.

File this under preaching to the converted
(maybe), but the SciFi Channel has new promos showing people wanting
things like cyber/bio enhancements, uploads, nanotech & self-directed
evolution.  If the memes have reached Madison Ave,
they must be near to reaching the mainstream consumer.

Reasons to be cheerful?

The ozone layer is fine for most of the planet. The ozone 'hole' is a
phenomenon which centers around the south pole and forms in winter
there, when atmospheric temperatures are low enough that ozone becomes
unstable enough for chlorine ions to do their dirty work. The chlorine
ions come from several sources, but the exaggeration in the ozone hole
is supposedly the result of increased use of chloro-fluoro-carbons as
refrigerants and fillers for aerosol sprays. Supposedly our emission
levels of these are now low enough that the ozone hole should go away by
itself in 5-10 years.

The green house effect is a completely different phenomenon, reliant on
things like methane gas, carbon dioxide, water, sulphur and nitrogen
pollution, as well as dust particulates of various kinds. Its a very
complex system which has yet to be modeled well enough to come to a
difinitive conclusion as to the cause of, or even if world temperatures
are actually rising. Most weather stations where temps have been taken
are in urban areas that have seen an increase in temperature locally due
to the urban environment development.

I was flat-out amazed, Hal, at your response to this timeline (but glad to

Just this morning I saw a $2,500 system advertised with a 15" flat screen 
monitor.  I can walk down the block and buy a 17" flatscreen for $900.  While 
this technology doesn't follow Moore's Law exactly, it seems to run at about 
twice that rate.  That would mean that a 17" screen ought to cost about 
$400-500 by 2003.  I know a lot of CRTs that size were sold for that price 
five years ago.

Again, I think you need to check the CURRENT state of the art.  I used a 
friend's Sony Glasstron as a computer monitor in February.  I didn't get 
sick, and none of the other people I know who have used it have, either. 
There are improvements on the Glasstron coming to market this year.

> no retinal painters will be used in

Tell that to Microvision (http://www.mvis.com), who are moving their product 
steadily to market (a stock to watch VERY closely, BTW). Both the U.S. Navy 
and the Army have Microvision products in test trials and the results seem to 
be very favorable.

I know a couple of attorneys who already use speech input for most of their 
drafting.

Check out ActiveWorlds.  This is admittedly crude, but there are quite a few 
users.

Remembrance agents are software agents that run a continuing commentary in 
some work environment, offering connections to items relating to whatever the 
subject of current work is. I saw Anders Sandberg demonstrate his own 
remembrance agent at EXTRO3 and expect SOMEONE will develop a commercial 
product like this before 2005.

As for spiders, personalizable web news services are already crude devices 
like this.  I can't see why they won't evolve quickly.

You can already rent cell phones in airports and at hotels.  I've had serious 
doubts about the word "disposable" since I wrote this.

Videophones are a function of bandwidth and compression tech.  Just as soon 
as the cable companies get a large enough installed base of high-speed net 
connections, this is going to happen -- why shouldn't it, with high-res video 
cameras now in the sub-$200 range?  Plenty of cars have installed cell 
devices now, including ones that interact with GPS for security and service 
calls, although the calls are user-initiated.  With high schoolers and 
housewives now having cell phones, its only a matter of time before the 
cellular net becomes dense enough to begin to compete head-to-head with land 
lines.

Well, it's still about 18 months too soon to be sure on this one: My optimism 
reflects my own views about the nature of mind.  We'll see who's right in a

"A few experiments" is what I'm predicting, but the current rate of progress

The main reason to expect this can be summed up in two words: Baby Boom.  For 
just a peek at recent progress that gives a taste for how much effort is 
being focused on this, check out:

This is a throw-away item in the timeline I drafted, based more on the

vanity.

I'm less sure about this than I was a year ago -- I don't see as much

Well, the jury's still out on this, and the trials are just beginning.  See:

    
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/NCI_CANCER_TRIALS/zones/PressInfo/Angio/table.
html

With the amount of research being carried out there, we should know pretty 
soon who's right.  This is one I'd make a fairly large bet on.

Unfortunately, you're probably right about the social status of cryonics.  
But the work of 21st Century Medicine really does look promising on the 
vitrification front in terms of reducing freezing damage.

This is from the February 6, 1999 New Scientist:

"The world's first cows genetically engineered to make a pharmaceutical 
product in their milk were born over Christmas, the Dutch company Pharming 
has announced. It has not disclosed which pharmaceutical is involved. 
Researchers will find out within six months whether the cows express the gene 
in their milk. "If they do, we can clone them and make more females," says a 
company spokesman." 

It seems like there's just way too much money to be made in this kind of 
thing for it not to happen in the time frame we're looking at.

Well, this looks to be beyond doubt.  Every region in the country has at 
least one state engaging in major deregulation.  From where I sit (Houston), 
the evolution of independent power companies is a major economic development 
with lots of capital ($Billions) flowing into it.

I think this will be a technology, like satellite dishes, that starts out 
commercial, begins to be used by consumers in "the country" and then makes 
its way into the city.

I'm probably going to be the last conscious being on Earth to own and operate 
purely internal combustion powered automobiles, which makes me an 
electro-skeptic, but even my hot rod buddies are starting to take note of 
electro-hybrids.  Audi's new vehicle looks really slick, as does the machine 
Chrysler showed at Detroit this year (an IC drives the front wheels, an 
electric drives the rear wheels with reverse-cycle generation).  Especially 
in Europe, I think high gas prices alone will make these kinds of machines 
competitive before 2003.

Another place we disagree at least a little.  General aviation is definitely 
not dead -- it's making a very slow come-back, and folks like Rutan could 
revive it in an environment where composites, advanced avionics and a better 
legal regime make investment worthwhile.  It's a question of price and I 
think the sort of engineering Scaled Composites has shown is possible will 
bring new entrants into the market.

The ultimate question here is whether we are seeing a reduction in "social 
friction", in the first world, i.e. a greater rate and acceptance of 
technologically-driven social change.  The scenario we're talking about is 
premised on this phenomenon.  I think such a premise is reasonable as an 
extrapolation from history: The rate of social change, driven by technologies 
like the automobile, commercial aviation, the telephone and television seems 
to have accelerated in the last 100 years, compared to the preceding century. 
 Considering the undoubted increase in the speed of scientific and 
technological innovation we're experiencing now, I can't see why we wouldn't 
reasonably expect at least some increase in the speed of social change up to 
some fundamental limiting factor.  I wonder if some such ultimate limit is 
what you're perceiving, Hal, and, if so, what it might be.

Exactly. Nanotech is not a panacea. But it might be darn useful.

Why not cell repair machines? The most drastic version would be small
devices entering cells, going to the nucleus and (say) lengthen the
telomeres or do other genetic modifications needed to extend the
cell's viability. Less drastic possibilities would include building
scaffoldings around veins to either replace the original walls (rather
tricky), or attract epidermal cells (possibly newly cloned and
injected) to form a new wall (sounds quite feasible in the short term,
even without nanotech).

Nanotech would make it much easier to get the right molecules to the
right place than current methods; to get strong life extension we also
need to know what aging processes there are and what to do about them
(something nanotech will also simplify discovering a lot).

Someone else mentioned this "human cloning" as well.  See

My guess is that chemical enhancements are limited, they only affect
the plasticity of memory and that means we can merely make it optimal,
not go much beyond current levels (let's say a few tens of percent) if
we want to keep both good generalization and clarity. Organizing
information has proven itself a great way of enhancing memory orders
of magnitude (mnemonics, ars memoriam, study techniques). External
support systems (paper, computers) also can hold arbitrary amounts of
information in perfect clarity, but are not as easily accessed.

My guess is that the ultimate limits of memory enhancement will be
input-output to the brain and processing rather than the brain
itself. The optimal memory enhancement without neurointerfaces would
be proper use of modulating drugs and memory techniques, but with
neurointerfaces the modulation could both be made much more specific
("Mark *this* memory") and external systems could give direct
support. Wearables with remembrance agents are a good start. Note that
this would make it possible to "cheat" the generalization-clarity
dilemma by storing generalized memories in the brain for processing,
and the clear data in external systems.

No. Uploading would not change the neural net of the brain, and the
blocks are "software problems" (problems with retrieval dynamics, bad
indexing, mis-associations etc). But interfacing and modulating the
brain becomes much simpler, of course. I would expect a fast rate of
innovation once people start to upload themselves.

Depends on the application - most of the time this causes few
problems, but when in the witness stand or trying to remember the
formula for sin(5x) it becomes troublesome. This is why I think having
several levels of storage is a good idea: from highly generalized
memories that when recalled are rather constructive, over to clear
recordings of experiences.

I caught that Esquire spread too.  Also, I recently saw a
favorable article on cryonics and immortalism in another
mainstream rag, LinguaFranca.  Seems like a boom of good
press.

But the piece in Esquire gives me a good feel of how most
people in the literate mainstream probably regard the
prospect of immortality - with equal measures of curiosity
and bemusement.

The Richard Dooling piece had an absurdist ring to it,
mirroring the cover tag line in its inquiring "would you
really want to live forever?"  And the question isn't an
easy one from the perspective of Dooling.  In his short
article, he paints a picture of a possible future that is
just as frustrating, conflict-ridden, and senseless as the
modern world.  He projects his fictional self surviving to
the year 2099 only to be killed by a terrorist in Darwin's
Army, a group that opposes "unnatural" evolution.

Still, I count this as a positive representation of
transhumanism.  The tone may be one of world-weariness,
skeptical of a better future, but that attitude just happens
to be part of the zeitgeist.  Anything that departs from
that perspective too greatly would probably alienate
Esquire's trendy readers.

Often times, for new memes to spread, they have to be
packaged in a way that will mostly fall in line with what
people already believe to be true about the world.   By that
consideration, efforts by the likes of Dooling might be far
more effective vehicles for spreading transhumanist ideas
than the various singularity-themed visions, which tend to
confuse the hell out of most people.

If you get a chance, check it out.  For kicks, there's a
great photo of a twenty-something yuppie giving the finger
to the grim reaper.

Doug Bailey told me he has young children whom he is trying to raise in a
way that promotes great intelligence.  He said,

"I was wondering if you've come across any techniques or "best practices"
in
your research that assists children of such ages develop keen,
analytical,
scientific minds."

>From what I've read, people aren't really sure how we learn, just that we
do learn and that different sorts of environments and personal
relationships can dramatically affect how well we learn.  There are an
incredible number of factors that may or may not affect learning and how
much each factor affects learning in different types of people is
difficult to measure.  

The idea of "best practices" in education is a hopeful fantasy at best
and at worst it means that we seriously believe that there is some final
solution, and that once we find it, we can give up on trying to actually
improve our methods of education.

I prefer the concept of "continually better practices".  Especially when
you are dealing with a phenomenon as spontaneous, creative and
unpredictable as the learning process.  

Determining whether a particular method of education out of practically
infinite variaties is the "one best way" is very difficult; beyond our
current abilities.  However, determining whether new techniques or
variations on current techniques are more effective than previous ones is
much easier. 

Developing methods of learning that are highly effective for the
particular individuals involved is a learning process in and of itself,
and like all learning processes, it requires an intelligent, rational
approach as well as a lot of experimentation.

Because people are naturally so diverse, it seems obvious that different
approaches to education must be used for different kinds of people. 
Education must be customized, carefully developed for each individual
mind.

Fortunately, though, our minds are similar enough that there are many
basic principles and techniques which have been developed over many
centuries and many millions of humans.

One of these principles is that the more focused and interested one is in
learning something, the faster one will learn it.  Because of this, it is
important to develop educational systems in a way that students find very
compelling.

Another basic principle is that learning is a fundamentally enjoyable
activity to humans (not surprising since our survival depends crucially
on our ability to learn).    Because of this, we can trust people to
further their own educations (we don't need compulsory schooling, in
other words).  

Basically, whatever form an educational system takes, it should be very
interesting and fun and it should rely on people's natural enjoyment of
learning to motivate them to improve their own learning methods and to
seek out new knowledge and skills to learn.

Mr. Bailey was wondering what sorts of activities I would recommend to
help young children develop keen, analytical, scientific minds.  I would
recommend the sorts of activities that require lots of problem solving
skills, analytical skills, creative skills and project development
skills.

The best activity I know of that requires all of those skills is computer
programming.  I began programming computers when I was eleven.  I would
always give myself programming projects to work on, usually little things
like solving math problems and making simple games and images; although I
had several larger projects that I worked on, like a Mandelbrot Set
explorer and several games, which were easy to make functional and easy
to keep adding features to.  

Looking back, I am quite grateful for my years of writing computer
programs.  It was always very challenging for me, and I was always
finding new sorts of problems to solve with the help of the computer.  I
enjoyed the fact that the computer was so versitile a tool, and I enjoyed
thinking of ideas and expressing those ideas as computer programs.  

People who don't program computers often perceive the activity as boring,
but I always saw my computer as one of the best toys I could ever have. 
There was no end to the ways I could play with it.

I have a young nephew (seven years old) who is very intelligent and
curious.  Last week I decided to start teaching him how to program the
computer.  (I downloaded a BASIC compiler from the Internet, called
FirstBASIC (easy to find with a search engine))  My nephew was very
enthusiastic about learning to program the computer, and I demonstrated
for about ten or fifteen minutes the sorts of basic things that he could
program the computer to do, like print words on the screen, draw lines
and circles, calculate and display a multiplication table almost
instantly, count to a million very fast, etc.  

Then he spontaneously said, "I want to make a game."  I said, "Okay,
let's make a tag game, where we can each move letters around on the
screen and chase each other around and get points for tagging the other."
(not in those exact words)  He was very enthusiastic about this, and we
began making the game immediately.  We started discussing the basic
things we would need the game to do: display different characters on the
screen, get input from the keyboard for moving the characters around,
keeping track of who is 'IT', etc. 

I started the program by clearing the screen and putting the characters
in their starting positions, explaining quickly the significance of the
words and characters I was typing in.  As soon as the program was capable
of displaying anything on the screen, he was very eager to have me run
the program, so I did immediately, and he was excited to see that the
game was getting created.  I then asked him what we needed to add next to
the program to make it the way we wanted it, and we discussed it briefly
and continued programming.

As I was programming, I would say everything I was thinking about the
program out loud, basically talking to myself, so that he could listen to
the style of thinking that is useful for programming and so he would
understand the reasoning behind everything I typed in.  Sort of a
continously running, stream of consciousness commentary on every part of
the process.  

He was completely enthralled for at least an hour and a half as we
developed the game, which he was able to play with his younger brother
when he was done.  The nice thing about FirstBASIC is that it is easy to
create stand-alone programs, and so he is able now to play the game any
time he wants simply by clicking on an icon in Windows.

As we were working on that project, we both kept thinking of ideas to
make the game even more elaborate in the future, such as objects which
appear on the screen that one can pick up to move faster or to throw at
the other player's character, or obstacles that make the chasing more
interesting.

The exciting thing about programming for me is that once you teach
someone the basics of programming, they can pursue it fairly autonomously
after that.  You can teach them programming tricks and suggest projects
to them, but they can pursue that sort of education with little
supervision.  Which means that it is an educational tool that is
extremely inexpensive to implement widely.

I think children should be introduced to computers and the fact that the
computer can be an extremely fun mind toy as soon as possible.  The
mental skills one develops when programming computers have countless
applications beyond computer programming.  I find myself using the
lessons I learned programming computers, in nearly all activities I
pursue, from art and music, to engineering, mathematics and scientific
pursuits.  The basic way I even think about my own mind and self and the
way I make decisions in my life have been profoundly influenced by my
years of programming computers for the sheer enjoyment of it.

I have written enough for now.  I hope my writing will be useful.  Thank
you for your attention,

- David Musick

continual improvement is the highest good

Actually, IMO there is a simple, non-technological reason why videophones
will not emerge in the consumer market anytime soon: we don't want them.
I'm not interested, no matter how cheap it is, and neither is anyone else
that I know - and that includes a lot of techno-gadget addicts.

Businesses will want videophones for all sorts of good reasons - and they
already have them, and the prices are falling just like you predict.
Residential use will have to wait for a generation that doesn't mind
answering the thing in a bathrobe, or (more likely) for an image-editing AI
good enough that people won't be worrying about what they look like.

Dear Karsten:

  All Extropians, Venturists, Esfandiarians, etc. should definitely 
check out Tom Bearden's stuff on the net.  Just use a search engine (I 
prefer MSN or Lycos) and search for "Tom Bearden" and you'll find some 
interesting stuff that is, in a sense, way beyond even nanotech.  Also 
check out Saul-Paul Sirag.  This guys, along with a few others, a 
re-writing physics itself: they're articulating an integrated, 
hyperspatial physics, with important implications for biology (aging, 
immortality, etc.) and consciousness.  Their stuff is pretty good 
reading, so please check it out. 
                                       MCP aka CLAY8

CHeck out James P. Hogan's 'Rockets, Redheads & Revolution' - just came out
this spring - he debunks CFC vs. ozone pretty thoroughly in there. Also some
interesting takes on AIDS and evolution...

As we discussed in February, despite Hogan's hard sci-fi credentials,
he can't be considered very reliable on technical matters.  Among
other things, he is a Velikovskian, as seen at his home page at
http://www.global.org/jphogan/index.html (follow link to Bulletin Board,
and then Catastrophism).

Billy Brown gave Velikovskianism a thorough debunking in his posting of
Feb 16.

    Cows Cloned from Milk
Healthy Calves from Milk Right After Delivery 

 
The Associated Press
T O K Y O,   April 26  Two calves cloned from cells found in cows 
milk have been born in northern Japan, officials said today. 
     The births last week at the Snow Brand dairy companys research 
center in Japans northernmost main island of Hokkaido were the first 
ever using colostrum  the milk produced in the first week after a 
cow has delivered, the company said in a statement. 
     The procedure could make it safer for animals to donate their 
cells for cloning, as the extraction of cells from milk does not 
require making an incision in the donor cow and reduces the risk of 
infection, Snow Brand said. 
     The cloned calves were produced by combining the nucleus of a 
mammary cell with an unfertilized egg and inserting the embryo into 
the uterus of a surrogate cow. It was the same method used to produce 
the sheep Dolly, the worlds first cloned animal. 
Two Out of Three Had Babies
Three cows were made pregnant through the technique, but only two 
succeeded in giving birth. One of the calves was delivered through 
Caesarean section on April 20 and the other was delivered naturally 
the following day, the company said. 
     Japan has recently been aggressively developing cloning 
techniques in order to maintain the competitiveness of its cattle 
industry by producing high quality beef at a cheap price. 
     A controversy erupted earlier this month after the government 
said that cloned beef has been on the market in Japan for at least 
two years, prompting protests from consumer groups worried about its 
safety. The government insists the meat poses no health threat. 
     Tokyo-based Snow Brand is Japans largest dairy product company, 
and has cloned several cows in the past.

So it sounds like even the most sophisticated technology will never allow me
to replay a clear and accurate memory of some playground incident when I was
7 years old.  Are you saying this is not only because of software/retrievel
problems, but also because the information/database itself is corrupted?

Too bad.  It would be great if a much more complete and accurate recall of
my past could be accomplished.

Thanks Anders,

Anything that can be cut can also be sewn. It is mathematically 
possible to take two black hole geometries, and sew them together 
along their "tears". This gives rise to wormhole solutions to 
Einstein's equations, in which two otherwise separate "universes" are 
connected by a throat, or tunnel, as shown in the top figure above. 
Such wormholes could also connect different regions of the same 
universe, as in the bottom picture. In principle this would enable us 
to take shortcuts to distant parts of the Universe just like they do 
in Star Trek. The problem is that within Einstein's theory such 
wormholes are very unstable. The throats tend to collapse in a much 
shorter time than it would take to get through to the other side, so 
that traversing such wormholes is in practice impossible. 

This then is how Einstein's gravity works. In the word's of John 
Wheeler: Matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how 
to move. So what is a black hole in this context? Clearly the more 
matter I put in the center of the sheet, the deeper the well that I 
create, and the harder it is for matter to "climb out" . According to 
Einstein's theory, if I pack enough matter into a small enough 
volume, the well will get so deep that the matter inside can never 
escape. A circle of no return forms. Any matter that passes the point 
of no return can no longer escape to the outside world. It 
necessarily keeps collapsing, moving towards the center. The well 
gets deeper and deeper until finally a hole is literally torn in the 
fabric of spacetime: the density of matter at the center becomes 
essentially inifinite, at least to the extent that Einstein's theory 
of gravity is still valid. Thus, what I mean by " a hole in the 
fabric of spacetime" is: a tiny region of space where the known laws 
of physics break down. A black hole is a region of space so tightly 
packed with matter, that nothing, not even light can escape. Hidden 
at its (crunchy?) center is a tear in the fabric of spacetime. 
Anything that falls into this region of space is irrevocably lost to 
the rest of the universe. No light can emerge or pass through this 
region, so it appears totally black. In some sense therefore, a black 
hole marks a boundary to spacetime: a horizon beyond which no one can 
see without travelling through it. This radius of no return is called 
the event horizon of the black hole.

I wouldn't have any quibble with that wording, however, I suspect you
might really mean to restrict posting to *addresses* subscribed to the

Legitimate subscribers who post from behind mail/news gateways or have
several mail addresses and would prefer to be able to submit messages
from all of them?

This can be solved with an additional contributors list (trivial to set
up with Majordomo, don't know about other list engines), although from
my limited experience in running such a set-up it still catches many
more inattentive subscribers than spammers. Simply limiting posting
rights to subscribed addresses, as practiced by some lists, is certainly
ill-conceived.

David Musick expressed many very good ideas about education in his recent
post, and I would like to toss in my 2 cents.

First: best practices in education.

Thanks, David, for expressing the rather unpopular view that there aren't
any.  Very true.  Too many variables, as you already said.  Most 
particularly, I would call attention, as you did, to the differences
between people.  What may work best for one may be an utter
failure for another.

Second, David again expresses one idea about learning that needs to be
absolutely central to any theory of learning.  INTEREST.  If it isn't
there, then the learning isn't effective.  

Further, I would make a stronger statement:  if it is there, in
sufficient quantity, then the method of education is nearly irrelevant. 
Indeed, whether one has any formal system in place is irrelevant for
those who are sufficiently interested.  So to some extent, Doug Bailey's
original question of how to get kids to assist children in developing
keen analytical minds might be partially rephrased in terms of how to
help children become interested in things that would develop their minds.

I might depart a little from Mr. Musick's formulation that 


>... it is important to develop educational systems in a way that
students 
>find very compelling.

However, my disagreement is only that I don't find it necessary to
develop educational systems at all...for reasons that David lays out very
well as he continues his discussion.

Foremost among those reasons is that children naturally enjoy learning.
Thus, as David says, there is no need for compulsory schooling.  In fact,
my inclination is to believe that it is difficult to prevent kids from
learning, unless one places them in a compulsory learning context.

If I may borrow a slightly graphic illustration from my friend Rob...
There are lots of things we all enjoy pretty naturally...food, sex,
learning, Music, etc.  Any of these can be a very significant source of
positive feeling.  However, as soon as the idea of forcing someone to do
one of these activities happens...The consequences to the person become
appalling.  Those with memories of being forced to eat certain kinds of
foods, may still have dietary problems because of it.  Those who HAD to
listen to some kinds of music often can't appreciate that kind any more. 
I'm not going to talk about sex here, so I'd ask eveyone to take a look
at the analogy with learning, and see if anyone agrees with the potential
damage.


David says something like this, though I think a bit milder with:

>Basically, whatever form an educational system takes, it should be 
>very interesting and fun and it should rely on people's natural 
>enjoyment of learning to motivate them to improve their own learning 
>methods and to seek out new knowledge and skills to learn.

He then goes on to answer Mr. Bailey's question about activities to
recommend.

He says:


> I 
>would recommend the sorts of activities that require lots of problem 
>solving skills, analytical skills, creative skills and project 
>development skills.

And then further goes on to suggest that computer programming does all of
these things.

As a educational philosopher by avocation, and a programming instructor
by (current) vocation, I can hardly disagree with him.

However, I would suggest that we look further into what other activities
could help with that.

Both personally, and as an educator, I have found several other branches
of study that perform all of what is suggested above.
I did my early play in Mathematics, rather than in computer programming. 
I thought that the systems were beautiful...and I enjoyed the sense of
competence.  Particularly once one gets into Algebra+, there's an
elegance to Math that is sometimes fascinating to kids.

As a note, I've previously been a math instructor, and found that for
those kids who choose an interest in math...The learning takes place at a
rapid rate.  I find that the numbers suggested in the Sudbury Valley
books (that Jocelyn Brown recently recommended) are very believable in
terms of math instruction: 20 contact hours for K-8 mathematics, given
that the children decide ON THEIR OWN to learn it.

Also, any branch of science works...or gadget-building (electronics,
robotics).

Another area that I found very helpful was my role-playing game
experience.  Certainly develops problem-solving, creativity, planning,
and analysis.

I also benefited from political argument in my house and playing chess.

But as something of a radical, I'm inclined to suggest a much stronger
statement.

I think nearly any activity can be an appropriate vehicle in which kids
can learn about the above skills.  The key to the whole mess seems to me
to be the approach that relevant adults take to their life, or that
activity.

I think that Mr. Musick did a wonderful thing for his 7-year old nephew
by taking and showing him programming.

Why did that work so well, though.  (please forgive my presumption,
David).

1.	Kid  was interested first.
2.	Kid was in control
3.	David really enjoys programming.
4.	David shared that enthusiasm.
5.	David shared, in a non-condescending fashion, his thought
	process for the activity.

If those factors are there...hard not to have learning.

That is not to say I could help a kid develop a keen analytical mind by
teaching them, say art.

But ONLY because I am rather pitiful as an artist.

I would expect that perhaps any keen analytical mind that David could
help to develop by teaching programming, or myself by teaching math,
could be as well developed by Natasha teaching Art.

If the kid has interest...let them run with it.  It will help...and it
will get them something I think even better than the keen analytical
mind.  It will get them a sense of control over their lives.

I see this in the news yesterday for the first time, did not know that someone was
actually using lasers for propulsion already.

http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DyeHard/dye990421.html

These scientists are flying a 6-inch diameter craft up 100 feet with a laser (light
amplified by the stimulated emission of radiation or coherent light) as propulsion.

Neat!

It's a bit mythical, but still good. It has the foolishness of assuming that
Jobs, Wozniak ( i know a guy that used to beat him up when they were
little), Gates, and Allen innovated anything. All they did was copy things
and market them well, with a few lucky breaks here and there.

I know that's not really the point, I just wanted to clarify a few things.

Ok, I found this dated March 99

Assisted Suicide Pushed in California
SACRAMENTO -- March 1999 -- California could become the second state 
in the nation to legalize assisted suicide under a bill introduced by 
an East Bay egislator. 
Patterned after Oregon's pro-assisted suicide law, the proposal by 
Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, D-Berkeley, would allow physicians to 
prescribe poison to terminally ill patients who have asked to take 
their own lives. 
The patients, who would have to be expected to be within six months 
of dying, would then have to take the drugs themselves. 
The measure is sure to face powerful opposition from pro-life groups, 
some medical organizations, groups representing disabled people and 
the Catholic Church. 
California voters rejected a slightly different so-called "death with 
dignity" initiative in 1992, but Aroner's bill is the first effort to 
seriously push the idea since Oregon voters made their state the 
first in the nation to legalize assisted suicide. In 1994 and again 
in 1997, voters there approved pro-assisued suicide initiatives. 
In 1998, the first year the Oregon law was in effect, 15 terminally 
ill people ended their lives with lethal medication. Eight other 
people obtained lethal prescriptions, but six died of their illnesses 
before taking the drugs and the other two were living when the study 
ended Jan. 1.

Here is the California law, called the natural death act. This is 
what I was given by the California code of law search engine. It 
seems to recognize this purpose for patients in a medical facility 
with strict regulation for procedures of deciding to terminate ones 
life. (Validation by a certain quota of Dr.s etc.)

http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-
bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=993412497+19+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve

Any other documents I discovered were too graphic for me to read 
fully.

Not corrupted, it was never stored perfectly in the first place. What
we store is more like models of what we thought happened, and they get
updated as we think more about it. When you look back to the
playground incident you will reconstruct it, but the props will be
borrowed so to say from other memories.

On the other hand, why would we want to remember playground incidents?

Definitely way beyond nanotech. Unfortunately, not in a particularly
flattering direction. The free energy people have yet to come up with
something that is replicable and works practically - and the theories
presented are awfully ad hoc. Bearden is better than most, but from an
scientific and academic point of view his papers are unconvincing (I
always get suspicious from "scientific papers" that claim to introduce
fundamental new physical principles and invalidate a lot of old
well-used theories without containing any equations or data but plenty
of quotes of what famous scientists have said).

Unfortunately it is not good *scientific* reading. 

I hate to sound like a greyface, but sometimes it is important to keep
a critical mindset. Open, but critical. As people interested in
radical possibilities we better base our thinking on as much solid
knowledge as possible, if we start putting faith in undemonstrated
hypothesises we will become a cult like any other. By all means, check
the fun theories, but remember that most will just be hot air. If the
above people do demonstrate their hypothesises in a convincing way,
more power to them (and I'll say it to them when they come here to
Stockholm for their prizes). But I'm not holding my breath.

Does nanotechnology hold the key to the extinction of coercive
government?  Can some future Utility-Fog based defense system protect
me and my family from government attempts to extort tax money?  If so,
would government cease to exist once everyone realizes that government
can no longer collect taxes?

I think the answers to the above questions are all Yes.  In light of
this, I suggest the a new Extropian holiday  Taxation Freedom Day! 
Unlike normal holidays, many of which celebrate things that have
happened in the past, Taxation Freedom Day celebrates an event that
will happen at some point in the future.  I think this fits in with
Extropian philosophy rather well  it is certainly optimistic and it
implies perpetual progress.  Im not sure which month and day to choose
 perhaps it can fall around the usual time of the Extropian conference
or the annual Foresight meeting.  I do think that it should be a
dynamic holiday in that the target year can change each year to meet
new expectations of when we will have the technology to resist
government coercion.  

I suggest that the first target year be 2040.  By then all citizens
should have sufficient technology to tell the government to go take a
hike.  As we see more and more technological progress, we can change
the year as we see fit.  

Taxation Freedom Day should be celebrated with lots of exuberance,
fireworks, laser shows, drunken revelry and perhaps a burning effigy or
two of evil IRS agents.  :)

I have been intrigued by this subject in the past and have intended to
pursue analysis of Neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's experiences with conscious
subjects undergoing brain surgery...apparrently, while such individuals were
undergoing surgery they experienced TOTAL recall of rather unremarkable
events in their lives...such as "being in the kitchen washing the dishes
while my husband is on the phone...he is saying "" (what follows is a
verbatim repeat of the conversation about unimportant matters).

Penfield was so shocked by this occurrence that he made it a subject of
considerable investigation during his career. I think we might be getting
close to a time when our brain scanning technology could take a renewed look
at this phenomenon.

Further investigation for extropian readers is the book "of two minds" by
Dr. Fredric Schiffer.
who makes a convincing argument for each person having at least two
"personnas" living one each in each cortical hemisphere...(I've always felt
this way, but have been of two minds on the subject :-)

Finally, for the really adventurous...look into a book which takes a
forensic approach to hypnotism, prior life experiences, and multiple
personality disorder...very provacative, and extremely well
researched...makes the point that it appears that the human mind synthesizes
complete memories and personalities out of the rich fabric of 100%
completely stored memories not consciously recalled or available. And here's
the REALLY interesting thing...I can't remember either the title or the
Author's full name...first name I think was IAN.

I notice that your predictions of computer speed and storage density are
noticeably below what an extrapolation of current trends would predict (i.e.
you have a doubling time of ~2 years, rather than the observed 1 - 1.5).  Is
this deliberate?

I also see a few points to quibble with:
> circa 2005
> 50 Gbt hard drives common, being replaced with completely solid state
devices

Solid state devices are improving, but not any faster than hard drives.  I
don't see desktop machines switching to solid-state unless hard drives stop
improving so fast, and that doesn't seem likely to happen so soon.  People
will only trade their 50 GB disk for a 1 GB persistent RAM device in a few
niche markets, like PDAs and wearables.

> coding of most applications automated

If you mean using code generators to do some of the grunt work, sure (I'm
doing some work on that myself).  But figuring out how to write a novel
program is a process of invention that can't be reduced to algorithms of any
reasonable complexity.  A general-purpose code writing program is thus only
slightly simpler than a sentient AI, which makes this an extremely
optimistic projection.  I'd guess more like 2015-2020.

> first cell-phone implants

Wouldn't this have to go through FDA product-safety testing?  If so, add
about 10 years.

> return of "oil shocks" as third world hydrocarbon consumption skyrockets

Our current oil reserves are so large that even very strong consumption
growth won't send prices up all that much.  Finding and exploiting new
fields is a much cheaper, faster process than it used to be, and we can't
possibly exhaust our total supply in this time frame.  At worst, we might
face shortages several decades in the future.

> a few "intelligent freeways" begin operation in major urban areas

God, I hope not.  Can you imagine what will happen the first time there is a
system crash?  Instead of a small, human-error accident every few days, you
get a huge, photogenic, machine-caused disaster every few years.  Even if
the overall mortality rate is lower, the public won't go for it.

> circa 2005 - 2015

If you mean sentient AI this seems a little optimistic (I'd bet on
2015-2025), but not hopelessly so.  However, IMO non-sentient AI will be
both more common and more important than human-level sentient agents.  It is
also easier to do - it is far simpler to duplicate a single cognitive
ability than an entire mind.

Yes, these were very striking experiments. Made me think everything
were stored perfectly in the brain when I read it as a young boy. But
the problem is, the recall was (if I can remember right :-) extremely
detailled and vivid, but not necessarily what really happened. Just
very good reconstructions of memory traces that would otherwise be
extremely hard to remember.

It still has far too limited resolution, individual cell assemblies
are too subtle to be viewed with foreseeable scanners. The overal
pattern of activation when remembering stuff has been studied, but
that is like saying "it involves typing on the keyboard, watching the
screen and drinking Coca Cola" as a description of programming - true,
but at a too high level.

Our online campaign against the FDIC's proposed "Know Your Customer"
rule was an incredible success! More than 250,000 public comments 
were filed against this assault on financial privacy -- enough to 
stop it dead in its tracks. 

And, more than two-thirds of those comments were generated via
http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com. Thank you!

However, the battle isn't over yet. As you probably have already
discovered, the Federal Reserve's Bank Secrecy Act Compliance Manual
pressures banks to develop policies similar to Know Your Customer --
policies that over 88% of banks have begun to implement. After the heat
dies down, the Federal Reserve Board hopes that they can simply repackage
Know Your Customer as "policy guidelines" instead of "regulations".

We can't allow this to happen.

Congressman Ron Paul has introduced two bills that would put an end to 
Know Your Customer once and for all:
 
* The Know Your Customer Sunset Act (HR 516), which would prohibit Federal
Banking agencies like the FDIC from implementing any form of Know Your
Customer regulation. It already has over 50 cosponsors.

* The Bank Secrecy Sunset Act (HR 518), which would sunset the reporting
requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act -- the underlying legal authority for
Know Your Customer regulations.
. 
If enough Representatives cosponsor these bills, Congress will be forced to
schedule public hearings. Given the broad-based opposition to Know Your
Customer, there is a real chance of enacting at least one of the bills into
law -- if we act now!
 
We've launched a new online petition at http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com to
help build public opposition to Know Your Customer and pressure members of
Congress to cosponsor HR 516 and HR 518. Like before, people who visit the
site can sign an email petition, which will be immediately sent to their
U.S. Representative, and their two U.S. Senators. 

They can also get additional information about Know Your Customer, The Bank
Secrecy Act, HR 516, and HR 518; arrange to forward copies of the letter
below to their friends and family; and read press releases and news
articles about the regulation and the growing campaign to repeal it.

We need you to do two things right now to make this campaign a success, and
persuade members of Congress to cosponsor HR 516 and HR 518:

1) Please visit http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com and sign the petition.

2) Forward the letter below to your friends and family. By triggering a
chain reaction on this issue, we can generate hundreds of thousands of
emails to Congress, and repeal Know Your Customer once and for all.

While it is important that you forward this letter to anyone who might be
interested, it is also important that we not engage in indiscriminate
spamming. If at all possible, please address each message to the individual
you're sending it to and put your name on it. 

Thank you for participating!


- - - - PLEASE SEND THE MESSAGE BELOW TO YOUR FRIENDS - - - - - - -


I'm participating in an Internet campaign to repeal regulations from the
federal government which will force your bank to spy on you, and I'd like
to invite you to join me.

Please forward this message to any friends, family, co-workers, 
neighbors, or other people you know who may be interested, then go 
to http://www.defendyourprivacy.com and sign the petition. It will be
submitted directly to your Representative in the U.S. House. Plus, a copy
will be sent to both your U.S. Senators. 

In December 1998, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposed
a so-called "Know Your Customer" rule. If enacted, Know Your Customer would
have required banks to monitor your checking and savings account, and
report any "unusual transactions" to the federal government.  This
frightening threat to your financial privacy would have forced your bank
to:

  * Discover your source of funds

  * Determine your "normal and expected transactions"

  * Report any "suspicious activity" to federal investigators

However, in the face of overwhelming public opposition, generated in large
part by an Internet campaign like this one, the FDIC withdrew their
proposed Know Your Customer regulation. However, the battle isn't over yet.

It turns out that the Federal Reserve's "Bank Secrecy Act Compliance
Manual" pressures banks to develop policies similar to Know Your Customer,
policies that over 88% of banks have begun to implement. After the heat
dies down, the Federal Reserve Board plans to repackage Know Your Customer
as "policy guidelines" instead of "regulations".

The government claims it is trying to thwart money launderers and drug
dealers. But what this law does is turn every bank teller into a government
informer and everyone with a bank account into a criminal suspect.

In a free society, the government has no business asking where you get your
money or how you spend it -- and politicians have no right to force your
bank to monitor your account. Know Your Customer doesn't need to be
"repackaged" -- it needs to be repealed.

Congressman Ron Paul has introduced the Know Your Customer Sunset Act (HR
516) and the Bank Secrecy Sunset Act (HR 518) that together will repeal
existing Know Your Customer reporting requirements, and prevent any new KYC
rules from being implemented. Together, these two bills will guarantee that
our financial privacy will be respected.

Over 250,000 outraged Americans flooded the FDIC with e-mails, letters, and
faxes during Know Your Customer Round One -- and the FDIC backed down! Now
we need to make sure Congress finishes the job by passing HR 516 & HR 518.

Let's keep up the pressure!

Please forward this e-mail to everyone you know who might be interested in
helping. But please don't send it indiscriminately -- spam will only hurt
our campaign.

Then go to http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com and sign the
petition. Thank you.

Can you guys do me a favour and see if you can hear my audio wav on 
my front page or just my web page links? If it's on both I want to 
remove one, it shows up on persons computer twice, but not on mine. 
Can you tell me if it shows up on both pages for you or not?

Of course it was a joke, really. I only said it 'cause I've been doing a lot of casual 
about
alternative energy sources, in particular, cold fusion.

Who knows, if we can understand the exact processes of the fusion,
then maybe we will be able to create controlled, violent, devastating explosions
differing in magnitude.

Sort of like holding a detonated nuclear warhead in your hand and tremendously
slowing down the chemical reactions and expansion to the point where the most serious
damage sustained amounts to nothing more than a paper cut !

Gather a ton of this normally lethal stuff, ignite, and take the family to
Pluto for vacation !!! ... Andromeda, Vega solar system...

Some years ago, while at the laundromat, I saw a child--almost a
pre-toddler really--who was "helping"-- as children by way of imitation
often will--her nanny do the laundry.  What made this noteworthy was that
the child was VERY young--less than two years old-- and had coordination
skills which were astonishing.  Watching her move with deftness and
deliberation gave the impression of an adult level of physical
competence--like watching a perfectly proportioned miniature grown-up.

I asked the woman I thought was her mother but turned out to be her nanny,
about her extraordinary coordination, and she explained that the parents
had enrolled her in some sort of gynastics, conditioning,
coordination-patterning, exercise program.

How often have we seen massively talented people in any number of fields
whose explanation for their incredible abilities begins with something like
"they started up on this even before they learned to walk."(This sentence
should end with a question mark, but I'm not sure where to put it?)   Ever
notice the breathtaking intensity of focus and attention of children at
that stage?  Point number one: start 'em young, VERY young.

I also think of the stories of William Randolph Hearst and Orson Wells.
They were (1) doted on (lots and lots of emotional stroking), (2) never
told "no", and (3) told repeatedly (at least in the case of Oson Wells)
that they were "geniuses".  What strikes me here--concerning specifically
(2) above-- is that there are mechanisms for self-inhibition which can
choke off the flow of creative and action-promoting abilities.  When--and I
would suggest that it is highly atypical--such self-inhibition is avoided,
energy levels for creativity and action are much--what the limits are here
is a good question--enhanced.  Point(s) number two:  major emotional
nurturance w/feedback loop, minimal teaching of self-inhibition
(interesting point here: discipline is useful for two purposes (1) to
maintain focus, and (2) to avoid "wrong" action), and positive
self-definition.  Restated: (1) motivation and energy potentiation, (2)
avoidance of energy strangulation, and (3) High and distinct self-definition.

Finally, there is fascination, which is the question of finding the things
or things which so captivates the emergent mind that it will blissfully
obsess on it till he/she keels over from lack of food or sleep.  It would
be useful to have a systematic way of finding this.  Toylandia.
Tool-landia.  Infolandia.

As smarter folks than me have observed, our culture has created an
educational system to suit its commercial and idealogical requirements.
(Have you ever noticed that the row-and-column-everyone-facing-front
arrangement of chairs in a classrom is the only geometry that prevents all
other human contact than with the person at the front of the room?)
Contrary to the old saying, you can get any peg into any hole if you're
willing to use sufficient violence and tolerate some broken pegs.  Keeping
your kids away from the educational establishment (the younger they are,
the more valuable this is) is not an EASY option, but I would suggest that
it may be a profoundly good one.

After that, give 'em love, give tools, and get out of their way.  (Cliche
or truism?  You make the call.)

As long as you're soliciting comments: I'm using a non-graphical
browser, so thankfully I have no sound anywhere (just as I prefer).
Your front page is OK, but the Web Links page has nothing but
graphic links with no ALT tags, so all I see is a page full of
[INLINE] [LINK] [INLINE] [LINK] [INLINE] [LINK]...

Before you reply "just get the latest...", I have the latest
browsers with all the whizbang gadgets.  I'm a Java programmer
myself.  It's just that when I'm searching the net for useful
information, I don't care to waste my valuable time downloading
pictures.  Content is the thing: dress it up with pictures if
you like; all the better to attract casual browsers.  But don't
leave out the content entirely for those of us who want words.

To David Musick and assorted co-conspiritors (sic), 

I was very impressed and pleased by your education post to the list.  So
important is the subject to me that I set off to compose a responding post
before finishing even the first page of yours
Then I returned to finish reading about your experiences with programming.
I strongly agree that the reliably unambiguous connection between cause and
effect--you do a thing, you get a thing--that is the essence of successful
programming, is a terrific basis for precise and valid analytical thinking.
 Gadgeteering with mechanical objects in the material world has a similar
accurate feedback training potential, but requires a variety of material
objects.  In programming the variety is a more fundamental property of the
medium.

I hope and suspect that the existence and ubiquitous presence of
programming in the lives of all people from here on out will improve human
intelligence significantly.

IF THIS IS TRUE, THEN AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL TO INTRODUCE KIDS TO PROGRAMMING
AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE AGE WOULD BE A MAJOR, MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH--AN
EXTROPIAN BREAKTHROUGH--IN HUMAN ADVANCEMENT.  

A real creative coup would be to find a way to make it accessible to the
very youngest minds--I think of the baby in the crib looking up at his
mobil, with the bright dangling objects, objects which when pulled on could
be the input device (no way this is a new idea), with a video screen and
speakers higher up and behind.  Imagine the music and movies that could
come out of that!

Dear Anders:

Your point(s) is (are) well-taken.  Nevertheless, you and our 
Extropian compadres should be aware of and appreciate the fact that 
Sirag, in particular, has, over the last 20-odd years, published 
several very innovative and important papers in some of the most 
(deservedly) well-respected and competently referee'd science journals 
in the world.  Among them, NATURE, and, if I'm not mistaken, PHYSICS 
LETTERS. He's got a book out, HYPERSPATIAL Crystallography (sorry, 
can't recall the publisher), and a condensed version of his overall 
stuff appears as an appendix in a volume on consciousness edited by 
Jeff Mishlove (sorry, yet again I can't recall the name of the darn 
book).  I think it's worth checking out.  In basic terms he's arguing 
that there is, essentially, one hyperspatial realm (or, perhaps 
better, meta-realm) which has a very high number of dimensions 
(indeed, is, perhaps, n-dimensional) but which has two utterly 
distinct (yet interactive) algebras.  One algebra describes (indeed, 
more or less IS) spacetime and (more or less n-dimensional) 
hyperspacetime.  The other algebra describes (various levels and/or 
realms of) consciousness.  Now, harking back to mainstream, 
garden-variety philosophy 101, this means that Sirag's stuff is indeed 
in one sense quite monistic (there's ultimately only one 
(hyper)space), but it is utterly dualistic algebraically.  Now  I'm 
sure as heck no Gauss or Euler, but anyone with higher math training 
can follow Sirag's stuff (at least to a fairly significant extent), 
and it certainly seems promising.  Indeed, the algebra(s) involved is 
essentially similar to the stuff already used in super-string 
theory(s).
Now, admittedly, the monistic aspect does strike me as uncomfortably 
Parmenidean, but, hey, if the math works, and ultimately can bring 
forth some useful technology, then I'm cool with it.  But, again, I 
agree whole-heartedly that one should be constructively skeptical 
toward this sort of stuff.  But, in all fairness, Sirag is a competent 
(if not, indeed, brilliant) mathematical physicist who's trying to 
develop an operational physics of consciousness (among other things). 
 I applaud him for this; and rather obviously, it may have profound, 
PRACTICAL implications for uploading, personal identity preservation, 
time travel (even!) and perhaps even more-or-less complete mastery of 
(hyper)spacetime!  Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.  I'm just 
trippin'--Sounds damned near utterly fantastic (i.e., impossibly 
fanciful, if not bull manure).  But then, hey, so did even simple 
(much less fully matured, full-blown) nanotech as recently as, say, 10 
years ago!  And, besides, isn't that ultimately what Extropianism, 
Venturism, Esfandiarianism, etc. is all about?!?!  Attaining 
"god-like" powers over (the ultimate constituents of) reality itself 
(for the joy of self-actualization, or whatever)!!

As for Bearden, well, he's attempting to re-organize (or, perhaps 
better: reconstruct) meta-physics (i.e., the (meta)theoretical 
foundations of physics itself).  Now this may seem a rather 
high-falutin', almost egomaniacal project---but, HEY, SOMEONE'S GOTTA 
DO IT!  Bearden's papers cite several turn-of-the-(20th)century papers 
which, he contends, if properly appreciated and understood, would go 
far both toward revolutionizing current theorizing as well as in the 
bargain integrate quantum theory and (general) relativity.  And, no, 
once again, I don't have the citations handy (MEA CULPA!!), but 
they're readily findable on the net in Bearden's articles.  He, like 
Sirag, should be respected and check out seriously.  Yet, he should be 
studied critically (if not, indeed, skeptically), but also without 
mainstream prejudice.

In sum, Anders, you're right about the critical/skeptical approach to 
this stuff, and I respect your opinion(s), but we Extropians should, 
in my opinion, seriously check Bearden and Sirag's stuff, as it is 
relevant to extropian themes and aspirations (even if much of this 
stuff IS, admittedly, in the nascent stages of its development).

ONWARD AND UPWARD!  TOWARD META-COSMIC HORIZONS!

                                                Best regards to all,
                       
                                                Mark aka CLAY8

Another important consideration in developing more advanced educational
approaches is creating an environment which promotes learning.  I've been
renting a small studio apartment for the past year, and my goal with the
place has been to create a rich and stimulating environment for myself to
learn quickly in.  I have several areas for working on projects, lots of
arts and crafts supplies and other basic supplies and tools.  All my
tools and supplies are very accessable, so when I get the inspiration for
a project, I can set to work immediately.  The walls have lots of intense
and interesting images on them, and I have lots of interesting objects to
look at and handle around the place, which keep my mind occupied even
while sitting, doing nothing.  Of course, I also have a stereo system, a
television, VCR, cable and a Nintendo 64.  I have mounted several eye
hooks in strategic places high on the walls and into the ceiling, which
has allowed me to do all kinds of things, such as hanging a hammock up
(just a blanket, tied at opposite corners), and I often hang wooden
dowels from the ceiling which will support my weight, so I do pull-ups
and gymnastic types of exersize.  There is enough floor space to do all
kinds of exercise, like dancing and martial-arts practice.  The kitchen
allows me to learn cooking skills.  
	
Basically, I have found that I rarely get bored in my small apartment. 
There seems to be no end to the activities I can do there.  I do a lot of
drawing.  I make a lot of geometric models and art.  I work on
body-control exercises, like dancing, martial-arts and gymnastics.  I sit
and think a lot.  I write.  I cook.  I watch educational shows on
television.  I read.  I play challenging video games.  It's all a lot of
fun, and I feel like I am very productive and always learning lots every
day.

Another important point to make is that the lifestyle I've been living
for the past few years has been very inexpensive.  My base living
expenses have been around $600 a month, and I feel that I live quite
comfortably.  The sort of education I've been pursuing for myself does
not cost a lot, and I have not had to worry about getting jobs that pay
me lots of money.  I tend to use my jobs as educational experiences also.
 For the past few years, I've changed jobs about every six months, giving
myself experience in many different types of work, so that now I have
incredible job security; I can work just about anywhere in any city. 

My point is that advanced education doesn't have to cost much; actually,
I haven't noticed that it has to cost any more than it costs to live. 
It's how you spend your time that makes the difference.  It's not
necessary (or advisable, in my opinion) to go to a college or university
and pay thousands of dollars so that people can assign you to do work
that you'd rather not do simply to get the social approval of a degree. 
I personally cannot stand college.  I tried it for a while after having
pursued my own sort of education for a few years, but because of all the
assignments I was required to do, I was not able to learn nearly as
quickly as I do when left to my own devices.  Basically, I felt that
school was interfering with my education, so I quit.

The sort of education which I practice and promote is one that is
diverse, intense, self-directed and inexpensive.  In other postings, I
will describe more the techniques and approaches I use when I learn. 
Hopefully many will find them useful.

Bill,

I just paid $ 2000.00 for a pair of state of the art vidio phones for
one very good use.  I am moving and my daughter is staying behind with
her mom.  To talk to her is good, to talk to her and see each other is
much much better.

Associated Press

 
 Researchers report cloning genetically engineered goats 

BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts researchers say they have cloned three 
goats that are genetically altered to produce a protein in their milk 
that might be used to treat heart attack and stroke victims. 

The cloning could mean faster and less expensive production of the 
protein, Antithrombin III, which has the potential to treat heart 
attacks and strokes and prevent blood clots. It is now being tested 
on humans. 

The cloned goats were born last fall on a farm in Charlton, the Tufts 
University School of Veterinary Medicine and [ Genzyme Transgenics 
Corp. ] of Framingham said Monday. 

"The results could revolutionize the biopharmaceutical industry," 
said Eric Overstrom, a developmental biologist at the Tufts 
veterinary school. 

"We now have a method that is a faster, reliable and more cost-
effective way to produce complex pharmaceuticals for humans and 
animals." 

Currently, methods of producing human proteins for drugs include 
growing them in yeast and taking them from pooled human blood -- 
expensive, risky and low-yield methods, Overstrom said. 

The work is reported in the May 1 issue of Nature Biotechnology. 

Transgenics is the process of implanting genes from one species into 
the DNA of another. It is used to put human genes into animals so 
they will develop human diseases. 

The researchers also came up with a way to use fewer eggs to produce 
a cloned animal. 

It took 140 eggs to produce the first cloned goat, using an older 
method. But the two other cloned goats, twins, were created with only 
92 eggs by using "activated" eggs that were tricked into thinking 
they had been fertilized. 

"Layering the cloning on top of the transgenics (gene-altering) work 
is important in getting the therapeutic proteins to the patients in 
the most efficient manner possible," said Sandra Nusinoff Lehrman, 
president and chief executive officer of Genzyme. 

"The cloning allows you, once you've got the cell line, to much more 
efficiently develop your herd." 

She believes there is a $200 million-a-year market for Antithrombin 
III in Europe, where it is used more than in this country. 

The cloning produces female goats, and goats have a gestation period 
of only five months and produce plenty of milk. 

The first cloned animal was a sheep born in Scotland in 1996.

National science and technology awards presented at White House 

WASHINGTON (April 27, 1999 4:26 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
A researcher who developed a test that helped identify causes and 
effects of DNA damage and a surgeon who performed the first 
successful human heart transplant in the United States were among 
this year's recipients of government awards recognizing pioneers in 
science and technology. 

"Your success in illuminating the hows and whys of our world and 
raising the quality of human existence have helped make the time in 
which we live perhaps the most exciting in human history," President 
Clinton told the honorees Tuesday. "I am humbled by your 
achievements." 

Clinton presented the National Medals of Science and the National 
Medals of Technology in an East Room ceremony at the White House. 

The science medal, established by Congress in 1959 to recognize 
contributions to the physical, biological, mathematical and 
engineering sciences, is the nation's highest scientific honor. 
Behavioral sciences were included in 1962. 

The nine science medal recipients - chosen by the National Science 
Foundation - included Bruce N. Ames, professor of biochemistry and 
molecular biology and director of the National Institute of 
Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, 
Berkeley. Ames' research on environmental and natural mutagens led to 
greater understanding of certain kinds of DNA damage and resulted in 
public policy recommendations on diet and cancer risks. 

The other recipients were: 

-Don L. Anderson, professor of geophysics at the California Institute 
of Technology Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena. 

-John N. Bahcall, professor of natural sciences at the Institute for 
Advanced Study, Princeton University. 

-John W. Cahn, a fellow at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. 

-Cathleen S. Morawetz, professor emerita at the Courant Institute of 
Mathematical Sciences of New York University. 

-Janet D. Rowley, a cancer researcher at the University of Chicago. 

-Eli Ruckenstein, professor of chemical engineering at the State 
University of New York in Buffalo. 

-George M. Whitesides, professor of chemistry at Harvard University. 

-William Julius Wilson of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at 
Harvard University. 

The technology medal, first presented in 1985, recognizes 
breakthroughs in the creation of new or significantly improved 
products, processes or services. 

The recipients, including Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the founder, 
president and surgeon-in-chief of the Texas Heart Institute in 
Houston, Texas, were chosen by an independent committee that answers 
to the Commerce secretary. 

The other technology medal winners were: 

-Kenneth L. Thompson and Dennis M. Ritchie, of Bell Laboratories and 
Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, N.J. 

-Robert T. Fraley, Robert B. Horsch, Ernest G. Jaworski and Stephen 
G. Rogers of Monsanto in St. Louis. 

-Biogen, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. 

-Bristol-Myers Squibb Company of New York City.

There exists an ozone depletion area ("hole") above the Arctic, as well,
mainly active during the Arctic winter season.

According to STUK, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland,
the UV radiation has increased approximately 12% since the beginning of
the 1980s.  STUK expected a 20-30% increase in skin cancer if no change
in the population's behaviour appear (like avoiding the direct sun shine).

The charts showing the movement of the hole showed it rotates, and varies
in size with the rotation.  The hole extended down to Germany and France
during the winter.

I was rooting around my hard drive when I found this piece, originally
written at age 14, by way of making fun of the War on Drugs.  Hope you
guys enjoy.

==

	Sudden Combustive Enlightenment:  Three words that strike fear into the
heart of every parent today.
	In 1996, over 400,000 teenagers died of Sudden Combustive
Enlightenment.  A teenager meditates for the first time every 2.3
minutes.  American inner-city ghettos are littered with broken statues
of Buddha, and the thick smell of incense and the sound of koans fill
government housing for the poor.
	Police have failed to stem the massive tide of Buddhic statues flowing
in from China and Japan.  Adding to the problem are the statues made in
the U.S.  "Everybody's making them." says Chief of Police Steven Miller.
 "They're a quick source of money for anyone who needs it.  We busted a
teacher who had children making them out of Play-Dough."
	Government efforts at prohibition only raise prices and profits for
dealers in meditation, known as "Masters" to their helpless addicts. 
The average statues, or "street statues", cost up to $100 apiece.  The
"good stuff", made from jade and ivory, can cost thousands or even tens
of thousands of dollars.  The typical "Master" has twenty "students" and
makes hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.
	Police tell horror stories of what they find in government housing. 
"There was one room that was so filled with the smoke of incense that we
had trouble breathing." relates Sergeant Foster.  "Cockaroaches scurried
all over the place.  All the lights had been ripped out and replaced
with meditative candles.  In the basement, twenty or thirty teenagers
sat with hands in their laps and a glazed look in their eyes, chanting. 
We put handcuffs on, and most of them didn't notice.  One of them died
on the way to the police station.  He'd meditated for too long.  He
achieved oneness with his inner self and fused his brain.  There was
this huge spike of flame...Thank God we kept them in flameproof blankets."
	Meditation was once a relatively minor social problem, with most forms
providing a minor buzz that was only slightly addictive.  Then more
dangerous forms of meditation became available.  "I'll admit it, we
ignored the problem," says Chief Miller.  "We thought it was just
harmless fun.  But that was Zen.  This is Tao."
	Parents say that even if their child doesn't die of Sudden Combustive
Enlightenment, meditation can ruin their grades in school.  "Jeffrey was
always at the top of his class," tells his mother, Mrs. Burns.  "Then he
and some friends went out for a night on the town.  One of his friends
gave him this crude idol of Buddha, and told him to try it sometime. 
Soon he was chanting and burning incense.  His grades started to go
down.  His answers at school were always obscure.  Then one day he
snapped completely.  He wrote 'the Tao that can be integrated is not the
true Tao' on his math exam.  He wrote something about a tree in a golden
forest on his history essay.  It was like a nightmare."
	Gangs of "students" often have "theological disagreements" that end in
violence.  In 1996, there were 3,000 shootings over disputes on the
"Eightfold Path" alone.  "Students" rob banks and start health-food
stores to buy incense and statues of Buddha.
	Continued meditation rapidly leads to complete mental and physical
disintegration.  One of the first side effects of meditation is baldness
and a tendency to chant.  The "student" invariably refuses to give
straight answers.  Once hard-core meditation begins, answers become
completely irrelevant.  In the advanced stages, five out of four
"students" become schizophrenic.  And then there is the dreaded Sudden
Combustive Enlightenment, in which too much time spent meditating leads
the "student" to become "one with his inner self".  In SCE, plutonium
atoms in the brain undergo nuclear fusion, absorbing large amounts of
energy and lethal radiation.
	Psychiatrists who speculate why teenagers turn to meditation believe
that it is the result of an inability to answer the moral questions of a
complex world.  "Their friends tell them 'meditate, and all shall become
clear'.  That can be very tempting to teenagers who want easy answers." 
On the other hand, "students" say much the same thing when asked why
otherwise sane people become psychiatrists.
	Can "students" be cured?  At the Medititational Rehabilitilitation
Center, scientists are looking for a way.  Hardly a week passes without
some new sign of hope.  Recently published results indicate that three
out of four "students" constitute almost 75% of those who have fallen
prey to this debilitating addiction.  Despite this, the hold of
meditation, once established, is almost impossible to break.  The best
cure, they say, is not to start.

	If you find your teenager meditating, call the Rehabilitilitation
Hotline at 1-800-DON'T-ZEN.  Remember:  Tomorrow may be too late.

The AP now reports that recent Legion of Honor recipient Herbert Young
has died at 112...not sure and how many months...but I guess this leaves
Denzo Ishisaki(also 112) unchallenged as the oldest man in the world.

Sarah Knauss by all indications still breathes at 118 years,7 months...
so she has been alive most of the time since February 1762,and a child
born today would be younger then she is now even in November 2117.
(Say,where would Moore's Law be by then?)

That I can understand.  But how often would you use it for normal phone
calls?

I'm not saying such things won't exist.  I just don't they they will be
widely adopted in the consumer market until very sophisticated image
filtering methods are available.

BTW, this isn't just my personal opinion.  The telephone companies ran into
this issue back in the 80s when they were experimenting with analog
videophones, and it is one of the things that convinced them to drop the
idea.  They kept getting complaints from users who didn't want to be seen by
everyone they talked to, and turning off the display just made everyone
wonder what you were hiding.  At the time they couldn't come up with a good
solution to the problem.

Given that the "hole" in the Antarctic was there in the 1950's, before 
widespread use of CFC's, it seems unlikely that it will go away.

While I am not sure that 12% increase is an accurate figure, if it is,
that's about equivalent to mov`ing south 75 miles.

um... i see alot of things on this list about life extension and
immortality, this is a good thing.

but this really brings up something for me. what quality of life do
these people have? Is it worth living forever only to be perpetually
confused by everything or have degraded cognitive processes?

Some concrete suggestions: there are N number of sounds ever used in any
human language; I think N is about a hundred or so.  Anyway, many of
these sounds are used in English, but some are not, and native English
speakers have a great deal of difficulty learning to pronounce these
sounds.

According to one study, if you exposed infants to these non-English
sounds, even without any further exposure,
years later they would be able to pronounce those sounds correctly.  A
pretty easy way to help the kid to speak fluent Hindi later in life if
he's interested.

According to many studies, breast feeding may be a significant factor in
later IQ development, although I'm a bit skeptical of these claims,
since it would be hard to properly control a study.

Surprisingly, some studies show that early musical training
substantially enhances ability in math and science later in life.  This
study shows that music is even more effective than computer experience:
http://www.amc-music.com/prbrain.htm

I got intrigued and did a little research of my own, I found these
links.  I have no idea if the information on here is reliable, but it at
least seemed relevant:
http://www.parenting-baby.com/
http://www.infantelligence.com/

All this aside, it's worth noting that study after study strongly
suggests that 80% of IQ is inherited.  I suspect that current techniques
aren't going to be able to affect raw intelligence by much more than
20%.  This in no way diminishes the importance of education, which can
have a profound effect on a person's intellectual efficacy; sometimes
you're better off with really good software that runs on a 486, rather
than buggy software that runs on a Cray.  My point is that I know of no
established technique that can raise the processor speed by more than
20%.

I suspect that in the vast majority if not all of these cases, the
reason the kid was so strongly attracted to the activity in question is
_because_ he was a prodigy, rather than that the skills developed
through early childhood intervention.

This is not to say there's anything wrong with giving kids the option of
trying advanced activities at an early age, without pressuring them.  It
sounds like that gymnastics class was very well matched for that kid. 
But I think it's important to recognize that children do have real
limitations of ability, and pushing too hard on them is going to be
painful for the child.

Which brings us back to a point made by others; kids know what they're
interested in, and how fast they want to go.  Harnessing that is going
to be the most powerful thing you can do.

I was told that there was a study done on young Nobel prize winners that
showed that they fell into two camps; half of them went on to have rich
scientific careers, making several discoveries that could have qualified
for the prize.  The other half were ruined by it, and never being able
to top their early work, never produce anything meaningful again.

The very likely case is that any given child is not a genius, in which
case telling him that he's a genius will only set him up to feel like
anything he accomplishes will not be enough.  Even child prodigies often
find that the extraordinary degree of their ability fades in adulthood.

If the child really does have extraordinary talents, it seems
appropriate to let him know.  But there is a danger to emphasizing these
abilities too much.  Even if the parents intend otherwise, a child is
likely to develop two misconceptions - first, that his self worth should
be dependent on his intelligence, and
secondly, that he is fundamentally different than other people, and
better.

What I would do if I had a really brilliant child is to acknowledge that
the child was exceptionally intelligent, tell the child that it's a
great gift and he's very lucky to have it.  That it is true that
sometimes he will understand things that other people won't, even
adults.  That he may be able to achieve things that have never been done
before.  But that having great ability with abstract thinking does not
automatically translate into having great ability with the human
problems of life - emotional resilience, compassion, courage,
independence, integrity - and that on the human problems of life, even a
retarded person might have something to teach him.

To any child, I would emphasize that human beings, in general, have
great capacity, much greater capacity than is fully utilized, and that
the child should dream big, not because he's a genius and has special
talents, but because he's a person and his dreams are powerful.  

A very funny piece on Suck about hearing "You're so smart!" at an
impressionable age:

_Separating School And State_ by Sheldon Richmond has some devastating
quotes from the people who founded the US public school system; their
explicit goal was to train factory workers, and there are a lot of
quotes about squelching individuality.  I believe it's in that book
where I saw the study that showed that literacy rates in the city
surveyed (Pittsburgh?) have dropped substantially in the 100 years since
public schooling was introduced.  (dang, why don't I have this book
anymore?  Sorry to not have the actual numbers.)

I would also note that the public school system was initially opposed by
most people; it was not a natural outgrowth of our culture, but the work
of a small group of people who were able to get the right bills passed.
Like so many unfortunate goverment projects, people can now no longer
imagine its absence.

Oh well, I'm looking forward to the day when finally all information is
available online.
But not simply just like the books in a store, but linked, cross-referenced.
The accomplishment of this huge time-consuming task would be the beginning
of a new era, where all information is free to anyone. The improvement of
smart agents will greatly improve the speed of information processing.
Still, human interference is still necessary throughout this process.
A libertarian and democratic state is impossible without this. You cannot
possibly participate in the decisions on any kind of mater before knowing
the facts. As long governments and their agencies as well as all kinds of
corporations try to make an advantage of hiding information from the public,
this ultimate goal will not be achieved. As long as some keep spying on us
without us being able to check the data collected, this is a form of
oppression. The control of the flow of information is a key to power. We
must not tolerate others to keep this control. But for now, I see no way
that this will change soon. There is too much money to be made with this,
and no one would give such power from his hands without cause.

But some day, I hope, at least a part of humanity will become intelligent
enough to understand this. Up to now, most humans do not even realize that
they are undergoing a silent brain-washing process by television and other
media. The truth is somewhere out there, but definitely beyond the news. How
can you possibly begin thinking when there is no one to teach you the
basics? Most people around me trust blindly in the information they get from
newspapers, magazines and television. They get blown up with so much hot air
that they aren't able to judge between truth and fake. Most of it being fake
...

I do not believe in conspiracies, but propaganda has always been a method of
politics, and with today's technology, mass psychology is the key to power.
For further reading I would suggest Le Bon : The Psychology of the Masses.
It depcits the methods of manipulating public oppinion. Although quite old,
the techniques may change, but the logic behind it is always the same. The
infamous Dr. Goebbels has written a book on the same theme, but although I
was able to find out about its existence, I was not able to buy and read it.
Well, in Germany it is still difficult to get hold of books from the Dark
Age of the Third Reich. Although most of what was published in that time is
junk, I do not understand why it should be forbidden. An intelligent human
should be able to find out about the quality of information himself.
Censorship is always bad. I do not see advantage in this. One exception: The
privacy of humans stands above the right of free information. The freedom of
anyone ands where the freedom of the other begins.

enough for today .. hope to read some comment on this

DISCLAIMER: I do not speak for Ameritech or it's alliance partners.
My opinion's are my own.


Actually TPC has been experimenting with this since the 60's, I was
one of the last group of tech's to service the original equipment
at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry when it was running
there, and recently have restored some of this equipment for our
archives folk.

The problem has always been bandwidth, plus the large amount of
equipment and service required. If the equipment/bandwidth was
cheap and reliable, everyone would have one of these.(IMMHO)

I could see many people doing the PeeWee Herman dress-up version of
this, not to mention adult calls/wrong numbers as in "Demolition
Man".

I had one of these sitting on my desk for a month running a
continual link between myself and the archives folks, it was a
blast.... with it's weird art deco housing, I felt like I was in
the flick "2001 A Space Odyssey".

Well, this seems to be quite far-flung from our point of view.
Let's consider something more realistic. We shot up loads of tech into
space. This now-junk could be recycled to biuld up something new. This junk
travels around at highspeed, but anyway, a space vehicle orbiting our plante
would do this, too. All it would need is a sort of "tractor beam" (hey, yet
*another* Sci-Fi technology) to haul all the junk in. This might seem way
off our tech level, but as most of this junk is magnetic, you could use some
kind of magnetic force to 1. catch it and 2. haul it onboard at non-lethal
speed. You wouldn't want to pull in debis at >4.000 km/h. This could be more
realistic than the nanosail discussed before.

The purpose of education is to prepare oneself with the knowledge and
skills necessary to make good decisions and improve one's overall
situation.

Education is basically about developing an increasingly accurate and
useful understanding of one's overall situation, including one's own
ability to modify one's overall situation.

Advanced Education is centered on helping individuals recognize their own
abilities and supporting them in developing their abilities even further.

Advanced Education is focused on improving all of one's existing
abilities.  If you can see, you can learn to see more clearly. If you can
think, you can learn to think more clearly, more creatively, more
intelligently.  If you can move your body, you can learn to increase your
strength, dexterity, flexibility, agility, endurance and efficiency in
your movements.  If you can learn, you can learn to learn more quickly,
more thoroughly.  If you can make choices, you can learn to improve the
quality of the choices you make.  If you can enjoy living, you can learn
to enjoy living more fully.  If you can do something, you can learn to
improve at it.

Advanced Education relies on the determination of individuals to improve
their overall situation and the cooperation of others with complementary
goals.

Advanced Education relies on an accurate perception of one's situation
and one's abilities.  One cannot make good decisions without an accute
understanding of one's situation and one's options.  

To develop a more accurate perception of one's situation and one's
abilities, one must improve sensory, perceptive and cognitive abilities. 
To improve sensory and perceptive abilities, one must learn to be more
alert to each moment of experience and pay attention to the details and
to the larger patterns of experience.  To improve cognitive abilities,
one must learn to be more alert to one's own thinking and pay attention
to the more subtle aspects of thinking, to pay close attention to all the
cascades of thoughts that every experience triggers.  To develop a more
accurate perception of one's situation and one's abilities, one must pay
close attention to one's current situation and abilities.

Advanced Education relies on the commitment of the individual to improve
all their skills and abilities.  To improve one's skills and abilities,
one must use one's skills often and pay close attention to all one's
actions as one is performing them.  This provides instant feedback and
assists in quick self-correction of behavior.

The most basic lesson in Advanced Education is to pay intense attention
to the present moment.  All other lessons rely on that lesson.  With
practice, paying intense attention to the present moment becomes easier
as it becomes a normal aspect of one's behavior.  The present moment is
considered the most important moment because it is when one makes
choices, and learning to make choices which improve one's overall
situation is the main point of Advanced Education.

There is no 'tear'. An object becomes a black hole when its mass is contained within a radius where the escape velocity is at or above light speed. It is still a physical object, and can be manipulated with ion guns and magnetic fields.

The question is what is causing it though (yes there is a smaller version of the hole in the arctic). Since ground level temps are normal in the arctic but much lower than historical levels at the ionosopheric level where the ozone is, this tells me that while greenhouse gasses may be keeping ground level heat in, the lack of high altitude particulates (cause by our shift away from widespread use of 'dirty' fossil and wood fuels), is allowing high altitude heat to escape too quickly. From what I've seen, the ozone depletion is most directly caused by the drop in ionospheric seasonal temperatures that is lower than historical norms. Chlorine ions have nothing to do with the temperature....

This fight is now over, at least for now.

I'm posting a copy of a document I just received regarding income taxes
here in the US that some of you may want to read, esp. the legal types here
for evaluation purposes.

the nation's freedom. If indeed the income tax is to be done away with, the
battleground of the future will concentrate in the area of information
management systems that infringe on rights to privacy. It should come as no
surprise that there are many large computer databases maintaining records
on almost everyone. Some are maintained by the government and some by
private business; but each system of records depends on the assignment of a
number to individuals within the database. Such assignments have one
purpose: They facilitate a positive identification of the individual who is
the bearer of the number. With rare exception, the numerical common
denominator between all of these systems of recordsboth government and
non-governmentis the social security number. A numerical assignment such
as this has two advantages in a computer program. First, it prevents
duplicate records from occurring within the system of records; and second,

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with either efficiency or numerical
identification. What is ominous is the common denominator on which these
systems of records depend. . . the social security number. While the number
itself is not evilit's intended purpose - to positively identify
everyonehas the potential for establishing a method of control far greater
than the income tax or a value added tax could ever achieve. In fact, that
9-digit number has become the greatest single threat to our individual
sovereignty today. Its mass acceptance by an increasingly apathetic and
uneducated nation makes possible an economic system where cash is obsolete
and a new order imminent. More than a few people have recognized that

cannot function. The social security number is the key to this system,

the system will flourish and expand. But what do you think would happen if
people began revoking their applications to obtain or retain a benefit

way. Results have been predictable. Public response, for example, to the
so-called requirement for obtaining a social security number prior to
drivers license renewal is a prime example of an issue where the battle
lines have already been drawn. For clarification to new readers, there
really was (in most states) no requirement to obtain a social security
number to apply for a drivers licenseonly an illusion (intentional or not)
created for the benefit of the average person. The law does require those
who have a number to submit it; but, individuals who do NOT have a social
security number are under no obligation to obtain one. According to the
Director of the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for example,
individuals without a number merely write NONE in the space provided -
but the government was not honest with the people, nor was the media who
blindly parroted what they were told without verifying the information. Un
control of an educated public willing to assert their rights, then it's all
over for global government. An increasing number of people realize the
implications of participation and do not wish to voluntarily cooperate in
the systematic dismantling of their form of government or the liberty that
their fathers have enjoyed. Growing in number, these groups of people are
asserting their rights, refusing to volunteer, and creating a major problem
for planners of global government. We understand that the States of
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana, and Tennessee (among others) have already
backed down on the so called requirement to obtain a social security number
for drivers license renewals (see article this issue). More are on the way,
and as the number of people willing to assert their rights continues to
increase, the government is forced to capitulate on other (globalist)
policies that have no provision in U.S. law.

citizen, an agency of government would be required by law to prove (in

a lawful requirement, the burden of proof would now be shifted to the
indvidual who must show that the government does not have jurisdiction with

set back for the architects of the new paradigm considering the speed at

mechanics of the process used the additional time to solidify the necessary
voluntary participation by creating perceived needs. They then
perpetuated their agenda in the face of opposition by exchanging

the new voluntary social programs that were the key to various
presumptions and jurisdiction(s). These programs were designed to touch
the lives of almost every American, and today, over 50% of the general
public receives some form of government assistance. Is it any wonder that
the vote of the p

brought about through the synthesis of economic and social situations,
without which, there could be no effective implementation. However,
government funded technology was racing along, and preparations were being
made to lay the foundation for such a system. All that remained was to
assign numbers to everyone. There was only one stumbling block to face
within the United States. The success of the new social order would depend
on the voluntary compliance previously mentioned. Why? Because under the
law, (limitations imposed by the Constitution), participation could not be
required. It wouldn't have to be. Given a change in the presumption of

Internal Revenue Code. The relationship is contractually significant when
the employee with a social security number submits a W-4 to the

employer has the authority to withholdnot necessarily a legal
requirement (by law) to withholdbut an authority to withholdgranted not

withhold belongs to the employerifhe has chosen to participate and

final determination by submitting the W-4. To do so is to create an implied
legal obligation (a presumption). The tax associated with the requirement

the only ones required to participate. But nonresident aliens are also the
subject of the income tax. Whoops! The amount of withholding (30%) is
geared to those who are the subject of the income tax laws. Since the law
is mandatory for those to whom it applies, it could be presumed that a
participant is required by law to participate, and thus the full brunt of
withholding is born by those volunteering. Does this then mean that someone
who chooses to volunteer, subjects himself to the same requirement for a
deduction of income tax that would be required of all nonresident aliens
under Subtitle A? Nonot necessarilybut again it's irrelevant because the
nature of the problem involves a misapplication which has no provision in
law to begin with. To errantly and illegally enforce any given provision,
the presumption is all that matters. Section 1441 requires cert
from statute. If the only liability arising from statute is section 1461
(for the withholding agent making payments to nonresident aliens), then the
only plausible presumption that one might arrive at, is that the U.S.
citizen is filing a 1040 return on behalf of his nonresident alien
principle. Treasury Decision 2313 (TD 2313) confirms the requirement for a
withholding agent to file a 1040 return on behalf of his nonresident alien
principle. There are few other presumptive alternatives. For further
confirmation of this logic examine the form letter sent to most nonfilers.
A U.S. citizen living and working within the 50 states, (who has been
filing returns) but suddenly stops filing, will usually receive a form
letter 8176 from the IRS. The IRS regulations and publications identify
this form as a request for backup withholding from a withholding agent
who has not filed the appropriate return. The entire process is
fundamentally illogical but it results from ignorance on the part of those
who file, and

from view that which we fear. Old age, incapacity, or any unknown is
fearful but in the mind of the public, social security reduces the element

social security? Conceptually, the program is not unlike insurance (hence
the deceptive title). If everyone puts just a little in, then everyone
benefits a lot, given that the unforeseen rears its ugly head --- right? To
the average person that sounds perfectly logical. Everyone runs to get the
social security card. Now they have a secure retirement! Now they are
protected in case of disaster. If it benefits everyone, then it must be for
the general welfare- - right? If it's for the general welfare of the
people then it must be constitutionalright? These incorrect beliefs, are
not only wrong, they are irrelevant. Since voluntary participation does not
require Constitutional authority, it is not necessary for them to bene
ancially oppressed people. Slowly people were led to believe that this
number holds the key to security and that without it, the fabric of society
would be irreparably damaged. They mindlessly accepted what they were told.
Slowly employers and businesses were led to believe that they needed a
number too, and then everyone rushed to obtain or retain the benefit, or
participate in what they thought was required. If you want to build credits
for your protection you must participate. To build credits you must
subject yourself to the requirements associated with the wage tax (that is
not imposed by law) but which subjects you to the jurisdiction of the
agency that administers it. To accomplish this, fill out a W-4 Form. Make
sure you put your number on the form or you will not receive the
protection you desire. Do you want a refund for the amount you overpaid
--- just file a return. Who files a return?presumably, those who are
required by law to file a return. Oh what a tangled web we weave . . .

participate. Existing provisions are limited to government agencies or
corporations (a creation of government) that are operating in the insular
island possessions (Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, etc.) and outside of
Constitutional purview. The employer can volunteer however. Even though the
law does not require his participation, he can apply for a number. If the
employer is not required by law to obtain a federal ID number to manage the
account whereby moneys are withheld from nonresident aliens and other
foreign entities (sections 1441, 1442, and 1443 of the IR Code) then he can
make application for approval so that a number can be assigned to create an
account for his voluntary compliance. Regardless of the method, once
entering into this relationship via application, the voluntary participants
become employer and employee as defined for purpose of Subtitle C. The
employee is then a covered employee as defined within, how

> THE STRUCTURE OF THE CODE
>
> The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is not applied generally. It is
structured into subtitles. Subtitle A is income tax and its provisions are
found in chapters 1 through 6. The application of the income tax is
confined to those chapters and does not extend beyond. Just as the
application of the income tax is confined within those chapters, the
application of the other taxes in the IRC are found to be confined within
their respective chapters in the same manner. Moreover, the legal authority
conferred in one subtitle does not extend to the enforcement of law in some
other subtitle. For example, the authority to withhold under Subtitle C is
found in section 3402 (keep in mind that Subtitle C is not imposedit is
voluntary!) The requirement to withhold under Subtitle A is found within
section 1441, 1442, and 1443. The application of these sections and their
requirements are unrelated. In 3402 the authority to withhold is predicated
upon employee participationIn sections 1441, 1442, and 1443, the
requirement to 
n Subtitle F, no one can find it. The IRS calls that voluntary compliance
and the IRS is correct. It is significant to understand why the government
uses the term voluntary compliance. Subtitle A (income tax) is imposed by
law, and although limited in application, compliance is mandatory for those
to whom it applies (nonresident aliens etc.). Subtitle C (employment taxes)
however is NOT imposed, therefore compliance cannot be enforced. When the
government through various IRS officials talk about voluntary compliance,
to what are they referring? Are they referring to their ongoing
misapplication of law with regard to Subtitle A, or are they referring to
mass participation under the un-imposed Subtitle C?
>
> GOTCHA!

> In examining the basis of illegal enforcement we find a tenuous but
presumptive relationship between the two subtitles. The subject of legal
actions against non taxpayers stems from the belief that everyone must pay
the income tax (which is confined to Subtitle A)Cross references in
Section 5 of the Internal Revenue Code confirms that Subtitle A does not
pertain to citizens.

That employer is a government agency or corporation, not a common law
employer, unless of course that common law employer voluntarily applies by
submitting a Form SS-4 Application for Employer Identification Number.
When the employer submits this application the following terms (we will use
the terms as they are defined within Title 20 since they are more concise)
come into play. Title 20 Code of Federal Regulations Sections 404.1003,
404.1004, and 404.1005 Employment means. . . any service covered by
social security performed by an employee. . . What work is covered as

covered as employment under social security Who is an employee You must
be an employee for your work to be covered as employment for social s
ds entitlement. It cannot be forced (enforced) upon the citizen. However,
if the IRS were going to intentionally misapply the law, how would they do
it? Subtitle A is clearly limited in application and does not pertain to
U.S. citizens in the 50 states. Subtitle C however is different. Subtitle C
has provisions for citizens who are voluntary participants, and the
similarity in certain provisions allows for a blurring of authority as to
the application of the income tax. To make use of this, IRS personnel need
only presume that the individual in question had a requirement to file a
return. Section 6012 requires returns of income to be filed but only for
subtitle A (Income tax). Notice that there are no provisions in Subtitle C
which require the U.S. citizen employee to file.

> Obviously, aliens do not give statements of citizenship! Income tax under
Subtitle A is withheld from aliens only. Chapter 3 is in Subtitle A, not
Subtitle C. Without an application for voluntary participation, the
employer is not an employer and may not participate for the benefit of
his employees. Without making application, the employer cannot be forced to
participate. But what employer doesn't want to give his employees a
benefit. These and other perks are factors that are considered in the
market place of quality labor and it is natural for the employer to want to
participate, even though he or she may not realize that it is voluntary.
Our members are aware of this. Some are employers who do not participate.
Edward Kotmair, the son of the fiduciary for the S.A.P. Fellowship, is a
large (common law) employer who does NOT participate. He has no federal ID
number, and his employees give him statements of citizenship to forward to
the IRS. The government has tried to coerce his participation but h
 not require you to participate, then don't participate. With participation
comes the very intervention and control that is now stifling the economy.
Even covered employees (as previously defined) who have actually applied
for the social security benefit need not participate unless they wish to
build up credits. This fact can be verified by examining the general
provisions in Subtitle F. We challenge you to find any that relate to
Subtitle C. If Subtitle C does not come under the law then it can in no way
be imposed. Of coursethose who don't pay, don't get any benefit.

agency for a jurisdictional ruling about himself. In a free country, this
new deal concept is ridiculous, and the Court's decision is a tacit
acknowledgment that the government has created a jurisdiction, effectively
secret in nature, which it withholds from the general public. The
non-existence of a requirement not withstanding, presumptions to the
contrary have grown into the belief that there really is a legal
requirement to obtain the number, and so to file a return and pay a tax.
Common sense should indicate that the social security number is not
required. After all, if something is required, there is no need to apply
for itit will be given to
and though ironic - it is participation that is unpatriotic. Participation
actually serves to undermine the limits of authority that the Constitution
places on the government; and, it gives the government an authority that it
would not ordinarily have. The perpetual misapplication of law that is made
possible by its implementation, and the overall effect that it has on
limited government, serves to effectively usurp the Constitution to which
the government is subject. The average person does not understand the
reason for the number, and therefore, cannot understand the reason for
rejecting it.

benefits associated with it to buy votes. If they can't buy votes then what
happens? We get our freedom back. Graft and influence fade away and we end
up with the constitutional government that was intended by the founders.
Right now, the tentacles of this numerical nightmare go off in every
direction. The one reaching out to grip the drivers license requirement has
just been cut off, and the government has recoiled from the adverse public
reaction that was so unexpected. That's just the beginning. With your help,

to world government and cashless transactions. We have examined the

Of course, this is a rather different kind of physical object from the
kind of objects we are used to. It is really made of spacetime
curvature than matter/energy (or more properly, the traditional
matter/energy parts have been hidden inside and may have become
something completely different - it doesn't matter). But it can be
pushed around and likely used, so it is really an object. The
spacetime as a rubbersheet analogy is good to a point, but then it
starts to fail.

Obviously, the goal is to extend the useful years of life. But
centenarians are so to say "over the hump", while many are somewhat
frail compared to younger people they are as a rule the most resilient
of their generation and often surprisingly active (the less reslient
and active have long since dropped off).

The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has
a right to food, clothing, and education.  "Rights" apply only between
person and person, not between person and Nature.  I can have a "right"
for you not to punch me in the nose; I can't have a "right" to eat a
meal.  Maybe I have the "right" to take your meal away from you and eat
it, but if that's what they meant, they should have said so.

I don't know if anyone has phrased it that way before, but it strikes me
as being a clean logical-plane counter to an unfortunate way of
thinking, so I thought I'd share it.

Black holes are thought to form from stars or other massive objects 
if and when they collapse from their own gravity to form an object 
whose density is infinite: in other words, a singularity. During most 
of a star's lifetime, nuclear fusion in the core generates 
electromagnetic radiation, including photons, the particles of light. 
This radiation exerts an outward pressure that exactly balances the 
inward pull of gravity caused by the star's mass. 

As the nuclear fuel is exhausted, the outward forces of radiation 
diminish, allowing the gravitation to compress the star inward. The 
contraction of the core causes its temperature to rise and allows 
remaining nuclear material to be used as fuel. The star is saved from 
further collapse -- but only for a while.

Eventually, all possible nuclear fuel is used up and the core 
collapses. How far it collapses, into what kind of object, and at 
what rate, is determined by the star's final mass and the remaining 
outward pressure that the burnt-up nuclear residue (largely 
iron) can muster. If the star is sufficiently massive or 
compressible, it may collapse to a black hole. If it is less massive 
or made of stiffer material, its fate is different: it may become a 
white dwarf or a neutron star.

And also:


Black holes are formed when a star dies.Usually, the star is very 
big, which is at least three times as massive as the sun.All of its 
mass is squeezed into a single point. At this point, both time and 
space stop. It's really hard for us to imagine a place like that, but 
that's how it is in the center of a black hole.

The center of a black hole is called a singularity. Within a distance 
of the singularity, the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, 
not even light, can escape. That distance is called the event 
horizon. It's like the point of no return.

When people talk about the size of a black hole, they are referring 
to the size of the event horizon. The more mass the singularity has, 
the larger the event horizon is.

Many people think that nothing can escape the gravity of a black 
hole. But if this were true, then the whole universe would be sucked 
into the black hole. Stars and planets can circle the black hole if 
they are far enough away from the singularity. Only if things get to 
close to the singularity they cannot escape.

Black holes are truly black. That makes them extremely hard to 
detect. When black holes collide with other objects including other 
black holes, it will ring with a unique frequency, known as its 
natural mode of vibration. This frequency will tell scientists if 
they have really detected a black hole. It will also tell them how 
big the black hole is and how fast it's spinning.-Chris Morris

   black hole


in astronomy, theoretically predicted final stage in the life history 
of certain stars (see stellar evolution). A star in the last phases 
of gravitational collapse is often referred to as a black hole. The 
collapse begins when a star has depleted its steady sources of 
nuclear energy and can no longer produce the expansive force, a 
result of normal gas pressure, that supports the star against the 
compressive force of its own gravitation. As the star shrinks in size 
(and increases in density), it may assume one of several forms 
depending upon its mass. A less massive star may become a white 
dwarf, while a more massive one would become a supernova. If the mass 
is less than 3 times that of the sun, it will form a neutron star. 
However, if the final mass of the remaining stellar core is more than 
3 solar masses, nothing remains to prevent the star from collapsing 
without limit to an indefinitely small size. At this point, the 
effects of Einstein's general theory of relativity become paramount. 
According to this theory, space becomes curved in the vicinity of 
matter; the greater the concentration of matter, the greater the 
curvature. When the star (or supernova remnant) shrinks below a 
certain size determined by its mass, the extreme curvature of space 
seals off contact with the outside world. The place beyond which no 
radiation can escape is called the event horizon. For a star with a 
mass equal to that of the sun, this limit is a diameter of only 1.8 
mi (3 km). Even light cannot escape the black hole but is turned back 
by the enormous pull of gravitation. Because light and other forms of 
energy and matter are permanently trapped inside the black hole, it 
can never be observed directly. However, a black hole could be 
detected if it is orbited by a visible star or during the collapse 
while it was forming. Four possible black holes have been detected in 
our galaxy, the Milky Way. The first discovered (1971) is Cygnus X-1, 
an X-ray source in the constellation Cygnus. In the 1980s, one of the 
strongest cases for a black hole was identified in the constellation 
Monoceros and labeled A062000. V404 Cygni, close to Cygnus X-1, and 
Nova Muscae 1991 in the constellation Musca were discovered more 
recently.

Yes, but the problem is, the space junk is in *different* orbits, each of
which have enormous velocity relative to each other.

OK, you invent a tractor beam, Karsten, and I will quit my 9 to 5, and

Almost none of it is.  There may be a *little* iron, but it is mostly aluminum.

Unique Neurons Make People, Apes Smart - Report
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unique type of brain cell seems to separate 
humans and apes from lower animals, and may make them smarter, 
scientists say.

But the neuron clusters come at a price -- they may make us 
susceptible to diseases such as Alzheimer's, the researchers at the 
California Institute of Technology and Mount Sinai School of Medicine 
in New York said.

The large, spindle-shaped cells are found in humans, bonobos, 
chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, but not any other type of 
animal, Patrick Hof of Mount Sinai and his colleagues report in this 
week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Bonobos are a type of chimpanzee recently found to be a distinct 
species and more closely related to humans than other chimpanzees. 
And Hof's team also found that bonobos have more of these cells than 
the other apes.

``This declining concentration matches the degree of relatedness of 
these apes to humans,'' John Allman of Caltech said in a statement.

The brain cells could finally offer what many people have searched 
for -- a defining element that separates humans from the animal world.

Criteria have fallen by the wayside one by one with discoveries that 
gerbils have a fairly sophisticated language to warn of predators, 
that birds use tools and that dolphins can respond to the grammatical 
structure in hand signals.

Several chimpanzees have been taught to use either sign language or 
computers to communicate and have been shown to use original thought 
in structuring sentences.

Hof and Allman's team looked at 28 different species of primate, and 
at humans who died and had autopsies.

They found their spindle cells in the anterior cingulate cortex of 
the brain, which controls automatic functions such as heart rate but 
which also has been linked to emotions -- including the emotional 
response to pain -- and facial expressions.

``Spindle cells were notably absent in the gibbon as well as in New 
World monkeys, Old World monkeys and all of the prosimians (such as 
lemurs),'' they added.

The findings show that, as biologists have long said, chimpanzees and 
bonobos are the closest relatives of humans.

``The observation that among humans and great apes, chimpanzees have 
spindle cell densities comparable to humans -- and it is the bonobo 
whose spindle cell distribution most closely matches that of the 
human -- underscores the relatedness of Homo (the human species) and 
Pan (the chimpanzee species),'' they wrote.

Spindle cells in this area have also been shown to be affected in 
Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, the 
researchers pointed out. This suggests that the susceptibility to 
such diseases may have evolved only recently.

Me too.  Karsten, I was at Yale a few years ago with a friend who
was an alumnus of that establishment.  He showed me a library there
which houses a collection of books, most of which were published in
the 18th century.  I was astounded there were so many of them, in
the days before automatic typesetting.  As it turns out, one cannot
browse these books, as they are too delicate.  I asked the librarian
if there is any effort to download their contents into ascii files, and
as it turns out, there is no such effort, nor most likely ever will be.

Reason: the information found therein is perfectly useless.  There is some
scientific speculations perhaps, useful only to the historian, some
historical information, same as above, but the overwhelming majority
of the information found in all those old books: (have you guessed?)
sermons!  If that is not bad enough, they are all heavily dependent
upon each other.  With the more lax standard of those times regarding
intellectual property rights, we have jillions of versions of a very few
sermons.

I now suspect that within 20 years, *all* the information currently found
in print-only format will be no more useful in that form than the collection of
mostly sermons in the stacks at Yale.  spike

Shuttle missions could be plotted according to algorithms which 
could calculate the courses able to pick up the most and biggest 
pieces (with similar direction and velocity).  This would not only to 
some degree clean our skies, but also provide info sources as to 
what does and does not hold up in space, and for how long, as well 
as fodder for space museums.  If we make such a cleanup a 
perrenial secondary mission, much could be done.

Adult Human Brain Stem Cells Reproduce In Vitro

Brain stem cells recovered from living adult human tissue have 
successfully reproduced in vitro at the University of Tennessee-
Memphis health science center. Additional research from the same 
laboratory also shows successful isolation and cultivation of mouse 
brain stem cells recovered as long as five to seven days postmortem. 
Scheduled this month for publication in a special issue of 
Experimental Neurology, these findings could provide a possible 
alternative to the research use of embryonic stem cells, an approach 
in stem cell biology and its possible therapeutic use that raises 
controversial ethical issues. 

Dr. Valery G. Kukekov of UT-Memphis and Methodist Healthcare of 
Memphis, is lead author on the paper detailing the growing of adult 
brain stem cells recovered from surgical specimens taken from 
patients ranging in age from 24 to 57. The paper is titled 
"Multipotent Stem/Progenitor Cells with Similar Properties Arise from 
Two Neurogenic Regions of Adult Human Brain." 

Dr. Eric D. Laywell of UT-Memphis is lead author of the paper 
detailing the growing of brain stem cells recovered from mouse 
cadavers five to seven days postmortem. Laywell's paper is titled 
"Multipotent Neurospheres Can Be Derived from Forebrain Subependymal 
Zone and Spinal Cord of Adult Mice after Protracted Postmortem 
Intervals." 

The work is from the laboratory of Dr. Dennis A. Steindler, UT-
Memphis professor of neurobiology and a co-author on both papers. 
Describing the work, Steindler said, "This new era of applying 
knowledge gained from genetics, molecular, cellular and developmental 
biology is much more than just the discussion of the ethical issues 
surrounding embryonic and fetal cell research, and the controversy 
over cloning animals and human beings. 

"This new research showing that stem/progenitor cells from adult 
brains can be expanded in culture (ex vivo) offers hope for future 
studies which could someday lead to autologous stem cell transplants 
for self-repair regenerative approaches," said Steindler. "It now is 
possible to think about using our own population of stem cells 
because it appears they survive well into mature adulthood." 

Kukekov's research recovered cells from the hippocampus and the 
subependymal zone (SEZ). The SEZ is a remnant left over from the 
fetal/baby brain region remaining in the adult brain that surrounds 
the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles. 

Kukekov said, "These results are encouraging because it means that 
even senior persons have these cells. This gives us the opportunity 
in the future, as the research expands, to take a small biopsy 
specimen from a diseased person, grow the necessary cells and then 
transplant them back to the same person." 

Kukekov said the research team is now working on describing the 
molecular biologic characteristics of the cultured cells. "We cannot 
move forward and be successful in experiments with propagation 
without knowing how genes are expressed in the process and what 
molecular events are occurring." 

Laywell's work with cadaveric mice successfully isolated and 
recovered stem cells up to five to seven days after death when the 
mice were kept at 4 degrees C. The cells were retrieved from the 
adult mouse spinal cord and forebrain SEZ. Using the culturing 
technique developed by Kukekov, the mouse cells grew and multiplied 
and gave rise to both neurons and glia. 

Laywell said the number of surviving cells drops off rapidly with 
time, but since they appear to be stem cells, only one is needed to 
multiply in culture. 

Laywell said, "Bone marrow stem cells have been repopulated from 
cadavers, so it seems to be a property of stem cells in general that 
they can survive in conditions that other cells can't." 

Laywell's paper includes a single human-cadaver unpublished 
observation which produced results similar to those found with the 
mice. 

The research is an international collaborative effort with co-
investigators in Bonn, Germany; Japan, and Memphis. The adult brain 
tissue was provided with patient consent by Dr. Keith G. Davies, a 
neurosurgeon with UT-Memphis and Semmes-Murphey Clinic and a co-
author on the adult cell paper. 

Kukekov's work was funded by the Methodist/Le Bonheur Healthcare 
Foundation. 

Laywell's work was funded by the Spinal Cord Research Foundation of 
the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). Steindler's work was funded 
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Daimler-Benz 
Foundation funded the work of co-author Dr. Bjorn Scheffler. - By

Well, a space vehicle is able to change orbits, so this poses no problem. As
there is only a finite number of orbits, you could, one by one, skim these
orbits.

Hey, nanotech sails are as much sci-fi as the tractor beam - for now. I was
talking about technical possibilities, not about my research. In fact,
tractor beams would be using some kind of gravitic manipulation, which
exists only in theory. We'll see, how long this will take, but I'm almost
sure I will see it happen.

As far as I know, every satellite contains at least some iron. I do not know
if this would be enough to attract it. I am not an engineer, but I know
that, though planes are built of lightweight materiels, they, too, contain
enough iron.

We'll see. But the problem is getting urgent, though, as some orbits are
nearly full by now and we cannnot afford to wait another 50 years 'till we
have a technical solution for it. Worst-case we'll do it the old style:
Replace tractor beam with robotic arm, and you'll have a system which could
be ready for service in a short term.

Although most information held within those books will be quite of little
use to most, I fear that we'll wait till it's too late. There are a whole
many books which do exist only once. If we assume that even the most
insignificant book holds at least a bit of useful information, why do we
risk the destruction of it by not replicating it's contents?
To me, one of the greatest disasters was the burning of the Great Library at
Alexandria. Humanity lost - in one night - the intellectual work of several
hundreds or thousands of wise men. What would we know today if we had this
information?

In the medieval times, men travelled weeks or nomths to be able to read a
book, which were stored mostly in cloisters. It sometimes seems to me that
things did not change very much. The library of the Vatikan in Rome still
holds one of the most important libraries of the world. Eventually, it will
burn down the same way as did Alexandria. And all will be lost, if we do not
change something in the way information is stored and processed.

BTW: The burning of books reminds me of Fahrenheit 451 ...

Unfortunately, things are not that simple. The number of possible
orbits are infinite, although only some are of real interest (such as
the geostationary orbit). But changing orbits for a spacecraft costs
energy and propellant, so skimming them all is extremely hard.

Yes, but most of the space junk is not entire satelites, it is
everything from pieces of wreckage over dropped spanners down to paint
fragments. I'm quite sceptical to the claim that all of it would
contain magnetic materials, and that they could be easily caught with
a magnetic field (what is the range of an effective magnetic field in
this case? I get the impression that matching orbits with junk can be
rather expensive and dangerous, and you have to go fairly close to it
to catch it. A field would be better than a boom, but still getting
too close with a valuable spacecraft.

Yes, but only for larger junk. Still, it is a serious problem and we
need a solution.

I see two big issues that are being overlooked here:

1) Space junk is only a medium-size problem.  It certainly isn't worthwhile
to launch a major space program just to corral the stuff.  Schemes like
robotic junk-retrieval tugs will end up costing tens of millions of dollars
per object retrieved, and there are tens of thousands of relatively
significant objects up there.  That adds up to an awful lot of zeros.

2) There is no good reason to bother with trying to recycle the space junk.
It costs more to gather a given mass together from a variety of different
obits than it would to simply launch a new satellite.  Furthermore, actually
doing anything useful with it would require a massive (and prohibitively
expensive) investment in putting manufacturing equipment in orbit.  The
total mass of all the junk in Earth orbit is nowhere near enough to justify
that kind of investment - it might make sense as a side project if we were
mining the moon or a captured asteroid, but neither of those scenarios is
going to happen anytime soon.

Therefore, the question becomes one of how to efficiently dispose of the
stuff.  The best proposal I've seen for that is simply to zap it with a
large ground-based laser.  Small bits of junk (like paint flecks and
drifting screws) can be vaporized this way, while larger ones can be shifted
into lower orbits which will quickly decay (you do this by hitting the
leading edge of the object, vaporizing part of the surface and producing
thrust that slows it down).  Now, granted, this is a technically challenging
project, but it doesn't require any new inventions.  It also has the
advantage of keeping all the equipment on the ground, so we don't have to
pay those exorbitant launch costs.

There are two schools of thought on the source of 'rights'. There is the Natural Law doctrine, that originated in Aristotle, was used to justify the divine right of kings, and found its flowering in the classical liberal movement during the enlightenment that resulted in the establishment of the US Constitution that recognised that rights naturally originate in individuals (not kings) as was granted by the creator of humanity (whether you call it Nature, Evolution, or God is irrelevant, to each his own).

Then there is the Force Doctrine, which holds that whatever rights you as an individual or a government have are only the result of you standing up and forcing others to accept your declaration. The flaw in the Force doctrine is that it is really a subset of Natural Law that attempts to disown and disavow its origins because it seeks to eliminate any restraints on its ability to exand to any level of use of force for whatever reason the weilder sees fit.

Political documents which do not explicitly state that right naturally originate in the individual are either poorly written Natural Rights documents, or are Force Doctrine documents (and the first can be used for Force Doctrine purposes). Of all of the written Constitutions, the only National ones which recognise that human rights naturally originate in the individual are the US and French Constitutions (while a number of US State Constitutions do the same).

The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states the following right from the start:


> PREAMBLE
>
>     Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

The word 'inherent' implies the Natural origins of rights. Then Article 1 states that these inherent rights are naturally established upon birth equally to all:


> Article 1.
>
>     All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

Thus this negates the idea of Force Doctrine. Since every person is naturally endowed with equal rights, you can only use Force to take away the rights of others, or to limit the expression of rights of individuals that are not expressly enumerated. This is a serious weakness, especially in that nowhere does it recognise the individual's right to defend themselves, their families, or their property. It states that the courts are the equal arbiters of rights, so you only can defend yourself if your local courts recognise that right.

I personally do not care about the UNUDHC, as it was written under the influence of 2/3 of the world being controlled by totalitarians. It is only expected that it would seek to strip the individual of the right to defend oneself, since such governments are the primary killer of humanity. We see in the current case of Spain v. Pinochet that such murderers will seek any means of evading responsibility for their actions, and of limiting opposition to their rule. Hopefully this case is a sign that governments are losing their power to limit our rights, and that the next round of the Human Rights Commission will recognise the natural right of the individual to self defense.

The situation in Kosovo is a case in point of the result of a systematic disarmament of a civilian population.

Humanity has achieved proficient methods for dissemination of information, and
thereby means for easy access to use current knowledge. Computers offer an
efficient and economical way to store information, and the Internet provides a
method for fast and easy access to information. However, the full potential of
the Internet is not being utilized. The solution could be a master web site for
each area of man's accumulated knowledge, a virtual library of all accumulated
knowledge. For example, in the field of medicine, the American Medical
Association, in cooperation with universities that teach in the field of
medicine, could create and maintain a web site which contains all knowledge
about medicine, so that anyone could access the information. Government should
initiate a consortium effort in conjunction with organizations, institutions,
and/or industry to create a master web site for each area of knowledge, or
encourage the creation of such master web sites through financial incentives
and/or financial support. Such a system has minuscule costs in comparison to the
benefits that could be derived therefrom. The full power of current knowledge
could be unleashed by such a universal system providing fast and easy access to
Humanity's accumulated knowledge.

>From the definitions section of the Oceania Constitution:

  A right DOES NOT imply an obligation on anyone else's part to
  provide the means to exercise that right.
  ... 
  An entitlement is a positive obligation on one...to provide
  something for another, or a right that interferes with someone
  else's rights.

That's another way to phrase rights so that "food" doesn't make
sense as a right.  A right is an action that you may take without
expecting interference from others.  Since "nature" is not an
actor that can interfere with you, one has no rights with respect
to nature, only with respect to other people (thus, Stan-who-is-
called-Loretta really doesn't have the right to bear children:)

I'm participating in an Internet campaign to stop the war in
Yugoslavia before ground troops are deployed, and I'd like to
invite you to join me.

Please forward this message to any friends, family, co-workers,
neighbors, or other people you know personally who may be
interested. 

Then go to http://www.StopTheWarNow.com and sign the petition.
It will be submitted directly to your representative in the U.S.
House and to both your U.S. Senators.

Every day that this undeclared war continues, it becomes more
likely that ground troops will be deployed, and that we will
find ourselves in another Vietnam-style quagmire. As the war
escalates, it will become increasingly difficult for politicians
to admit that they made a mistake, end the war, and bring our
troops home.

The bombing of Yugoslavia is a textbook example of the folly of
foreign intervention: So far, the US-NATO air assault has
accomplished the exact opposite of what President Clinton
promised. 

Our bombardment has prompted more attacks on innocent civilians,
worsened the plight of refugees, caused the conflict to spill
over to neighboring nations, and inflamed anti-American
sentiments around the world. Bombing errors have resulted in the
deaths of refugees -- the very people we are supposed to be
protecting.

We acknowledge the terrible human suffering of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo -- suffering which has been exacerbated by our
reckless attack on Yugoslavia. However, that tragedy does not
justify American military intervention that puts our nation at
risk.

The job of the American military is to defend the United States
and to keep Americans safe. Instead, our air assault on
Yugoslavia has reduced our military preparedness, reignited Cold
War tensions with Russia, and made us a more tempting target for
terrorists. 

If the American people don't speak out, the war will continue to
escalate, ground troops will be eventually be deployed, and
American casualties will rise. If we don't want that to happen,
we must persuade our representatives in Congress to stop the war
now.

Please forward this e-mail to everyone you know who might be
interested in helping, but please don't send it indiscriminately
-- spam will only hurt our campaign.

Then go to http://www.StopTheWarNow.com and sign the petition. 

Thank you.

I agree and yet:


Space junk passes within 1 1/2 miles of ozone-mapping satellite ^By 
MARCIA
DUNN ^AP Aerospace Writer CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - An ozone-
measuring
satellite trailing space shuttle Discovery came frighteningly close 
to a
500-pound piece of space junk that could have smashed it to pieces. 
The
discarded rocket motor passed within 1 1/2 miles of the German-built
satellite, worth tens of millions of dollars. Discovery and its crew 
of six
were 51 miles ahead of the satellite at the time Monday night and 
were in
no danger, German mission manager Konrad Moritz said. If the rocket 
motor
and the 7,700-pound satellite had collided - both are hurtling around 
Earth
at 17,500 mph - it could have been disastrous. The U.S. Space Command,
which tracks junk in orbit, knew the object was out there and kept 
NASA
informed. However, as the piece drew near, engineers variously 
predicted it
would pass as close as a half-mile or 3 1/2 miles. Because of that 
wide
margin of uncertainty, scientists nervously watched computer screens 
when
the moment of closest approach came. ``We saw that we are still
transmitting, so our spacecraft is fine,'' Moritz said. ``This was a 
moment
of excitement.'' Ground controllers were prepared to fire tiny 
thrusters on
the satellite to slowly maneuver it out of harm's way. There is no 
danger
of the motor coming close to the 184-mile-high satellite again, said 
NASA
spokesman Kyle Herring. The astronauts plan to retrieve the satellite 
on
Saturday, two days before their mission ends. The spent rocket motor 
was
used in the unsuccessful launch of a communications satellite that was
carried up on a space shuttle in 1984. Coincidentally, the platform on
which the satellite's ozone-mapping telescopes are flying was on that
mission, too. ``Now we are meeting this guy again,'' Moritz said. 
``Isn't
that the story?'' The rocket motor is among more than 8,500 orbiting
objects being tracked by the U.S. Space Command, most of them junk.
Discovery's crew spent Tuesday taking more pictures of the Hale-Bopp 
comet
with an ultraviolet telescope mounted on a shuttle window, and 
conducted
more tests with a laboratory platform designed to withstand 
vibrations from
the spacecraft. ^AP-ES-08-12-97 1845EDT

Space junk so prolific that radar will track debris 

by The Associated Press 

OSLO - Earth's `backyard' is so cluttered with space junk that the 
United States and Norway are planning a giant radar station to help 
track the orbiting debris. 

The radar station, called Globus II, will be built in Norway's 
Arctic, a few miles from Russian military bases on the Kola 
Peninsula, officials said yesterday. 

There are an estimated 9,500 manmade objects in orbit around Earth. 
About 93 percent of them are space garbage, ranging from dead 
satellites and booster rockets to bolts and metal bits, said 
Norwegian project leader Tom Rykken. 

The amount of space junk has doubled since 1980 and poses a 
navigational hazard in space, said Norwegian space expert Erik 
Tandberg. "If such an object hit a new satellite or spaceship, it 
would cause serious damage," Tandberg said. 

Work on the 132-foot-tall radar dome is to start in April and be 
completed in late 2000. It will be operated by Norway's Military 
Intelligence Service. 

Officials refused to discuss possible military uses for the radar. 
Norway is the only member of NATO that shares a border with Russia.

Anyone remember the big scene in the X-Files movie last year where they
discover massive honeybee farms run by the government?... well, just found a
possible explanation for it... apparently, at Sandia National Labs they're
using honeybees to seek out land mines.. at least, that's the current
purpose they're researching.  Of course, in practice, they could use this
'bee survey' method to find pretty much anything a bee could... kind of
relates to what we're thinking of doing with nanobot reconnaissance..

I went to NASA'a online pages and punched "space debris" into the 
search engine. There were 400 and some odd results. The main concerns 
seemed to be over collisions and flight interceptions. Manmade and 
astroid/meteor type material.

The 1/5 mile passby of a rocketmotor is near, but still quite distant. Complaining about that is about the same ratio (size v. distance) as complaining that Venus comes too close to the earth....Sounds more like a science journalist who needs to justify her job more than anything...

For those who enjoy the show, National Public Radio's Science Friday will
feature a couple of (hopefully) good discussions tomorrow at 3:00 Central.
If you miss it, you can always listen to it later at
http://www.sciencefriday.com/

Hour One, Second Half: The New Plant Biotech

Imagine a world in which plants aren't just "what's for dinner" - they're
biological machines that can manufacture drugs or help clean up human
messes. Sound like science fiction? Research published this week in the
journal Nature Biotechnology says that it may not be too far off...Many
researchers have been looking into ways to get plants to produce specific
proteins for human use. But a big problem has always been getting the
proteins out of the plant once they're produced. Having to harvest the plant
and separate out the desired protein has made large-scale protein production
through plants somewhat difficult. But researchers at Rutgers University in
New Jersey have developed a new twist - tobacco plants that manufacture
proteins, and then excrete them out of the plants' roots into a hydroponic
solution. That makes it a lot easier to separate the wheat from the chaff -
and raises the possibility of "protein factories" in which plants suspended
in hydroponic tanks drink in protein ingredients and ooze the finished
product out into a constantly-flowing stream.

Plants are also being used to take chemicals out of the soil. Some teams are
developing plants that filter harmful materials like chromium, lead, and
mercury out of the soil - and one team, at Cambridge University in the UK,
have developed a tobacco plant that can filter the explosive TNT out of soil
and break the organic compound down into harmless components.

Plants as living, breathing solar-powered machines? We'll talk about it on
this segment of Science Friday.

Hour Two: The X Chromosome

What, deep down, makes a woman a woman? Sugar and spice and everything nice?
Nope - unless you count the tiny amount of sugar that makes up the backbone
of the DNA in the X chromosome.

You probably learned once that women have two X chromosomes, while men have
one X and one Y. But can that microscopic difference really account for all
the differences between the sexes - beyond the physical differences to the
emotional, behavioral, and psychological differences? (and do all those
differences actually exist, or are some of them just a product of society?)

On this hour of Science Friday, we'll talk about the X chromosome and what
it does... and next week, we'll continue the conversation in this hour with
a look at the Y chromosome.

Washington: The Net Must Pay
by Declan McCullagh

2:30 p.m.  27.Apr.99.PDT
WASHINGTON -- Whenever a new form of evil extrudes into American society, demands
for Internet
regulation seem to arrive faster than a greyhound on crack.

Remember the TWA 800 crash three years ago? By the time investigators determined
that the airline
disaster was not a terrorist act, Washington officials already had spent the better
part of a year
complaining about the dangers of the Internet.

Rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble of the Oklahoma City
federal building when
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) introduced an amendment to censor
bomb-making Web sites.
Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) joined her in moral outrage, claiming his staff
unearthed a recipe on
Usenet for "baby food bombs" that were "so powerful that they can destroy a car."

Those disasters, of course, had little to do with the Internet. But when word got
out that the alleged
gunmen in the Littleton massacre were Doom-playing, AOL-subscribing,
Web-site-publishing computer
geeks, calls for censorship came even more quickly than before. Bolstered by polls
showing that
Americans feel Internet controls are necessary, Washingtonians spent this week
demanding
restrictions.

During a speech Tuesday afternoon devoted to a proposal to limit handgun purchases
and other
restrictions on firearm ownership, President Clinton said his plan would keep guns
out of the hands of
criminals.

He also blamed "violence on TV, in the movies, on the Internet, in songs, [and]
video games that you
win based on how many people you kill." Gun rights advocates have argued that
firearm availability
saves lives, pointing to research at the University of Chicago that found when
states made it legal to
carry concealed weapons, murders dropped by an average of 8.5 percent.

At a White House briefing earlier Tuesday, the Washington press corps complained
about the lack of
controls on Web publishing. One reporter asked whether government officials would
come up "with
some solution to get all this hatred and bigotry and violence [off] the Internet?"

Replied Bruce Reed, an adviser to President Clinton: "I think that that is part of
[a] larger discussion
we have to have not only with Internet providers, but also with Hollywood and with
video game
manufacturers, and everyone else who contributes in some way to making this culture
[as] violent as
possible."

Reed said the First Amendment limited how aggressive the government could be in a
crackdown, but
another official said he could see a way around it.

"The court has really struck down every government effort to try to regulate [the
Internet]. We tried
it with regard to pornography. It is going to be a difficult thing, but it seems to
me that if we can
come up with reasonable restrictions, reasonable regulations in how people interact
on the Internet,
that is something that the Supreme Court and the courts ought to favorably look
at," Eric Holder, the
deputy attorney general, said Sunday on NPR's All Things Considered.

A poll shows broad support for such plans. Three-quarters of Americans believe
bomb-making
information should not be allowed online, according to a survey of 450 adults
conducted by CBS News
on Thursday. Some 68 percent want the FBI or other federal law enforcement agencies
to monitor the
Internet. Free speech advocates argue that such a rule would violate the First
Amendment.

Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) said Monday he had renewed hopes that Congress
would
quickly approve his Internet Gun Trafficking Act. Introduced in March, the bill
would require Web sites
that include information about gun sales to be register with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and
Firearms.

All this jockeying for political position could be considered unseemly in the wake
of a tragedy, but it
also appears to be inevitable.

"Scapegoating takes us further from the root of the problem," said Solveig
Singleton, director of
information studies at the Cato Institute.

"The main responsibility must lie with the perpetrators themselves, their parents,
and others in a
position to have a good understanding of the danger -- those who are closest to the
problem."

Karsten, the problem is that the useful information in that form is so
diffuse as to make it not worth the effort to search the text to find the
jewels of wisdom.

Granted this was a sad loss.  However...

We would know a lot about how people in the old days thought.
What would we learn about anthropology?  Nothing!  We know
far more about ancient humans than would have been recorded
in the library at Alexandria.  This is because we have technology.
There is no evidence that the ancients had anything we would
consider advanced technology.  They had no way of determining
the age of a fossil for instance.  If we discovered today that
the collection at Alexandria was spirited away and hidden, then
we found it today, we would find therein no breakthru insights
that we have not already independently rediscovered in the
intervening years.

> ...The library of the Vatikan in Rome still

I beg to differ.  Theologians might feel the loss should that library
burn, but I suspect it would have almost no impact on the lives or
the thinking of our society.  Religious thinkers, especially ancient
ones, offer little or no guidance in the questions we are now facing,
such as:

Should we charge ahead with the altering of the human genome?

Should we unleash nanotechnology, specifically the nanoreplicator,
as soon as it is physically possible to create?

Should we work towards a singularity, even if it means the passing
of the human race as we know it?  Should we work to slow it?

> BTW: The burning of books reminds me of Fahrenheit 451 ...

Karsten, we have a much greater challenge than the accidental
or intentional burning of books: preventing data from being lost
by changing technology.  Anyone have any floppy discs?  How
about the old 5 inch floppies?  Can you still read them?  spike

Rich and Rewarding  |   Review by Tom Keogh

It's no accident that movies based on video games (such as the recent Wing
Commander) tend to look and feel lifeless. They're based on a medium where
technology is in the service of private sport, where emotions and urges
swell behind the limp forms of captivated players.

David Cronenberg's eXistenZ is not based on a video game but, rather,
suggests that electronic gaming is really one more technological refraction
of our essential primitiveness. In fact, the film doesn't really need to
focus on games at all: Cronenberg has made the point more than once that
human advances in gadgetry (Videodrome), science (The Fly), consciousness
(Naked Lunch), or random bits of evolutionary expansion (Scanners) are
really higher thresholds for the same old, gut-bucket instincts: jealousy,
survival, dominance, isolation. In eXistenZ he finds a provocative vehicle
for his old themes in the story of a direct, virtual-reality link to the
human central nervous system, exploring the most profound implications for
an internal experience born of marrying technology and bodies.

Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as Allegra Geller, a superstar in the world of
game design and the object of intense devotion by players wired at the base
of their spines for virtual-reality input. Brought to a secret gathering of
volunteers chosen to test-run a bold new game called eXistenZ, Allegra is
wounded by a would-be assassin, an anti-game Luddite who shoots her with a
human tooth fired from a gun made of bone. Rescued by Ted (Jude Law), a
newcomer to the firm manufacturing eXistenZ, Allegra flees to one false
haven (a gas station run by a bounty-hunting Willem Dafoe) and then,
apparently, a true one (the laboratories of a Russian bio-tech researcher,
played by Ian Holm).

There, she and Ted (who reluctantly allows a game implant to be inserted in
his back) immerse themselves in the shifting planes of perceived reality
inherent in playing eXistenz. At times, they are driven by outer-controlled
feelings of sexual craving or aggression; at others they try to decode the
meaning of characters and actions they meet in a virtual Chinese restaurant
or fishery. As in his film of Naked Lunch, Cronenberg loops certain
experiences, words, and people through different chapters in his story,
creating an echo effect with an oddly mournful air. (That bone gun, for
instance, disturbingly reconstructs itself during a food scene.) The longer
the movie runs on, the more extensive the game's full reach, so that after a
while eXistenz seems to be nothing less than existence itself.

The film looks deceptively small, but in his Film.com interview, Cronenberg
says the production actually cost far more than Crash did. He suggests that
it was actually his decision to strip the actors and art direction of
everyday things -- jewelry, knick-knacks -- that gives eXistenZ a
dislocating spareness. He's absolutely right: there is something unnervingly
sub-normal in the off-the-rack look of people with no distinguishing signs
of their time on Earth. Equally spooky are the minimal, organically based
tools through which Allegra and other gamers maneuver their way through
eXistenZ, manipulating something that looks as if it belongs next to your
liver instead of squeezing a joystick.

Whatever it cost, eXistenZ is Cronenberg in a minor mode, cultivating and
refreshing his preoccupations within a narrow framework before diving again
into uncharted ambitions. eXistenZ is a chance to see a master at work for
its own sake, and as such this is a rich and rewarding film.

I'm looking forward to it.

Measuring The Cosmic Neutrino Background

The cosmic neutrino background can, in principle, be detected, according to 
the American Institute of Physics' Physics News Update for April 27. There 
are, the Bulletin points out, almost as many neutrinos loose in the universe 
as photons, and almost as much energy vested in neutrinos as in photons.
But because neutrinos are extremely reticent about interacting with other 
particles, detecting the neutrino background is not as easy as detecting the 
cosmic photon (microwave) background. That's why dedicated neutrino 
detectors struggle just to record a handful of incoming neutrinos from 
potent nearby sources such as the sun.

Nevertheless, the Bulletin says, there might be a chance to map the 
background indirectly: The pattern of lumps in the microwave background, 
which will be measured by the upcoming MAP and PLANCK orbiting detectors, in 
fact encodes information about the neutrino background.

(The PLANCK mission is a European Space Agency project to image the 
temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The 
whole sky will be mapped in nine frequency channels ranging between 30 and 
900 GHz, with a sensitivity and an angular resolution that will allow the 
separation of the cosmological signal from all other sources of confusion.)

Scott Dodelson of Fermilab, Michael Turner and Robert Lopez of the 
University of Chicago and Andrew Heckler of Ohio State, in an upcoming 
article in Physical Review Letters, show that these measurements will 
accurately establish the time at which slow-moving matter (protons and later 
atoms) became predominant over fast-moving radiation (photons and 
neutrinos). In turn, they write, this determines precisely how much early 
annihilation energy (arising from electrons and positrons smashing up) was 
apportioned among photons and neutrinos.

Cloning Can Cause Serious Health Problems -Study

By Patricia Reaney

LONDON (Reuters) - French scientists raised fresh fears Friday about the 
dangers of cloning humans, saying it may cause serious long-term health 
problems.

Researchers at France's Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique said a 
cow they cloned with DNA from an adult somatic cell appeared healthy but 
died from anemia at seven weeks.

They believe the animal, whose immune system did not develop properly after 
birth, died because of errors in its DNA genetic reprogramming during the 
cloning process.

``This is the first report of a long-lasting defect associated with somatic 
cloning,'' Dr Jean-Paul Renard and his colleagues said in a report in The 
Lancet medical journal.

``Our observation should be taken into account in debates on reproductive 
cloning in human beings.''

Cloning animals from adult somatic cells, which make up most of the body, is 
difficult because the DNA from the adult cells need to be reprogrammed, or 
set back to their embryonic state. The French cow was cloned from a cell 
taken from the ear of an adult cow that was an embryonic clone.

Renard and his team suspect something went wrong in the cloning process that 
interfered with the clone's genetic reprogramming which stopped its immune 
system from developing.

When the cow died there was no evidence of infection or malformation but a 
post-mortem examination showed the spleen and lymph nodes had not formed 
properly.

Scientists at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, where Dolly the sheep was 
cloned, described the French study as probably the most detailed 
investigation of cloned animals.

``It should be viewed as an important contribution to the evidence that 
nobody should be contemplating cloning human beings,'' Dr Harry Griffin, 
Roslin's assistant director, said in a telephone interview.

``All those that are working in this field know that the technology is 
unsafe. We have been working hard to get this point over to people 
speculating about the possibility of using it in cloning of human beings.''

The ethical issues of cloning humans have been hotly debated in the media 
hype that followed the birth of Dolly and other cloned mammals, but the 
discussions have paid less attention to the medical risks.

All the cloning groups around the world have produced cloned animals that 
died before or shortly after birth. Griffin said reprogramming could account 
for the very low success rate of the technique and the immature development 
of tissues, in this case the immune system.

``The reality is we know very little about the reprogramming process and we 
are going to have to work hard on that in order to ensure acceptable 
developments of this technology come to fruition,'' he said.

The reprogramming of the somatic cells may not be 100 percent complete even 
if the animal is born at full term. Griffin thinks developmental abnormality 
is going to be a common phenomenon in cloning.

``It may well be that there are different tissues or aspects of physiology 
that are incompletely developed in different animals,'' he said.

Cloning Can Cause Serious Health Problems -Study

By Patricia Reaney

LONDON (Reuters) - French scientists raised fresh fears Friday about the 
dangers of cloning humans, saying it may cause serious long-term health 
problems.

Researchers at France's Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique said a 
cow they cloned with DNA from an adult somatic cell appeared healthy but 
died from anemia at seven weeks.

They believe the animal, whose immune system did not develop properly after 
birth, died because of errors in its DNA genetic reprogramming during the 
cloning process.

``This is the first report of a long-lasting defect associated with somatic 
cloning,'' Dr Jean-Paul Renard and his colleagues said in a report in The 
Lancet medical journal.

``Our observation should be taken into account in debates on reproductive 
cloning in human beings.''

Cloning animals from adult somatic cells, which make up most of the body, is 
difficult because the DNA from the adult cells need to be reprogrammed, or 
set back to their embryonic state. The French cow was cloned from a cell 
taken from the ear of an adult cow that was an embryonic clone.

Renard and his team suspect something went wrong in the cloning process that 
interfered with the clone's genetic reprogramming which stopped its immune 
system from developing.

When the cow died there was no evidence of infection or malformation but a 
post-mortem examination showed the spleen and lymph nodes had not formed 
properly.

Scientists at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, where Dolly the sheep was 
cloned, described the French study as probably the most detailed 
investigation of cloned animals.

``It should be viewed as an important contribution to the evidence that 
nobody should be contemplating cloning human beings,'' Dr Harry Griffin, 
Roslin's assistant director, said in a telephone interview.

``All those that are working in this field know that the technology is 
unsafe. We have been working hard to get this point over to people 
speculating about the possibility of using it in cloning of human beings.''

The ethical issues of cloning humans have been hotly debated in the media 
hype that followed the birth of Dolly and other cloned mammals, but the 
discussions have paid less attention to the medical risks.

All the cloning groups around the world have produced cloned animals that 
died before or shortly after birth. Griffin said reprogramming could account 
for the very low success rate of the technique and the immature development 
of tissues, in this case the immune system.

``The reality is we know very little about the reprogramming process and we 
are going to have to work hard on that in order to ensure acceptable 
developments of this technology come to fruition,'' he said.

The reprogramming of the somatic cells may not be 100 percent complete even 
if the animal is born at full term. Griffin thinks developmental abnormality 
is going to be a common phenomenon in cloning.

``It may well be that there are different tissues or aspects of physiology 
that are incompletely developed in different animals,'' he said.

Sounds like a possibility. The problem here is of course getting the
cells connected into the network. What usually happens when young
nerve cells are transplanted (when things go right :-) is that they
start sending out axons to connect to neighboring or more remote
cells, depending on chemical signatures and their own preferences. It
is not obvious that transplants will help, but some experiments on
rats have been quite encouraging.

It is deeper than that; the anterior cingulate cortex is closely
related to our decisionmaking processes. It could be seen as the
bridge between the limbic systems (emotions, valuations) and the
frontal cortices (planning). Damage to this area has rendered people
catatonic: some survivors described afterwards that they dimply didn't
feel they wanted to do anything (see Damasio's _Descartes' Error_). In
many ways it could be seen as a part of what we call the will; a guess
is that it ties values to actions, so that we can decide what to do.

Maybe the higher intelligence of homids is due to a better ability to
evaluate the pros and cons of different actions, or maybe in a more
flexible way.

The basic principles of advanced education have been around for thousands
of years.  They simply haven't been widely practiced.  The ideas I have
developed for the type of education I pursue have come from years of
thinking, reading and experimenting.  In the end, though, the ideas that
I have come up with and verified for myself are basically the same ideas
that many people, throughout human history have independently developed.

My approach to living and making choices which are good for my overall
situation is basically the same as that which Zen practitioners use.  The
basic idea is that every moment of experience contains an incredible
amount of information, all of which is relevant, to some degree, to the
choices we make.  The goal is to learn how to be more aware of as much of
that information as possible and develop a decision making process that
considers as much of that information as possible and makes good
decisions, based on that information.

My experience with this has been quite successful.  I have worked for
several years to make my experience of each moment more vivid and
detailed.  I have learned to make every moment of my conscious experience
very rich and vivid, and every experience contains many lessons and
thoughts, whereas before, I pretty much ignored most of my experience and
missed out on all the lessons it had to offer.  

Making decisions based on the incredible amount of information in each
moment is difficult to explain how to do, but generally, I just pay
intense attention to everything I can, and certain actions just "feel"
most appropriate and are carried out fairly automatically.  Basically,
one must start with one's current decision making "algorithms", and allow
them to evolve as one learns to be aware of increasingly more information
from the experiences of each moment.  

The whole process reminds me a lot of the skills involved in moving
quickly through a crowd of people without shoving people out of the way. 
Everyone is moving around and spaces between people are opening up and
closing.  How do you decide which actions to make and which direction to
go?  Obviously, you can't plan your route ahead of time; you have to be
alert to each moment and where everyone is.  Decisions must be made every
small fraction of a second.  But the nice thing about the human brain is
that it's very good at tasks like this.

Unfortunately, the educational system most of us were raised with put us
in situations where those sorts of practical decision making skills were
not allowed to develop for hours each day as we were forced to sit still
in our desks and listen to the teacher drone on endlessly about basically
trivial things.

There are a lot of activities I have found quite helpful in developing
more advanced observation and decision-making skills, and I will present
them in other posts soon, but I felt it was important to explain the
basic principles behind the activities first.

There are many books out about Zen and Mindfulness Meditation which I
have found helpful in developing satisfying living strategies.  I
encourage those interested to seek them out and read them.

- David Musick

This moment is the moment of learning and the moment of choice; it is the
most important moment you have.  The care and attention you give to this
moment is a gift to yourself; a gift of learning and the gift of a good
choice.

 Sorry to hear all this, but I have a suggestion, which I doubt can be
acted on, but will make it anyways: Since the doctors can do nothing for
your wife go elsewhere for a treatment. Nothing to lose. Suggestion: Since
some foods like tomatoes, green tea, and soybeans have been gaining a
reputation in the scientific community as cancer fighters, then a last
ditch fight using them might be worth trying. Regressions have recently
been obtained in prostate cancer with lycopene pills for example. (tomato
sauce is by far the cheapest source of lycopene) Try a spagetti sauce, soy
tofu diet laced with green tea leaves, IP6, and what else your doctor can
sign off on that might be helpful. Good luck.

How about trying like hell to get into a study group for angiostatin and/or 
endostatin.  The National Cancer Institute has a good survey of the current 
research and leads for getting into it.

That is completely rediculous.  Technology can only reveal clues surrounding a culture, but does little to reveal the cultural milieu itself.  Ok, so we know they used fire to create ceraminc pots, and they had what appears to be a panthiestic style of worship.  That tells us nothing.  If we actually has a score of translated documents in their own words, it would tell us substanially more than what we could do through some carbon dating.

Besides, how can you possibly know the Library of Alexandria contained nothing worth considering?  To you claim to know what you don't know?  Sounds paradoxical to me.  Besides, much of modern science traces it routes directly back to manuscripts recovered from Alexandria.  Imagine howe much more time would have been saved, had Alexandria not burned.  We could have entered the sceintifc/technological age back in the 12th Century.  Imagine that!

Again, this unfounded and it implies that nothing but the hard sciences have absolutely no value to human culture.  Who is to say that certain insights that the ancients had would *not* give fresh perspectivea into our current delima's?

> that!...

John, I could have made it much clearer what I meant.  I do not deny that some
ancient clever philosopher figured out wire and batteries, etc.  I agree that had we
not lost the library at Alexandria, the current explosion of technology that we
are now enjoying would have happened long ere this, many centuries ere this.

My contention is that pretty much *any* technology found therein has long since
been rediscovered and vastly improved.  The philosophical insights found therein
would be of little value to us today for they are not facing the questions we now face.
By this contention, I do not mean to diss the Greeks.  There simply were not
enough of them.  They could not put together the critical masses of brains that
we mere mortals of today can do by dialing up our modems.

Before you flame, try to think, *what was in that library* in Alexandria?  I have
an idea:  That library was filled with heroic stories about the brave deeds
accomplished by the various heroes of the past.  Accounts of battles.  Genealogies.
History of the great civilization of the Etruscans, Mycenaeans.  Political pamphlets
on such topics as slavery and why Mycenaeans are better, smarter, braver than
Trojans, etc.  In short, I suspect it would be reams and reams, scroll after scroll,
of material that closely resembles our Old Testament.  My contention is that
our current society would not necessarily be advanced today, if we had all
that stuff.  We would have advanced long ere this, had we not lost the art and
science of the Greek classic period, but we lost it, and... We recovered.
And exceeded.

Nowthen, fast forward to today.  Much of the material in paper books today
is of little value, because it is not searchable.  Consider what we do to our
students before we give them engineering degrees.  We make them study
books of equations, *all of which are encoded in computers*.  The software
version works right, whereas if you have ever performed the tedious classic
version of aerodynamics, you know that... the classic version doesnt give the
right answer!  The computerized version does, if you model it correctly.

My contention then, is that we have now the equivalent of an Alexandrian
fire, burning brightly at this moment, however, this time, the knowledge is
not being lost, but rather, transmogrifying itself into a more useful form. spike

If I may presume to reply to my own post, I think I can state much more
succinctly, my point:  We moderns already spend waaaay too much time
and effort, searching searching searching ancient texts for answers to today's
dilemmas.  I really mean that.  If we could somehow resurrect the most
famous wise guys of the past, Confucius, Moses, Solomon, Socrates, Jesus,
Maimonides, Nostradamus, etc, these guys would be *just as clueless as
we are* to solve some of today's questions.  We need to find the answers
ourselves!  Not look back.  They can't help.  Look forward, not back.  spike

QUANTUM SCULPTING
Feedback enables researchers to control an
atom's wave function

by Graham P. Collins
The development of quantum mechanics, the underlying laws that govern matter 
and energy on the scale of atoms and electrons, has not only revolutionized 
our understanding of the universe but also has given us such technologies as 
the transistor, the laser and magnetic resonance imaging. Now Philip H. 
Bucksbaum and his co-workers at the University of Michigan have combined 
several recently developed techniques with a feedback system to control the 
very essence of quantum particles: their wave functions. The Bucksbaum 
experiment "is true quantum engineering," says physicist Michael G. Raymer 
of the University of Oregon. "It should open up many new possibilities, most 
of which we cannot even imagine now."

A wave function defines the physical state of a quantum object. Wave 
functions are slippery characters, tied to probabilities, not certainties. 
They obey the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle: if one characteristic 
is well defined, a related feature must be highly uncertain. For instance, 
an electron with a very precise position must have a wide range of possible 
velocities. Nevertheless, during the past decade a number of research groups 
have assembled techniques for manipulating and analyzing complete wave 
functions in detail.

Bucksbaum and his graduate students Thomas C. Weinacht and Jaewook Ahn apply 
their technique to a type of quantum state known as a Rydberg state, which 
occurs when an electron in an atom is excited to such a high energy level 
that it barely remains bound to the atom. "Rydberg states are a great 
laboratory to test new ideas," Bucksbaum explains. An electron with such 
high energy can occupy a very large number of quantum states. Combining 
those states in different proportions (that is, placing them in 
superposition) sculpts the shape of the electron's wave function. In one 
combination, for example, the electron is smeared out in a ring around the 
atom; in another, it is localized and orbits the atom much like a planet 
orbiting the sun.

The basic tool for such wave function sculpting is a strong, ultrashort 
laser pulse, which excites the electron from a lower energy level. Through a 
design developed by Warren S. Warren of acousto-optic modulator--a crystal 
whose optical properties are governed by precisely shaped sound waves. How 
the laser's intensity and phase vary over the 150-femtosecond pulse 
determines how the available excited states combine to produce the 
electron's sculpted wave function.

But what shape of laser pulse is needed to generate a specific sculpted 
electron wave function? In principle, this shape can be predicted by 
computations, but in practice one must contend with nonideal equipment and 
incomplete understanding of the physical system being controlled.

Bucksbaum's new trick, described in the January 21 issue of Nature, is to 
use feedback to modify the shaping pulse. His group works with a gas of 
cesium atoms in batches of about a million atoms. An approximate pulse 
excites the atoms, and the researchers map the shape of the resulting wave 
function with quantum holography, a technique they demonstrated a year ago. 
In optical holography, the three-dimensional shape of an object is 
reconstructed from its hologram, a special two-dimensional interference 
pattern. In quantum holography, measurements produce data loosely analogous 
to a hologram from which the complete wave function of the object can be 
reconstructed. In accordance with the uncertainty principle, however, each 
measurement disturbs the quantum "object," so the "hologram" must be built 
up one pixel at a time over many experimental runs, with thousands of 
identically prepared atoms measured on each run.

Once the physicists have mapped the resulting wave function, they look at 
the difference between that one and the desired one. This information is 
then used to adjust the detailed shape of the laser pulse used on subsequent 
batches of atoms. Bucksbaum found that after only two or three iterations 
this feedback zeroed in on the desired wave function.

Quantum control has applications in the burgeoning field of quantum 
computing, in which the encoding of data onto individual quantum states may 
allow the development of computers that function on quantum principles. 
Another application is control of chemical reactions. Shaped optical pulses 
that induce just the right excitations at specific bonds in a molecule can 
enhance or suppress alternate reaction pathways. Some groups have 
independently used feedback for this type of control, but the feedback has 
not been based on detailed mapping of a wave function.

Quantum physicist Carlos R. Stroud of the University of Rochester cautions 
that further research is needed to see if Bucksbaum's method is applicable 
to a wider range of quantum systems. Still, he says, "they have expanded the 
quantum mechanics toolbox."

Here's ABC's news report today about the gas out,

  Protest Fizzles at Pump
Enthusiastic E-mail Campaign Has Little Impact


By Jordan Lite
The Associated Press
April 30  A nationwide e-mail campaign urging drivers to boycott gas 
stations to protest high prices kept plenty of people away from the pump 
today. But across the nation, many drivers continued to fill up out of need 
or habit.
     Business was down by as much as 50 percent at midday at a Chevron near 
downtown Sacramento, Calif., that charges $2.07 for full-service premium. 
The owner, Ross Relles, complained that gas stations are the wrong targets.
     Whoever is promoting this idiotic day, all its hurting is the small 
retailers like me, Relles said. We should be absolutely swamped because 
its not only Friday, but its payday.
     Since the gas out originated in an e-mail message, it was tough to 
tell exactly who promoted it and how widespread it was.
     Mike Lambert, a new sport utility vehicle owner in Newark, Calif., said 
he urged six friends to join him in a daylong boycott in an e-mail message a 
month ago.
     Within days, he said, others rallied to the cause and forwarded e-mails 
of their own.
     Its time we did something about the price of gasoline in America! ... 
Lets have a GAS OUT! read one message that showed up in computers in 
Texas.
     Global agreements to cut oil production sent the price of gas 
skyrocketing in recent weeks. Explosions and problems at refineries in 
California contributed to an especially sharp spike in prices there, 
prompting an investigation by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
     The latest Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide showed the 
average prices at self-service stations was $1.1733 per gallon for regular 
gasoline, $1.2748 for mid-grade and $1.3598 for premium.
     The average price in California for unleaded regular, self-serve 
gasoline is up 42 cents from last month, to $1.64 per gallon, the American 
Automobile Association said. Selected markets in California, however, 
continue to report prices of more than $2 a gallon for premium grades.
     Oil company representatives said the boycott was unlikely to produce an 
oversupply of fuel or lead to lower prices. Still, people avoiding the pumps 
were pleased that at least they were having a symbolic impact.
     Theres a conspiracy among oil companies to keep gas prices high and 
profits high, said Gary Ploss, of Rio Rico, near Tucson, Ariz. If enough 
people get together, maybe theyll get the attention of these oil companies 
and maybe something will get done.
     Oil company representatives said that prices are set in a competitive 
market over which they have little control.
     I think the purpose of the gas out is to send a message of frustration 
and we hear the message, said Chevron Corp. spokesman Mike Libbey. However, 
he said the company has no plans to lower prices.
     This winter, American motorists were enjoying extraordinarily low gas 
prices amid a perceived glut of oil on the world market.
     Consumers out west have seen prices go from as low as they have been 
in seven years to an all-time high in a period of just seven or eight 
weeks, said Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the AAA of Northern California.
     Still, drivers who drive for work and those who drive gas-guzzling 
sports utility vehicles couldnt avoid filling their tanks.
     Erika Litchfield of San Francisco was filling up her Land Rover at a 
Chevron Station in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood, where classical 
music is filtered through speakers at the pumps.
     I have no choice. Im stuck with this, she said as the truck guzzled 
$30 worth of regular unleaded. Its awful, isnt it? Trust me, if I had a 
choice Id boycott.
