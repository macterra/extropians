*On average**, I would say that those who have joined ExI provide more
content and less noise than those who don't. Of course there will be
high-signal non-members and high-noise members, but there are too many who
join the list without much of a clue about our interests and perspectives.
This move will reduce the number of such folks, since the uninformed
usually don't become ExI members until better informed.

This move will also mean we can block spam.

As I will explain in a separate message, improving the signal/noise ratio
is one goal of this change, but it's not the main one. Even if that doesn't
happen as expected, I think the move is desirable for ExI.

I don't understand this. If there are Luddites out there who want to hunt
down extropians and transhumanists, they can do that as easily for the
non-members as for the members. If someone is afraid of a Luddite attack,
they should stay off all lists, or post anonymously.

It was too difficult to maintain records of who had paid the list fee and
who had not. The change we are about to make should be much simpler to
administer. Good thing too, since so many are too stingy to join the
Institute so we have no money to pay for adminstration. :-)

Wow, Damien, I'm glad you're not doing marketing for ExI! You didn't
mention the Exponent newsletter that keeps members up to date on what's
happening and helps them network, the local meetings, or the substantial
discount on the EXTRO conference (that paid for half the dues this time
around).

Damien, I thought you were a student. If so, the rate is merely $30. Hardly
a burden. For those who think $95 is too much, note that Alcor yearly dues
are $360, The Life Extension Foundation (which uses membership to sell many
products) is $75, and the World Future Society professional membership is
$95 ($175 for full prof. membership).

We *have* to raise dues. Personally, I have worked some of the time for a
ridiculously small amount, giving up opportunities for properly paying jobs
in order to develop and disseminate extropian ideas. Most of the time I
have worked for ExI for nothing. The other directors have worked for
nothing. The advisors work for nothing. David McFadzean manages the list,
the web site, and the domain for nothing. Derek Strong, our webmaster,
manages the site for nothing. Those who contribute to Extropy (and now
Extropy Online) do so for nothing.

It does costs money to run an organization. The current membership dues are
insufficient and we don't want to ask yet again for donations. I don't
understand why so many capitalist-friendly people seem to expect us to do
all that we do with such a pitiful income.

No, it doesn't mean that. Why on Earth would we want to restrict membership
entry only to those spoken for by others?

or (more likely) that a current member
>gets to bring in one new one for free. 

Yes. It's a way of accommodating those who feel they don't earn enough to
join themselves, and who don't do anything for the Institute that would
justify a lower rate.

I agree that a single list cannot serve all purposes. That's why we now
have several local lists and will be adding others. We recently added a
European list since we're seeing growing interest there. We are setting up
the NodeNet forums -- special email lists focusing on particular topics.
And we want to encourage the formation of more local groups and chapters.
(Working with us to do this is a good way to get a break on or waiver of
dues...) 

We would have more local meetings if more people were organizers. We've
been adding more places to the Local Events section of the Exponent
newsletter, and want to develop local activity further. I'm glad to hear
that you're interested in getting together with others in Chicago, Ed. I'd
love to work with you in getting it started. You may be the only doer in
the area, so if you don't start something, it may not happen.

Great! But remember it's not just the list that you're paying for. As with
this year, members will receive a discount on EXTRO 4. Since I intend to
attract some well-off folks interested in life extension, I expect us to
make the registration higher to keep the organization alive, but to give a
major discount to members. With that, the newsletter, the networking, the
meetings, the new forums, the web site, the media work, etc., we will do
all that we can to make it worth it.

>Not being a member doesn't mean anything. Being a member means you put some
>money where your mouth is.

Yes. Many people just want to talk and not do anything, nor do they want to
make it possible for others to do anything. We appreciate very much our
members, who are willing to back their values with a little cash.

I'm delighted to see the spread of transhumanism and the budding of other
groups. I hope the new groups -- unlike ExI --- have wealthy founders. If
not, they will end up either shutting down out of personal and financial
exhaustion, or they will have to charge sufficient dues and deal with
complaints.

First, it's $95 (less for those with special arrangements), not "at least
$100", and it's $30 for students. Perhaps you didn't intend it this way,
Geoff, but the way you put it is sadly reversed. Many ExI members and
potential members have very well paying jobs. Meanwhile, a number of those
most active in getting things done work for nothing or for absurdly little.
I'm embarrassed to admit that instead of driving a Mercedes, I drive an old
Ford with well over 100,000 miles on it, and until very recently I didn't
even have that. I live with a large amount of credit card debt thanks to
working for ExI for extremely little instead of getting "a real job". And I
am the *only* person who ExI has ever paid any kind of salary to.

Your comment reminds me of a my very first TV appearance -- in England on
the morning news in 1987 when I debated a Prof. of Surgery on cryonics. As
we left the studio, the fellow turned back to me and sneeringly said "I'm
sure you'll make a lot of money." Knowing how the folks at Alcor had worked
for years for so little, this cheap shot made me furious.

Kathryn: I wish there were more like you -- transhumanists who actually
*do* something. Currently you are contributing to the Institute's work by
acting as an editor for Extropy Online. We will be very happy to work out
breaks for members who are not rolling in money and who are contributing in
other ways. You are such a person.

Onward!

There is an excellent new essay by Patricia
Churchland called "Feeling Reasons" available on the
Web as part of an ARS Electronica symposium from
September 1997 at
http://www.aec.at/fleshfactor/subs/reasons.html
(at least I think it's new)

Here are the section headers:

1. Introduction - The Social Significance of Agent
Autonomy and Responsibility

2. Are we responsible and in control if our choices
and actions are caused?

3. Are we more in control and more responsible to the
degree that emotions plays a lesser role and reason
plays a greater role? 

4. Are there significant neurobiological differences
between "in control" agents, and "out of control"
agents?

5. Learning what's rational and what's not.

6. What Happens to the Concept of Responsibility?

Of course I should have mentioned HK!  If memory serves, Hong Kong was a
little fishing village before the Brits made it their base of operations in
the area.  Although always a numeric minority (finally a tiny minority), the
English GREATLY influenced the development of Hong Kong's culture, especially
its business and legal culture.  At the same level of gross generalization as
my original post, I would posit that Hong Kong is another exception that
proves the rule: The well-known business creativity of Hong Kong business
people may well mark one of the very best blendings of the Confucian values
of secularism, industry and thrift with the Western bourgeois values of
individualism, irreverence and creativity.  Let's hope that China's
swallowing of HK in fact results in the ingestion and dissemenation of those
good memes.

Well, this is the very problem about which I am concerned: In much of Asia
there is a risk that some of the important liberal values usually associated
with capitalism in the West (especially individual liberty and the
transparent rule of law) may NOT be automatically coincidental with adoption
of western industrial technology and its consumerist output.

I think there is an increasing need to diversify this list, yes, but
it is also important to have some main channel of communication which
can reach a large percentage of the extropians if we want the movement
to remain cohesive. A tricky balance.

 Anyone who accepts Drexler's estimates of when nanotechnology will
be possible, and who understands what will happen if an assembler
can utilize atmospheric CO2, should be more concerned about CO2
shortages than CO2-induced global warming.

I don't think anyone here would object to your using list membership
simply for revenue.  I've never joined ExI simply because they've
never offered anything of sufficient value for my money, and I don't
give to charities.  If this list was a benefit of membership, you'd
have my check tomorrow, becuause that's something of value.  Whether
or not it improves the list itself isn't really as relevant to ExI's
overall goals as simple revenue, is it?

Wait a minute...the difference between the member and non-member prices
for Extro3 was about $5 less than the cost of membership, so joining
would not have been a significant savings (unless the member prices
listed on the website weren't true).

Well, Alcor is hardly a fair comparison: I get the emergency services
of a trained cryonics team at my bedside for that money.  The others are
more comparable.

Nothing says a good capitalist can't be a cheap bastard.

Let's hope ExI can demonstrate this time around that giving them money
actually will accomplish something.  Rational capitalists, regardless
of their commitment to a cause, won't part with a penny unless they think
doing so will benefit the cause (and therefore themselves).

 How has the difference between the highest nations and the median
been changing? This seems more important for determining the risk that
we will be conquered by some other region that makes a major technological
breakthrough.
 My impression is that within areas that can afford to stay reasonably
up to date with most communication and transportation technologies,
that there should be a convergence of growth rates.

 How could birth rate control contribute to growth?

 On a loosely related note, I recommend Crosby's book The Measure
of Reality, which describes how European culture changed from an
almost purely qualitative view of the world in 1250 to a fairly
quantitative view in 1600, setting the stage for explosions of
technology and businesses.

What did you have in mind for this ">H tech sublist? "  Do you mean a "high
tech" list? Does that mean the technical aspects of human cloning, brain
transplantation, rocket propulsion, etc.?  If so, I'd be interested in
participating and possibly helping in the "administrative load" (though I'd
like to know more of what you have in mind for the latter).  Feel free to see

Hi Greg, I'm just reading the "Taoist body" by Kristofer Schipper, which
analyses the social impact of taoism on Chinese society. I think you
would be interested about this quote about  "Activist taoism"..

"This situation (opposition between taoism and imperial cult -Remi) lead
to revolt, and, at the 1st century before our era, messianic and
millenarists movements inspired by taoism appear, with the hope to give
birth to the reign of the Great equality (Tai Ping)  which existed
before our civilization and come back after. The state fight these
movements (snip) . The great revolt of the Yellow Turbans, in 182 of our
era, became so important that the Han dynasty exhausted and died in
trying to repress it".

We can also remember The Triad society, before becoming a simple
gangster organization, was also a religious organization full of taoist
symbols and ritual, whose purpose was to destroy the Mandchu dynasty and
let the Ming come back instead. So Taoists are quite used to political
activism.

According the  historian of science Joseph Needham, most of the
scientific discoveries in China were made by taoists, confuciansist
being only interested in social philosophy.

        I think that a lot of people have been missing the point toward the
soon to be members-only list.  What the Extropy Institute is doing is
promoting a diversification of ideas as opposed to excluding them.  For the
past year and a half threads have frequently been started about the signal
to noise ratio, list quality, and posting techniques; the result of these
threads have always turned out to be the same: nothing is done about them,
and the list remains as it was.  
        Finally, something is being done about it.  It is unfortunate
indeed that many don't want to or cannot afford the ExI membership, but it
is --at the very least-- a way of giving the list more of a focus.  For the
most part, those who are willing to pay for an ExI membership will be those
who attach a lot of importance to the extropian philosophy...why else would
one purchase a membership?
        It irks me to see plenty of posts complaining about this new move;
at the very least, it will promote a focus.  One of the core values of
extropy is Boundless Expansion...this list has suffered the slings and
arrows of stagnancy and noise-filled posts --this move is an attempt to
expand.  If it does not work, then another method will be tried.

Whether it is a good move for ExI remains to be seen (but I don't imagine, Max,
that you'd consider it if you thought it wasn't. <grin>).

However, I do see this as a smart move allowing only people who have made a pledge
to the Institute to have the right to post freely on an Institute list (which is
set up for the express purpose of fleshing out the Institute's memotype.) One
thing I have noticed in my time here is that discussion occurs on the whole range
of transhuman topics, whether specifically extropian or not. This is not
necessarily a problem, but very little reference is made to the more specific
tenets of extropy (i.e., the principles). If a goal of the list is to "share" some
of the load on Max by promoting the cultivation of new *EXTROPIAN* ideas, the
current setup is failing at that.

BTW, there is a general transhuman list already --
http://www.us.itd.umich.edu/~alexboko/mlist.html

The current discontent over the membership proposal may be a sign that most
people's interest is in the broad transhuman philosophy, and not specifically in
extropianism. Admittedly, I've been putting off a student membership for several
months now. But one thing is becoming clearer to me: whether or not I agree with
everything ExI has stated in the Extropian Principles, there is no other
transhumanist organization as firmly established as ExI, and doing the amount of
work ExI seems to be doing (CM if I'm W -- Aleph?). Even though some aspects of
spontaneous order suggest a broad politic that I'm not ready to accept, I see no
need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Given that I have no time/motivation to start an organization on my own, a
membership in ExI will accomplish a few things for me.

1. It will give me a concrete hand in the promotion of transhumanism.
2. It will (now) allow me participation in a list that I *already* look forward to
sifting through everyday.
3. It will allow me to debate the Extropian principles with a little more
leverage.

Purchasing a membership in ExI does not mean:

1. I think ExI is the final word on transhumanism.
2. I am a libertarian, or
3. I will be a member next year.

In short, there is work to be done, and ExI is shouldering a good part of the
load. I think we all need to decide why we don't want to join, and work those
things out for ourselves. Some may think they don't know enough about the
organization. Hey, that's what this list is for. Ask some questions, ask Max. I,
too, am very careful about my affiliations and their impact on my career. There's
nothing wrong with that. But, if you're a transhumanist, and you think that
transhumanism needs to pick up some steam, then a contribution to some
organization seems like a good next step. Some people, like Broderick, are already
doing their share by themselves, and we need more and more people like that, too.
Living in the States, and given that I don't have the expertise to write _The
Spike_ or something similar at this point, I think ExI could use my help.

That's all,

'bard

I think this is THE important point in this issue. As I first subscribed
to this mailing-list, I was kinda shocked by what I read in the
introduction. The rules put up there sound really restrictive.
Unfortunately, many people seem to have forgotten that introduction -
and no one seems to enforce it...

Maybe regularly posting this introduction could help!

Answering the question posed in the subject I have to say that many of
the threads are quite interesting and I really appreciate being on this
list - even when I don't have the time to read it a lot anymore (if
there was less "noise" this may change...)

later,
Holger

This reminds me of the role of Jainism and Buddhism in classical India.
They provided a spiritual outlet for the monied merchant caste which was
excluded from the mutual back-scratching rituals of the Kshatriyas and
Brahmins.

There is no such thing as an ideographic script; this is a fiction
lingering from the first days of Jesuit missionary activity in China and
before Egyptian hieroglyphs were decipherd.  Written Chinese is a
logosyllabary: characters represent phonetic information --syllables--
first and foremost.  Syllabic content is modified by determiners, little
marks added to the syllable-character to indicate something of its
semantic value.  Finally, a small percentage of characters in common use 
are true logographs, having purely semantic value and no phonetic value,
similar to Arabic numerals.  Classical Chinese dictionaries are full of
archaic characters which no one knows how to pronounce anymore --these are
logographs that have either passed from common use or were never commonly
used in the first place.

All writing systems have a phonetic basis because the phonology of a
language is the system with the smallest number of units.  English has
about 42 phonemes; Japanese has IIRC about 120 possible syllables.  20 to
a few hundred functional units are about all anyone can reasonably be
expected to learn.  Semantic systems, on the other hand, contain an
indefinite number of meanings.  Can a human learn an indefinite number of
characters in a few years?

Daniels, P.T. & Bright, W. (editors) 1996. _The World's Writing Systems_.
New York:  Oxford University Press.

DeFrancis, J.  1989.  _Visible Speech:  The Diverse Oneness of Writing
Systems_.  Honolulu:  University of Hawaii Press.


Having said all that, I seem to recall that there are three levels of
literacy.  At the first level, the reader reductively sounds out each
unit, whether letter or syllable.  ("Kuh... ah... tuh... cat!")

At the second level, the reader reads the whole word phonetically.  This
is as far as almost anyone got in the ancient Mediterranean world or
medieval Europe --people read aloud and literally listened to what they
were saying.  The ability to read silently was almost unheard of; Saint
Augustine was famous for being able to read without speaking.

The third level is where most people end up now.  At this point, all
writing systems effectively become ideographic in that the marks on the
page are perceived as a unit; we recognize the shape and do not read the
word phonetically (break it down by syllable or letter) except in the case
of words new to the reader.  The whole word isn't even needed; try
covering up the bottom half of the letters in some text, or reading only
the first few letters.  To get to this point, though, one needs to go
through the previous stages of analyzing writing in terms of phonology.

This is what Chomsky has spent his activist life talking about.  Of
course, he's an anarchosyndicalist and believes wage labor is slavery and
private property is injust, granted, but his criticisms of the
authoritarianism of the state and corporation and the orthodoxy they
manufacture through news media seem to me to be dead on.  Western
democracies don't need to beat people up to enforce the status quo
(although they do engage in that to some degree; drug enforcement springs
immediately to mind); why waste resources on that when you can play on
the group-think instinct?

Individuals without the funds to pay yearly 4-H dues are usually given a

Scientific American. They don't limit the discussion to sub'ed members.

I run several mailing lists for the user groups/professional orgs I am

initial setup/tweaking.

The question put forward in the Subject line of this posting is not the
right one to ask. Naturally it is in the beginning of discovering the
philosophies that >H & Extropy covers that ones life will be changed.

After a while when the ideas sink in, it is more like a process of
refinement and personal development.

Those of us who are old sci-fi buffs, and especially those who have
taken part in >H & Extropy for the last ten years will find it rather
difficult to find ANY posts on any lists that will change their lives.

Luckily "rather difficult" is not the same as impossible and i have
found lots of mindcandy on this list and continues to do so. My e-mail
filter removes the most noisy participants on the list. (Imo)

I think some extropians should be justifiably disturbed by the rise of
violent luddites.  If the unibomber was still active, I would advise you
to be wary of your mail!  A copy-cat unibomber can't mail a bomb through
e-mail, so contributing to the list is fine.  Maybe if you gave a greater
assurance of privacy in releasing our vital stats from ExI, it would
eliminate this paranoia. (As EvMick said, a little paranoia is a good
thing)

I apologize for infuriating you, I was definitely not insinuating *you*
were driving a Mercedes.  I think everyone here appreciates the work you
have done with little *cash* return; however, I think if I were in your
position, I would be more than satisfied with the things you have received
that have no cash value.(eg. the massive exposure of your ideas, the new
friends and connections you have made, etc..)  I don't think being a
capitalist means you can't appreciate those things that cannot be bought.  

On the other hand, I do so the need for more money to ExI.  I guess I
still hope that you will not get this money by charging to contribute to
this list.  I think this list is a wonderful place for newbies to watch
for a while, then throw out a couple of replies and watch the seeds of
their ideas grow into new threads.  With a $95 fee, this will become a
rare phenomenon.  

In reading your e-mail, a question pops into my head: What is your
motivation for creating the Extropian movement?  I highly doubt it is to
make money, there are many easier ways of doing that.  I know if it was
me, my motivation would be to create a world that is open to my ideas,
that supports my values... a world that can provide constructive criticism
to my radical philosophical ramblings.  I think others may share my view.
Recently, I have been thinking about how I might help the extropian
movement.  Whatever this may involve, I would not expect a salary.  I
often spend time spreading transhumanist memes (something that seems very
easy in a university), and I do not consider this work at all.  It is
exciting that so many people are open to these ideas!

This is a great idea.

HAHAHAHA!!

You may have given the ExI maillist a motto...

>Luckily "rather difficult" is not the same as impossible.

Or, for the more jaundiced of the participants:

The ExI Maillist: "Rather Difficult".

:) :)

BTW, an email filter does nothing for second-order effects, e.g. the noise
from people you let through posting re people you filter. Another way of
looking at it is that low SSNR sets a bad example for newbies.

I think I was writing a little deeper than you were bothering to read. I
meant each example to be a different kind of selection pressure:

>>Is the Rotary a cult? is the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies a
>>cult? Is 4-H a cult? Is the specialty-certified service station I take my
>>car to a cult? How about the letters-to-the-Editor column of Scientific
>>American?
>
>Individuals without the funds to pay yearly 4-H dues are usually given a
>rider. 

That's not my point here. My point here (made more clear by a part of my
post you elided :) is
that 4-H "tries to tell people how to live" at least as much as any ExI
member I've ever met. Possibly more.
Regardless of that, the "dues" all members pay in 4-H do exist, and are
those of conforming to the mores of the US American agricultural heartland.
Be a rotten enough kid, and they _will_ suggest you do something else with
your time...

>And anyone is allowed and invited to write to the letters column of
>Scientific American. They don't limit the discussion to sub'ed members.

Ah, but again you miss my point. Which is, in this example, that the
letters are *edited*; another selection pressure, and based on the author's
letter's value being judged by the editor. The "dues" here are more
abstract yet strangely familiar given the prior case: fitting (or _being
fit into_) into the editorial categorization scheme... "What KIND of letter
is this? How well does it sound to me (the editor) when I read it loud?" Etc.

I run several mailing lists for the user groups/professional orgs I am
>involved with. If done properly, it takes almost no effort after the
>initial setup/tweaking.

I'm sorry, now I don't seem to understand what _your_ point is. Somebody
_already_ runs this list, no? :)

The difference is, "alt.extropic", being new, could be whatever it wants to
be, those who cared could take over "alt.extropians"; and those who wished
could yell at people who misbehaved with abandon! :)

Well, just for noise reduction it is not necessary to oblige one to become a
member of ExI... . A  specific ( and fair..) committee could simply select
those who would have permission to have R/W acces to the list or simply
"read only"...

Unless the objective of such actions is also getting more funds to ExI... (
what is not reprobable, since we need that Institutions like ExI grow up...
and without money it is very hard for humans...).

A suggestion for the leaders would be to permit the access of some "invited
members", even if not ExI formal members..., for guaranteeing a higher level
to the list... ( I say that not for me, but for some exponents that will be
simply "discarded"... thrown away from the list... )

The list, up to know has been just a "free-trial-sample"... Now >>> get your
membership for just $ xxx !!!

Anyway, it was some interesting to participate of some of the discussions on
the list... But, since I am a Brazilian Sci, with a President (Mr. Fernando
Henrique Cardoso) who says publicly that admires Scientists - but in
reallity, prefers to pay much better to recent graduated lawyers than to
more expecienced doctorated engineers, physics, biologists etc... I just
will say: 

Bye... I suppose I will be transformed, in a near future, in a
"nonvoiced-extropian" !!!!

I thought about the same thing - and there already are 2 extropian
newsgroups on the usenet:alt.extropians
alt.extropians.forbidden.topics

Those newsgroups don't seem to get used a lot, though (on alt.extropians I
only found one thread - and that one has been crossposted to many other
groups, too). I wonder why. Since anybody can post into this list and
there's an archive, it's not much more "private" than the newsgroups.
Newsgroups have one major advantage: offline-reading, so you only download
the posts you believe to be interesting.

The only problem I see with newsgroups is spamming, but we've had that on
the list, too...

later,
Holger

Dear friends,

The following is an Update Announcement about the CryoFeast '97 following
the virtual Performance Art Reception:


"THE AESTHETICS OF MEMETIC EVOLUTION"
        
        Performance Art

Opening:  Friday, December 5, 1997
at the Transhumanist Art Centre:  http://www.extropic-art.com

morphing into

CryoFeast 1997 Host -- Los Angeles Party

FREEZE YOUR BRAIN  UPGRADE YOUR MIND!

Spanning the gap of cultural domains, this skywalk transports us as a
culture responsible for the creative roles we play in our evolution and the
parts we replace with the techno-science biology.

Like a beacon mapping out a passage into the future, let us to question our
evolution:  Why would we want to live indefinitely?  Is cryogenics the best
safety-net available today for indefinite lifespans tomorrow?  What are the
ground breaking technologies extending life?  What about uploads and
artificial life?  Are you an Automorpher?  You will see a visual language
that illuminates, propels and uplifts us with critical savvy.  Open the
floodgates!  The power source is on!

You are invited to participate in The Aesthetics Of Memetic Evolution by
entering the virtual cryogenics chamber at   http://www.extropic-art.com.
Watch the spinning head and see for yourself why you might want to live
indefinitely.

This Performance Art event will begin the CryoFeast 1997 weekend.  Who will
be there?  Creative Minds! 

**CryoFeast 1997 Party**

With no further adieu, let the CryoFeast begin:

The 1997 CryoFeast will be hosted in Los Angeles on December 6th at 7:30
p.m.  (See below for contact information.)  It's a pot luck, so bring your
favorite delicious dishes. Parking is adjacent to our townhouse and we will
have signs up guiding you here.

FEATURED GUESTS AND EVENTS:

**Premiere video "Vernor Vinge - The Singularity" 
(Prepared especially for the CryoFeast.)
**Fred and Linda Chamberlain, founders of Alcor Foundation
**Artificial life visuals - Karl Sims
(and other video clips)

And, for those of you who would rather expand your brain than your belly, we
have plans for book signings from some of our favorite authors.

While others may be a little behind the times in giving thanks for the
harvest; we  are giving thanks for the technologies that may help us to
achieve indefinite lifespans.  

I welcome all to attend my home in Los Angeles or the other fantastic
Co-Hosted CryoFeasts honoring Alcor Life Extension Foundation.

The problem is even worse.  Most people conflate capitalism with
authoritarianism BECAUSE these ideas are usually thought of in
terms of "package deals" -- to use Rand's term.  An example of a
package deal in another field is equating atheism with Darwinism
-- or even the specific state of evolutionary theory at a given time.
This is often done so that one can reject one idea by its chance
association with others.  In the atheist example, theists often argue
against a specific theory or aspect of a biological theory and then
say, "Aha, this theory is faulty, therefore, atheism in untenable and
you should follow my laundry list of religious tenets."

The same happens with capitalism.  A good example in the Third
World is the confusion of capitalism with colonialism.  People tend
to see the various colonial powers as capitalistic - even though
imperialism is an example not of market exchange but brute
governmental force -- and hence wind up being against capitalism.

(I'm not well read in memetics, but Rand's notion of a package deal 
should be incorporated into the theory, as it explains the spread or
lack thereof of many ideas.)

Yes, really!:)

I was impressed too, though I feel he should have stuck to cosmology

This irreducible randomness and directedness seems real, yet most
cannot accept it and try to explain them as an epiphenomena of our
awareness.  Where, pray tell, did our awareness come up with them
then!?!:)

But it seems to explain the large scale structure and mass distribution
which extant Hot Big Bang theories has trouble have trouble accounting
for.

Where he takes this is intriguing, but I feel it is a bit premature and
might be attached to closely with his cosmological theory.  If his
notions of self-organization prove wrong, then people might reject his
Cold Big Bang -- even though it might be right.

Hi!

Are you serious about this "members-only" club in ExI?

I know this is going to make a lot of persons happy, but I'm quitting if
that's the case. A mailing-list whose purpose is to spread information
and ideas cannot create prejudices on the factor of wealth. $95? You've
got to be kidding?

BTW, my site is already fully functional. If you are a free-markets fan,
don't even go near it! If you want to learn more about life-extension
and biogerontology - amongst other minor subjects -, check it out.

See ya - probably not for a long time -,

A big part of the book was devoted to saying science should be 
understandable by the layperson.  This is okay, but can be taken
too far.  Lerner's paean to Faraday is a welcome alternative to the
modern heavily technical and seemingly nonsensical science,
BUT it begs the question.  If science is about finding the truth,
then the truth might NOT be as intuitive or as convenient as some
would like it to be.  Does this make it any less true?

I don't recall all of it, though I seem to remember him coming down
against the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) of quantum mechanics.
(Correct me if I am wrong, but CI basically states that the traits of
quantum systems are determined by the observer.)

I believe so, but wonder how to distinguish between some of his

_Conceptual Revolutions_.  It would be a learning experience.

I agree. While I've been delaying my subscription/membership this year
due to vagaries in time/employment, etc... I am rather appalled at the
elitist attitude some list subscribers are taking with regards to the
list. So we have some newbies now and then, so we get spammed once in a
while. If I were the powers that be, I'd keep the main list open and
have higher level specialized lists for those who don't want to have
their in boxes polluted by the tracks of ignorant plebes. Its not the
cost that implies the "cult" flavor, its the isolationist attitude.
Those who don't want to be bothered with helping enlighten newbies to
extropianism shouldn't have kept their subscription when the list went
public.

Here's an interim suggestion: Have a free subscription period, of say 3,
6 or 12 months. Then have a subscription rate for further membership to
the list.

Max should have booted me a long time ago, to be fair. (The check is in
the mail). ;)

For those that complain about too much noise and too little substance,
you should be pushing the list owners to police relevancy/ongoing
stupidity more effectively. Subscribers should also police themselves.
If you think someone is not on topic, first a) check the FAQ yourself,
then b) email the relevant text in the FAQ to the offender.

Many people here who are ardent libertarians seem to be rather welfarish
in their attitude toward noise/signal on the list. If you think someone
is an ingnorant nincompoop, use personal email to go into long and
sufficient detail to educate the novice as to his or her error. THose
who are too stubbornly newbie for it to have any effect on usually dig
themselves deep enough for some real fun once they get into rude enough
territory. If you are not taking personal responsibility for fixing up
the signal to noise on the list, then its your fault. I find the threat
of high subscription rates simply the moral equivalent of trade
restrictions. Hardly libertarian.

DOn't forget that democratic institutions in Hong Kong are less than 10
years old. That HK has become so wealthy without a smidgen of popular
representation for so long is rather the main problem preventing wider
acceptance of "western values" in China and SE asia. They pointedly
ignore Japan's stable democratic gov't that has existed in one form or
another, since the mid 1800's. THey also pointedly ignor other 
democratic states with high asian populations: Hawaii, Seattle,
Vancouver B.C., & Australia. China, et al think that if HK can get so
wealthy without democracy for so long, then they can too. THey pointedly
ignore the implication that this makes them the running dog imperialist
capitalists they revolted against....

How about putting bots out on the web that prevent web browsers from
computers in repressive countries from accessing western web pages, or
conversly, to make the economic and idea flow on the web more
beneficially one way, to prevent western browsers from accessing China
based web pages, and pages in other repressive countries? Maybe as a
virus that installs itself on browsers??? MSIE has enough security holes
that this should be easy... I'm surprised this hasn't happened
already....

Slightly more esoteric EE-speak for almost the same thing. It's Signal /
(Signal + Noise), since in the real world it's easiest to measure those two
things, and relatively harder to directly measure just the noise by itself.

So "S / ( S + N )"  Ratio --> SSNR.

I'm in Indianapolis.  I don't think a bike ride to Chicago is
realistic, but I would be willing to, gulp, take a weekend  bus if it
means chill'n with extros (provided I can feasibly get from bus station to

That might work too. I have no particular problem with that, provided that
it costs something of value, p front, not necessarily money but something
of value that must be redeemed, to join the "higher level" lists. PLEAS PAY
SPECIAL NOTE that "higher level" is again your interpretation, not
necessarily A Fact.

Michael, where do _I_ fit in? Are you telling me, a person who never joined
until "the list went public", that I should never have joined? This doesn't
make any sense to me; Help me out here, please.

>Here's an interim suggestion: Have a free subscription period, of say 3,

Here's a suggestion: Have a list where I can talk to people I trust and
respect, and other people can listen in. It's no more elitist than a panel
discussion on TV, and it only costs money if you want to subscribe with
write-privs to the list. And as I mentioned before, there's CRIT.

I don't see this as isolationist. Nor any more elitist than a gas station.
TANSTAAFL. My attention is worth something, AND SO IS YOURS. Get it? :)

Allow me to render a free translation: We should be perfect people, and
then any system would work.

BZZZZZT.

I suggest you look to the seeming. I am offering to pay my own way; a
moment ago you were advocating that the list owners do more "policing".
There are at least two ironies here.

That's fine, IF you want to. Feeling obliged, OTOH, seems like

Except in the extropy list, where we are supposed to give without end for

Geoff -- I assure you that I *do* proceed carefully with unknown packages
in the mail. There could easily be more than one Unabomber out there. I
*know* there are growing numbers of people who hate me and other vocal
extropians. You raise an excellent point about the security of members
information. I'm open to suggestions. We have been pretty careful about
that information. If members feel it warranted, we could be even more
careful such as having a policy of never renting out the list and only
exchanging it for lists of other organizations we are utterly sure of (this
has, in effect, been our practice anyway).

Geoff, *you* didn't infuriate me, that was the prof. of surgery who took
the cheap parting shot that I was unable to respond to. I didn't think you
were assuming I drove a Mercedes, but you did make it sound like maybe the
situation was a bit like that.

We are not charging to contribute to the list. We are charging for
membership, one of the benefits of which is charging to the list. There is
a difference! There is no separate list charge.

Newbies can still read the list. There is also the Transhuman list. And
there are the newsgroups. This is not an either/or situation.

Geoff, of course my motivation for the work I've done was not to make
money. But I've come to realize that you cannot run an organization
effectively without sufficient revenue. I've also learned by personal
experience that living in debt at a tiny salary is a stressful way to live,
and not conducive to a happy life nor to a life that includes
life-extending protocols that do not come free.

If you are an active member, or want to become an active member, and want
to ask for a break on dues, please get in touch.

ExI members paid $25 less for EXTRO 3 than non-members. Membership at that
time was at a low of $30 (down from the previous $45). That meant that for
members who came to the conference, the remainder of their membership
benefits cost only $5. If you can get a members' newsletter, posting
ability to the list, entry to local meetings, and other benefits for only
$5, that's pretty good. For those going to the conference, becoming members
of ExI almost completely paid for itself.

If you want them to wait *at* your bedside, that's quite a bit extra. :-)
Another comparison -- with another networking organization -- the
International Interactive Communications Society. The last time I checked,
annual dues were $125. Anyway, for the ExI dues, you do get the regular
(not just emergency) services of a trained extropian team in your media!

It already is accomplishing something, Daniel. If it weren't for our
members (especially those who have supported the organization beyond the
minimums) we would not be in existence. There would not have been the very
considerable amount of media exposure to these ideas, there would not be
conferences, and there would not be some of the offshoot activity including
other organizations that are starting up. At the very least, members will
allow us to keep doing what we've been doing. If we can increase
membership, *then* we can realistically consider doing more. I always
welcome suggestions for what else we could be doing (do you have
suggestions Daniel?) but such suggestions cannot be acted on without
resources.

Onward!

The point is not that it's a big effort to run the email list (though it
does amount to significant work when you add in David's work running all
our other lists, the archive, and the web interface). The point of making
the list members-only (for posting, not for reading) is to internalize the
benefits -- to make it a membership benefit to boost the reasons to become
an Extropy Institute member. The more reasons there are to become a member,
the more members ExI will have, so the more it can do (not to mention
simply being able to survive, which just would *not* continue for much
longer at the old, low membership rates).

I see no sign that suggests that to be the case. The discontent expressed
by a few seems to be a mixture of concern among the less well off that they
can afford the new member rate (a concern that can be relieved for those
willing to contribute in other ways), and annoyance by some that ExI wants
to make our email list a member benefit (with regard to posting) rather
than keeping posting privileges open to those who don't support the Institute.

Well, that turned out to be a good move, Keith, since the student rate is
down to $30. Having been a student for many years myself, I appreciate the
financial contraints, and so wish to accommodate students both with a lower
membership rate, and also by allowing students to register for the
conference at half the regular rate.

But one thing is becoming clearer to me: whether or not I agree with

The Justice Department has recently been using the idea of network
economies to justify prosecuting Microsoft. The bigger the network, the
larger the internal benefits. The fact that (small as we are) ExI is the
largest and most active transhumanist organization does give reason for
those sympathetic to its goals to get on board. The more of us there are
together, the more we can accomplish and the better the network functions.
If people hold off joining because they don't want to join organizations
(however that feeling is motivated) then we will have a hard time reaching
a size able to make real changes.

Yes, these are perhaps less tangible benefits that discounts on
conferences, etc., yet no less real. Obviously some of these factors will
be more valuable to some, less so to others. Some of us find it important
to support the development and dissemination of these ideas, recognizing
that not only are they beneficial to other people (the Benevolence Motive)
but they also improve one's own chances of long-term survival and
transformation (the Self-Interest Motive).

Well said, Keith. (1) You can be a member of ExI AND other transhumanist
organizations, and you can not be completely sure about all the principles.
(2) Being libertarian -- as I said a few times lately - is NOT a
requirement of ExI membership, nor of being "extropian". Extropians do have
a general appreciation of the role of spontaneous order and affirm
self-ownership, but the precise economic and political implementation of
those ideas is up to the individual extropian to decide. (See Extropy
Online in about two weeks for my essay on Self-Ownership.)

Yes! Please do ask, and please do comment on what you would like to see ExI
doing (and how we can make it happen with our resources or by expanding our
resources).

Whoa! That is not and never has been the List's purpose. The list was
created as a "safe haven" (founder Perry Metzger's words) for discussion
amongst Extropians without having to pander to the differently-opinioned.

Outreach can be accomplished through many other means that we already use,
including the web site (we want to improve it's function in that role),
local meetings and chapters, appearances in the media, and so on.

Here's a possibility that I'd like to hear feedback on:

The current proposal is to make the Extropians list into a members-only
list for posting ability, but non-members could still read messages.

Instead, we could leave the Extropians list as it is, and create a new,
additional list, say ExI-Members, or Extropians-Special, or
Extropians-Insider (or whatever has the appropriate elitist ring to it :)
). That would leave this list more open, but mean we have a more filtered,
probably higher S/N list, with clear guidelines for members, so we would
still have a new members-only benefit to add to the other membership benefits.

Feedback welcome.

I think it would be good to just have one list. Following multiple lists is
a drag, and crossposts are a drag, and NOT following both lists you might
miss something important. I don't think making the list members-only for
posting would cut down on noise except for the tiny bit of spam we get, but
it's ok with me. The idea of looking for more benefits to membership is a
good one.

I think that's a much better idea than effectively kicking non-members off
the existing list.  Generally people react quite negatively to having 
something taken away (much more so than to an a equivalent gain).
Saying non-members can't post certainly seems to be really bothering a lot 
of people here.

You might consider a discounted subscription for those who will not be
able to take advantage of any of the other benefits due to location etc.
and who do not want another paper publication - in other words a
listmember-only rate (perhaps "associate" vs. "full" membership ala ACM or
IEEE but less costly and no magazine :-)

Splitting the list up would be more confusing for reasons already given
(dual posts, cross posts etc).

Is this an average? Or is it true in almost all economies? Does the share

I'm surprised and not convinced without seeing the data. Even if true,
clearly there are cases of convergence. Have factors been identified which
mark the few cases of convergence from the majority of cases of continuing
divergence? (I suspect I know what some of those factors are, but I'm
interested in what the literature says.)

As someone else asked, how could controlling birth rates boost growth?
Surely the opposite? More births means more growth in the long run at
least, as there are more people producing, and more specialization, and
bigger domestic markets.

Thanks for the tidbits of info, Robin. If you have time to answer these
questions, I'd like to see what you say.

Hm... This means that India and China have higher per capita incomes 
than most European nations, since that was true in the year 800 AD.

Try again.

There are certain SOCIAL and POLITICAL factors that dramatically 
affect growth rates.  These factors changed over a 
relatively short period in western Europe; and in the course of a 
couple hundred years western Europe went from the verge of extinction 
(pushed from the east by the Mongols, from the south by the Moslems, 
and bound on the north and west by cold salt water, and seriously 
ignorant of science and technology as compared to those foes), to 
being the definers of world power.

In the process, the LEADERSHIP of western Europe LOST most of their 
power over western Europe.

Other parts of the world did not make that change.  Some 
leaders actively resisted for fear of losing their power.  Others 
tried to achieve some interesting 
compromises (that in the case of China amount to 
"Behave like them, be imaginative, independent, and individualistic, 
and above all, do what you're told") that didn't work.

But a newly industrializing nation grows faster than an 
already-industrialized nation.  If the newly industrializing nation 
is not DEVELOPING new technology, but merely COPYING it, as is now 
the case for most industrializing nations, the growth rate can be 
quite incredible.

All that is necessary is to start copying those social and political 
factors.  Maybe not all of them are necessary.  Maybe they are.  
Maybe they work better copied in one order than in another.  

South 
Korea apparently has copied enough to handle the process of 
*becoming* an industrialized country, but not the state of *being* 
one, so they are a bit of a mess right now, but the people will work 
it out -- if they are permitted to try lots of different ways to do 
so, most of which won't do very well.  (Same way Edison invented the 
light bulb.)

I think that this is the best idea so far.  I just discovered this new
world of possibilities and as I am not a member, I would hate to see it go
already...there is too much potential for that, and filtering what I want
to read isnt that bad.

Not that I want to start another thread, but has ExI exchanged a list
containing my name with other organizations?  If so, is there a
procedure for me to find out who received it and request that this not
be done in the future?

This list is sponsored by ExI itself, yes?  Its going to be the
first place newcomers look, since they will want to see the "main"
list (even though that would not be accurate).  First impressions are
important.  Why not do it the other way?  Make this, the "main",
unhyphenated list members only post, everyone read, and create a
Extropians-Free for All list.  Make the Extropians FfA deliberately
*anything goes*, nothing censored, like the Speaker's Corner in Hyde
Park.  Actively encourage eccentrics to speak out as an expression
of Extropian ideals without seeming to endorse them. That way we can
present a more serious, controlled public face while still providing
a forum for totally unfettered communication.

I heartily agree that the 2 list scenario is the best of both worlds (because it
allows for both worlds).  I do VOTE YES for this idea.  Additional services e.g.
those I mentioned in "Re: SNR" may be useful as well. The text of "re: SNR" is
reprinted below:
I feel that most intelligent people who have a lot to contribute probably find
it an excessive waste of
time to wade through so many postings.  Therefore, I suggest that all those who
post should be
Extropy Institute (EI) members.  I do not believe that basic EI membership
should have a price tag
though. Another electronic community that I am a member of (the HTML Writer's
Guild at
http://www.hwg.org.) has several levels of membership but basic membership is
free.  In this way
those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can subscribe to a
print copy magazine
(sort of like Web Magazine), other services, get a plaque (ala Public
Television) or whatever. A live
chat room for Level 2 members, for example might be set up.  An archive of the
most popular
threads could be available for Level 3.  A member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or
online by
access number) is possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list
but would be paid for
by the members who desire such services.  It's a thought worth serious thought.
Maybe a vote of
sorts could be taken.  Who would I contact about this plebiscite notion?

*********
 Therefore, I suggest that all those who post should be Extropy
Institute (EI) members.  I do not believe that basic EI membership
should have a price tag though. Another electronic community that I
am a member of (the HTML Writer's Guild at http://www.hwg.org.) has
several levels of membership but basic membership is free.  In this
way those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can
subscribe to a print copy magazine (sort of like Web Magazine), other
services, get a plaque (ala Public Television) or whatever. A live
chat room for Level 2 members, for example might be set up.  An
archive of the most popular threads could be available for Level 3.  A
member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or online by access number) is
possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list but
would be paid for by the members who desire such services.  It's a
thought worth serious thought. 
******

That's an interesting idea.  It would allow Max to say with almost a 
straight face that we have "tens of thousands of members world wide".

On the other side, I recall a conversation I had with the editor of 
*The Journal of Practical Applications in Space* (I've forgotten her 
name). She claimed that she had little success getting colleges and 
universities to subscribe until she *increased* the rate for 
institutions from the standard ~30 dollars to ~150 dollars.  Seems 
they didn't believe it was a "serious" journal until then.  

I'd also like to point out that there are really two kinds of 
membership organizations.  One has a popular membership like the 
Planetary Society or the old L-5 Society, and the membership fees 
are in the neighborhood of $30.  The other type is a "professional" 
society (though there is no real requirement that you be in the 
"profession") like the AIAA or the American Library Association or 
the World Futurist Society with fees from generally more than $100 
and often several hundred (my wife pays nearly $200 for ALA 
membership).

The blunt fact is that the Extropy Institute has been a flop as a
popular membership organization.  I think there is a lot to be said
for moving towards the professional society model, if for no other
reason than it needs to do something  different, since what it was
doing wasn't successful.  By posing more as a "serious" (I get the
giggles every time I type that) think tank, policy wonk,
professional society it may be more successful and I think will
definately be taken more seriously by those who are not and never
will be members.  Maybe Max can even revive the print Extropy and
have libraries line up to pay $400/year for it!

Just my .02 nanoDirksen worth.

Hello folks:

My original interest in the Extropians was to gain an insight on various
opinions,
and occassionally published "snippets" and references to scientific articles
in regards to topics such as nanotechnology, life extension, alternative
economic
systems theories, and so on.

Sadly, the "original" extropians I had become so attracted to years ago,
seems
to be slipping further and further into a quagmire of internal turmoil, and a
general
myre of postings not even remotely related to the thematic trajectories of
what had
initially been defined as "extropianism"

how sad . . . . 

just an opinion from a "relative" outsider, looking in

sincerely
C.O.

I've been on the list since it's inception and managed it for
sometime. I don't accept the view of a "quagmire of internal turmoil."
The Institute is self has never been been healthier, stronger or more
effective.

The list only reflects those who are on it and the many roles that it
serves and there are many. There are many easy ways to improve the
list's S/N. Here is one: hire a few Phd's to screen each post and
charge enough for the list to cover that cost.

Given the clear goal that the list should be effective for the
institute w/out taking resources away from it my previous suggestion
is clearly not a good one. Nor would be in the inverse which would be
to allow anyone to post on any topic.

Given that some middle ground must be met and that those involved are
smart, well spoken and sometimes aggressive people with differing
views you can see that any changes to the list and the list it self
can bring conflict.

If there is any Quagmire it's that there isn't a separate list for the
meta discussion of the list and that those who want basic list
resources have no way to avoid the "good fight about the list"

Yours,

Harry S. Hawk

...And even when what is "taken away" wasn't theirs to begin with.

It never ceases to amaze me how many people complain that something is
being "taken away" when it was a freebie to begin with.  No one has any
inherent right to post to a list maintained by someone else, and
restricting the list will not alter one bit the right of non-members
to form their own list--hell, I'll host it myself if they really want
one.  The question is not what the list posters want; the question is
how ExI can best spend /its/ money.  If a closed list is of the greatest
benefit to ExI--not the posters, just ExI--then that's what they should
choose to pay for, nothing more.

As a current freeloader on this list, I have not the slightest illusion
that I'm entitled to anything from ExI I haven't paid for.  If they
want to continue allowing me to freeload, that's their business, but if
they want to spend their money more frugally, the freeloaders will just
have to form their own list or pay up.  TANSTAAFL!

You make good points. The only problem here is how not to go
about alienating those people who already use "extropians" as Hyde Park...

btw, I like the idea of calling the other list hyde-park-extropians. :)

"Young" Extropians  may not begin its grown with the same errors than
"extinct" (?) Nazis...  

Does anybody know what means "DEMOCRACY IN ACTION" ???

Just read above...

Gomes.

PS: Closing the list is completely different from admitting the necessity of
creating a more silent room to provide a better environment to discuss
really important subjects... But what makes someone  think  this can be got
by paying money for it ??

So:>>> Create another list: the "Silent room"... but include invited serious
people... not just those who will pay for it... If you do not take care,
this will be a perfect occasion for "Little Dollies" show their butts a
little more... But... and about the brains ??? ( with lots of exceptions,
obviously...)

Make a questionary, maybe even in multi choice (a,b,c,d),  having the main
topics which are desired or necessary to a
person participate in the new list... those who get more than 80 %, f.ex.,
will be accepted!!!! 

Intelligently Democratical, isn't it ????

This is the best option I've seen so far. If we are voting, it

Okay, so what is the purpose of ExI?  What are these "changes" you want to
make?  If members do not have to agree with your political standpoint then
they cannot be political.  So what, exactly, are you talking about when you
mention "changes"?  If you're not trying to make political changes then are
you offering services other than communication with like minded people?  Is
it a support group? a charity even?  The reason I've never joined is because
I have no idea of what it's all about.

Harvey: We recently did an exchange with the Bionomics Institute through
Cato. We figured plenty of our members would welcome info on the last
Bionomics conference. Michael Rothschild was an extremely popular speaker
at EXTRO 2. We have also exchanged local N. Cal mailing lists with
Resources for Independent Thinking. RIT's Pres. is Sharon Presley, who is
an ExI Advisor.

If you prefer to be excluded from all exchanges of mailing lists, we will
gladly accommodate you.

I guess I've misunderstood a thing or two for the last months...
The ultimate medium to-date for fast, cheap and, above all, global meme
spreading but that's not what it's for... (?)

 >Outreach can be accomplished through many other means that we already use,
 >including the web site (we want to improve it's function in that role),

Most of those are one-way communication, local meetings can be tough with a
couple of hundred persons dispersed accross the four corners of the globe
(never understood that expresion). The beauty of this list is that anyone
can ask a question and get answers from persons who often have more
knowledge and/or a more refined opinion on a subject (or just different,
that can be educational too - trust me, I know ;-).

Of course there's nothing wrong with having a members-only club for
high-level, civilized, discourse. But the fringe movement of
Transhumanism/Extropianism will then be just that, a fringe movement if
most members only talk to each other in the 'private' room. Fringe, as in:
unknown by the overwhelming majority and therefore often misunderstood and
without much support (financial or otherwise).

That would be a great loss and waste of many good, constructive idea's.

We (The_Organisation_Still_Known_As_Excedo ;-) honestly believe that
everything we do must be about meme _spreading_ at this stage, both here in
Europe and everywhere else in the World. How many Transhumanists worldwide
belong to some kind of organisation? 2000? Who would take us seriously? If
we want to be in a position to actively change certain things, like
legalizing cyronics in Holland for instance (from what I hear many
Extropians would like to change a thing or two...), we must have thousands
of members. By constanty being prepared to educate anyone who seeks to
understand, by being as open to criticall questions as we possibly can be
(even if the other party is 'unreasonable' - especially then, in fact).

I'm using all the "we's" because I feel all will benefit from global
cooperation in some form, no need to reinvent the wheel on every continent.
ExI has already done great stuff, but with only 300 (?) members after 10
years (orso - and yes, I know, Excedo is peanuts even compared to that) a
lot of work remains.

I would like to have a list were everyone can participate, ExI certainly is
under no obligation to provide such a medium but I think many active
non-members would leave if they cannot particiate. That would mean
breaking-up one of the largest and most active Transhumanist lists in the
world. Those who leave would miss-out on things done on this list and ExI
members would miss-out on other points-of-view (and it is my feeling that
most Extropians are open-minded and interested in other views).

Personally I would have no problem with paying a fee to ExI but I would
like to have insight in how these funds are being allocated (both
stockholders and taxpayers have that right I believe). Also I would like
specific information on ExI's organisational structure and who is in what
position.

How about access to the Euro-list Max? Will that remain free and open? Or
should we compensate ExI for the cost of hosting an additional list?

Regards,
Arjen Kamphuis

In all honesty I must admit that I'm very curious who the 24 people are

This sounds like a much better suggestion to me.

Here is a parable from railroad regulation.  Once upon a time railroads
were regulated in part to force railroads to subsidize passenger traffic.
When the trucking industry started to cut into railroad freight business,
the regulators wouldn't let railroads cut their frieght prices, for fear
they wouldn't have money to subsidize rail passengers.  Eventually there
was little rail traffic left, but the regulators insisted on passenger
subsidies still.  So the railroads went out of business.  Now the 
government directly subsidizes Amtrack passenger rail.

There is a demand for this list, and so in principle there is an opportunity
to "tax" list members to pay for "good things" done by ExI.  But it is not
that hard to create competing mailing lists, so I don't think the tax 
could be very high.  Requiring ExI membership at $95/yr seems far too high.

One article (in recent J. Econ. Persp.) fits a Markov model to recent changes
(some countries do very well, some very bad), and then projects evolution out 
into the future.  By this model, it's unlikely  the U.S. would fall very far 
below the top for quite some time.

I referred to "per capita" growth rates.

Isn't a discussion an exchange of information and ideas? How can you
have a discussion in the first place without different ideas and
opinions?
I understand what you are trying to say, but I still think that the list
is a spread of information and ideas, you can add; - only amongst
Extropians; but it's still a spread - and exchange might be a better
word - of information and ideas.

See ya,

LS,

Remember this issue? ;-)
We have received quite a list of names to choose from, thanks go too all
for taking the effort to write us. Traffic has slacked off somewhat the
last few days and we have begun our selection proces.

But:

You can stil send us you ideas!
They remain as welcome as ever, no matter how noisy they may be!

// engage_commercial_mode //

 I would like to take this opportunity to remind eveyone of the 
 great opportunies that await the lucky winner:
 - A $100 fully digital, untracable, Amazon gift certificate
 - Immortalisation on our Website (of your name and URL-of-choice)
 - Our eternal grattitude
 - Enhanced respect by fellow Transhumans & Extropains worldwide
 - General improved career opportunities
 - Possibly a better sex-life
 - And much more...!

// disengage_commercial_mode //


Any idea received before saturday (we'll stretch it to LA-time ;-) will be
considered by the not-so-independent-or-impartial Jury.

So give it your best shot! We can all use a hundred bucks right?


On behalf of Excedo, the Dutch Transhumanist Society,
Warm Regards,
Arjen

Duh.   As is almost everything else on this list. And, as the old saying
goes, opinions are like bung holes: everyone has them. If everyone has
them, then their market value is squat.

Once you get tired of it, unsubscribe. If you are tired of participation
in the hubub of the free market of ideas. I took a two month break when
I needed it. I may take another break this winter as ski season gets
underway. Just because you are subscribed does not make you a slave to
the list. If you don't want to hear it, like the proverbial mother, TURN
IT OFF.

I joined the list after it went public as well, but was a member of the
transhuman list long before that, and was waiting for a while for
extropians to open up.

What is the current market rate. No, not your personal rate, the MARKET
RATE. Seeing the utter lack of successful pay subscription services on
the net, the value of your attention, on a statistical basis, is
effectively nil.

Your are merely practicing the typical NIBY attitudes that, as a former
resident of Seattle, I saw on a daily and excessive basis on the part of
Californians who, once they moved up north to paradise, were doing their
best to shut the door to keep anyone else from coming in. Pretty

Your motives speak for themselves. You are a) Trying to figure out a way
to limit the level of participation in the list in a manner that
hopefully increases the average intelligence of the list content. b) You
propose to do this by charging people for posting priviledges, which is
tantamount to a tariff on the free exchange of ideas. Your error is that
you wrongly assume that there aren't people who don't mind spending
money for the right to be complete idiots.

Like any trade restriction, and as the list members in long standing
should remember, the last time it was a closed list, with posting by
charge only, traffic dwindled to nil, and the Transhuman mailing list
sprung up which offered the same subject matter at a lower cost:
nothing. It was an interesting exercise in free market economics. Its
too bad nobody, especially those claiming to be economic libertarians,
got the hint.

What is the cost of maintaining a mailing list??? Is this a case where
there is no such thing as excess profit???

As luminaries like Michael Kinsley have learned with Slate, the value of
ideas on the web marketplace is far less than two cents. Slate was
supposed to become a subscription service, but gave up and is still
free. If Max wants to make money on the list, I suggest he use his free
market rights and start using advertising as an income source.

Beside the point, since Max has stated he does not want to make money per

Perhaps, but I don't use my attention statistically, nor in the Joe&Marge

Indeed. And this list could help more if it were higher signal. QED.

I didn't assume that. You assume I assume that: that the pricetag will
suffice. It won't. But it *will* prevent an inordinate number of bad
examples from giving newbies bad lessons. I'll filter too, if I have to. I
want to try the experiment. You are convinced it won't work.

We don't have a lot more to say to each other on this topic, I think.

Thanks for your suggestion, Steve. I like it. I'm watching the feedback --
thanks to all for your input. Currently I'm inclining towards Steve's
version of my suggestion. I'd like to decide by the end of this week.

Don't worry about being seen as "culty", the EI has never given an 
exclusive impression.  S/N is an obvious problem for the net in general. 
And if we have to pay to be involved in an intellegent discussion now and 
then, it's worth it.  It must take some work to keep the EI going.  And 
by the way, I'm one of those who haven't bothered to pay up. Just lazy.  
It'll remind me.

Read carefully.  Max was not disavowing mailing lists in general.  He
was saying what this particular list was founded for.  That founder said
so in July, having been gone for a long time.  After a short while I
think he left again.

That's my personal /dev/null, not a list of people ExI bans from posting or
anything.  They were selected because I eventually judged their posts
were more trouble to delete than they were worth.

Me Toooo. I always snip long quotes, and often short ones as well. I
definitely prefer posts with two properties:

1. The response comes FIRST.

2. The post in its entirety does not need to be scrolled, which for me
requires either a long mouse motion and a click, and then back again to
get the next post, or a short mouse motion, a click and a key press,
followed by the short motion and a click and keypress - all of which
USES UP MY TIME.

List maintenance isn't the product we'd be taxing.  That's cheap
indeed--I could create a list tonight for nothing.  I already manage
four and have plenty of server space.  But nobody would care.  The
product in demand is the time and attention of a few people--Max,
Natasha, you, Anders, Carl, and a few others.  Whither /they/ go,
so shall we follow.  If a free list is added as well, that's fine,
but if those people don't follow it, it will be as useless as the
alt.extropians group is now.

The other product of course is the "extropy.org" trademark.  No
matter how valuable any lists become, the ones pointed to from the
ExI site will be seen--rightly or wrongly--as having the implicit
sanction of ExI, and will therefore attract more interest.

Both of those products are so many times more valuable than mere
list maintenance that they alone will determine what price the
market will bear.

I would even go so far as to say that it would be such a great
benefit to have just a few valuable people that ExI could charge
more for membership to have money to pay certain people to read
and occasionally contribute to the list.  David Friedman, for
example, is a nethead but doesn't have time for all of this list.
If ExI paid someone to digest the political/economic discussion,
forward it to him, and get responses, I'd be happy to pay more
for that.  Perhaps some similar arrangement could be made with
folks like Drexler, Merkle, etc.

Hi.

For those interested, here are some solid investments for 1998.  It is a
good time to buy, as the market is still depressed from the recent slide.


Cisco Systems (CSCO  ~$90/sh) :  The world's leading producer of network
routers and switches (roughly 2/3 of the entire market) is climbing fast
and for good reason.  The demand continues to grow as networks proliferate,
and Cisco has virtually unstoppable market presence.  While pricey, this
stock should continue to perform well for the foreseeable future.  This
would be a good long term "value" investment.

CUC International (CU  ~$30/sh) :  I've been watching this well-managed
membership organization for a while.  However, the agreed upon merger
between CUC and HFS ( Avis, Ramada, Century 21, et al ) is a match made in
heaven.  The new organization (which will be called Cendant, I believe),
will be able to snag customers (and profits) coming AND going.  CUC has
also managed to smoothly move their $2.9 billion discount business to the
Internet to great effect.  

Intel (INTC  ~$78/sh) :  No matter which way you slice it, Intel's share of
the total market is increasing.  With competition weakening from the clone
vendors, and the pool of major architectures getting smaller, Intel is
poised to become an even bigger force in the market as it moves into the
high-end with the IA64.  Native architectures that will likely all but
disappear from the desktop over the next 5 years: PA-RISC, Alpha, MIPS, and
PowerPC.  Doesn't leave much, does it?

Merck (MRK  ~$95/sh) :  Long considered a solid value investment, great
things are expected of this company in 1998.  FDA approvals are expected in
1998 for new drugs to treat baldness, asthma, and migraines.  Additionally,
Merck's recent introduction of the drug Fosamax for osteoporosis is
expected to rack up enormous sales.


Updates regarding previously discussed stocks:

Triquint Semiconductor (TQNT ~$20/sh) :  After getting slammed
successively, first by an unexpected inventory glut, and second by the
market slide, the market value of this company has suffered severely.
However, this company still has strong support in the industry and
continues to attract large deals with top wireless vendors.  Consensus now
puts Triquint at $40-45 in 1998.  Earnings are expected to rebound sharply
next year to $1.20-1.40/sh.

I think an increase to $95.00 for ExI membership is entirely reasonable
for all the reasons already
posted.  I really want a strong and viable institute, an institute able
to make its ideas and visions
heard around the world.  I could care less if Max were able to cruise
around in a Merc, as long as the
ExI is fulfilling its mission.

I might add when the time comes for additional fund raising, as I am
sure it will.  It would be helpful to advertise
a specific need or project.  Its always more motivating to know of a
tangible need.  As an example, the Foresight Institute had a fund raiser
for new computer targeted for a specific purpose.

Regards,

SP

Assuming that a dual-list structure can be maintained without  
an inordinate drain on ExI's resources, I support the concept from 
a memetic standpoint.  Very few discussion forums currently exist for 
persons new to transhumanist and extropian thought to participate in
intelligent, rational discussion and, in doing so, to develop their 
own potential for future contributions.  None of us came to this set 
of ideas full-blown, and many of us have experienced growth through 
interaction with more advanced thinkers.  Some general transhumanists 
make the decision to pursue extropian goals, and others sharpen our 
minds with their continued presence.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

        At the risk of posting a noisy "me too" response, I have to agree.
Though I truly sympathize with all those who have financial difficulties, I
think that supporting one's lifestyle\philosophy is a priori.

I agree it's neither fair nor rational, but that's just how people are.
It really is nearly universal; what's there to be amazed about?

Of course it's ExI's decision.  But since ExI has goals of outreach and
increasing membership, how people will react to their actions is a reasonable
part of their decision.  A rational person has to account for others' 
irrationality.

I don't want to post a "me too" one, but this is the one I like best.
For me this is what it's all about.

I'm realistic: we build our own structure as you all heard by now,
but this also costs money. I'm not complaining, it's my free choice.
So I know very well what the dilemma of Max is. You want more people
but you also need money. Charge them to high and they go, charge
them to low and your own structure fails to exist.

So, for me, It's not the price that bothers me. I will make my own
decision if I think I have value for money.
(although it's a bit "stupid" to pay one organization while you can
use all the money for your own, since they both serve the "same"
purpose)

What bothers me is the
fact that after all the hard work of Extropy, I'm not far off by saying
that the Transhuman-meme isn't firmly known around the world.
I (we) would like to focus on this meme-spreding thing first.
More people = more idea's = more commitment = more donations
= a stronger well known structure.
Transhumansim is he very first "thing" in the world I'm more then 
willing to invest a lot off time and money in with whole my hart.
After reading a lot
on the site off Henry Kluytmans and Anders Sandberg.
(they both try to educate people) I was hooked, I saw the light :-)
I also thought (think) that seeing everything that was (is) going on
here; all Transhumanists are honestly working/hoping for a better
world with as much people on board as possible.
So in my/our own humble way I/we will work 
(with all who would like to help)
towards a well known Transhuman organization (in the Netherlands)

I noticed the frustration about the Noise. Since I'm a newbie
myself I take this partly personal. But I also noticed that
sometimes one off my posts started some "high"-level off
discussion on which (due to lack off scientific knowledge)
I had to drop out. But let me tell you again: I learn and enjoy.
But also, aren't this the sparks you need now and then, if
you are highly educated and seen it all ?

Anyway: I will see what Max decides, it's "his" organization
and I'm thankful to him that I could be part off this list.
But Max, I hope you agree with me that if you want to attract
new people in large amounts you have to make sure that the
hurdle they have to take is as low as possible.

As soon as Max's comment came across my screen, I remarked to my roomate
that while public response to this announcement was extremely
predictable, I was willing to bet money that people would express utter
suprise when the "backlash" occurred.

As Curt says, this response is indeed nearly universal and very
predictable. I rather am dismayed that people who attempt to predict and
plan the future are not able to predict such an obvious reaction.

Besides human-nature, Basic Economics dictates that a price increase is
concurrent with a demand decrease.  By free-market standards, the
increase in the cost of receiving the list will decrease its
membership.  If decreasing membership is not the goal of the price
increase, than it may not meet the expected goal.  Obviously, Max's
original claim that the price increase would reduce noise or spam was
met was skepticism.  Max's later explanation that it was really a
revenue-enhancing move for ExI seems more likely, but the Public
Relations or "Advertising" could have been handled more smoothly.

Obviously, any price increase would mean more money for ExI than
nothing.  How much of a price increase would bring the most revenue is a
matter for debate.  The higher the price, the less members you get.  The
lower the price, the more members you get.  This is basic free-market
economics.

One idea that I have not seen expressed is the implicit choice that many
readers on this list have made.  They choose to read the list, but they
have chosen not to join ExI.  By linking the two choices, Max is forcing
people to choose whether their reasons for reading this list outweigh
their reasons for not having previously joined ExI.  If this is indeed a
revenue-enhancing move, I hope Max and ExI have done some market studies
to support their belief that this move will have the intended result.

There are at least 2 people I would call extropians here in the Poconos.
Pat Fallon (me) and George Wakefield (co-worker).  So far, the only
gathering we have planned over the next few weeks is attending the
Pocono Libertarians monthly forum (this month it's an Xmas party), on
Tuesday, Dec 16th at the Tannersville Inn (1 mile off of route 80). If
you're interested, there's more info at:

http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw

Otherwise, if you're near Stroudsburg, PA, stop in at The Computer
Doctor and say hi. It would be cool to meet extropians in the meat, here
on the right coast.

For the record, I prefer the option of having "extropians" for

I'm in favor of EITHER making the extropians list
members-only OR starting an exi-members list.If
someone forced me to choose between these options,
I'd choose the former.I think that either change
would be beneficial to both the list and the
organization, for reasons others have posted.-- M.

	A wormhole, as I understand it, is effectivly an area where space time has
been curved by a strong enough source of gravity, to the extent that two
points in space time are briged by a gap, thus allowing fast travel between
two otherwise distant points.  The "gap" which connects the two points is
an area which for all intents and purposes, doesnt really exist.  It is
dimensionless with respect to time and space.
	  That is the part I dont really understand too much. In effect, if you
were able to walk into a wormhole, you would be entering this
"non-existant" gap and you wouldnt find yourself traveling down a long
tunnel with flashing lights and what not, you would enter and find yourself
at the other end at the same time.  Does this then mean that if you are
standing in a wormhole that you are in effect in two different places at
the same time, and isnt that a paradox?
	The area of non-existance which the bending of space-time creates would be
the same as what is outside the boundary of the universe.  Obviously,
outside the universe nothing exists because it hasnt occured, or been
created yet; time has not occured there.  Then, if you could somehow reach
the edge of the universe, or the edge of time (which too is a paradox) and
you crossed the border between our universe (existance) and the other side
(non-existance), like a wormhole, you could then travel from one side of
the universe to the other instantaneously, assuming the universe is like a
sphere of space time.
	This is my understanding of this so far...please feel free to offer any
guidance or other theories as to this.

If you stand in a wormhole, you are in a certain (very weird) place,
possibly with parts sticking out at the "entrance" and "exit". There
is no real paradox here, you are in one place at a time (or strictly
speaking a locally connected volume of places).

The "non-existent" gap cannot be entered, since by definition it does
not exist. But there is a "throat" in the wormhole, where it is most
narrow; in a spherically symmetric wormhole this is a spherical
region. From the outside, a wormhole in space would look like a
distortion of the stars behind it, with a distorted ball of stars in
the center (they are stars seen through the wormhole throat). If you
move through it, you will see the star-ball in front of you expand,
until it fills half of your sky and the more and more distorted
universe behind you fills the other half; you will also see a
distorted "reflection" of yourself along the seam between the
starfields created as light rays from you circumnavigate the
throat. As you emerge, the starfield in front of you will become less
distorted, and the stars of the place you left will become a ball
inside the other wormhole distortions. In a small wormhole this
transition is of course very quick.

I really wish I could draw it, but email currently doesn't support the
kind of multimedia I would like (imagine being able to create
"applets" showing how you visualize a certain phenomenon!).

At no point in the traversal have you left spacetime, you have just
moved through a more exotic region than we are used to. It is possible
to get from point A to point B faster than a straight light ray by
taking a wormhole shortcut, but at no place is there a violation of
the lightspeed limit locally.

Concerning Chicago Extropians: I am an ExI member
living in Arlington Heights, and I have been
interested in organizing some sort of meeting of
Chicago-area Extropians for quite some time.

Count me in as well.

Okay, what's next? I recommend that we wait about a
week (during which time we could perhaps e-mail each
other as I am doing) to give others a chance to
notice this thread* and respond, and then try to
organize some sort of meeting.

*(I don't know about you, but I rarely have time to
wade through the postings, and frequently have to
just delete them without even skimming them.)

While we wait, how about giving suggestions for rough dates.  I'll start
the bidding with sometime before Jan 12th  (Travel from Indianapolis will 
be much easier over my semester break), excluding the week around Xmas.
I volunteer to compile all sugestions and find a time frame that
accomodates the most people, excluding myself if need be.  Maybe with a
small group, we can all be satisfied.

Anxious to meet you all!

If it takes a large gravity well to create a wormhole, or in effect, a
black hole or singularity, how would it be possible to traverse?  Anything
like a black hole would tear you to shreads and crunch you into infinitly
dense particles.

How can two biologists exchange information about life in the

If we want to discuss our ideas with others who strongly disagree,
there's a forum for that, too: it's called Usenet.

Seems like the people who complain about the signal-to-noise are
among the most frequent posters.  What's wrong with this picture?
My suspicion is that people who don't filter their mail (by
computer, skimming or just plain getting up and doing something else)
are addicted to noise, and asking for noise with a better S/N ratio--
or is it S/M ratio?--is futile.

My mail filter and my legs work fine for me, leave me off any insider's
lists.

I was under the impression that such travel would be impossible due to the fact that
wormholes tend to collapse as soon as they form. However, I was speaking with a friend
a while back, and he brought up the subject of Kerr (sp?) black holes. It seems that
these are theoretical black holes in which the singularity is larger than a
mathematical point, elongated perpendicular to an axis of rotation. Some physicists
seem to think that that this singularity may be ring-shaped. If so, this would mean
that one could follow the axis of rotation into the very center, supposedly "passing
through" the singularity (which if I am not mistaken would have the properties of a
wormhole/gravity well).

If it were possible to begin a normal (Schwarzchild) black hole rotating, would one be
able to create such a ring-shaped singularity? Theoretically, this would eliminate the
problem of wormhole collapse since the centrifugal force of rotation would keep it
wide open. Of course, travelling through it would be an entirely different matter...

Before this list gets moderated, I thought I'd toss some thoughts out to
the list.  I've been lurking for about a month and expect to return to
lurk mode quickly, so don't bother killfiling me. :)

> Re: Steve Sickle's Hyde Park plan.

This seems to be the most reasonable alternative to me.

> Re: James Rogers' stock recommendations.

Cisco & Intel dominate their markets.  In order to grow their revenues to
match the expectations shown by their current P/E ratios, they will have
to grow the market itself substantially, as well as fight off competitors
who would love to grab market share, and the associated profits.

I have trouble seeing the PC market growing substantially, or Intel's
market share (>90% ?) growing.  In fact, I see signs that many people are
buying lower cost PC's when they do eventually buy.  I don't see anything
sparking a drive towards P2's by the public, either.  Windows 98 will run
fine on a Pentium with enough RAM & HD.  Excel, Word, et cetera.  Quake II
will be helped more by a Voodoo graphics card than a new processor.  The
internet, Netscape on a 56K modem certainly doesn't require more than a
Pentium, even including all the current Java mini-apps.

As for Cisco.  Well, I work for Newbridge, so I'm biased.  Obviously, I
think this market will grow substantially.  But, will Cisco continue to
dominate so completely?  They don't have the advantage that Intel does in
that competitors (like Newbridge) don't have to clone Cisco products, just
interwork with them.

I'm new to the stock market -- 6 months ago I was a farmboy going to
school, now I'm an engineer in a market short of engineers.  I certainly
timed my graduation right.  :)

> Re: books.

Because of this list, I just finished reading Rucker's Infinity & the
Mind, and Drexler's Nanosystems.  So keep referring to books so I know
what to pick up!  (That recent conversation concerning updating the
Extropian recommended book list was great).

> Re: politics.

This list finished converting me to Libertarianism.  I was close before, I
just needed the push.  If you're familiar with Canadian politics, I kept
flipping back and forth between the socialist New Democrats and the
extreme right wing Reform Party, and found myself very confused.  Now I've
found a home.  :)  I joined the Freedom Party in Ontario here, but haven't
received anything from them yet.

Partly, it's a reaction, because I now live in perhaps one of the most
over-governed regions in the world -- Ottawa, Canada.  The suburb I work
in, Kanata, is much worse.

So, are there any extropians here in Ottawa, or a surrounding area, like
Montreal? I'd be interested in meeting with anybody.  Unfortunately, I
don't speak French, although I can stumble along in Japanese...

And now back to lurk mode,
Bryan

Is this concept the same as the one used in " Contact" whereby Jodie
Foster ( can't remember her character's name) is sucked through the
wormhole when  her " capsule" is launched by the Vagan designed .. er..

It's funny you should mention that, the modern theory of wormholes was 
largely developed by Kip Thorne, but he probably wouldn't have come up with 
it if it wasn't for Carl Sagan and his novel "contact". Sagan needed a way to get his characters to
the stars quickly, and so in an early version of his book they fell into a 
wormhole made by a Black Hole. Sagan didn't mind proposing new physics for a 
novel but he didn't want to use things we already know are untrue, he wasn't 
an expert on General Relativity so he sent his manuscript to somebody who was, 
his good friend Kip Thorn. Thorne said he was sorry but it just wouldn't work, 
such a wormhole would be as unstable as a pencil balanced on its point, 
the very act of entering one would cause it to collapse. 
  
Thorn felt badly, he didn't want to leave his friend in the lurch and became 
determined to find a way Sagan could finish his book. After a few days of 
work he found that wormholes could be stabilized and made to do useful things 
if you had something that pushed the wormholes walls apart gravitationally, 
something with a negative energy density from light's frame of reference,
something like antimass. Thorn called this stuff "Exotic Material". Nothing 
like Exotic Material has ever been observed and there is no theoretical 
reason to think it exists, but there is no theoretical reason to think it 
doesn't either, and that was just what Sagan needed for his novel.

Wormholes may have this problem, the jury is still out on that. The
energy densities and space-time curvatures involved in wormholes are
comparable to black holes (but "negative" in some sense), and there
are many wormhole models that are not traversable at all since they
collapse, have infinite blueshifts and other nastiness. But on the
other hand, just as very large black holes would have fairly weak
tidal forces at their event horizons, traversable wormholes with
sufficiently large throats might be survivable.

"Traditional" (Einstein-Rosen bridges) wormholes do collapse almost
immediately, before anything can traverse them. But Thorne showed that
in principle it is possible to stabilize wormholes by threading them
with negative energy densities (for example from electric fields,
negative matter or the Casimir effect). Later papers have shown that
stable wormholes may be possible, but most involve violations of the
energy conditions (which say there are no negative energy densities;
they are however somewhat doubted) or dynamic wormholes that change
"radius" (some do this so slowly they are traversable).

Yes, the Kerr-Newman solution to the equations (which is a rotating,
charged hole) has many interesting properties, including a
ring-singularity inside the black hole and the possibility of a
wormhole through it. Unfortunately there seems to be results that
suggests that natural black holes will not work, the wormhole
connection is broken when the hole is formed.

Maybe. Making a Schwartzschild hole rotate is simple, just throw in
mass with angular momentum. But I'm not sure we can control where the
"wormhole" leads, and it might be very hard to get out of the wormhole
opening if that is another black hole. I think I prefer classic
womholes...

Quick question, want feedback and sources of literature.  As far as I
know only members of the electromagnetic spectrum can travel at the speed
of light.  If it is impossible to get anything with mass to travle the
speed of light, because it would need infinite energy, and light has a
wave/<bold>particle</bold> duality...then how do photons of light get the
energy to travel at that speed?

So, why do not you ask who doesn't consider him/herself an extropian ???? 
Ask too  why he/she is in the list without considering him/herself an
extropian ...

I suppose you're forcing people to decide in a hurry "to be or not no be",
since you want: Extropian <=> ExI member ...

Why not to give an ultimatum to those who are here *trying to change the
main objectives of Extropianism*  ?

IT'S V'RY EASY : 

If a person really feels is NOT an Extropian ( supposing, obviously, there
was time enough to getting a conclusion...), please let THOSE WHO ARE  think
and discuss more tranquilly... and simply go search for another list more
adaptable to its particular existencial characteristics... ( you know

from neighboring states (!), I'm inclinced to make
things as convenient as possible for the long
distance voyagers.

However, I have found with all things of this nature
that its best to give people notice well before the
event. By "well before", I mean like a month minimum;
in general, two months is better. Since this thread
began around 2 December, I don't think anyone would
object if I strongly suggest that we not attempt a
meeting prior to 2 January 1998. Usually, I would say
that the date should be SET at least a month in
advance of the event, and we haven't even set the
date yet.

(Perhaps we should hurry up and settle on a date
then?? Maybe if three of us can agree on a date,
others will consider the matter settled. How about
Saturday, 10 January 1998?)

Hey, are there any more Chicago & Midwestern
Extropians out there? Chicago? Milwaukee? Madison?
Indianapolis? St. Louis? Quad Cities? Take a break
from lurking and let us know!

Any more suggestions concerning the timing of a
possible gathering? How about the setting?
Restaurant? House? Bar? All of the above? Suggestions
on other matters?

(I will be away on vacation from Friday, 5 December
to Monday, 8 December, so I may not manage to respond
to messages very quickly over the next few days,
unless I can find Web access where I'm going.)

A target date of January 10 sounds reasonable.  Let's hear from other
interested folks...

Depending on the response to this gathering, we may have to reserve
something(??) (I'm new to get-together planning business).  We should be
sensitive to age concerns, as someone(Steve) suggested to me.  We should
find out if we have any individuals that may require us to meet in an all
ages venue.

Exovivo!

I'd have to disagree, the rush to buy Pentium 2's is huge.  Nobody wants
anything below a 233MXX and usually go for the Pentium 2.  Oh! And the
sequal to Quake, Trinity won't use 3D cards, it'll be software only (as will
most next generation 3D games, cos the cards don't do the right sort of 3D)
so you're going to need that P2.

Any chance of converting you to something more extreme - absolutely NO

only members of the electromagnetic spectrum can travel at the speed of
light.  If it is impossible to get anything with mass to travle the speed of
light, because it would need infinite energy, and light has a wave/particle
duality...then how do photons of light get the energy to travel at that speed?

First of all, sorry for the conceptual simplifications, but they seem
necessary...:

Well, in matter-energy transformations, the photons' total energy is
equivalent to the original matter:

mc^2 = sum(hv)   

So   m=sum(hv)/c^2   is the mass wich was transformed in c-velocity (always)
photons... (or vice-versa)

Ex: In simpler e+ / e-  anihilation, we have after 1 photon with >= 1024
keV, wich equals to two 512 keV rest mass- equivalent eletrons ( + and - )
plus kinetic energies....

In the contrary effect, 1 photon of energy necessarily >= 1024 keV is
transformed in a pair positron-negatron, wich variant kinetic energies but
with "normal" velocities, very far from c (generally, slow eletrons).

Suggestion: Study these transformations.... who knows the answer you want is
there .....???

Does anybody know how much time lasts such transformations ??? And what
happens during them ???

I agree 100%

What I disagree is with your "argument" that because you have money you are 
an extropian and can join the list while I can't. The simple fact that you 
have money - 95$ - to spend makes you nothing better than anyone else in 
discussing any issue in the world. And since basically that's what you are 
trying to do, I'm expressing my disagreement. All I said was as simple as 
that, I disagree with prejudices based on wealth! I disagree when you say 
that you are more "qualified" to discuss extropianism because you have more 
wealth!

See ya,

Texas Instruments Does Copper Combo
                     Wired News Report 

                     12:15pm  4.Dec.97.PST
                     Texas Instruments claims to have one-upped
                     Motorola's and IBM's recent copper-chip
                     achievements with a new technology that
                     promises to increase performance tenfold and
                     combat the effect of resistance and capacitance.
                     The new chip technology combines copper wiring
                     with a new insulating material called xerogel - a
                     material made of microscopic air-filled glass
                     bubbles. 

                     TI claims xerogel solves the issue of capacitance
                     in chips that continue to get smaller and smaller.
                     New chips using the copper/xerogel combination
                     are expected to be the size of a fingernail, with
                     500 million transistors.

If exotic material [there's got to be a better name for it...] has enough negative gravitation to keep
a wormhole open, it sounds like it would be very useful in a propulsion system for interstellar
spacecraft. But then what happens to conservation of energy? Kinetic energy is created out of nothing
more than two particles in close proximity?

The issue here is how ExI's spends its resources here.  Respecting
private property is not discrimination based on wealth--it's ordinary
human decency.  Whether or not you have $95 doesn't make me believe
you are any better or worse of a person by itself--but if I'm offering
something /I own/ for that price, if you don't have the money you don't
get my goods.  That's not discrimination, that's just business, and the
only alternative to that is theft.

That having been said, even if there /is/ wealth-based prejudice in
some minds, I think that's quite a fair and valuable prejudice, and
discriminating on those grounds is not entirely irrational.  In earlier
times when wealth was amassed through aristocracy, slavery, conquest,
and other unpleasant means, one might have been justified in
discriminating /against/ the wealthy like Jesus did ("It is harder
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven"), and maybe even in some societies
today with corrupt systems of government and business, wealth might
correlate strongly with moral depravity.  But in the developed world
today, the greater number of transactions between humans that are
voluntary, the more likely wealth is to correlate with cooperation
and doing valuable service to others.  Since earning a living by
free trade is the most socially responsible act one can perform,
choosing to associate with those who do so is quite rational.  If by
doing so I miss out on the occasional interesting poor person, well
that's my loss, but I don't have time in my life to accomplish
anything without having prejudices--it's just not possible.

I'm not sure if  'exotic' means only negative matter, or includes 
other things as well, but...

Energy is conserved because half of the kinetic energy created is 
negative, and so it balances out.

photons are only considered particles in that the energy they contain is
equivalent to a given amount of mass via e=mc^2. When you stop a photon,
it has mass because you've taken all of its energy away. It is going
nowhere and falls back into the space-time continuum.

Now, this brings up a big difference between light and solid matter with
regards to black holes. As far as we know, light cannot escape a black
hole, because the singularity drains all energy from the photons to the
point that they cannot be detected in the visible spectrum. However, if
you have a toroidal black hole such that matter can pass through from
pole to pole, conservation of momentum dictates that the matter should
retain most of its momentum, and reemerge from the other side (or if a
wormhole is formed, out of the other hole). As wacky as this sounds,
even Hawking has posited this possibility....

Exotic Matter far predates Sagan. It goes all the way back to the early
50's. ALcubierre posited it for use in his warp drive concept...

Actually, conservation of momentum dictates that, if you can pass
directly through the center (down through the pole as the hole rotates
round you), you should be able to come out the other end, provided that
the hole on the other end is of equal or less mass than the one you go
into. Due to frictional losses, you would however, come out into a lower
orbit on the other end. If anyone has any relativistic reasons why
conservation of momentum would not hold, please explain...

If you cn get the hole spinning fast enough, the event horizon should
also warp into a toroidal shape at some point....

Rotation alone can't be enough, because normal BHs do (or can) rotate.

I had an idea that might help ExI membership.

What if ExI started a mutual fund that was only available as a service
to ExI members.  The Extropian fund would provide ExI members an
opportunity to actively direct capital towards companies that promote
Extropian principles, and hopefully earn a good return on their
investment.  An Extropian fund might increase membership and public
awareness.  The unique perspectives that Extropians have on future
social and economic trends could prove useful in developing an
investment strategy.  Who else would be more qualified to manage our
investments should we find ourselves hanging on the eve of singularity? 

I don't know anything about the technical or legal aspects of starting a
mutual fund, or how much start up capital it takes.  Would it be
appropriate for ExI to take on such an endeavor?  Anyone have any
comments on this idea?

I like this idea.  Here's a couple more:

Have a webpage index of members listing their skills, resumes and
services offered.  This could be like the restricted list, readable by
the public, but only members can be on it.  If this would take too many
resources, then perhaps just a single page index of members with a link
to members' private web pages.

ExI should also sell advertising space on its web page.  Listings of
Extropian services, either of interest to Extropians, or offerred by
Extropians, would be of interest to visiters to that page.  This
hopefully would be a good form of advertising, and thus should earn good
revenues for ExI.

Maybe the extended advertising would be a pay service, available to
nonmembers as well, while the individual web pages or links would be a
member service.

The Mutual Fund idea gave me these ideas.  I would like to see an
Extropian financial advisor available.  And why not and Extropian
doctor, lawyer, writer, web-designer, philosopher, artist, etc?

This is not a challenge, just a query.  Have we been having a lot of
luddites on this list challenging basic scientific facts?  I have seen a
couple of naive questions in the past few months, and only a few
discussions about basic science.  I don't recall any major disruptions
by people trying to prevent rational discussion.

Discussing the basics is already against the list rules.  Can't
violators be told that they are violating the list rules?  Has anyone
notified certain posters that they were violating list rules without
result?

The only problems I have with the list is the occassional spam.  I don't
expect spammers to respect the new rules any more than the old rules. 
Software will have to try to block them.

Many members of the list seem to be seeking physical get-togethers.
I suggest that everyone interested in such meetings post a message
to the list with the word "Location" in the subject, and as much 
information
as they care to give about contacting them in the body of the message.

Please don't misspell "Location", as I'm going to be filtering it into a
special folder.  My posted location will be in a day or two as I allow
time for others to establish filters.

We might consider establishing standard subject lines  for certain kinds
of posts (standards that go further than the kind of ad hoc ones in
existence now).  Someone willing to donate a little time and a web page
could then maintain a document of those standards.  The document's
location could be posted to the list (or lists, or whatever the future
arrangement is to be) periodically for newbies.

Thanks for your time,
Bobby Martin

Uh, unless I'm much mistaken Alcubierre wrote his paper in 1994 (give
or take a year or so). Unfortunately later research seems to show that
the largest sustainable warp is smaller than the size of a proton, so
it's not much help 8-(.

|
|THE FOSTER DEATH: U.S. JOURNALISTS OPERATING UNDER A "D-NOTICE?"
|================================================================
|
|In *Above Top Secret* (ISBN:  0-688-09202-0), author Timothy Good
|describes a British government mechanism known as a "D-Notice":
|
|  A  D-Notice  is  a  formal  letter  of  request  circulated
|  confidentially to newspaper  editors,  warning them that an
|  item of news, which may be protected  under  the  [British]
|  Official   Secrets   Act,   is   regarded  by  the  defense
|  authorities as a  secret  affecting  national security.  It
|  has no legal authority and can only be regarded as a letter
|  of advice or request, but it warns that "whether or not any
|  legal sanction would attach  to  the  act  of  publication,
|  publication  is  considered  to be contrary to the national
|  interest."
|
|  ...since a D-Notice warns  an  editor that publication of a
|  given news item may violate the [Official Secrets] Act, the
|  effect is similar to censorship.
|
|Does  the United States have some sort of similar mechanism?  Has
|the  U.S.  government  ever  contacted  prominent  news  outlets,
|suggesting that pursuit  of  a  particular  story could adversely
|affect national security?  At least one instance comes  to  mind:
|ABC  News  had reportedly been set to air a story on how the U.S.
|government seems to  have  had  prior  knowledge  that the Murrah
|Building in Oklahoma City was about to be bombed.  The story  was
|pulled  at  the  last minute, however, reportedly due to concerns
|that its airing might  greatly  weaken  and  even topple the U.S.
|government.
|
|In "The Secret Report and  the  Death Warrant" (CN 9.02), Sherman
|H. Skolnick describes how the late Vincent  Foster  was  employed
|for  years  by  the  National Security Agency (NSA), and may have
|been doing some "freelance" work on the side:
|
|  The report goes  on  to  show  that  since the early 1980s,
|  Foster  held  the  equivalent rank of Military General with
|  the   super-secret   satellite   spying  and  code-cracking
|  operation of the U.S., the National Security Agency  [NSA].
|  Foster  continued  this  work for the few months before his
|  death  in  the  Clinton  White  House.  Travelling for NSA,
|  hundreds of thousands of miles, Foster was the  master-mind
|  of an NSA Project that tracked wire transfers between banks
|  worldwide -- trillions of  dollars  per  day, of banks both
|  friend  and  foe.   Because   of   being  on  top  of  this
|  enterprise,  Foster  never  believed  that  project   might
|  someday find his  purported  foreign  secret coded accounts
|  that  could  finger him as having violated various American
|  espionage laws.
|
|Skolnick's allegations are  corroborated  in  a classic series of
|reports by J. Orlin Grabbe, "Allegations Regarding Vince  Foster,
|the NSA, and Banking  Transactions  Spying."  [1] Further support
|for claims that Vince Foster  was  a  high-ranking  NSA  official
|appear  in a story in the May 15, 1996 Washington Times newspaper
|("Spy  Agency  Holds  Large  File  On  Foster,"  by  Bill Gertz.)
|Referring to revelations contained in the April 24, 1996 issue of
|Strategic Investment newsletter,  the  Washington  Times  article
|reports  that  "secret  documents  held  by the electronic spying
|agency [NSA] indicate Mr. Foster's  death was a matter of 'highly
|sensitive national security.'"
|
|There's that word:  "national security."  Was  Foster's  death  a
|"national  security"  matter and, for that reason, were prominent
|news outlets in the  U.S.  given  some version of the "D-Notice?"
|That would explain why most mainstream journalists here have been
|so  remarkably  blind   regarding   inconsistencies   surrounding
|Foster's  supposed "suicide."  Furthermore, given that Foster was
|a high-ranking NSA employee and had apparently violated his trust
|by engaging  in  espionage,  it  ought  to  be considered whether
|Foster had been secretly sentenced  to  death  by  some  sort  of
|secret  tribunal.   A  clue  to  this possibility is found in Dr.
|Stanton    Friedman's    book,    *Top    Secret/Majic*    (ISBN:
|1-56924-741-2).   Friedman  writes  about  mere  =civilians=  and
|the  possible  extreme  penalty  they   can  be  subject  to  for
|violations of "national security":
|
|  Civilians  unfortunate  enough  to  be  caught  up  in  the
|  security web were made to sign  silence  agreements  ending
|  with  the  phrase  "upon  penalty  of death" according to a
|  witness who very  quietly  spoke  to  me  about  it after a
|  lecture.
|
|If a civilian can potentially  be  secretly  found  "guilty"  and
|sentenced  to  death,  then  the same fate could definitely await
|high-ranking NSA officials who violate  their trust and engage in
|espionage.
|
|But why, if Foster had been secretly sentenced to death, was  the
|sentence  executed  so  sloppily?   Surely  NSA could have done a
|neater job of terminating the  errant Foster.  Widely reported as
|a deep-level cohort of Foster was Hillary Rodham Clinton.  If Ms.
|Clinton had been involved in Foster's alleged espionage,  then  a
|poorly executed termination of Foster might have been designed to
|embarrass  the  First  Lady,  weaken  her  influence, and thereby
|incidentally punish her as well.

Very probably there will be voxel support in OpenGL soon. First voxelspace
hardware accelerators have become available lately. Though this is
high-end visualization market currently, such technology might eventually
become affordable (of course memory demand for voxel rendering is ... 
demanding). 

While I know absolutely nothing about investments, Texas Instruments's
next-generation devices look very bright technically. Both their Digital
Light Processing and their VLIW SuperDSP (1 GFlop now) family look
absolutely unique on the market. If only they'd add parallel links to the
'C6x family...

In the United States there is a docterine known as a "Clear and Present
Danger."  If there is a "Clear and Present Danger" all rights under the
Constitution are null and void.  Any actions whatsoever that are deemed
necessary can be taken.  This allows the state to search areas without a
warrant, detain persons without formal charges, jail persons without a
jury trial by their peers, etc.  Normal rights in most countries only
apply under normal and peaceful conditions.  When the government is at
war or under seige, more restricted options are usually available.

But how can we tell if a mathematical point is rotating or not? If we can't
tell, then there's no way to know if it's rotating fast enough. I don't know
much beyond this, but the fact that normal BH's can rotate (or even do rotate)
doesn't mean this "can't be enough" to form a ring singularity. I brought this
up because it seems like ring singularities would pretty useful things for
understanding more about gravity wells and possibly wormholes.

Possible spoiler alert:



















































I haven't got to the other story yet, but I wasn't terribly impressed
with this one; the 'trick' seemed pretty obvious from the beginning,
but also seems unlikely to work. The uploading tech was also rather
dubious; leaving out memories to 'save space' in the upload's computer.
I don't see how this would be possible if memories are distributed
across the neural network in the brain.

However, it is nice to see more people writing about this kind of 
thing.

they say nothing travels faster than the speed of light, but what about when
light comes near a black hole and it sucks it in, doesnt the light go faster
then?  And how does that change the light?

As someone who works for a 3D graphics chip manufacturer, I find this
rather surprising; in fact, from what I've read about Trinity it will
*only* work with a 3D accelerator; supposedly there will be no software
rendering included, just OpenGL.

With all the quality options enabled (i.e. a situation similar to ID's
games) I've seen some demos running fifty times faster with my 3D
accelerator than on a 266MHz Pentium-II. I can't see Intel catching
up in the near future unless they build some 3D capabilities into the
CPU itself.

Intel will make more money on increased profitability rather than demand.
While demand tends to grow slowly and relatively steadily, the real
profitability will be in the near-term decrease in competition.  Intel's
aggressive price cutting has typically only occurred when faced with
competition.  As soon as the competition disappears or becomes ineffective,
aggressive price cutting stops and Intel's profit margins soar.  Intel will
milk current architectures for all they are worth with little investment in
making significant improvements in their bread & butter products as long as
their are no viable competitors.  I believe we are moving into a period
where competition against Intel will be relatively weak.

Cisco has so thoroughly dominated several markets that I know of many large
corporations that won't buy anything except Cisco products, much in the
same way most large companies purchase Microsoft products for their
business desktops.  In a lot of IS departments, its a matter of "No one
ever got fired for buying Cisco products" mentality.  Having personally
used networking products from several companies, I don't see an inherent
superiority in most of Cisco's products, but their market presence is hard
to avoid, let alone compete with.  For many people "Cisco" is synonymous
with "internetworking".  Short of Cisco *seriously* fumbling the ball
(something I do not think will happen), they should remain THE dominant
company in this market.

There is no such general legal doctrine recognized by any court in the US.
The words themselves come from a Supreme Court case having to do with the
first amendment, where it was ruled that a clear and present danger of
violence could justify restricting speech (the "fighting words" exception).
The Supreme Court has ruled many times (for example, in U.S. v Nixon on
the matter of his ignoring the subpoena of his tapes) that the executive
branch cannot arbitrarily use "National Security" at its own discretion to
violate Constitutional rights.

Of course, that's the "official" position of the court.  The reality of
course is that they have a bigger army than you do.  And law, after all,
is a matter of what gets enforced by the ones with guns, not what happens
to be written somewhere.

We can't yet say they "do" rotate or anything else, because we can't
yet say they in fact exist; black holes, though they are on the old
conventional well-accepted end of speculation, are still speculation.
In all cases, though, they are not a "mathematical point" as you
describe.  They have mass, charge, and angular momentum.  In this
"normal" configuration, the singlularity is a point at the center of
the spherical mass.  In this state, rotation is not sufficient to
produce any of the truly bizarre spatio-temporal effects claimed of
toroidial ones.  There is also, of course, no model even in the realm
of speculation for any process that might create a toroidial or other
non-ideal black hole.

I was under the impression that Alcubierre had published his initial

Light never goes any faster or slower than light speed unless it is
stopped dead in its tracks by  hitting solid matter. What happens to it
is that its wavelength, or frequency changes. Short wavelengths have a
lot of energy in them, while long wavelengths  have little energy. As
light is pulled into a black hole, it gains energy as it falls. Since it
can't speed up, its frequency merely goes higher and higher. A black
hole has a deep enough gravity well that light generated inside the
black hole, by the time it reaches the inside edge of the event horizon,
has lost ALL of its energy, so the photon dissapears. Likewize, light
entering the black hole's event horizon from other sources gains energy,
and is bent in a trajectory. The event horizon is described as the
altitude above the black hole at which the most energetic visible light
is bent so much that it is trapped in orbit around the black hole. This
is the true event horizon. There is also an apparent event horizon which
is merely caused by the lensing effects the gravity field has on laght
passing by the black hole, outside the event horizon, which varies in
relationship to the distance of the observer from the hole. The farther
away you are from the hole, the bigger the apparent event horizon seems
to be. As you approach the hole, the apparent event horizon shrinks in
size.

FUrthermore, the National Security Act has classified provisions that
purportedly have this country secretly in a state of martial law until
the communist threat to the US has ended. Cuba, North Korea, and Commie
(right!) China are the justification for maintaining this. This is why
you can be shot for walking on certain public lands in Nevada by
contractors of the AEC, ENergy Dept, and the USAF, and why former
employees of Area 51 were thrown out of court when they tried to sue the
gov't for damages incurred from the open toxic waste and nuclear waste
dumps on the Area 51 site.

Nope...  This effect will increase its frequency, but not its speed.  As it
approaches a BH, it gains energy, given by E = hv (where h is Planck's
constant and v is the frequency).  Since its speed is a constant given by c
= wavelength*frequency, its wavelength will also decrease as it increases
in frequency.  So light will "blueshift" towards shorter wavelengths, but
won't increase in speed.

Intel's P/E is less than Cisco's and about half of Microsoft's, in fact it's 
not much higher than the average stock, but I think Intel's future is much 
brighter than the average company.
              

        >I have trouble seeing the PC market growing substantially,
                 

Well, the vast majority of people on this planet don't have a PC of any sort. 
Someday they will.


        >I see signs that many people are buying lower cost PC's when they do        
        >eventually buy.


I agree that under $1000 PC's are becoming more popular, it's because they 
can do most of the thing most people want done, or they think they can, 
however I don't think lack of demand will be a long term problem for Intel, 
so when the stock sold off a few weeks ago I bought some.


        >I don't see anything sparking a drive towards P2's by the public,        
        >either.  Windows 98 will run fine on a Pentium with enough RAM & HD.        
        >Excel, Word, et cetera.
              

In the short term I think voice recognition will be Intel's savior,  
especially when it gets integrated with common software, that's gota eat up a 
lot of clock cycles. In the longer term the solution is virtual reality, 
it never seems to  have enough processing power to make people happy.
                 

        >[I don't see] Intel's market share (>90% ?) growing. 
                 

I think that in the next 4 or 5 years Intel will dominate not only the 
hardware of PCs as it does mow but also of that of workstations, mainframes 
and, thanks to the Open MP standard, even super computers. RISC technology is 
10 years old now and it's running out of ideas, yes CISC is even older and 
dumber, but that's not the point, the point is IA-64. Intel's new IA- 64
architecture really does seem better than anything the RISC people came up 
with, and even if it was not, Intel has the critical mass to make it a 
standard, something the smaller RISC companies could not do. RISC may be able 
to hang on for a while with an inferior technology, just as Intel did with 
x86, but they can't survive indefinitely because they don't have the huge
installed base that Intel had.  

HP, Compaq, Dell, IBM, Bull, NCR, Sequent, Stratus, Hitachi, and Unisys have 
all said they will go with IA-64. Digital says they will stand behind their
Alpha chip, but they also say they will make an entire IA-64 line, so despite 
what they say I'm skeptical of Digital's commitment to Alpha and I think 
potential customers will be skeptical too. Silicon Graphics is singing the 
exact same song, but if their MIPS chip is so wonderful why are they making 
IA-64 machines, and will they really be willing to match Intel's research and 
development dollars to keep MIPS competitive? I doubt it.

Only pathological Intel (and Microsoft) hater Sun says they will never, ever, 
ever, make a IA-64 machine, but they admit they're porting Solaris to IA-64. 
Why? Deep down even Sun knows they will have to face reality someday, they 
can't fight the entire world.

That's exactly what Intel plans to do with MMX2, but probably not until early 
1999.

In the name of honesty I should tell you that I could be wrong, I've been 
wrong before, I thought RISC would kill Intel and like a moron sold my Intel 
stock 10 years ago.

Oddly, no, light orbiting a black hole is some distance beyond the
event horison.  Scientific American had an interesting article on this 
and some other peculiar near-hole physics a year or two back.  At the
event horizon, light ends up in the hole no matter what direction it's
going.

Really, its rather obvious that light, and other EM radiation, at energy
levels too low to at least maintain orbit would fall in, so, the event
horizon is actually relative to the observers particular visible
spectrum. One could say the event horizon is a whole region of orbits.
High energy EM radiation would obviously have a much lower event horizon
than low energy radiation. Since EM radiation has no upper bounds in
terms of frequency, this means that for at least SOME radiation, the
event horizon only exists at the "surface" of the blackhole, i.e. the
singularity. At this point we then are dealing with infinity and near
infinity mathematics. Of course, this is also relative to the black
hole's mass. Large mass black holes will have a much higher terminal
frequency than small black holes.

Light follow geodesics in space-time that have no relation to its energy/
frequency/whatever.  The circular light orbit around a black hole is the
same regardless of what kind of light it orbiting.

Inside the "light orbit" orbiting around the hole makes you fall in 
*faster*.  This is one of the peculiar aspects of near-hole space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Conspiracy theories certainly are sexy at the moment. Linda Thompson,
the American lawyer who is the public spokesperson for the so-called
militias, the people in the backwoods of America who think Bill
Clinton is trying to usher in an America Reich, got half an hour on
BBC TV last autumn. Look at the impact of 'The X Files'. I've been
contacted by five or six TV companies in the past six months - two
last week - all interested in making programmes about conspiracy
theories. I even got a call from the Big Breakfast Show, from a
researcher who had no idea who I was, asking me if I'd like to appear
on it. He'd seen me billed as speaking here. The first thing of
consequence that he asked me was: "What is the weirdest conspiracy
theory you've come across recently?" He wanted me to appear on this
wacky morning show and tell the viewers something wacky.

I said, I didn't think I was quite what the Big Breakfast was looking
for. He asked me what kind of magazine 'Lobster' was. (He'd never
heard of it, of course.) I said it had no pictures and that I'd once
published an article in it about the Moonies and the Korean CIA,
which had two hundred and sixty two footnotes, citing work in five
languages. I could hear his interest waning. I sent him a few copies
of 'Lobster' anyway; and - guess what? - he never called back.

Compare and contrast this situation with, say, 1963. Who was
interested in conspiracy theories in 1963? In the UK, a handful of
disgruntled racist Tories - the League of Empire Loyalists - and
little groups of Hitler lovers clinging to the old Jewish banking,
world domination myth. In the US, the John Birch Society and a
handful of old time anti-Semites and American Hitler freaks.
Conspiracy theories were out on the margin of the margins in 1963.
Last year - was it? - on 'The X Files', one of the FBI agents
dismissed someone as "one of the people who believe Elvis is dead".
(Or so I have been told; I've never watched an entire episode of 'The
X Files'.)

These days we've got conspiracy theories everywhere; and about almost
everything.


CONSPIRACIES WITHOUT EVIDENCE

Here are a few choice examples from the last few months - this is the
stuff the Big Breakfast show wanted to hear about.

Two conspiracy theory books about the OJ Simpson case appeared in the
Tom Davis catalogue in December. In the interesting one, the Davis
catalogue summary says, the FBI blacklisted bar applicants - i.e.
would-be lawyers - because of anti-war activities. Unemployed for
years, these unemployed lawyers assassinated Nicole Simpson and
framed OJ Simpson to compel the FBI to disclose the blacklist. Only
in America, with one million lawyers, the home of the lawyer joke,
would someone imagine a murderous cabal of unemployed lawyers!

Nearer to home (but nearly as far off the planet) somebody called
Michael Todd, who lives in Selby, in Yorkshire, for a mere #95, is
offering to provide evidence of a world-wide conspiracy called
Operation PELT, with a secret HQ in Ireland and thirty offices
world-wide. The aim of PELT, by the way, is to destroy the entire
alternative movement; health, green, eco etc. I wrote asking for
evidence, but did not get a reply.

The Administrator of the anti-fluoride, National Pure Water
Association wrote to me suggesting that the reason for the
vilification of Yorkshire Water in the summer and autumn of last
year, was Yorkshire Water's refusal to add fluoride to their water.
She wrote: "Much of the persecution of that Company this year -
leaks, dry reservoirs etc. - is, we are sure, orchestrated
`punishment' for their decision." I wrote asking her for evidence,
but received no reply.

A UFO buff I know slightly tried to persuade me that the US has a
secret base built under Loch Lomond in Scotland, from which emerge
mysterious craft. (The UFOs as underwater craft is one of the minor
themes amongst UFO theories.) Why, said I, would they put such a base
under the single most popular tourist spot in the west of Scotland,
visited every day by hundreds, if not thousands of people?

The difficulty - or the delight - for people like me is that buried
in the stupid nonsense there is something of interest in almost all
of these fields. There surely isn't a US base under Loch Lomond, and
there surely isn't a secret conspiracy between the ET greys and the
US government; and there surely aren't millions of Americans being
kidnapped and sexually assaulted by aliens.

But - a big but - this doesn't mean that the entire UFO thing can be
rationally written off as nonsense, hallucinations or whatever. There
are now too many video tapes of strange things in the sky to add to
the many reports from sensible, rational people. (The ubiquitous
camcorder may yet resolve lots of this for us.)

The anti-fluoride case, after years of being on the crank list is
creeping into the mainstream. Even 'Covert Action', the very serious,
American, neo-Marxist, anti-imperialist, spy-watching journal has
published an article on the fluoride issue (something that would have
been unimaginable five years ago). The damage done to the
anti-fluoride case by Sterling Hayden's portrait in 'Dr Strangelove'
of the crazed US base commander, obsessed with the communist
conspiracy to pollute America's precious bodily fluids, is being
overcome, albeit slowly.


IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY, BUT ...

But once you make that initial move of trying to deal with these
areas rationally, it gets very difficult very quickly. One of the
subjects generating conspiracy theories at the moment is that which
is now called mind control. We know that the CIA et al, and their
Soviet counterparts, were busy in the fifties and sixties looking for
a means of controlling the human mind. Drugs, hypnosis - even one or
two little US projects, still not disclosed, which seemed to be
interested in electromagnetic fields. But there are now hundreds of
people, in Europe and in the USA - I know someone dealing with
seventy such cases in the USA - claiming to have been mind
controlled; some claim to have implants in their head, or their body;
they are being bombarded by energy weapons of some kind; they are
being controlled. Timothy McVeigh, the alleged Oklahoma bomber,
claims to have an implant in his body. I have photocopies of X-rays
which appear to show something in some individuals in Sweden. Brain
scans are now available in home-pages on the Net, apparently showing
the same sort of thing. There are now agencies in the USA which, for
a large amount of money, will debug your body. Used to be your house
or office or car; now its your body. They will check you out - and
remove, if necessary - bugs, implants, chips, whatever. I've got the
written statements of half a dozen or more such victims in this
country. I have been corresponding with, and have met, two people who
tell me they hear voices in their head - the voices of teams of
psychologists and intelligence personnel monkeying around with their
brains. I could just say, they're paranoid schizophrenics - one of
the classic symptoms of which is hearing voices in your head. Except
that (a) I've known some schizophrenics and these two men don't seem
like schizos to me; and (b) more importantly, the technology to do
what they claim is being done to them may exist. As far back as 1962
an American scientist called Alan Frey demonstrated that, using a
microwave beam, you could transmit sounds - words - into the head of
an individual that were inaudible to other people. A Freedom of
Information application by Jane Affleck produced a document from
1970, a report published by the Office of Technological Utilization
in NASA called 'Implantable Biotelemetry Systems' - implants, in
short. Twenty five years ago they had them down to the size of a 5p
piece. This 1970 report shows them, even gives wiring diagrams. Now,
twenty five years later, some of them are practically invisible, like
a strand of hair.

I don't mean I believe that there are people with implants; I have
not yet seen any convincing evidence of this. Photocopies of X-rays
don't quite make it. And even if there are such people, even if
somebody turns up with evidence that can't be ignored, it is a long
step from the existence of implants to the remarkable things claimed
for them. How would an implant in your teeth, say, control your
thoughts? But given the technology that existed in 1970, it is simply
not possible to dismiss this stuff out of hand. No, it doesn't seem
likely. But would you really be surprised to learn that the CIA or
some other branch of the US government (or its NATO allies) were
doing random tests of this technology? That's what they did with
various nerve agents and LSD in the fifties - just sprayed it round
to see what happened. And, after all, if NATO scientists are trying
out microwave weapons or mind entrainment devices, these kinds of
tests have the most perfect cover of all: no-one will believe the
victims.

Similar difficulties arise with the various conspiracy theories now 
surrounding the Oklahoma bombing. It doesn't seem likely to me that 
the Federal government did blow up the building themselves to give 
them a pretext to clamp down on the militias, as some on the right 
are now suggesting; or that the explosion was caused by a stray US 
missile as some others claim. But given what we know the US military 
and intelligence services have done in the past twenty five years, 
and given the incompetence of the military, these can't be instantly 
dismissed either.


FACT AND FANTASY

Nonetheless, most of the conspiracy theories floating around are
crap; there is no evidence, and when evidence is offered, the
evidence is crap. But why is this stuff on the increase? Why, after
producing 'Lobster' for thirteen years have I now been asked to
address this august if slightly cranky assembly? [See front page
notes - ed.] One factor is the increasing availability of computer
technology. I first began to notice conspiracy theories in the late
1970s as a by-product of getting interested in the Kennedy
assassination. In those days getting a decent-looking magazine
together was expensive. You had to pay for typesetting. The fringe
mags looked like fringe mags. These days about #700 will buy computer
kit with which you can turn out an imitation of the 'Wall Street
Journal' if you want to; and with a fax machine you can spread it
round the world. There has been an increase in conspiracy theories;
but its also that those that exist are getting round much faster than
they used to.

Another factor is the increasing difficulty people have in working
out what is real and what is not. In the USA Mrs and Mrs Joe Sixpack
are faced with thirty, sixty, a hundred and twenty cable channels of
TV putting out varieties of piffle at best; tabloid papers like the
'National Enquirer' and all its imitators in supermarkets putting out
honest-to-god inventions as `news'; endless right-wing radio talk
shows pumping out nonsensical conspiracy theories about the evils of
liberalism. The chances are very high that the Sixpacks haven't read
a book of any kind in the previous year - maybe not since they left
school. And the Sixpacks may have been born again: America is a
profoundly religious society. People who believe in God and the
Devil, people who are waiting for "rapture", haven't that far to go
to believe that the sky at night is swarming with UFOs looking for
people to abduct and experiment on.

The claim that people are finding it harder to distinguish between
fantasy and reality is difficult to sustain and is always poo-poohed
by people in the garbage media who claim that people know, for
example, that the 'Daily Sport' or the 'National Enquirer' are not
meant to be taken seriously. But I'm not so sure. The 'Sunday
Telegraph' of 4th February this year carried a story about a
policeman in London who was psychic. The policeman concerned was
quoted as saying: "At first my colleagues in the police force thought
it was all a bit odd. But since the BBC programme 'The X Files', many
have given it a lot more credence." But 'The X Files' is fiction.

I have seen the explosion in conspiracy theories attributed to the
approach of the millennium. Maybe it has some effect on some of the
religious groups, but the average citizen doesn't seem to me to give
a toss about the millennium. Me neither. It'll just be like New
Year's Eve with more drinking and better fireworks, and back to work,
and endless TV programmes looking back over the century. I'll bet
they're busy making them now.


A VAST MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

Another factor in the rise of conspiracy theories is the existence of
real conspiracies in recent US history. Look at American history
since 1963: the assassination of the Kennedys, Dr King, most of the
Black Panther leadership and Jimmy Hoffa; the shooting of Governor
George Wallace. The revelation of CIA plots against foreign leaders.
Massive domestic surveillance and disruption programs by the FBI and
CIA. The CIA shipping opium in Laos and Vietnam, organising forty,
fifty thousand assassinations in Vietnam under the Phoenix programme;
tens of thousand more in Indonesia. Secret wars all round the globe
trying to police the US empire. All this began to emerge in the 1960s
after the destruction of the Warren Commission Report on the
assassination of JFK and the revelations continued through the 1970s
as part of the spin-off from Watergate. Since the advent of
Republican administrations in the eighties we've had Irancontra; the
October Surprise; the clandestine arming of Iraq; billions of dollars
ripped-off from the Savings and Loan banks; hundreds of thousand of
corpses in Central America - including a few American nuns - created
by death squad regimes working as US proxy governments. A vast
military-industrial-intelligence complex - everything President
Eisenhower warned America of in his farewell speech in 1960 - totally
beyond democratic control, gobbling up hundreds of billions of
dollars.

Added to which, with Clinton and the Democrats in office, the
Republican Party and its allies on the right are churning out
conspiracy theories about Clinton. Some of these, about his role in
the leasing of Arkansas to the CIA and the Reagan White House to run
guns into Central America and cocaine back, seem to be true, or
true-ish. The rest, especially the paranoia about Clinton trying to
engineer an American Reich, suspending elections and putting the US
under UN control, strike me as dotty in the extreme. Some of it looks
political pay-back; the right having their revenge for the long line
of Republican disasters beginning with Watergate and Nixon which were
exploited - however incompetently - by the Democrats.

The cumulative effect of all this is that some redneck yahoo in the
boondocks, with his weapons, a year's supply of canned food and
Pepsi, his AppleMac and his fax machine can say: "Hey, buddy, don't
tell me I'm paranoid, all right? Look at what we know the
sons-of-bitches in Washington have done already! And that's just the
bits we know about."

So: why are we getting more conspiracy theories? Technology,
AppleMacs and faxes, information overload; the whole buttressed by
what I'm still willing to call the objective reality of US political
practice. Looked at another way: here we are in Uncle McCluhan's
global village; and what is village life like? Word of mouth, rumour,
gossip - most of it inaccurate. Maybe conspiracy theories are just
the gossip of the global village.

If I am talking mostly about America it is because America seems to
be the source of most of this nonsense. I could be wrong. It may be
that since I don't read any foreign language news sources or watch
other countries' TV, I am simply unaware of, say, Austrian conspiracy
theory culture; or Taiwanese. There are a lot of conspiracy theories
on the right of Japanese politics, including some bizarre
anti-Semitic theories - bizarre because there are no Jews in Japan.
And there is clearly an upsurge of anti-Jewish theories in the former
Soviet Union and its empire; but anti-Semitism has been there since
the last century that I know of, and probably centuries earlier. But
as far as Britain is concerned this stuff is mostly coming across the
Atlantic. And it's mostly coming from white people.

There are some black conspiracy theories. Some of the black American
religious sub-cultures apparently believed that Reagan had "666", the
mark of the beast, tattooed on the back of his skull, under his hair;
others believe that the distribution of heroin among the black
population to a plot by the government to keep black Americans down.
This is a sort of progenitor of the theory that AIDS was a biological
warfare experiment which escaped. Joshua Nkomo in Zimbabwe was
expounding this thesis in early April - his son died of Aids - with
the twist that it was a germ warfare experiment designed by whites to
kill blacks. (This Aids-as-germ-warfare-run- amok theory came from
the Soviet Union; the KGB ran it through various third world media in
revenge for the CIA conspiracy theory which blamed the KGB, through
the Bulgarians, for the attempt to assassinate the Pope.) There are
many other black conspiracy theories - enough to fill a book this
year by an American academic. But mostly it's white folk churning
this stuff out; at any rate its white folk's theories which are
getting the attention in the white-dominated mass media. And that is
the clue.


"WHO'S BEHIND THIS?"

For it seems to me that the underlying cause of the explosion in
conspiracy theories is the decline of the US empire. The American
dream is faltering; at best, wage rates are no higher than they were
twenty years ago for many of the working class. For many they are
lower. There are said to be eighty thousand homeless people on the
streets of Chicago. The gap between the top strata in the US and the
bottom is wider than it has been since the war, and getting wider
every year. Things are not going according to plan for many white
Americans, and they need to explain this to themselves.

You can see the change reflected in the accounts of encounters with
Extra Terrestrials. In the 1950s, when the US empire was booming, and
Mr and Mrs Average White American consumer was being fed a relentless
diet of stories predicting ever-increasing material prosperity, the
Extra Terrestrials reportedly contacting the America citizen, were
largely - but not wholly - benign. Now the US empire is falling apart
and sections of the big American cities are turning into a reasonable
facsimile of the set of 'Blade Runner', the skies over American at
night are apparently bustling with hundreds of thousands of Alien
Rapists, beaming down into peoples' bedrooms.

But since only two per cent of Americans have read a book in the last
year, and their primary source of information, the TV, does not deal
with such issues, the ability of most of them to explain something as
complicated as the economic decline of a great power is limited.

And there is a psychological dimension: so deeply ingrained is the
myth of America, the country of manifest destiny, the shining torch
of freedom, democracy and the American way, the land of the brave and
the home of the free, that most Americans seem to find it hard,
verging on impossible, to believe that there is something wrong with
the system. But if the system is fine, and things are going wrong,
the problems are being caused by ... bad people.

Somebody's to blame! Somebody's behind this!

This is the approach of the most visible conspiracy theorist in the
UK today, David Icke, erstwhile TV sports presenter and green
activist, who lost his TV job for supporting the Green Party. Icke's
a good-looking guy and he's been on TV, and that's enough for lots of
people, I suspect. David lectures; they turn up, give him a fiver to
get in. There's an Icke video, David recorded talking in a theatre in
Liverpool. Icke lines up all our discontents; lists all the terrible
things that are being done to the planet and the catastrophe
approaching. That takes about fifteen minutes. He then asks the
audience, not "What is the cause or causes of this?", but "Who is
behind this?" Once you ask that question, you're off into uncharted
territory. His answer is a mish-mash of American conspiracy theories
about semi-clandestine groups like the Trilateral Commission, the
Council on Foreign Relations; and to that he adds a smattering of
ufology's greatest hits - Majestic 12, the alliance with the Greys;
and old chestnuts like the Illuminati. Like many of his American
sources, Icke's methodology is, roughly: if it's in print it must be
true.


"CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE ALWAYS WRONG"

The difficulty for a naive empiricist or rationalist like me is that
in a sense the people who are currently producing and recycling all
the rubbish about global conspiracies, the David Ickes and William
Coopers of this world, are right. But only in a sense. Some of the
world's politics and economics is influenced - but not controlled -
by little groups of people. The Bilderberg Group does exist, does
meet. The Trilateral Commission does exist, does meet occasionally
and discuss a new world order. After all, these are the guardians of
capital, and disorder is what they don't want. Global investment
likes order. There are bankers ripping us off - but few of them are
Jewish. David Icke and the many Americans from whom he has adopted
these ideas, have a little nugget of truth there, but thanks to the
way they use it, they contaminate the subject matter and unwittingly
play into the hands of the very people they think they are opposing.

For most of the chattering classes - the media and knowledge
industry, academics, politicians and their assistants - the epithet
`conspiracy theorist' is the kiss of death. One of the bed-rocks of
the ideology of liberal democracies is that conspiracy theories are
always wrong, and those who espouse them are mental incompetents at
best. This unquestioned belief usually manifests itself in the
endless genuflections like this: "of course I'm not a believer in the
conspiracy theory of history", or: "as usual the cock-up theory of
politics turned out to be true". Indeed, I would say that the
espousal of the belief in the cock-up or coincidence theory of
history is at the heart of what passes for political and intellectual
sophistication in liberal democracies.

This is understandable up to a point. Who wants to be associated with
nutters who believe the world's being run by a cabal of American
politicians and extra-terrestrials? Or the Masons? What irritates me,
however, is that this legitimate allergy to mega conspiracy theories
extends much further than the crazy fringe to a general prohibition
on conspiracies. And this is very strange, because it is blindingly
obvious - is it not? - that political parties, for example, are
intrinsically conspiratorial. Routine internal party politics is a
network of interlocking cabals plotting how to get their hands on
this group, committee, caucus meeting, council, party, pressure
group. It is only a slight exaggeration to say, as Carl Oglesby did
in the early 1970s, that conspiracy is normal politics. Yet this idea
would produce everything from outrage to patronising shakes of the
head from almost all intellectual and political circles in this
country. "Really, old boy, the world just isn't like that."

I met this view of the world on my first visit the Newsnight office
in 1986. I was then trying to persuade the media to take seriously
the allegations of Colin Wallace about anti-Labour activities by the
intelligence services in the 1970s. Wallace was then still in prison
- he was framed on a manslaughter charge. I had written to him and
mentioned that I would be visiting Newsnight and Wallace wrote back
warning me that up in the higher reaches of the BBC was a man called
Alan Protheroe, who was an asset of the British secret state and who
knew Wallace and what Wallace had been up to in Northern Ireland in
1974. When I met the Newsnight journalist who was interested in
Wallace and was proposing to interview him when he came out of
prison, I said "Wallace says watch out for Protheroe. He thinks he
will ky-bosh your interview."

I got the patronising smile of the higher media who know everything:
"Oh come on, the BBC isn't like that." What happened? Wallace was
interviewed, and Protheroe blocked its transmission. The BBC then
denied that the interview had ever taken place. About a year later it
was revealed that M15 actually had an office inside the BBC from
which it vetted applicants for BBC jobs.


HOW THE IDEOLOGY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY DENIES REALITY

The belief that our society "just isn't like that" is a part of the
ideology of liberal democracy, which I identify as the concept of
pluralism. This is mostly what's taught in Anglo-American
universities. The last time I took a look at it, British academic
politics was still wrestling with the discovery that interest and
pressure groups intrude into the model of Westminster party politics.
But the problem with `pluralism' is that it is essentially empty,
merely telling us that many groups in society have some power. The
interesting questions begin where pluralism stops.

A real world perspective - what I would call a parapolitical
perspective - on the other hand, takes it for granted that there are
clandestine influences at work in society. Not the ridiculous,
world-controlling conspiracies like the Masons, or the Illuminati, or
other such nonsense, but more mundane things like intelligence
agencies manipulating domestic and international politics; companies
buying government policies by making anonymous donations to the Tory
Party etc. It became absurd to deny the existence of large-scale
political conspiracies, of powerful `hidden forces', as soon as the
existence of the CIA - or KGB or SIS - was revealed. The interesting
questions, the rational questions, are not: Are there such things as
covert influences - conspiracies - in political or social life?, but:
Given that there manifestly are such things, where are they? Whose
are they? How important are they? How can we tell fantasy from
reality? And - I would argue - how do we put a stop to them?

Simple empirical observation says conspiracy is a very common form of
political behaviour. The mysterious thing is not that some poor
deluded fools insist on seeing conspiracies, but how it is that, for
so long, so many otherwise apparently intelligent people - most of
Anglo-American political science, for example - have, until very
recently, managed not to notice that conspiracy is an everyday and
rather important part of the phenomena they purport to be studying.
Let me give a couple of examples. Since its formation in the 1920s
until its demise about five years ago, the Economic League collected
and spent, in today's money, millions of pounds every year working
against the British left. It may have spent as much as the
Conservative Party since World War I. Yet there was not one academic
essay about the Economic League between its formation and 1980. Not
one in sixty years. No account of British domestic politics in the
twentieth century can be anything but hopelessly incomplete without
incorporating the Economic League, but I have never seen one that
does.

Academic American history somehow manages to skip over the fact that
in a five year period in the sixties one President, the probable next
President, and the most important black leader since the war were
victims of assassinations which were never investigated properly and
remain unsolved.

Not that it's difficult to explain why this odd situation has
prevailed for so long. Britain has been run for most of this century
by two intensely secretive, overlapping groups; one is the British
state, about which we know almost nothing - especially its secret
branches - about which even MPs are not allowed to ask questions. And
the other is the Conservative Party, about which even its members
know almost nothing of how it is run or who funds it. In the US,
since the war, a group of government agencies, with their satellite
supply companies, headed by the CIA and the Pentagon, have been
operating largely in secret, and very profitably, too. God knows it's
hard sometimes to show the links between ideology and interests, but
in these instances it looks pretty straightforward to me. The most
powerful interests in Britain and the US don't want their
conspiratorial activities examined; and gee whiz, it turns out that
being interested in conspiracies is intellectually forbidden in both
societies.

Of course there's one obvious exception to the official prohibition
on interest in conspiracies. Since 1918 we have all been officially
encouraged to believe in the existence of one conspiracy: the red
menace. In Britain the most significant recent conspiracy theorists
were the cold warriors, who pumped out endless theories of Soviet
espionage and subversion in this country since the war. Mrs Thatcher
was one of those. She looked at the Trades Union Congress - at Uncle
Jack Jones, one of the nicest and most decent people who ever existed
- and saw Moscow subversion. And to ensure that we believed in the
reality of this approved conspiracy theory, the Anglo-American
intelligence services, the outstanding example of institutionalised
conspiracies in the twentieth century, have spent a ton of money -
your money - propagating it, while denigrating anybody who turned up
with any other kind of conspiracy. This hypocrisy reached some kind
of peak in the late 1960s when the CIA - a vast world-wide conspiracy
- put out a message to all its stations and personnel about the
Kennedy Assassination. The instruction from Langley was that they
were to use their political and media assets to put out the line that
the kind of conspiracy described by the Warren Commission critics
could not possibly exist!

Four years before this comic event the CIA's relationship with the
Warren Commission investigating JFK's assassination was handled by
the late James Jesus Angleton, head of CIA counter-intelligence. He
believed, among other things, that the split between the Soviet and
Chinese communist parties (up to and including a shooting war on
their borders) was a disinformation campaign to lull the west into a
false sense of security. There are still people on the fringe of the
UK-US intelligence services who believe the collapse of the Soviet
empire in the last decade has been a deception operation.


THE CONSPIRACIES WHICH ARE THE STATE

My interest in conspiracies, not conspiracy theories, is political.
As well as being a naive empiricist, I am also a naive democrat. I
believe that the political process should be open, transparent. I
don't like secrecy, and that means I don't like conspiracies. Be it
the Trotskyist groups trying to enter the Labour Party; be it the
foot soldiers of MI5 and Special Branch trying to conjure up a new
enemy to keep themselves in work; be it companies bribing
governments. And, yes, be it the Masonic networks in the police,
local government, the state etc. The Masons are significant, though a
Mason I met recently told me that their membership in Britain was
falling; it's just that they don't - and never did - run the world.
The important conspiracies we should be looking at are those run by
the state - in this benighted country we might say the conspiracies
which are the state.

The garbage we are now getting so much of, the global conspiracy
baloney, is simply background noise, a distraction. Anthony Summers,
the British investigator and writer, summed up the position very
well: he said he wasn't interested in conspiracy theories, but he was
interested in theories about conspiracies.

Six years ago I wrote a piece about this subject - I was thinking of
Britain, not the US. We were then in the aftermath of three years of
revelations of official conspiracies, generated by the 'Spycatcher'
episode and the related revelations of Colin Wallace about the
attempts by the British and American intelligence and security
services to undermine the Wilson government. I concluded that piece
thus:

"As a concept `conspiracy' would be of little interest or explanatory
value were it not for the defensive refusal of our chattering classes
to acknowledge its legitimacy. We can only look forward to the day
when the term has lost the connotations it has at the moment and
rationality finally prevails. Meanwhile, with our eyes and ears open,
we `naive empiricists' just have to get on with trying to understand
the nature of political and historical reality."

And I will be doing this long after the mass media have moved on from
the X Files agenda of the moment to something else equally trivial.

True enough. And the holdovers of the "clear and present danger" test
have been largely declawed even in terms of "fighting words." In
_Brandenberg v. Ohio_ the court excludes from first amendment protection
speech "likely to incite or produce" imminent unlawful action. This is
arguably similar in application (if not language) to the "clear and
present danger" test in _Schenk v. U.S._ which excludes from first
amendment protection any speech which creates a "clear and present
danger" of "substantive evil" of the kind which Congress has the right
to proscribe. Fortunately _Brandenberg_ eviscerates its test with an
intent requirement, making the current state of the law relatively
pro-free speech. However (to be realistic), the Supreme Court always
seems to be the most willing to protect free speech at the times when
such protection is the least necessary (during peace-time, economic
boom, etc.)

As Lee Daniel Crocker pointed out, black holes are not points. They
are a pattern of spacetime, and rotates in all physically reasonable
models. A simple way of testing if a black hole rotates (and how fast)
is to drop a small object from towards it. If the object begins to
deviate from a straight fall, then the hole rotates and the deviation
and direction of deviation can be used to calculate the angular
momentum.

I think there are some popular explanations of this in Pickover's
_Black Holes: A Travellers Guide_. There is also (of course) a more
detailled treatment in Misner, Thorne, Wheeler's _Gravity_.

Thanks for al the replies you've sent us! 
We have started our selection proces and will start screening names with
the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in a few days. As soon as we have made our
final choice the winner of a $100 Electroninc gift certificate from Amazon
Books.

During the next daysWe'll change the name of our site, the URL, the logo
(somewhat), register the new Transhumanist Society and start actively
promoting our organisation.

In spite of having not sought the media untill now we've already received
several invitations for TV-appearances, radio and a series of interviews by
a cultural magazine 'DutcH'. The latter was started last saturday when we
discussed our ideas with a journalist for several hours (great fun for
everyone involved!). When we get a draft of the article I'll make a
translation and post it to the list, problably the journalists will also
have a look at the ExI-site, Homo Excelsior and Aleph.


Greetings,
Arjen

May I add that without different ideas, without exchanges of view, without

I'm currently reading the Ultimate Resource 2nd edition by Julian
Simon.  This is one of the books on Max's top ten to read list.  One of
the main themes of this book is that the benefits of a larger population
generating more new ideas and different perspectives, generally out
weigh the associated increase in congestion.  It seems to me that this
principle would apply equally well to this list.

I had written:

Hmm, lemme dust off the back of this envelope...

 ~1E10 neurons, ~1E13 synapses
 say a synapse needs a 10 bytes of memory and 1E2 calculations per second.
 That's 1E14 bytes and 1E15 ops/sec (not necessarily floating point).

 To the nearest power of 10, workstation-class computers have
 ~1E8 bytes and ~1E9 ops/sec.

 So both the memory and the speed would have a factor of a million to go.
 If speed only increases by a factor of 10 each decade (2Mhz in 1977 vs.
 200 today?) that's 60 years!

 But if memory goes up 1000 each decade that's there in about 20 years...
 2017.

 If you use multiple computers (say, 1000 PC's, 30 years from now) to
 increase the speed, there's a networking issue.  Worst case, each
 neuron has tentacles going everywhere and each computer has to receive
 1E10 x 1E2Hz or 1000Ghz.  Best case, each neuron transmits locally and to
 one other computer (out of 1000) , and each would have to receive 1E9 Hz,
 just 1 Ghz.  But 10Ghz is only 100 to 1000 (depending whether you count
 raw bandwidth or throughput) times the speed of current "Fast Ethernet",
 and if you assume network switches rather than a bus-like net, that's
 only a factor of 10 in speed per decade for the network.

 (Note: according to the memory calculation, you would only need 1/1000
 of a computer's worth of real-estate in 30 years--a fraction of a chip!?)

 But using components specialized for being brains might slow you
 down because it's harder to get chips designed and built than to
 program PCs.  On the other hand, such brain-chips could already have
 become an industry by 2027, used inside insect-robots or spy cameras
 starting a decade earler...

SPACEDEV TO ACQUIRE INTEGRATED SPACE SYSTEMS

December 8, 1997, Steamboat Springs, CO - SpaceDev Chairman, James W.
Benson, announced today the signing of a letter of intent whereby
SpaceDev, a development-stage company, in an exchange of stock, will
acquire 100% of San Diego-based Integrated Space Systems(ISS).  On close
of this transaction, ISS will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceDev
(OTC:PSDM).

The acquisition will bring SpaceDev (www.SpaceDev.Com) closer to its goal
of being the first commercial company to launch a privately financed
spacecraft to scientifically analyze and land on a near earth asteroid as
well as becoming the premier provider of high quality, low cost
space-related consulting, design, planning and support services and
products.

ISS, a rapidly growing, profitable three-year-old aerospace engineering
and technical services firm with estimated sales of $2 million in 1997,
will provide SpaceDev with many of the aerospace engineering skills to
build the Near Earth Asteroid Prospector (NEAP) and to develop future deep
space missions for SpaceDev and its private and government customers.

"Bringing ISS and SpaceDev together is a strategic first step for the
growth of our business. The acquisition of ISS will give SpaceDev
important capabilities in mission and spacecraft design, construction and
testing; space and launch vehicle integration; and ground and mission
control and operations," said Benson. "This acquisition will help move the
mission from concept to reality."

 "The exploration and economic development of space will be a hallmark of
 the 21st century. We believe ISS skills and experience combined with
 SpaceDev's vision is a great business opportunity as well as an exciting
 venture into a new market with unlimited possibilities," said Phil Smith,
 President and Chairman of ISS.

SpaceDev, the world's first commercial space exploration company, intends
to launch the first privately financed spacecraft to visit and land on
another planetary body. NEAP provides the first opportunity for
governments and companies to fly their instruments and experiments through
deep space to an asteroid. SpaceDev intends to sell the data acquired by
its own instruments as a commercial product to a wide variety of
governments and private companies around the world.

The Near Earth Asteroid Prospector, first in a series of SpaceDev
missions, is currently scheduled to carry three of its own instruments to
analyze the asteroid's size, and determine its composition and value. In
addition to these, payload space is available on NEAP for up to six
additional experiments or instruments. A price list outlining the cost for
rides on NEAP was published in November and is available on SpaceDev's
website, www.SpaceDev.Com.

ISS, which employs more than 35 full- and part- time aerospace engineers
and support staff will continue operations in its current San Diego
facility, where SpaceDev plans to tap into the large base of aerospace
expertise in California. The principals of ISS, formerly key program
engineers and designers at General Dynamics, formed ISS when General
Dynamics Space Systems Division was acquired by Martin Marietta in 1994.
ISS engineers have been working as mentors to students at the University
of California, San Diego on the NEAP mission for the past year. SpaceDev's
base of operations will move from Steamboat Springs, CO, to San Diego in
January. 

This news release contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may
vary due to a variety of risk factors, including but not limited to,
execution of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence,
availability of substantial additional financing, dependence on
management, government regulations, successful building and launching of
spacecraft, dependence on outside contractors and other risks generally
associated with a start-up development venture.

Transistor Technology Takes a
                     Quantum Leap
                     by Ilan Greenberg 

                     4:58am  8.Dec.97.PST
                     Isaac Newton wouldn't approve of what Sandia
                     National Laboratories is doing to the tried-and-true
                     transistor. 

                     Conventional transistors are based on classical
                     physics principles, but basic science researchers
                     at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
                     recently demonstrated a new transistor that
                     makes use of quantum theory - specifically, it
                     uses a technique called quantum mechanical
                     tunneling of electrons. 

                     "It's pretty hard to make high-frequency
                     transistors. This is true even after the federal
                     government has pumped millions into funding
                     university research. So considering that context,
                     we're pretty happy with our results," says Jerry
                     Simmons, head of the nanoelectronics group at
                     Sandia. 

                     Called the Double Electron Layer Tunneling
                     Transistor, or DELTT, the three-terminal quantum
                     transistor is considered a breakthrough in
                     transistor design because quantum tunneling
                     leapfrogs current transistor technology in terms of
                     its extremely high speed. The transistor will be
                     capable of blistering speeds by relying on a single
                     quantum transition between two electron states,
                     something traditional transistors are unable to do. 

                     Quantum tunneling can also allow the same
                     integrated circuit functions to be achieved with far
                     fewer transistors. And because the transistor only
                     needs existing nanotechnology to build its
                     atomically precise two-dimensional layers of
                     electrons - a new level of miniaturization for
                     transistors - the DELTT is expected one day to be
                     reliably manufactured in large numbers using
                     existing semiconductor production facilities, a
                     challenge long thought to be a limitation with
                     quantum transistor design. Manufacturing the
                     quantum transistor is years in the future, however. 

                     "Right now it's a research device. We've only
                     demonstrated it in the past year," says Simmons.
                     "I don't want to get in there worrying about
                     production yield - it's my function to demonstrate
                     that it's worthwhile to move it into the next stage." 

                     Simmons expects the device to work at room
                     temperature by the end of next year, but even then
                     it may be several more years before the
                     technology is ready for production. "A real chip
                     needs a million working transistors, and thus
                     extremely high yields. We're on our way, but there
                     still are obstacles to commercialization, and I
                     can't say when it will actually be manufactured,"
                     he says. 

                     Regardless of its manufacturing timeline,
                     transistor researchers who have examined the
                     fundamental research behind the chip say Sandia
                     has produced a major advance in electronic
                     design. 

                     "This is a premier piece of research," says Paul
                     Berger, associate professor of electrical and
                     computer engineering at the University of
                     Delaware. "I've seen some of these things before,
                     but nothing with this kind of complexity and
                     sophistication. We're going to have to look for
                     alternative ways of computation, and this quantum
                     transistor is certainly noteworthy and needs to be
                     addressed." 

                     Future applications for the quantum transistor
                     include cellular phones and eventually desktop
                     CPUs, Simmons says. Ultimately, Simmons
                     hopes the transistor will find itself in three broad
                     categories of devices: ultra-low-power static
                     memory elements, which will require exceptionally
                     low currents; ultra-high-speed logical processing
                     elements, which will require very small feature
                     sizes and somewhat higher currents; and
                     far-infrared detectors. 

                     Sandia's interest in transistor design is one part of
                     the government laboratory's larger charter, which
                     is to assure the safety, security, and reliability of
                     nuclear weapons. As part of this mission, the
                     7,500-person lab also conducts research into
                     basic science. While at some point the quantum
                     transistor is likely to find itself attached to a
                     nuclear warhead, the national defense laboratories
                     are also increasingly participating in technology
                     transfer programs with civilian industries. 

                     The Sandia team will present their research
                     advance at the International Electronic Devices
                     Meeting in Washington, DC, on Monday, and will
                     publish various aspects of their research in the
                     upcoming issue of the journal Applied Physics
                     Letters.

Hard to predict, but there is a lot of very promising work being done
right now. We are getting better and better at understanding cell
adhesion molecules, neurotrophic factors (which make axions grow in
certain directions) and growth factors that make neurons thrive. At
the same time there is plenty of work on neuron-chip interfaces,
ranging from letting them grow on field effect transistors to having
axons grow through holes in a silicon plate. The big problems to solve
are 1) how to make these systems last in the body (rejection, tissue
changes, neural wear and tear etc), 2) doing something useful with the
signals and 3) get some volume into the connections (there are
millions of axons in the spinal cord, and we need a sizeable fraction
(around 10% or so) in order to restore function).

My guess is indeed that by 2027 we should have the necessary know-how
to do it (or at least know why it can't be done if we are unlucky). Of
course, just because we can interface neurons with silicon doesn't
mean we will immediately get cool brain-computer interfaces, that is
much harder and is also influenced by trends in human-computer
interaction, competition with other systems such as wearable computers
and the big threshold of pain, expense, time and effort required to
get an interface to work for you.

Much, much earlier.  Although, it will probably be using real nerve
tissue instead of silicon.  Rats have already been cured of paralysis by a
grafting procedure, and the "grafted" cells can be incited to grow by
neural growth factors.  Neuro-chip interfaces are in the midst, though...
a non-toxic two-way interface is now possible, and hopefully soon we'll
know how to exploit such an interface, and have the surgical techniques to
connect all the nerves correctly ( or just connect them haphazardly and
let the brain rewire its somatosensory/motor cortices to accommodate...
although this may not be feasible considering how difficult a time the
brain has with rewiring after amputation, ie. "phantom limbs") ... this is
where Anders elaborates on my mickey mouse understanding of 
neuroscience...

 (the problem in a nutshell - IMHO)

We're driving on a misty night at full speed along a road we don't know.
Brakingdistance is about 100 meters, visibility about the same. Someone on
the backseat claims that there is an obstacle ahead but can't tell whether
it's something solid or just a slight thickening of the fog.

Now, we're in a hurry to get to a party (Cryo, Far Edge, whatever...) and
the driver wants to keep everybody happy so he's not going to slow down
because some backseater 'thinks' he sees something. So here we are rushing
toward an object that could be anything from a whisp of fog to a solid wall
of concrete. After some discussion the still unclear object is now to close
for a full stop, the choice is: we just drive on and 'see what happens' or
the ask the driver to brake and hit 'whatever it is' at the lowest speed
possible. Bumpers and airbags might minimize the damage (if any).


An international panel of scientists have some pretty good theories that
something will happen to the global climate due to the usage of fossile
fuels (the only countries that don't agree with the IPCC-reports are a few
OPEC-members). Increased downward infrared flux trough increased CO2
concentration is a well-accepted fact (and maybe a way to terraform Mars
someday). The precise effects on the global climate system cannot be
estimated at this point, it may take another 10 to 15 years to find
conclusive evidence for (or against) a human-induced climatechange. But: if
nothing is done before then it may very well be too late do to anything.

Given the fact that we have a resonable indication that something is going
to happen that _may_ be very damaging to to the only habitable planet we
have it does not seem unreasonable to try to do something (IMHO).


Maybe we could somehow include the cost of bonding the CO2 again (by
reforrestation) in the price of gasoline or electricity, as an alternative
for complex regulation. That way anybody can drive (& fly) as much as
he/she want as long as the true global cost of 'closed-cycle' consumption
is paid. The funds could be used (by oilcompanies?) to plant trees that
will bond atmospheric carbon or put into energy research.

Really bad analogy.

A better analogy:

You're driving along a road through low hills.  It's a rather twisty 
road and you can't see all that far ahead, but you're driving at a 
reasonable speed.  One of the back seat passengers thinks he sees a 
fog bank up ahead, and says that he vaguely remembers the road 
turning abruptly downhill somewhere along here.  Another back seat 
passenger says he saw no fog bank, and remembers the first backseater 
claiming a few days before that the road turns abruptly UPhill.  A 
third backseater (it's a big vehicle) says that if we go any higher 
we'll run out of oxygen, and a fourth points at the lambs gamboling 
at the top of a nearby hill and claims the oxygen problem ain't so.  
Meanwhile the first backseater claims we're near sea level and so 
going down could be bad, and the fourth guy notices that off in the 
distance (through a conveniently timed gap) it appears we can see a 
lot further down and there's no sign of an ocean.

And in response to this confusion, some want us to come to a dead 
halt.

The evidence for an ice age is as good as the evidence for global 
warming.

Actually, if the ice-age theorists (who were the panick mongering 
government-must-intervene-to-save-us crowd when I was in high school) 
are right, then the usage of fossil fuels might be why we AREN'T 
having problems.

There is no need to wait for this evidence at all.  We can state 
categorically that previous eras when the temperature was rather 
higher than it is today were clearly NOT caused by human technology 
(being as they occurred variously before the dawn of man, up to as 
late as about the time humans started trying to domesticate fire).  
We can further say with equal confidence that they were NOT 
environmental disasters in any way that we would recognise.  That 
while there have been fluctuation in shorelines all over the place 
all the time, there is no compelling evidence that any particular 
fluctuation was due to temperature variations in the range the 
global-warming-doomsday theorists are predicting.  (The 
ice-age-doomsday theorists, score rather differently on this point.)

We can further state with confidence that human action did not make 
all that much difference in the CO2 content of the atmosphere over 
this century -- and the times it WOULD have made what difference it 
DID make, don't match up with the times of temperature changes or CO2 
level changes.

But what?  The choices are, with no particular reason to believe one 
over another:

(a) an ice age is coming, we need to increase the greenhouse effect

(b) we're increasing the greenhouse effect and threatening to cook 
our planet, we need to reduce the greenhouse effect

(c) neither of these is happening, there's no big deal

Even if we assume that you are right about the problem, it may be 
that you are wrong about the solution.  The fundamental need is to 
increase the amount of organic matter.  If your solution compels poor 
people on marginal land to continue the agricultural practices now 
turning that marginal land into desert, you are being 
counter-productive.

For that matter, according to some studies, if 1/100 of what Clinton 
proposes US businesses should pay out of their own pockets each year 
to cut their CO2 emissions were applied to dumping dusts of 
metals-rich organic chemicals into the southern oceans, we might 
solve the problem not only for the US, but for the entire world.

That is, still, assuming for the sake of argument that the 
global-warming doomsayers are right in their predictions.  What if 
the ice-age doomsayers are right?

Has anyone (Drexler, et al) addressed Dr. Smalley's objection to the
feasibility of MNT?

His problem is with thermal resolution and can be found at

I'd appreciate anyone's informed opinion on Dr. Smalley's assertions.

I don't think wondering what we're doing to our atmosphere is the 
truly relevant question here -- it is probably either no big deal or 
way too late.  The important thing that no one is addressing is that 
the fossil fuels we are burning represent the end result of millions 
of years of solar energy concentrated into these highly energetic 
substances.  I don't think anyone will argue that we are burning this 
stuff at an extremely accelerated rate, and the fact is, when 
they are gone, that is it.  I happen to believe they might be 
important, and I would rather not run out of them any time soon.  
It's not so much about the atmosphere, but rather how limited a 
resource they represent.  I think fossil fuels have better uses than 
being inefficiently combusted when I commute to work.

He makes the point himself:

<excerpt>On the other hand, molecular assemblers certainly do exist. We
call them catalysts. Robert Weymouth, Mark Davis, and Gabor Somorjai were
invited to the conference to remind us of just how powerful modern
catalysts can be. These are not examples of the universal assemblers in
the Drexlerian dream. Instead, they are entirely ad hoc assemblers that
in their intimate, hyperdimensional, chemical way go about the business
of molecular assembly of just a particular product from just a particular
set of reactants. But in this specific, assigned task they are very
effective molecular assembly machines.

</excerpt><<<<<<<<


While a given protein makes only "a particular product from just a
particular set of reactants," DNA has much fewer such limitations. 
Indeed, DNA is at the root of everything which we call "alive," including
cheeseburgers.  If it happens in a cow, there's no law that says that we
can't, for example, rewrite the DNA of a bacteria and make it happen in a
test tube.


We can already rewrite DNA...  we even know how it codes for proteins;
but those catalysts are nothing if not complicated.  Writing our own is
hard, but possible,* if economically unfeasible (though this will
change).


This is just one of the possible ways by which MNT could happen; it may
not be the best way.  However, if it can happen *in any way at all*, then
I, along with many other future-minded scientists, will strive to make it
happen.

Yes, but the jury is (obviously) still out on this. Merkle and Smalley
had
a somewhat productive debate on this at Foresight 5, which I hear was 
continued over dinner.

The crux of Smalley's argument:

"On a length scale of more than one nanometer, the mechanical robot 
assembler metaphor envisioned by Drexler almost certainly will work, 
but within the 1 nm3 volume surrounding the reaction site there
is a subtlety and complexity that is often not fully appreciated even 
by practicing chemists. In any chemical reaction for all but the most 
trivial of molecules, the detailed mechanism takes place on a potential 
energy surface in an N-dimensional hyperspace, where N is of the order 
of 10-30 (three dimensions for each atom in the near vicinity of the 
reaction site). In order for a robot assembler to be completely
universal, 
it would have to be able to control the detailed movement of not only
the
atom(s) to be added or removed, but also the detailed motion of all the 
atoms within a few bond lengths of the reaction site. Unless the motion 
of all the atoms is controlled in this reaction nanospace, there is no 
way of insuring that only the desired reaction product is obtained.
Since 
the manipulator "fingers" of the robot would have to be made of atoms as 
well, there appears to be at least one fatal problem with the concept of 
a universal assembler: there simply is not enough room inside the 1 nm3 
reaction volume both for the atoms desired in the final structure and
the 
atomic fingers necessary to control their movement."

   In the very next section he talks about catalysis, which narrows this 
search to essentially zero. Much current work is directed towards
mounting 
catalysts on proximal probes.
  Incidentally, Drexler doesn't particularly advocate a "Universal"
assembler,
Merkle and Smalley hashed through this at a panel at Foresight 5.
   Smalley's latest objection is to the size of an assembler (leaving
"universal 
out of it)- he thinks it would have a minimum volume on the order of 1
cm^3 to 
do useful work. Though I think this estimate is wildly inaccurate, it is
also
pointless, in that the absolute size of an assembler doesn't matter.
What matters
is {number of atoms added to a structure per unit time}/{number of atoms
comprising
the assembler}.
  Please don't construe this as an attack on Smalley- he is a wonderful
guy, does
top-flight work, wins prizes, etc. He's just not an engineer.

Turns out that as CO2 levels are rising, plant life is naturally
increasing their growth rates, as well as increasing their rates of
carbon bonding/ kilo of plant growth.

I've also seen simulations by oceanographers at UW a couple years ago
that showed that most of the rise in CO2 levels had much more to do with
the killoff of oceanic plankton in the southern hemisphere, which is
directly and conclusively linked to the chlorine caused ozone hole. As
this ozone hole is now feared to have reached a self sustaining level,
due to the increased cooling in Antarctica (which causes a natural level
of destriction of ozone in the winter), and a smaller but equally
ominous ozone hole above the acrtic circle, which will lead to
additional cooling, leading to additional ozone loss, and so on, it
looks more like while equatorial regions are getting warmer, according
to pro greenhouse theory scientists, the poles are getting colder, which
has yet to receive any media spin, for fear, apparently of thoroughly
confusing the masses.... Could our indiscriminate use of CFCs this
century trigger a new ice age???? Could the threatened thermal expansion
of the oceans, with a concurrent rise in sea levels, be absorbed by an
increase in polar icecap thickness???

_Gravitation_ (1973), by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler is probably a bit steep
for most interested parties searching for information on wormholes.  If you are
looking for excellent information on wormholes, (Kip) Thorne's 1990ish book
_Black Holes and Time Warps_ is better suited and actually includes more
decisive discussion of wormholes in general.

Not even that expensive. There are an estimated 3-5 million tons of
surplus cargo ships world wide just sitting in harbors, collecting rust.
These could easily be sailed south and scuttled. Instant polar reefs....

I tend to think that after several billion years, that the earth is
pretty good at maintaining an even keel within its own system. its dealt
with extreme vulanism, etc. for millions of years, and the bulk of the
climactic variation over time has more been a matter of a change in the
solar flux levels.

Also, considering that we've found a repreive of a few years,
supposedly, from the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, if the greenhouse effect
is really happening, all we need to do to fix it is clean nuke a few
volcanos.

I see this doublet quite often, and my face has developed a rueful tic of
recognition.  `There's no good evidence for global warming, and besides,
you fool, it's the only thing holding back the glaciers.'

Yes.  And until recently they were not anthropogenic.  On the other hand,
cities full of vulnerable human beings, and their agricultural and pastoral
and industrial life-support systems, were not jammed on those littorals.

What evidence for an ice age?  The global temperature has increased half

How can we say that?  There was a happy ecosystem, yes.  There was not a
happy ecosystem with agricultural humans who tend to live near
shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria in it.

I think we can say that we are busy putting the CO2 of the Carboniferous 
back into the atmosphere.  The Carboniferous had Very Large dragonflies
and cockroaches.  Some people might consider this worth a thought.

In the absence of further evidence, I prefer to assume that the
economists are right.  There are various things we should be doing
anyway, which would be cheap insurance.  Not actively subsidizing coal
and other high-carbon fuels.  (Spain and Germany subsidize their coal,
and I suspect the US spent more on the Gulf War than on renewable
energy sources.)  Being more energy efficient in general.

On the other hand, while global warming is a possible threat,
deforestation, desertification, aquifer depletion, and sperm count
deterioration are all actually happening, as is air pollution in
Mexico City and Beijing which make LA seem like a health spa.  There are
environmental problems with higher urgency.

The understanding I have read from various books such as those by Kip thorne,
Michio Kaku and a bunch of others is that the limiting factor for velocity is
the geometry of space-time. Nothing can travel in a perfectly straight line
because space and time (space-time) in higher dimensional geometry is bent,
curved or "warped" by large bodies of mass/energy such as stars and planets.
The orbits of the planets, asteroids and comets around our sun for example are
due to the warping or bending of space-time into "grooves called "worldlines" by
physicists.  Black holes have a massive amount of mass/energy in nearly
infinitesimally small space causing maximal warping of space-time upon itself so
that it pinches itself off from the rest of the universe.  This curious property
is what Kip Thorne used in theoretical work to create a wormhole. A wormhole is
just 2 black holes (or a black hole and its corresponding white hole, (which is
which is of course relative to the position of the observer).  Because the
geometric constraint has been circumvented by the remarkable anomaly of black
holes, the "light barrier" or "geometric barrier" can then be superseded by
superliminal velocities.  Such black holes could connect distant parts of the
universe, possibly various universes that are related by the Wave Function of
the Universe described by Stephen Hawking and connect various time periods (past
and future) of our universe(s) that are tied together by this Wave Function  The
moment before the Big Bang was the entire universe as a singularity aka black
hole and thus the entire universe and its relationship to similar and dissimilar
universes is ruled by the dominance of quantum mechanics at such
atomic/subatomic scales which is why the universe must be quantize into the Wave
Function of the Universe mentioned above

The major problem with that claim is that identifiable sources of 
possible error convert it to something on the order of "The global 
temperature is someplace between two degrees colder and three degrees 
warmer than a century ago, with the most likely value being half a 
degree warmer."

The other problem is that to the extent that we can track WHEN this 
change occurred, it appears that about 80% of the effect occurred 
*before* 80% of the alleged cause.

No significant evidence of major change in swamp area as a result of 
temperature changes in this range.  No significant evidence of 
non-trivial shoreline changes.  No significant evidence of changes in 
flooding patterns.  DIFFERENT plants grow well, but the basic level 
of biodiversity is not significantly affected.  In other words, 
nothing that would be particularly significant to agricultural humans 
who tend to live near shorelines and be vulnerable to malaria.

That I'll agree to -- with qualifications.  The major qualification 
being that most of the heavily industrialized nation are 
re-foresting, and have been for more than 50 years, and government 
mandates are NOT a significant part of this trend.

A second qualification is that we don't really know the cause OR 
SIGNIFICANCE of the sperm count depletion.  If it's happening due to 
stress rather than pollution, for example, it isn't a pollution 
problem.  If it's occurring primarily in industrialized nations, 
well, most families in industrialized nations put far more effort 
into preventing pregnancy than in trying to achieve it (as opposed to 
mating for other purposes), so it doesn't seem like such a tragedy.

And another big qualification is that we know the causes of several 
of these others, and the environmental socialists' proposed remedies 
virtually guarantee that the problems will continue unchecked.  (In 
fact the origin of the problem in many cases is that dictatorial 
governments more or less impose these remedies for reasons having far 
more to do with control than with the environment.)

Hm... "the chlorine caused ozone hole".

(1) What is the primary source of chlorine in the atmosphere?

(2) More specifically, what is the primary source of chlorine in the 
upper atmosphere over Antarctica?

(Surprisingly enough, the answers to the two questions are 
different).

(3) How do human (industrial and other) emissions of chlorine into 
the atmosphere relate or compare to either of these?

(4) How much human-source chlorine is specifically in the upper 
atmosphere over Antarctica?

(Answers: oceans, a volcano, infinitesmal, and essentially none.)

(5) What do you propose the government, or anyone else, should do 
that would actually affect this situation?  

I think that turning off 
volcanoes is currently beyond our technology, and coating the oceans 
with oil to prevent chlorine evaporation might have significant 
undesirable side effects.  :-)

I'll disagree with this.  In my opinion there are a pair of reasons 
that the investigation into alternatives is not more apparent:

(1) The problem is not pressing at present.

(2) It seems the most critical question regarding any possible new 
energy source is not how well it works, but how efficiently it can be 
taxed.

Probability near zero.  We HAVE, today, a passable SUBSTITUTE for 
gasoline that can be made by relatively low-tech, low-energy means, 
strictly from an extremely renewable resource -- agricultural 
wastes.  (It's ethanol.  Not gasohol -- just ethanol.  About 180 
proof.  We know how to make solar-powered distillers that deliver 
this purity, out of ordinary construction materials. Your carburetor 
must be adjusted because you'll consume about twice as much of the 
stuff per mile as you do gasoline.)  We also have a number of 
non-fossil sources of oils.  The hypothesis that we cannot come up 
with satisfactory artificial petrochemicals is untenable.

>  I happen to believe they might be
> important, and I would rather not run out of them any time soon. 

That, I can agree with.  What we most desperately need to avoid is an 
artificially maintained low price when the supply situation calls for 
a price increase -- it is precisely this price increase that will 
inspire the work on developing and deploying alternatives, so that we 
don't hit a crisis.

So if we can arrange for governments to NOT formulate energy policies 
and NOT act to protect people from rising energy costs, we don't have 
a problem.

I won't argue with this one either.

What is the evidence that this is really happening? The only evidence I've
heard cited was from a French physician who, it turned out, did not have a
statistically valid sample. I presume there must be better evidence than
this, but I have never heard it.

I would have thought many eco-people would be *happy* about anything that
reduced population growth...

This is old news, but a Forbes article from Sept 8, 1997 reports that
Harry Browne has discontinued his investment newsletter:

http://www.forbes.com/forbes/97/0908/6005229a.htm

We have occasionally discussed Browne here.  For a number of years he has
advocated a cautious, diversified investment strategy designed to preserve
assets while providing modest growth, regardless of the economic climate.
Readers have finally lost patience with his message after so many years
of steady successes in the stock market.

The article makes some good points about the difficulty of keeping a level
head in a declining market.  Many investors today have never experienced
a true, long-term bear market, and it remains to be seen how they will
handle it.

>From a contrarian perspective, the fact that Browne's fortunes have finally
fallen so low must be taken as another indicator that the market is near
its peak.

Thanks Doug,

In 20-50 years it's quite possible  that that asteriod belt would be mined
extensively. I believe there are plenty of asteriods comprise of the
heavier elements. In time it will be probably more ergonomical  to mine
these asteroid belts than on terranova, esp for the construction of space
stations and other planetary explorer vehicles.

There are two ways to measure the Earth's temperature; you can either 
take a lot of surface measurements, try to correct for errors, then feed 
them into a computer model which may or may not reflect reality, or you 
can just launch satellites and measure it. The CAG (Computer Aided Guess)
systems do, indeed, say that the temperature has increased and is 
increasing.

But what happens when you stop guessing and actually measure it?

So there you have it; the temperature of the atmosphere is decreasing by
0.04 degrees per decade. This isn't a guess, it's an actual measurement,
and matches measurements taken in situ by balloon. As a programmer and
physicist measurements give me a warm fuzzy feeling that computer-aided
guesses just can't match.

Now this is not to say that there aren't other effects (e.g. oceans,
high-level atmosphere) which the atmosphere measurements are missing, 
or that the temperature hasn't risen in the past (though it's odd that 
most of the supposed greenhouse-gas increase occured before most of 
the greenhouse gases were released). But it seems like good evidence 
that we are heading for an ice age, not greenhouse warming.

I've just skimmed the article. His objection is not with the thermal noise
(which is adressed by cooling down the device) or positional accuracy
(which is not addressed as easily, for I cannot make a dynamics analysis
as there is no definite manipulator structure yet) but a control problem.
Too many things moving in too many direction over a surrealistic potential
hypersurface while we have coarse handles attached only to a few of them. 

"On a length scale of more than one nanometer, the mechanical robot
assembler metaphor envisioned by Drexler almost certainly will work, but
within the 1 nm3 volume surrounding the reaction site there is a subtlety
and complexity that is often not fully appreciated even by practicing
chemists. In any chemical reaction for all but the most trivial of
molecules, the detailed mechanism takes place on a potential energy
surface in an N-dimensional hyperspace, where N is of the order of 10-30
(three dimensions for each atom in the near vicinity of the reaction
site). In order for a robot assembler to be completely universal, it would
have to be able to control the detailed movement of not only the atom(s) 
to be added or removed, but also the detailed motion of all the atoms
within a few bond lengths of the reaction site. Unless the motion of all
the atoms is controlled in this reaction nanospace, there is no way of
insuring that only the desired reaction product is obtained. Since the
manipulator "fingers" of the robot would have to be made of atoms as well,
there appears to be at least one fatal problem with the concept of a
universal assembler: there simply is not enough room inside the 1 nm3
reaction volume both for the atoms desired in the final structure and the
atomic fingers necessary to control their movement." 

Merkle says it is not a problem at all, since he has computer models which
prove otherwise. Intuitively, he might be right -- I do not buy the
corrugatedness of the energetic landscape when it cames to rigidly held
radical tools. 

Merkle's newest (afaik) browsable paper can be found

http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html

Where I do see problems, is the aforementioned positional accuracy (+- 10
pm should be plenty, but +-100 pm is imo too much), sterical hindrance of
reaction sites on diamondoid terraces, high surface contaminant
concentration at cryogenic UHV conditions and associated radical
lifetimes, sterical hindrance at the tip tool (a hollow tip may be bist),
which would make multiple tip reactions impossible, etc. etc. The possibly
worst problem is the bootstrap problem. We can see Hy Brazeal from here,
right behind the mist bank, but the ocean between us is studded with shark
fins. 

It is a nightmare of seemingly trivial details, but then God is in the
details as John C. uses to say. If one is unwilling to call these
constraints physical laws, one can call them technical difficulties. 
Whatever one may call them, if they are severe enough, machine-phase
autoreplicators are dead meat. Or dead diamond. Whatever.

Very true. Whatever we are doing, we do not know what we do. Even worse,
given process' dynamics (climatic history gleaned from palaeoice records
do not forebode well) it will be too late when we have arrived at an
informed consensus. In fact the argument that at our current level of
technology the sustainability of progress can be assured for only a few
decades (estimates vary, but you got my meaning) should be a major pro for
an R&D bost. Singularity imminent or not, thin-film photovoltaics and
electrochemical forms of energy storage should range very high on the
international agenda. Singularity may be delayed, or it may be altogether
a comforting myth. We are risking too much here, imo.

Yes. Whatever we should be, we should not be complacent, we bipedal

I didn't know much about this issue, but I've just browsed the web a bit
to find some information about the ozone problem.

Here is a page on "ozone myths" from the EPA:
http://www.epa.gov/docs/ozone/science/myths.html

Following the link about sources of chlorine, we find:

Another source is:

I hope Warrl will respond to this.  On the face of it it appears that
his (1) was technically correct but irrelevant (since he referred to the
atmosphere rather than the stratosphere where depletion occurs), and his
(2) is incorrect.  Likewise (3) is irrelevant since it does not refer
to the stratosphere, and (4) appears to be contradicted.

Hello all,

I try to follow what you all are talking about,
as good as I can.

I hope this isn't considered as noise. But could 
someone try to explain to me, referring to my 
picture, what the problems are on this scale.
As detailed, but also easy to understand as possible.
I try to get the picture in my head.

Thanks !

I agree.  It's very interesting, I had not heard of this measurement

It certainly does not!  0.04 degrees "per decade" measured over a lousy
2 decades???  That's statistical fluctuation if I ever saw it.  It is
*very* good that we are starting to measure temperature fluctuations
rather than use computer-aided guessing, but at this point there is
nowhere *near* enough evidence to make any sort of long-term predictions
whatsoever.

I don't think global warming is as well understood as ozone destruction.
The measurements appear much more ambiguous and the evidence for human
impact is less clear.  But in the interest of fairness here is what the
EPA has to say about these atmospheric measurements, from:

[Note - the figure referenced in the first EPA paragraph is not present;
HTML source comments indicate that they plan to incorporate a figure
from the international IPCC study.]

We know that two decades is not really enough to expect to see a clear
trend, and apparently it happened that the beginning of the interval was
unusually warm, swamping the trend.  Expanding the time frame as shown
by the balloon measurements does appear to confirm the warming trend.
The satellite measurement results should be considered with this
information in mind.

Uh, the global warming proponents are apparently claiming a 0.05 
degree "per decade" rise as grounds for massive restrictions on 
personal freedom. They do have data from further back in time, but 
there are good reasons to consider the data unreliable. Their
predictions certainly don't match the measurements over a lousy
two decades.

Or is this what you mean? That neither side has a good case?

"Depending on the response to this gathering, we may

I'm not so new at it, and I doubt we'll have that
sort of problem at this point. Rather, I'm concerned
that the response will be insufficient for us to
gather as early as January. (By insufficent, I mean
less than four people saying they'll be there. I
certainly wouldn't recommend travelling all the way
up here just to meet little old me.)

Let's give it a several more days before reacting.
Also, if the response is insufficient at this point
to gather in January, let's not give up. Some things
take time.

Getting organized extropian activity in Chicago and
the Midwest going may unfortunately require more than
just posts in this list. Perhaps not as many people
in Chicago read the Wired article.... I know there
are a lot of people in Chicago with extropian
tendencies, but they may never have heard the word
"extropy". To generalize, while there are some
cultural differences between greater LA (for
example)and Chicagoland*, these are so slight as to
be negligible to a first approximation.

Anyway, I expect we'll be starting pretty small.

*By the way, Michael, are you originally from

I believe these point to be facts, but feel free to correct me.

1.Increased atmospheric CO2 causes increased downward IR-flux 
  which could possibly lead to a temperature-rise of the biosphere.

2.In 1958 a downward trend in the relative concentration of radioactive 
  C14 was discovered by Suess and attributed to burning of fossile carbon.

3.In 1970 a clear upward trend of atmospheric CO2 was shown by 
  measuraments begun in '58 all over the world.

4.Over a 18.000 year period the CO2 concentration increased from about
  190 PPM to 280 PPM and then suddenly increased to it's present value
  of 365 PPM over the last 200 years.

5.During the latter half of this century there has been a solid
  correlation between economic growth and increased consumption of
  fossile fuels, were increase in fuel usage is tyically 1-3% greater
  that economy growth in that year.

6.Right now the developed nations are consuming a disproportionate part
  of the global energy resources (the US consumes a 25% of all fossile
  fuels produces while comprising only 5% of the global population).

7.All humans living in Africa, Asia and the rest of the world have 
  just a much right to drive cars, have a TV and airconditioning but
  if they do the global energy requirement will increase by (at least)
  a factor of 5. Currently the known supplies of oil/gas are only
  sufficient for 25-50 years (depending on your growth scenario) at 
  the current consumtion level.

I'm an optimist but I cannot help seeing a _potentially_ very threatening
picture emerging here.

I hope you do not seriously expect that trying to describe anything as
complex as the climatesystem would have been an instant succes. That just a
ridiculous as expecting the rocketscientists of the early fifties to design
a Saturn-V and expext it to perfom on the first flight. Of course things
went wrong! The fact that mistakes have been made by certain people
studying these issues in the past doesn't mean there can't be (and hasn't
been!) progress in this field.

Please state _one_ scientist whose work has been under the same scrutiny of
peer-review as IPCC publications that dares to stake his reputation on the
theorie that the CO2-increase of the last 200 years is preventing another
ice-age.

AFAIKT almost every glacier on this planet has been retreating during this
century and the is _no_ indication whatsoever that there's another iceage
around the corner. And even if there was it's not something that is going
to happen in decades but over a period of several milennia.

And the fact that this argument is never heard in discussions at policy
level might be an indication that it is not taken seriously by the broad
community of scientists (even PR-people of big oil companies _never_ use
this argument!).

Trees are stable biomass. It may be that more CO2 'bonding' can be done by
oceanic plankton as was noted by Michael Lorrey. However, these cannot be
more than temporary solutions since the global emission of CO2 is
increasing exponentialy and will continue to do at least so for some time
(there's a lot more coal to burn).

I have no idea where you got this idea and of course it's also necessary to
try to foster sustainable land-use in poor countries. This is just a part
of a much bigger general education problem. If farmers on the edge of
desert can be educated about these things that will be a very big plus
(just as education about family planning and basic health).

I've heard proposals to dump animals waste (a lot of that in Europe, and
no-one knows what to do with it) in so-called 'oceanic deserts'. These are
area's in the oceans that do not contain minerals (maily nitrogen) required
for basic plankton life and are mostly lifeless because of it. The
introduction of nitrogencompounds could start a whole foodchain that would
bond many megatons of carbon. The high cost seems not to be getting it in
the middle of an ocean but to get is from the farms to the ships, after
that: no problem.

The statistics are difficult, but if you superimpose temperature data
concerning the last 150 years from Vinnikov, Groveman and sources like CRU
and GISS the similaritiest are striking to say the least (and so is the
upward-trend).
No, there's no certainty yet. I do not think we can afford to wait for
absolute, 100% certainty.

X-cuse me? The relation between increased CO2 matches the start of the
industrial revolution and the relative decreasing C14 concentration
correlated with statistical data on global usage of fossile carbon. There
is very little doubt were all this 'new' carbon comes from, the extent of
it's effect cannot be determined yet but there are many indications that
the consequences for the global food production (amongst many other things)
could be a big problem.

Not yet, but that may very well be because there's a delay between cause
and effect (not unusual in large systems). A two degree temperature
increase in the sub-tropics could very well enlarge the habitat for
malariamosquito's causing 50 million additional deaths yearly (mainly in
third-world countries). Already research in Colombia, Ethiopia, Pakistan
and Papua-New-Guinee has shown that malaria is becoming more frequent in
higher area's, this could be greenhouse-related.

It could be already too late, but since we're not sure either way let's
work with the assuption that we can make a difference, it's a helluvalot

Exacly, if the current trend does not change we'll have burned 300 million
years of solar energy in about three centuries. It's been a nice kickstart
for out technical civilisation but we have to find better alternatives pronto.

Yes, better to use them for plastics and composite materials.

Uh, perhaps. I'm fairly convinced about ozone depletion because we
can see precisely what's going on in the atmosphere; but in this case
all we have are old measurements which may not be very accurate.

Unfortunately they don't show the figure. They do show another figure
on another page which claims the surface increased in temperature by
0.6F in that time, which rather seems to contradict the atmospheric
data.

Uh, their own graphs show 0.6F increase at the surface since 1979. See
http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/index.html.

Their own graphs show a large temperature peak around 1941; on this
basis we could imply that 1958 was a particularly cold year, and hence
the warming is merely a coincidence. And I'm still puzzled as to how
the same set of data could show warming from 1958-1993 but cooling from
1979-1995; if it was only a few years, perhaps, but 1979 is close to
the midpoint of that range.

Variations accounted for, errors checked against balloon measurements.

But that would imply that natural processes in the atmosphere can

anyway.

Did you find a source for those? They just state it and don't provide

	I think the point is that there are many theories that come into fashion, 
and decompose with time.  They usually say we need to use big government to 
force everybody to do this or stop doing that.  A couple of decades ago, 
the fashion was overpopulation.  People (still touted as experts) would 
claim mass starvation, disease and a lack of fresh water were just around 
the corner.  Once again, we have people saying that, in spite of the lack 
of evidence, we need governments to limit freedom.

	I don't see how the purposes of "the big oil companies" (why does 
big=bad?) would be served by stating that burning oil changes the climate. 
 Seems like a mighty silly thing to do.

	Of course not.  That's a very important part of these things.  Time to 
limit freedom now, before we can find out.

	And we will.  If 90% of our oil reserves were to be suddenly gone, I 
suspect we would rapidly make adjustments.

	I've always wondered if people that favored electric cars so much realize 
how toxic batteries are, and that the electric plant burns coal to generate 
the electricity to power them.

	Being in tune with the auto industry (here in Detroit, it's tough to avoid 
it), Ford has a car.  It carries a boatload of batteries (toxic waste).  It 
hits a top speed of 10 miles an hour, and needs to be recharged every 30 
minutes.  Or something, I must admit I cannot recall the exact details. 
 Generally speaking, it couldn't replace the average gas-guzzling, 
smoke-belching, rust-bucket of doom.

> Live as though you will die tomorrow.

	This would almost contradict your concerns :).

Yet the EPA claimed no warming trend since 1979, even though that's been 
a period of strong economic growth in the West. Cause and effect, and
all that.

Oil supplies have been "sufficient for 25-50 years" for as long as
I can remember. Odds are they always will be.

These wouldn't happen to all be computer models based on the same
assumptions, by any chance? Interesting that you quoted data for the 
last 150 years; thereby leaving out the very warm period at the beginning 
of the 19th century, where temperatures weren't much lower than today. Is 
this your idea of certainty?

I don't think anyone's questioning that we've dumped a lot of CO2 into
the atmosphere. We're questioning the doomsaying about it causing 
massive global catastrophe.

You mean it will grow better with more CO2?

So you agree that we need to keep the government from restricting our
technological progress with unneccesary limits on fossil fuel use then?

Ah, found it; http://www.vision.net.au/~daly/sonde.htm shows a graph
from the fifties to nineties; assuming it's accurate, the temperature
measured by balloons has dropped nearly 1C in that time. Of course if
you cut off the ends the temperature rises rather than falls, but this 
is what's so dubious about greenhouse science; you can prove anything 
by choosing the right dates.

Biology: More Evidence of Sperm Count Decline

By Joby Warrick

Monday, November 24, 1997; Page A02
The Washington Post 

A new study has produced further evidence of a steep decline in sperm
counts among American and European men.

Three California Health Services Department scientists reviewed data
from 61 studies of sperm density over the past half-century. They adjusted
for differences in data collection and other factors that may have skewed
earlier analyses.

Average sperm counts among healthy American men dropped by 1.5
percent each year between 1938 and 1990 -- a decline more rapid than
previous studies have suggested, they found. The decline among European
men was about twice as fast, or 3.1 percent a year, according to a report in
the November issue of Environmental Health Perspectives.

See the current Business Week (you get read it online) for an article on
the new Toyota Prion -- a hyybrid electric-gasoline car that gets 66 mpg in
heavy traffic. It costs Toyota something like $30,000 to make, but they are
selling it for $16,000. The idea is to get an early lead in what they
believe (without strong evidence) will be a big market.

I just found a GISS web page with a temperature graph. Oddly, the
graph starts at 1880, which is close to the coldest point in the 19th
century; go back another sixty years and you'd see little warming at
all. There's another interesting web page at: 

http://www.vision.net.au/~daly/low-head.htm

Which covers an Australian station used in CRU studies, showing that 
the supposed 1C temperature increase there over the last few decades 
was due not to global warming, but to trees growing nearby and blocking 
out a cold wind. How many more such dubious measurements have been 
included in the global warming computer-aided guesses?

Hmmm.... not a problem for the 1999 Synergy Hypercar, since it's
forward looking collision avoidance radar will alert/brake you in
case of any imminent danger. Besides, it's composite monocoque
chassis/passive restraint system is years ahead of anything
manufactured just two years ago. Not only that, but since each
wheel/hub is an individual electric motor/generator (used for
regenerative braking) the stopping distance is much less.

 The Kyocera turbine/generator set in this baby runs at peak
efficency, and combined with the features above means I get an
average equivilent of 200 Mpg ( I like to use ethanol). This
greatly reduces the other problem you mentioned in your post.

Okay, I'm indulging in a little near future speculation, but
everything I've mentioned does exist, it's an ongoing project of
the Rocky Mountain Institute.

Actually, this is wrong.  I'm quoting from the first part of Chapter 11 of
Julian Simon's _Ultimate Resource_.  The whole book is online at:

I seem to remember a Scottish study (sorry, no references ;( ) that found
a steady decline in sperm count for Scottish men in the last couple
decades.  The suggestion was that this phenomenon was caused by
environmental estrogens.  Estrogen analogues can be found in everything
from common shampoo to pesticides, and it is interesting to note that
sperm counts are lower in rural agricultural areas, which *may* be the
result of estrogen analogues in pesticides.

True, this is an apparent contradiction, and it reminds me of something I
was reading recently.  I was reading about some environmentalist movement
that had its roots in Germany.  They underlying doctrine of this group
was: if we kill ourselves, we'll be helping the environment.  Apparently,
some techno song supporting this meme (and created by a member) is on the
top 20 list in Germany.  Can someone verify this? (especially those in
Germany)  It seems to me if these people exist, they pose the greatest
threat to human beings imaginable.  It seems only logical that the next
step in their logic would be "why don't we kill everyone else."  The
danger would be that these characters would take Kamakazi(excuse my
spelling) to a whole new level-- their objective would be to kill as many
people as possible including themselves.  I hope I don't sound
too paranoid, but if this group exists, they sound very dangerous.

A few months ago The Learning Channel (or The Discovery Channel, watch
both, get them confused at times) had a special on the future of
automobiles.  Granted, this was a TV documentary but...

1)  The best electric cars developed currently pollutes more than the
new breed of internal combustion engines.  This pollution is mainly from
the gases produced by the batteries.  (They also noted that the disposal
of used-up batteries would be a more ecological hazard than anyone has
yet been willing to contemplate.)

2)  The new internal combustion engines produce LESS pollution than
mandated as minimal by the California pollution laws.  Amazingly, the
electric cars exceed or just barely reach this level.

3)  90%+ of the pollution of new internal combustion engines occurs in
the first 5 minutes of operation, before the engine/catalytic converter
gets up to operating temperature.  Electric engines pollute at a
constant rate.

4)  Gasoline is a by-product of oil refining.  It was actually dumped
into the ground in the early days before the advent of a need
(automobiles).  We will always need to get rid of gasoline somehow until
we no longer refine oil.

5)  The scenario about the pollution and secondary trauma from an
electric car accident was enough to turn your stomach.  Granted, I
suppose batteries COULD be developed that could survive a 60 mph
crash....or powerful enough that you wouldn't need several hundred
pounds of them.

Granted, we refine more oil for gasoline purposes today than we need
from other refinery products.  Yes we should find alternative propulsion
methods.  What this shows to me is yet another emotionally charged
fringe group (anti-oil, luddites, anti-technology, etc) with the power
to enact laws of the land affecting everyone without using a little
logic and common sense.  

I'll be glad to purchase an alternative to my internal-combustion
propelled automobile when one is developed that is better, not just
different.

Of course, we HAD an alternative years ago.  Just about every city of
size had excellent small-rail systems.  These were bought up, ran into
ruin, and ripped out.  Bring back decent mass transit (busses just don't
make it as they don't go where I need when I need and pollute more than
a thousand cars) and you eliminate the need for individual transport.
We can still have our automobiles, we just won't use them nearly as
much.

When I lived in Nebraska, all the gas contained at least 10% ethanol,
distilled locally from agricultural waste.  Not only did it make the gas
cheaper, but it burned cleaner and improved the octane rating as well.  It
has never been clear to me why ethanol enhanced gas isn't available in many
places, such as California, where there is plenty of agricultural waste and
an obvious need for cleaner fuel.  There is very little investment required
to make this change, so it would appear (to me) to be an obvious and
available improvement in the current state of affairs.

I'd say the evidence is strong that legislatures across the US will soon be
passing laws mandating conversion to cleaner cars... like it or not.  If
they do, you can bet that the market for clean cars will be at least as
great as the market for polluters.

This statement could not be more true.  However, one has to speculate 
as to where battery technology would be today if companies had spent 
even one percent of the money they have spent on improving IC engines 
or oilfield techniques.  Likewise on solar power.  No one 
will argue that electric motors are far better at converting 
electricity into kinetic energy than IC engines are at converting 
gasoline into KE. (I wouldn't mind having a 75KW motor on each 
wheel.)
  I truly don't think it is a matter of expense, but one of 
inertia.  Manufacturing electric motors is far cheaper than the 
complex IC engines they have today, and solar cells wouldn't be so 
expensive in mass production.  Humanity has a habit of not budging 
the status quo until life really starts to stink.  Pain and fear are 
great motivators.  Oh well.

In California, we are protected from such common sense by CARB, the
California Air Resources Board, who helps us out by mandating the
use of MTBE in gasoline, a toxic substance that accumulates in 
groundwater, has unknown health effects, causes car fires by eating
away fuel lines, and causes /more/ pollution by reducing the fuel
efficiency of the cars that use it.  It's also very cheap, which is
why the oil company lobbies purchased that particular regulation
(after they had earlier purchased laws mandating that older under-
ground fuel tanks be dug up and replaced whether or not they were
leaking, to drive small gas stations out of business).

Responsible environmentalists are not welcome in California poitics;
most people here actually take the Sierra Club seriously, despite
all the damage they've done.

Ah, much like when Gun Control Inc. hired U Chi profs to go over FBI
stats from 1979-92 to "prove" that right to carry laws increase crime.
When the whole dataset proved the opposite, they fired the profs and
hired other people to cherry pick the data to fit their preconceived
conclusions.

There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.....

Of course, one source of chlorine is not necessarily as dangerous as
another.

Nothing any more. From What I've seen, the worldwide CFC levels should
be back below pre WWII levels within 20 years. At which point, the ozone
will come back, so long as we haven't caused an ice age to start,
plankton will return to previous levels, CO2 absorption will come back
up, as well as the major fisheries returning to normal levels.

I think a greater threat with the oceam bottom is if it gets too warm at
the bottom in equatorial regions, if the thermohaline conveyor system
shuts down, then the vast methane hydrate deposits in equatorial ocean
bottoms might release themselves rather explosively.

On the other hand, increased atmospheric CO2 causes plants to increase
not only their growth, but the ratio of carbon fixing per lb of plant
growth.

Additionally,  increased equaltorial heating (where more of these
greenhouse effect measurements are taken, on a per square mile basis,
than in polar regions) tends to reduce the efficacy of the thermohaline
conveyor system in the oceans. The Atlantinc conveyor is known as the
Gulf Stream. As this conveyor system slows, there will be less heat
transport to the poles, leading to colder temperatures in polar regions,
which I needn't further explain, is what causes ice ages.

And yet we have seen nowhere near the same level of temperature increase
relative to CO2 rise as that seen in prehistoric data gathered from ice
deposits. THis says that there must be some other mechanism in charge of
major cooling/warming trends.

200 years? You mean 20 years. According to my geologist cousin, the CO2
level's effect on global average temperature has a diminishing returns
effect that kicks in at 280 and really flattens out at 330 ppm. After
that it really doesn't have that much of an effect if it goes up
further. 

He is not just a rockhound. He is a hydrogeologist that specialises in
ice ages.

No, there is a solid correlation between per capita income and
pollution, but it is not linear. It starts out linear at $0 up to
$10,000.00 per year, then drops down by 50% by $12500.00, and slowly
dropping further thereafter.

This is always a statistical lie tossed out by developing countries to
make the US shoulder the burden like a Sugar Daddy. They fail to say
what percent of that 25% of all fossil fuels is not burned, but is
converted into plastics and other products. THey also fail to properly
account for Chinese coal consumption. This figure is a highly classified
state secret (the true figure at least). They also fail to recognise
that the US long ago reached fill utilization of hydro resources, and
leads the world in implementation of wind and solar projects. They also,
with the exception of France, fail to mention that the only way for the
entire world to solve its fossil fuel dependency is to fully use nuclear
power.

Your second statement is an utter falsehood, while your first is
inaccurate. The advantage of following our lead is that they will be
able to take advantage of energy and fuel efficient technologies from
the start that were developed by the US. The current fuel reserves, as I
have repeatedly informed this list in the past, is merely a measurement
of known available reserves that are cost effective to recover at
TODAY's market prices. Previously unknown reserves are being discovered
every day, so much so that, depending on growth scenarios you use, we
have somewhere between 200-400 years of KNOWN fossil fuels available.
THis is not even considering the vast hydrate reserves under the ocean
bottoms that were only discovered to exist a couple of years ago. How
much oil and gas remains to be discovered is still an unknown.

A large number have in the past published, and had reviewed, data on
things like the variance in Solar Nutrino Unit (SNU) levels over time,
as well as the fact that current SNU levels, which are a product of
fusion occuring in the sun's core right now (the heat of which will
radiate to the surface within 5,000 years or so) is only 1/4 of that
deemed necessary to sustain the present solar flux levels. THis means
that, if current solar fusion models are accurate (and are no less
accurate than, say, greenhouse effect simulations) then in a few
thousand years, the sun will drop its output by a large fraction. It is
also well recognised that the end of what is known as the "Little Ice
Age" coincides with vast population and industrialisation growth (with a
concurrent increase in CO2 levels). While this (the little ice age deal)
is not currently in scientific or political vogue, in the 70's and early
80's, it was considered to be solid science.

You fail to mention that the Greenland Ice Cap, which is in reality one
huge glacier, is indeed growing.

Of course not. you fail to understand the economics of energy prices.
Tell me, when did oil companies make the biggest profits????? Duh, when
prices were sky high during the OPEC stimulated and Carter induced oil
crunch of the 70's and 80's. If energy taxes take effect, this will
increase prices, which will increase their margins, allowing oil execs
to squeeze in more profits. They also will be able to wangle huge
increases in government subsidies for energy research. Pushing oil shale
scams on the feds was one of the biggest cash cows the oil boys 
perpetrated on the US and Canada.

Not so. As CO2 levels go up along with heat, and hopefully with some
stimulation from sinking a couple thousand obsolete cargo ships (all
that metal rusting stimulates plankton growth), that plankton will
flourish and become a) fishfood, which will become people food, which
will become sludge spread over the barren wastes of the midwest, the
Sahara, etc. and b) precipitating detritus settling on the ocean bottom,
to, over time become methane hydrate deposits.

How about throwing out 100 years of counterproductive waste treatment
"technology" and start spreading sludge over the desert??? There are
companies doing this now in Texas with New York City sludge (grade B
sludge).

At this point there is little for Mohammed Q. Sixpack in the sourthern
Sahara can do, as the main thing draining usable soil from the desert's
periphery is the sun and the winds. Getting Europe to ship its shit
south would do wonders.

Except for bureaucracy. The EPA, that fountain of wise and informed
environmental protection, has banned New York from dumping its sewage at
sea. Any wonder that local fisheries have plummeted???

Almost all of the data, however, are from stations in temperate,
tropical, or equatorial zones. There is very little data from subpolar
and polar regions to give such statistical pools the proper balance. As
a result the stats are merely measuring an increase in equatorial
temperatures, while the decrease in polar temperatures are swamped to
insignificance.

Sorry, wrong again. Turns out that malarial mosquitos live in swamps
that are a) not given a decent through flow of water, and b) protected
from incursions of salt water. It is the opinion of many current
wetlands experts (as seen in last months AUDOBON issue) that malarial
mosquitos are a sign of an unhealthy wetlands ecosystem. Healty wetlands
have well rounded populations of mosquito predators.

 Granted, as top predators, we are getting more irresponsible, but this
is mostly because of the preference of many to descend to the level of
cattle in order to be able to increase population.

Unfortunately, the object ahead is a bull moose. 1100 lbs of bone and
meat and huge antlers. Unlike a stationary object, he moves around, and
unlike another vehicle, he tends to move in whatever direction your or
your fancy schmantzy collision avoidance computer thnks he's not going
to move in. The papier mache thin body of your vehicle crumples like
toilet paper when it hits, and since its low body hits the legs, the
body of Bullwinkle comes crashing down on top of the car, crushing the
cockpit and breaking the backs or smaching the skulls of everyone who is
pinned in their seats by their superduper airbags.

For those of you who don't put any credence in this scenario, I happen
to live in a state where moose browsing around downtown is a frequent
occurence. There are Moose areas where road signs warning of the local
pedestrian traffic have additional signs below them that remind me of a
MacDOnalds restaurant: "Hundreds of Collisions".

BTW: If anyone wants a digital photo of one of these, email me. Specify
day or night shot....

A guy died recently from hitting a moose with his 1/2 ton pickup truck.
Imagine what would happen to a little toy like Mr. Super-duper
Electromobile.

Recently, many consumer groups are targeting Sport Utility Vehicles,
because they are involved in more deadly accidents than normal cars.
They fail to mention that the fatalities happen to the OTHER guy, in
that tuna-can rice burner. SUV's have the lowest passenger and driver
fatalities of all vehicles. Funny how they misrepresent the statistics.
WOuldn't have a prejudice to further would they????

Because, with the highest energy and gas prices in the country,
Californians probably don't want another 5 cents added on per gallon. A
few years ago when the EPA mandated that the Seattle area use ethanol
inhanced gas (sold as "oxygenated") to reduce smog, prices went up by
5-10 cents, and people howled. They didn't stop driving though...

Actually, I think its a kind of darwinian hybrid vigor or some such.
Anyways, let em off themselves if they want to.

I wonder if they were for or against Ms. Williams' peacenik/ecohippy
inspired Landmine Ban????

Its good to see that at least SOME econuts can actually think out a
linear chain of logic no matter how sick, and better yet, that they can
actually ACT on it.

Is global warming trendy pseudo science with a statist control eco- agenda?
 Or is it a merely climatological fluctuation delaying the next  ice age?  The
 basic physics, of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) and increased temperature is
 well known.  The historical data for the last few hundred thousand years seems
 to show a correlation between CO2 and temperature.  But it is not clear, does
 warming cause increased CO2, or does increased CO2 cause warming?   In either
 case, the CO2 levels go up and down naturally, thousands of years before
 humans burned hydrocarbon fuel. Even more interesting are the cyclical
 patterns of cooling and warming every few 10,000 years or so.  There are
 several frequencies of cycles in both the CO2 and temperature data.  The cause
 of these  big cycles and  little cycles is still unknown. Numerous theories
 have linked some fluctuations to earth's orbit,  or continental drift,  but
 subtle links to solar activity cycles has recently come forward.  I am
 currently placing my bets on a slightly brighter sun, as a major factor in the
 current warming.    There  are tiny climate  fluctuations and patterns perhaps
 best explained with fractal mathematics or chaos theory as applied to
 dynamical systems. Rather than get whipped up into climatic speculation, let
 us look at the data.  Lots of hard work has been done figuring  out  the
 temperature  history of the earth.  Numerous ice cores, ocean sediment cores,
 chemical analyses later, scientists have charted the temperature over the past
 thousands even million years.  Dates and temperatures are correlated through
 historical records, tree rings, pollen counts, and isotope ratios of  oxygen
 in ice.  The real data are usually not shown in the newspapers, so the average
 citizen has no context to decide if a 2 degree warming in the next 100 years
 is significant.  The media at the behest of government environmental scare
 mongers has no interest in displaying the facts.  The facts are that the
 global climate fluctuates all of the time.  You can check the data fo
 The Vostok ice core data ia available on the web.  Point your browser
 to http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu.  Go to their search engin, type Vostok,
 and follow the links.   Who is to say that the current climate is optimum?
 Examination of the data indicates temperature and CO2 are certainly not
 stable.  A global warming investigator  130,000 years ago, looking at the
 data, would come to the conclusion that the CO2 is increasing, and the climate
 is warming.   Oh NO Grok, we had better stop burning those camp fires !
 Why do we assume stability, when the data do not support  our fond hopes.    
 Global warming proponents claim the earth will be warmer in the next century
 than ever before.  Wrong,  130,000 years ago, the earth was  much warmer than
 today.  Carbon dioxide was also higher.     More recently,  there was a warmer
 period called the medieval optimum.  In the history this coincided with the
 age of the Vikings.  From the year 900 to 1200 the climate in the northern
 hemisphere was warmer than today..  Oats and barley were regularly grown in
 Iceland.  There were wine vineyards in England.  Canadian forests were tens of
 kilometers north of present lines and the Vikings inhabited Greenland.  All
 totalled, climate estimates are 1.8 to  3.6F warmer than today.  This warm
 spell did not last, by the 14th century, the Vikings abandoned their northern
 settlements, and the English vineyards declined.   There was a mini-ice age
 after 1450AD to about 1650, where glaciers in Europe advanced, springs were
 delayed sufficiently to cause crop failures.   Canals in Holland, normally ice
 free, were frozen over along with the Thames.  This is associated with a
 sunspot minimum, known as the Maunder minimum, where solar activity was quite
 low.  The current inter-glacial period is quite warm.  This is good.  If we
 slide back into an ice age (as scientists were predicting in the 1950 and
 1960s), a 200 foot thick sheet of ice grinding over our houses and farms would
 be really a drag.  I have also hear  the argument that the  , 
gs faster than previous
 cycles.  Wrong, the  warming after the Younger Dryas cooling 11,500 years
 ago was rapid.  An estimated 7C rise in nearly 50 years.    No  man-made CO2
 emissions to blame there.  
 Current international pressure, UN stuff, with Al Gore  cheerfully making
 impassioned pleas for governmental controls on green house emissions. Gore is
 quoted as saying that the threat of global warming is the greatest  threat the
 country faces. Really, more than poverty, more than declining wages for the
 workers, more than an uneducated population?     But  all  this is  policy
 based upon software models, complex computer simulations, where the outcomes
 involve major economic impacts.   The state of current climate models is
 rather crude, as can be seen in the accuracy of rudimentary weather
 prediction.  The warming partisans cannot predict the weather accurately two
 days or weeks ahead, but blithely assert predictions based on simulations 20
 and 200 years ahead. 
  The warming propagandists and government  activists frequently fail to
 mention the green house gas  with the largest  impact .  What is it?  Water
 vapor !  Many uncertainties exist in the models, such as the many feed back
 processes, involving the oceans,  or the way to model clouds.  One of the big
 feed back mechanisms is the reflection  of solar energy (heat) by clouds back
 into space.  When the earth heats up, more clouds form, reflecting more energy
 back into space,  causing a cooling effect.  Clouds are subtle, their fractal
 variety is still beyond a computer simulations plugging some average cloud
 reflectivity coefficient or formula into the computer code.  There are
 problems with the models prediction of regional  warming.  One recent model
 that predicted an average warming due  to CO2 emissions, showed areas as big
 as western Canada warming, when actually a cooling was observed.  Antarctica
 is getting cooler.  One model predicts this , many others do not  describe
 this empirical finding.  
 
 And much recent data, shows a cooling. The earth m
 show a small warming at
 the surface, but satellite measurements show the atmosphere cooling slightly.
 This was written in earlier posts.  0.05C per decade in some linear regression
 over 20 years is meaningless in the context of the last 1000,  10,000 and
 100,000 years.   While some may say, these issues are complex, so we defer to
 the preponderance of scientific opinion on global warming.  But the consensus
 of scientists is not nearly so monolithic as the main stream press would have
 us believe.  Dr.Fred  Singer has a statement opposing the global warming
 hysteria, signed by  over 100 PhDs, top  professors of meterology (U of I ,
 MIT U of Arizona...), weather service directors etc.  The decision is too
 important to leave to speculation.  The  computer models are not that accurate
 !  
  On shaky grounds for science, and possessing powerful rhetoric, why does the
 enviroestablishment want a reduction of economic activity?  Their vision is
 that of zero population growth, less industry, returning to a totally
 unrealistic idyllic rural ecotopia.  Instead of viewing more people as a
 valuable resource, they view more people as a burden.  This is the misrabilist
 view point.  The more people we have, the more ideas, the more crafty
 inventiveness, and  problem solving we also have.  Implicit in this is the
 rate of solving problems is greater than the rate of creating problems.  This
 assumes that people are educated and skillful in technical methods.  The
 answer of course moare Extropy.
 Or the misguided policy might be a plan to stabilize the gap between wealthy
 Americans or countries and the poorer citizens or developing countries.  The
 earths rotation is slowing down also.  Do we expect a massive government
 effort to speed up the rotation?  The bureaucrats want to create an atmosphere
 where the government will solve all of our problems.  It is the old
 centralized control model,  which proved too slow for the communist
 bureaucracies to prepare for the 21st century. For the centralized
 bureaucrats, a global warming control
s a wonderful exercise in self
 perpetuation. 
 William Calvin, in his wonderful book, The Ascent of Mind,  has made an
 excellent case that the warming and cooling associated with the ice age cycle
 has been a major influence for the increase of human intelligence and
 evolution.  Will the current temperature changes spur further gain in
 intelligence?  Or, will the natural changes,  be a used as a weapon for the
 benighted forces of stupidity and regression?   
 Instead of restricting energy use, we should be  spending lots of energy
 preparing a life boat... climate control and space migration.

Gasohol is fundamentally a waste.  Sure, it probably makes cars run 
cleaner than with pure gasoline... but to make gasohol, you need 
alcohol in excess of 98% pure.  Whereas if you decide to leave out 
the gasoline, 90% pure alcohol is good enough.  The energy cost of 
going from 90% pure to 99% pure exceeds the energy value of the 
alcohol, and is a rather demanding high-tech process.  And in most 
cases the production of the energy for *that* will release some 
pollutants into the air.

 (Hm... to produce 90% pure alcohol you need something that looks a 
lot like a hot-box; that's backyard technology.  To produce 99% pure 
alcohol you need a sophisticated industrial facility.  I detect a 
possible reason why some prefer gasohol...).

I'm no admirer of Carter.  IMHO he's the second-best President of my 
lifetime, because he was so incompetent he couldn't get his 
horrible ideas implemented -- the best was Reagan because his good 
ideas got in the way of Congress's horrible ideas, and in 
retaliation Congress didn't approve his horrible ideas either.

But let's give the, ahem, "credit" where it's due.

It was primarily NIXON that induced the oil crunch of the 70s.  (And 
OPEC was more than happy to take advantage of it.)  It was pretty 
much over before Carter came into office.  As far as I can recall 
there really was no oil crunch in the 80s.

Um... weren't we talking about TEMPERATURE change here?  Last I 
heard, they figured that the apparent increase in temperature in the 
last 100 years mostly happened in the *first* half of that period.  
But the overwhelming majority of industrial activity (including 
fossil fuel usage) occurred in the *second* half of that period.

It doesn't matter how well you can prove that humans caused an 
increase in CO2 levels, if you can't show that said increase actually 
caused the effect you are trying to stop.

I'm talking about changes that happened tens of thousands of years 
ago to millions of years ago.  If the delay between cause and effect 
is so large that we haven't seen the effects by now, we have 
*nothing* to worry about (in this regard at least) that derives from 
any human activity.

I can certainly agree with that -- but I would submit that this is 
the best data we have, and that it is at least as strongly supportive 
of "ice age" claims as of "global warming" claims.

Oh, CFC, not just chlorine.  

Chloroflourocarbons.

Those nice molecules that (as compared to most gas molecules in the 
air), weigh about as much as a small horse, and are extremely 
vulnerable to bioprocesses and sunlight.

They are going to remain intact while they defy gravity to rise into 
the stratosphere and simultaneously cross not one, but two, breaks in 
atmospheric air current patterns.  (The wind patterns of the earth 
are pretty neatly divided into three groups, and adjacent groups 
don't interact much.  The groups can be described with a fair degree 
of accuracy as: the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere, 
and Antarctica.  Almost all human industrial activity has occurred in 
the northern hemisphere.)

They are going to do this in sufficient number to make a major 
difference in an environment which has injected into it on a daily 
basis, by natural causes, an amount of chlorine compounds comparable
to the entire annual human industrial consumption of chlorine.

They can also stop speeding locomotives just by holding up a hand 
(and, amazingly, the trains don't derail when stopped so suddenly 
from the front).

Or external-combustion engines.  These can burn pretty much anything 
flammable.  Potentially they can burn *nothing*, if an efficient and 
sufficiently portable alternative heat source is provided.  They are 
in principle vastly more fuel-efficient than rankine-cycle (ordinary 
4-cycle internal combustion) engines, because you aren't turning each 
heat source off and on several times a second.

Actually, that *is* a plausible explanation.  (For verification it 
would be helpful to determine if there really was a decline in 
kilt-wearing.)

The male scrotum is a temperature regulation device: it shrinks or 
enlarges in an attempt to keep the testes at an optimal temperature 
by adjusting their distance from the body.

It has been observed in the US that snug underwear  (confining the 
testes close to the body and providing them with a snug coat as well 
--> overheating) causes a drop in sperm counts.  This is an easily 
reversible change, though, usually fixed by having the man switch to 
boxer-style briefs.

Myth: I said that volcanoes and the oceans are causing ozone 
depletion.

Fact: I said nothing of the kind.  I merely said that chlorine 
releases from human industrial activity are incredibly tiny in 
comparison to either of these natural sources.

Hi all,

just a question: can anybody tell me if Drexler's "Unbounding the Future"
has been translated into German? I would like to give this to some people
whose English is not good enough to be able to read the original, in order
to help spreading the meme of nanotechnology and the assembler
breakthrough :-) The public is totally unaware of this topic here in
Germany, and the book seems to be comprehensible for non-scientists.
Any hints appreciated.
Thanks,
            F.P.

It is a popular trick to discredit an emerging technology by publishing a

Apparently you want to be careful in what you claim so that you cannot
be contradicted by the facts.  Let me put you on the spot.

Do you agree that human industrial activity is the principle cause of
ozone depletion?

If not, what do you think is causing ozone depletion?

Do you agree that most chlorine in the upper atmosphere (where ozone
depletion occurs) is due to human industrial activity?

If not, what do you think is the source of most chlorine in the upper
atmosphere?

These are not trick questions.  These are fundamental questions which
must be answered in dealing with the ozone problem.

Thanks,
Hal

I'm surprised you would post this when I already provided information
which contradicts part of it (the segregation by latitude), along with
a pointer to a FAQ which contradicts the rest of it.

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/ozone-depletion/top.html

| 4.1) CFC's are 4-8 times heavier than air, so how can they
| reach the stratosphere?
| 
|  This is answered in Part I of this FAQ, section 1.3. Briefly,
|  atmospheric gases do not segragate by weight in the troposphere
|  and the stratosphere, because the mixing mechanisms (convection,
|  "eddy diffusion") do not distinguish molecular masses. 

| 1.3) How does the composition of the atmosphere change
| with altitude? (Or, how can CFC's get up to the
| stratosphere when they are heavier than air?) 
| 
| In the earth's troposphere and stratosphere, most _stable_ chemical
| species are "well-mixed" - their mixing ratios are independent of
| altitude.  If a species' mixing ratio changes with altitude, some
| kind of physical or chemical transformation is taking place. That 
| last statement may seem surprising - one might expect the heavier 
| molecules to dominate at lower altitudes.  The mixing ratio of 
| Krypton (mass 84), then, would decrease with altitude, while that 
| of Helium (mass 4) would increase.  In reality, however, molecules 
| do not segregate by weight in the troposphere or stratosphere.  
| The relative proportions of Helium, Nitrogen, and Krypton are 
| unchanged up to about 100 km.  

To repeat what I posted yesterday about latitude differences:

| 4.2) CFCs are produced in the Northern Hemisphere, so how do they get down to
| the Antarctic?
| 
| Vertical transport into and within the stratosphere is slow.  It
| takes more than 5 years for a CFC molecule released at sea level to
| rise high enough in the stratosphere to be photolyzed.  North-South
| transport, in both troposphere and stratosphere, is faster - there is 
| a bottleneck in the tropics (it can take a year or two to get across
| the equator) but there is still plenty of time.  CFC's are distributed 
| almost uniformly as a function of latitude, with a gradient of ~10%
| from Northern to Southern Hemispheres.
| [Singh et al. 1979] [Elkins et al. 1993]

I'm curious.  Do you really believe this stuff, or are you intentionally
posting falsehoods and misleading information for some reason?

That wasn't specifically my point, but it's reasonable interpretation.
I haven't personally seen the data either way, so I can't comment in
detail, but it's my belief that the fluctuation of annual average
temperature is on the order of a couple degrees.  (It would be nice
to see the data you refered to.  Is it available online?)  On that
basis, a "per-decade" change of 0.05, when the per-year change is
more than an order of magnitude larger, is not very convincing either
way.

Have a bad day yesterday Michael?

The composite body of a Hypercar is not paper-mache thin, and in
fact its monocoque construction makes it much stronger than a
conventional car and probably your 1/2 ton pickup. It will not
crumple like tissue paper.

If I could not stop short of the Moose, I would accelerate. (law of
inertia you know.) letting Mr Moose with his now broken legs land
behind me.

Lets say I did stop short of this moose. I'd either try and reverse
my course, or sit there quietly and wait for him/her to pass.

If threatened, I'd reach for my trusty Oneida Strike Eagle, notch
a 33.5", 3316 alloy shaft, thunderhead 125 equipped arrow, and
convert Mr bad attitude into 1100lbs of steaks, chops, and
mooseburger. After all it's the law (at least in Alaska) than you
have to salvage a game animal if killed (even if struck by a
vehicle). Maybe a nice new full length moosehide jacket and
moccasins as well.

He wouldn't be the first, nor last.

Vulnerable?  I always heard that they were used because they were
stable.  They seemed miraculous: good for whatever they're good for,
and unlikely to trouble anyone.  Basic chemistry: we're talking about
halogen atoms bonded to carbon.  "Vulnerable" does not come to my mind.
"Teflon" does.

Yeah, they're vulnerable to sunlight -- to high energy ultraviolet rays.

Now, hydrogen-CFCs -- HCFCs -- are different.  The current or almost
current _Nature_ had a column bemoaning the rush to ban HCFCs along with
CFCs.  CFCs are stable, very powerful greenhouse gases when released,
and bad for ozone.  HCFCs have a life time of 1.4 years and thus won't
make it to the ozone layer, and the letter argued that the energy
savings their use provides offsets any greenhouse increase they may
provide in that short lifetime.  It also argued that production does not
have to equal eventual release, but I can't address that topic any
further.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Once in a while I find myself trying to explain to someone
that the fact that they didn't adhere to some stupid rule
of some stupid piece of technology
(often stupid in a subtle way, like the fact that
 the VCR must be OFF or it won't record X-Files tomorrow night,
 or the way that Dilbert, intending to delete an embarrassing 
 phone message, instead sends it to all his coworkers),
means the piece of technology is stupid,
not them.

Listen, it's a dribble glass.
It's designed in such a way that it dribbles on you.

"Yes, but I *knew* that."
It's still a dribble glass.
Dribble glasses work by fooling you into thinking they're something sensible,
fooling you into doing something perfectly sensible with them,
then doing something to you that *looks like* it was your fault.
Hah, hah, you trusted me.

"You'd think I would learn."
The point is that this is a retrograde, damaging kind of "learning."
It is unlearning the expectation of civilization--the expectation that
people won't hand you a dribble glass.  We are in denial.  Instead of
admitting the horrible truth that we are being handed dribble glasses
left and right, we take the blame ourselves, eroding the idea that
technology should not dribble on us, that it should be adapted to us.

First maybe learn to be a human being,
then, when you're done that, in your spare time,
you might take up the hobby of learning 
   the obeisance before fetish-objects,
   the nervous glance,
   the stepping over cracks,
   the counting to ten,
   the throwing salt over your shoulder,
   the obsessive triple-checking and hand-washing,
   the knees-bent, arms-outstretched walk,
   the saying-the-opposite-of-what-you-mean, but winking obscurely,
in short the behaviors
that are adapted to the fun house--or funny farm--around you.

There is a moral point here.
Acquiesce to barbarism implies support of barbarism.
By saying "I should learn," one implies that
we all should learn to adapt to bad designs,
that it's okay for people to hand us dribble glasses.
We shouldn't.  It ain't.

It's okay, as a provisional, practical matter, to learn the ways
of the idiotic mutant sheep-monkey some piece of equipment was designed for,
but don't make it sound like a measure of a person.

Measuring ourselves by dribble-glass standards is not a game I want to be
included in, implicitly or not.

The site above by John Daly of Australia is a good resource for skepticism
about global warming.  As with any advocacy site (such as the EPA)
you have to take what it says with a grain of salt.  I've gone to the
original article and responses in Nature to get more information.

The specific point made on the web page above is somewhat misleading,
although the larger point about time spans does seem valid.  Daly shows
a chart representing temperature data from the period studied in the
original paper, followed by another chart showing temperature data for
a longer period.  An upward trend is clearly visible in the first chart
but vanishes in the second.

The misleading aspect is that it might appear that the first chart was
used in the original paper.  In fact this is not the case.  Daly's two
charts are based on a set of measurements by Angell which cover the time
span from 1958-1995.  The original paper used different measurements,
by Oort and Liu, which cover only a narrower time span.  The original
authors, in their response to the critique, claim that the Angell
data "has instrumental biases and known deficiencies in its spatial
representativeness."  So they did not use that data set supposedly
because it was not accurate enough for them.  In particular, they
did not select a subset of the Angell data and display it, which is 
the implication you might take from Daly's web page.

Actually, the original paper has no charts to show temperature increase,
and surprisingly enough, the original paper is not about warming at
all!  Rather, the paper is looking for changes in the *distribution*
of temperatures by altitude and lattitude.  Global temperature changes
are completely averaged out and discarded in its analysis.

What the original paper looked at was changes in the distribution of
temperature, based on the data by Oort and Liu.  It does not show any
simple one dimensional graph such as Daly has on his web page.  Instead
there is a two dimensional chart showing temperature change over the
period as a function of lattitude and altitude.  What the chart shows
is that the upper atmosphere has gotten cooler compared to the lower
atmosphere, and that the northern hemisphere has gotten cooler compared
to the southern hemisphere.

The purpose of the paper was to look at climate models and see if any
of them predicted the same distribution of temperatures.  It appears
that models which include carbon dioxide along with sulfate aerosols do
reproduce the data relatively well.  Adding an ozone contribution makes
the fit even better.  CO2 cools the upper atmosphere and warms the lower,
while the sulfate aerosols are concentrated in the northern hemisphere
near industrial sources, and provide cooling.

So simple analyses in terms of global temperature changes over the years
in question don't go to the heart of the original paper.  What does matter
is that the differences in temperature between northern and southern
hemispheres also appear to go away when you extend the time frame.  That's
the actual point of the chart shown by Daly, although he doesn't say so.
It represents southern hemisphere temperatures, and their decrease in the
past decade effectivelly eliminates the previous temperature differential
between north and south which the models explained so well.

In short, extending the time frame causes the measurements to *depart*
from the model predictions, while within the time frame of the original
paper the measurements were becoming *closer* to the model predictions.

In their response, the original authors admit this.  They don't like the
Angell data, but they use a different set of measurements from Parker
and they confirm that the temperature distributions depart from the
predictions after 1988.  However they claim that this is OK, that some
departures can be expected.

I didn't find this part convincing.  Yes, broadly speaking there can be
variations, for example if the sulfates get out ahead of the CO2 you
could have some cooling.  But the whole point of their original paper
was the agreement with the models, and even more it was the increase
in correlation between models and data.  Showing that the correlation
immediately turned around and began to decrease after the time span
studied by their paper has to make you question their results.  At a
minimum they have to explain why the models don't predict the temperature
distribution after 1988.  But they don't go into that at all.

I love this analogy; it's wonderfully enlightening and
entertaining.  I might point out, though, that it applies
equally well to institutions of society as it does to
items of technology.  "Learning" that men should wear
ironed shirts and shined shoes, and women painted faces
and fashionable dresses, or that certain simple, perfectly
clear four-letter Anglo-Saxon words should be avoided in
favor of obscure Latinates are also examples of adapting
to the dribble glass.

My favorite quote along those line's is Krishnamurti's:
  "It is no sign of mental health to be well-adjusted
   to a profoundly sick society."

SO essentially, then, we can blame automobile emissions controls laws
for the reduction in cooling in the Northern Hemisphere???? If we had
more sulfate pollution there wouldn't be any warming trend???

PV pollution is a matter of the waste products of production. It takes
quite a bit of pretty nasty stuff to make a solar cell.

Electric vehicles are, in total, around 45% efficient on average, while
Internal Combustion vehicles are 18% efficient, on average. This is a
comparison of only the engine, power source, power train, and rolling
and aerodynamic friction. When Power plant efficiencies are figured in,
it comes out that EVs are on average 3 times more energy efficient, and,
including power plant emissions, 33% cleaner than current IC technology.
(of course, this fails to measure emissions of oil refineries, hint
hint)

Once this is determined, one then evaluates the economic value of these
benefits, and weighs them against the drawbacks, like decreased range,
speed, safety, and user time wasted waiting for charging, and the higher
cost to purchase a vehicle. 

Personally, I think that if all a driver needs a car for is to commute
50 miles or less each day (as is the case with 80% of American workers),
then an EV makes sense. If one hopes to use a car for any recreational
purposes, however, an EV is not a good idea. An EV may be a good choice
for one vehicle in a two vehicle household for weekday carpooling.

Not bloody likely. Ever wonder why more vehicle occupants that are hit
by trucks are killed than occupants of the trucks??? Law of inertia. A
smaller vehicle is a)not going to have the same structural strength as a
much larger utility vehicle and b) will be stopped faster than a larger
vehicle, causing much more traumatic injury.

Considering that ALL cars are now required to be designed with what are
known as "crumple zones", I highly doubt that this would be the case.

IF you see him in time. They tend to have this habit of using vehicle
headlights to iluminate the road first, so they can see that they won't
stub their toes or something crossing the road, so they jump out just as
you reach them. Additionally, their hide is very dark with no sheen, it
seems to suck light into it. ( The Canadian Stealth Program: Driving
moose across the pole....)

In NH, moose hunting is by lottery. They definitely don't let you take

Prices remained above $23.00 per barrel for oil until the late 80's
WHile supply may have been high, government policies kept oil prices
higher than they should have been. Sure there were no gas station lines
stretching around the block, but that was more a matter of cars going
from 10 mpg to 25 mpg on average.

You're implying that you aren't factoring in the energy cost of the 
refining and transportation of gasoline.

Three times 18% is 54%.  You're saying that the complete power cycle 
of an electric car is three times as efficient as the internal power 
cycle of a standard IC engine car, or 54% efficient.  However, you 
also say that the internal power cycle of an electric car is only 45% 
efficient.  This implies that the efficiency of the electric power 
plant, transmission system, and battery charging system (or 
equivalent) is rather in excess of 100%.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 350 December 10, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein

QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally
demonstrated by physicists at the University of Innsbruck (Anton
Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@ uibk.ac.at; Dik
Bouwmeester, Dik.Bouwmeester@uibk.ac.at).  First proposed in
1993 by Charles Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118), quantum
teleportation allow physicists to take a photon (or any other
quantum-scale particle, such as an atom), and transfer its properties
(such as its polarization) to another photon--even if the two photons
are on opposite sides of the galaxy.  Note that this scheme
transports the particle's properties to the remote location and not the
particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk, whose body
is destroyed at the teleporter and reconstructed at his destination,
the state of the original photon must be destroyed to create an exact
reconstruction at the other end.  In the Innsbruck experiment, the
researchers create a pair of photons A and B that are quantum
mechanically "entangled": the polarization of each photon is in a
fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely
defined interrelationship.  If one photon is later measured to have,
say, a horizontal polarization, then the other photon must "collapse"
into the complementary state of vertical polarization.  In the
experiment, one of the entangled photons A arrives at an optical
device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose
polarization state is to be teleported.  These two photons enter a
device where they become indistinguishable, thus effacing our
knowledge of M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying
Kirk).What the researchers have verified is that by ensuring that
M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization
would now have to assume the same value as M's. In other words,
although M and B have never been in contact, B has been imprinted
with M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy,
instantaneously. This does not mean that faster-than-light
information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station
must still convey the fact that teleportation had been successful by
making a phone call or using some other light-speed or
sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't
foresee the possibility of teleporting large-scale objects like humans,
this scheme will have uses in quantum computing and cryptography.

Sub-picometer (.6 pm) resolution has already been attained with
interferometric
(visible light, BTW) techniques. These methods should be relatively
easily extensible
to 3D, and to positioning two separate objects using two or more probe
wavelengths.
Granted, the reflectors are several dozens or hundreds of atomic
diameters away from
the desired reaction site, but cryo temps should remove this objection.

Isn't this addressed well enough by the assembly sequence? Don't let a
terrace
become more than one or a few atoms high when a structure (atom) still
needs to 
be added to the base of the terrace. I don't think this would be
particularly
restrictive on the structure class size (and I've built a non-trivial
number
of things).

Science fact: Scientists achieve 'Star Trek'-like feat

<Picture: 'Beam me up' graphic>December 10, 1997
Web posted at: 9:29 p.m. EST (0229 GMT) 

NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have pulled off a startling 
trick that looks like the "Beam-me-up, Scotty" 
technology of science fiction. 

In an Austrian laboratory, scientists destroyed bits of light 
in one place and made perfect replicas appear about three
 feet away. 

They did that by transferring information about a crucial
physical characteristic of the original light bits, called photons.
The information was picked up by other photons, which took
on that characteristic and so became replicas of the originals. 

The phenomenon that made it happen is so bizarre that even
Albert Einstein didn't believe in it. He called it spooky. 

In addition to raising the rather fantastic notion of a new means of
transportation, the trick could lead to ultra-fast computers. 

The experiment is reported in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature by Anton Zeilinger and colleagues at the University of
Innsbruck in Austria. Another research team, based in Rome,
has done similar work and submitted its report to another journal. 

The work is the first to demonstrate "quantum teleportation," 
a bizarre shifting of physical characteristics between nature's
tiniest particles, no matter how far apart they are. 

Scientists might be able to achieve teleportation between atoms 
within a few years and molecules within a decade or so, Zeilinger said. 

The underlying principle is fundamentally different from the "Star Trek" 
process of beaming people around, but could teleportation be used on
people? Could scientists extract information from every tiny particle in a
person, transfer it to a bunch of particles elsewhere, and assemble those
particles into an exact replica of the person? 

There's no theoretical problem with that, several experts said. 
But get real. 

"I think it's quite clear that anything approximating teleportation 
of complex living beings, even bacteria, is so far away technologically
 that it's not really worth thinking about it," said IBM physicist Charles
H. Bennett. He and other physicists proposed quantum teleportation in 1993.


There would just be too much information to assemble and transmit,
they say. Even if it were possible someday, it would be so 
expensive that "probably it's just as cheap to send the real person,"
said Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. 

Besides, Schumacher said, teleportation would "kill you and take
you apart atom by atom so you could be reassembled at the other
end, one hopes. It doesn't seem like a good idea to me." 

Much more likely, experts said, is using teleportation between 
tiny particles to set up quantum computers. These devices would use
teleportation to sling data around, and they could solve certain complex
problems much faster than today's machines. 

In the new work, scientists transferred the trait of "polarization"
between photons. Light behaves like both a photon particle and as 
a wave. A light wave has peaks and troughs like an ocean wave, and
polarization refers to the directions in which these peaks and troughs 
point. Photons retain this trait. To transfer the polarization between 
photons, the researchers used a phenomenon called entanglement, 
which a disbelieving Einstein derided. Since then, however, it's been 
shown to be real. 

When two photons are entangled, "they have opposite luck," said 
IBM's Bennett. Whatever happens to one is the opposite of what 
happens to the other. In particular, their polarizations are the opposite 
of each other. 

Here's how the Austrians took advantage of that: 

Call three photons A, B and C, and assume the goal is to transmit A's
polarization to C. The researchers created B and C as entangled photons.
Then they entangled B with A. 

That second step destroyed A, but not before B took on the opposite 
of A's original state. This change meant B's entangled partner, C, had to
change polarization to remain the opposite of B's. So C's polarization 
ended up the same as A's used to be. The polarization was transmitted. 

The process worked only 25 percent of the time because of how the
experiment was set up. It's possible to go to 75 percent and scientists 
will shoot for that, Zeilinger said. 

If the notion of entanglement leaves your head spinning, don't feel bad.
Zeilinger said he doesn't understand how it works either. 

"And you can quote me on that," he said.

Very well, what should we do? Autodafe the designers? Wipe out criminally
pointy-haired decision-makers, and the mob which adapts to broken designs
stampedeing all over the marketplace? Pass me that torch, please. 

This seems about forcing 'good' decisions upon resisting imbecility. About
memetic engineering. Last time I looked it was not a formal discipline
still.

Let's put Machiavelli on a scientific platform.

A quite fine example of why one should not trust CNN with scientific
news, the hyperbole of the article was quite amusing (although the
subject is indeed amazing, I can hardly wait until I get my hands on
Nature) Now every crackpot will think the teleportation booth is
around the corner.

This result is yet another step in the direction of turning matter
into information processing.

I think less drastic measures are more effective (if you remove one
idiot, two takes his place); we should both demand better designs and
try to promote good design (as you all know, I'm constantly cheering
HCI as one of the most important >H areas). We need both positive and
negative fitness gradients.

Very true. I have started looking at replicator dynamics; combined
with cognitive science it might be a workable first step towards
memetic simulation and modelling.

I don't think thin-film PV arrays need to generate significantly more
waste than production of an equivalent floatglass surface. Silicon is
anyway not a good substrate for them.  (There _is_ a reason for Silicon
Valley's massive environmental load). 

If people refer to monocrystalline GaAs or Si arrays, that's their
problem. (One can also make diamond wafer PVs. Of course one could also
drive an ICU with diamond dust).

braking quantitatively reuses braking energy. No transmission is required
for a motor-in-wheel concept. Spike cache allows to reduce peak motor
performance significantly. Design synergies allows elimination of a large
number of dead weight, which allows drastical reduction of peak motor
performance. (Of course I am talking composite frames here. Why bothering

All this does not include a high-performance carbon-frame lithium-ion EV
charged of an PV array. Novel designs involve supercapacitors both for
main and spike storage.

Due to synergistic effects the range is higher (at least twice range),
travelling speed is equivalent or higher, peak performance significantly
higher, safety significantly higher (there's a reason Formula I cars have
composite frames), recharging of a battery-swap EV (most EVs recharge
overnight or at work since used for commuting) or a fuel-cell vehicle
equal.

Currently, yes. If their potential is properly developed, EV significantly
outperform modern ICEs in all respects. And if you really want hovercars,
you can always use microturbine arrays. 

The reason why we don't have (fuelcell)EVs today are past and current
marketing decisions.

A year or so back, there was a flurry here about Hugo de Garis's announced
plans to build a Brain in Japan, using evolvable hardware.  I just checked
in to his site to learn whether he'd maintained his announced schedule.
Here's what he says:

`I head the Brain Builder Group at ATR, a research lab in Kyoto, Japan. I
expect, with the help of my group and international collaborators (from 9
countries), to build an artificial brain with a billion artificial neurons,
with evolved cellular automata (CA) based neural circuits, by the year
2001. We already have 10 million neurons, and expect to achieve our target
on time. By evolving neural  et modules with roughly 100 neurons each, at
ELECTRONIC SPEEDS (i.e. a complete run of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), with
tens of thousands of circuit growths and hardware-compiled fitness
evaluations, all in less than a second) in special FPGA (Xilinx's XC6264
chip) based evolvable hardware (called a CAM-Brain Machine (CBM)), we will
be able to download these CA based neural circuit modules (each with its
own evolved user specified function)  to user specified brain architectures
embedded in a RAM based space of trillions of CA cells. The same CBM
(programmable) hardware then updates the whole RAM CA space frequently
enough (e.g. 2500 times a second, i.e. at over 100 BILLION CA cells a
second) for real time operation. By the end of 1998, our Brain Builder
Group (BBG) expects to see the completion of 2 parallel tasks,  amely the
design and fabrication of the CBM (which was started in January 1997, and
should be completed by the summer of 1998), and the creation of a 10,000
module artificial brain architecture to control a robot kitten's many
behaviors. Starting in April 1998, the construction of a robot kitten
called "ROBOKONEKO" (in Japanese), should begin, and be completed by April
1999. The 10,000 modules for the artificial brain will be evolved in 1998
and 1999 with the CBM, and placed in the large RAM memory. The I/O between
the RAM brain will link via radio antenna with the (life sized) kitten
robot. After 2000, the BBG hopes to work on more ambitious projects, such
as household cleaner robots, and with substantially more brain builder
researchers on the team. (One of my goals for Japan is to see the country
create a "J-Brain Project" (J = Japanese), which would aim to build a
10,000,000 module artificial brain with 2000 human "EEs" (Evolutionary
Engineers) over the time period 2001-2005). The basic strategy will be to
increase the size of the artificial brain (both in terms of the number of
modules it contains, and the number of EEs used to build it) by a factor of
10 every 2 years, i.e. 1999-2000 (100,000 modules, 20 EEs), 2001-2002
(1,000,000 modules, 200 EEs), 2003-2005 (10,000,000 modules, 2000 EEs). 20
years from now, brain-like computers should generate a trillion dollar
industry. My boss has a similar dream, hoping to see a ten billion
(roughly the number of neurons in a human brain) neuron artificial brain be
built by Japan over the period 2000-2010, in a large Japanese R&D project.'

How about refuelling time? My one-way commute probably takes around
20-30 kWh of energy. If you're using PVs to recharge, then say 250
W/m^2, which means I need 80-120 square-meter-hours to recharge the
car to get home; and since I can't recharge it at night, we'd have
to double that so I could get back in the morning. So to recharge it
in the time I'm at work I'd need 20-30 square meters of panels, and
I'd have to hope for a sunny day. Standard residential electricity 
supply would take 16-24 hours to recharge.

In comparison, I fill my car with gas every three or four days, and 
it takes about five minutes. The only competitive system for a
purely electric car is a complete battery-swap and I can't see gas
stations wanting to do that in a hurry. Fuel cells seem like the only 
realistic option.

Certainly.   However, the Gaia Liberation Front (whatever that
really is) wants to kill *me* off.  Involuntarily, and preferably
with the least damage to the ecosystem.  Hence, their interest in an
engineered pathogen for the purpose of genocide.

That they cannot recognise a reductio ad absurdum when they see one 
more than counterbalances any "logical" thought that may be going on.

Hypercars:  Safety, Performance, and Aesthetics


A common generic objection to fuel-efficient cars is their alleged
crash risk. But this confuses fuel economy, mass, size, and design.

Fuel economy and light weight need not compromise safety. There is
no correlation, far less a causal relationship, between present
cars' crash-test performance and their mass, nor between their fuel
economy and their on-the-road death rate(67a,67b). That is chiefly
because occupant protection systems are lightweight, and because
vehicles' design and materials are vastly more important than their
mass. It may also be partly because light cars can avoid more
accidents by stopping sooner and handling more nimbly(68a,68b).

Existence proofs suggest that the general lessons invited from
gross correlations between light cars and higher death rates are
misleading. Americans can now buy a 4,2 l/100 km (56 mi/gal) car
with a lower death rate than a 10,2 l/100 km (23 mi/gal) car; cars
with identical efficiencies but over tenfold-different death rates;
and cars at any mass that differ in crashworthiness by more than
tenfold. Such comparisons reveal some unusually dangerous cars now
on the road at various levels of mass and fuel economy, but they
make no case that fuel economy does or must conflict with superior
safety(69a,69b) Rather, their high scatter emphasizes the
importance of design differences.

Theoretically, collisions between two cars identical except in mass
tend to damage the lighter car more. (Practically, this is often
incorrect because other, unequal factors such as design dominate.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought to show
the danger of light cars in recent light/heavy crash tests; the
light cars reportedly came off better until stronger heavy cars and
flimsier light cars were substituted.) This idealized theory leads
some to propose that you should drive a heavier car--thus reducing
such collisions' risk to yourself while raising others' risk
correspondingly(70a,70b) But the right answer is to make all cars
(71a,71b)s afe whatever their weight, without putting all the
adjustment burden on light cars. Heavier vehicles should be made
less aggressive (Kdser 1992)--softer, less angular, more
absorptive, with bigger ridedown distances--and the road fleet's
mass distribution should be further narrowed, e.g. by incentives
for replacing inefficient with efficient cars (section 11). Heavy
lorries  with slightly relaxed length limits could even be equipped
with a highly energy-absorbing structure on the front to help
protect any car they might hit (M. Seal, personal communication, 24
March 1993).

Better control of destructive driver behaviour such as drunkenness
is often crucial: behaviour may be up to a thousandfold more
risk-determining than the car itself (L. Evans, personal
communication, 1992), and only about a twentieth of crashes do not
involve driver factors (Evans 1991). But as to the car, modern
designs and materials can do far better than Henry Ford had in mind
when, in 1926, he said that " A heavy man cannot run as well as a
trim man. You do not need weight for strength"; (S. Abouzar,
personal communication, 3 July 1991).

GM's Ultralite confirms that mass per unit volume can be cut by
more than half below the "steel plateau" level. This decoupling
permits fuel-efficient cars to remain ultralight while combining
roomy interiors with ample crush length, which appears to improve
crash performance somewhat. Yet better materials and design can
also substitute for crush length.

Composites and other ultrastrong net-shape materials--many stronger
than the familiarly durable but lower-grade carbon-fibre fishing
rods, skis, etc.--would dominate in a hypercar. They would bounce
without damage in minor fender-bender collisions: most deformations
of carbon-fibre composite panels simply pop out again with little
or no damage. Under severe loads, composite structures fail very
differently than metal, so "totally different design concepts have
to be applied", and understanding of failure modes is not yet
mature. However, even under compressive loading--often considered
composites' weak point(72b,72a,)"Composite structural
elements...show high and in many cases better energy absorption
performance than comparable metal structures" (Kindervater 1991)
(73a,73b) Extensive aerospace experience is available from
designing all-composite structures and aircraft (like the Stealth
bomber and fighter) to withstand bird and stone strikes, landing
stress, etc.

Light metals would also be used where appropriate, such as in
sections of crushable light-metal foam or honeycomb for energy
management in a serious crash. These materials, available for two
decades (APS 1975), have a nearly perfect square-wave
response--they squash flat, absorbing enormous energy, before
transmitting crash accelerations--making them an ideal substitute
for ridedown length.

Other crash-energy-managing design options include buckling
members, down-deflecting heavy driveline components, filament-wound
or sheet-and-keel(74b,74a)cruciforms, and "impact beams(75a,75b)
Composite prototype and small-production cars and vans with
proprietary crash structures have in fact yielded some of the best
crash-test results ever recorded by a major automaker; some were
probably driveable after a 56-km/h barrier crash (P.H. Magnuson and
major-automaker experts, personal communications, March 1993;
Grosse 1992).

An ultralight car using ultrastrong materials, modern airbag
restraint systems, and crash-energy-managing design can weigh less
than half as much as today's platforms--as the Ultralite does--yet
be far safer than any car now sold. That is why racedrivers are
rarely killed nowadays when composite cars hit walls at  350 km/h:
as tens of millions of Americans saw on their 1992 tv news, the
composite car flies to bits, failing at "sections specifically
designed to initiate such breakaway and absorbing extensive crash
energy through controlled failure modes," but the "survival
capsule" remains intact and the driver generally limps away with
perhaps a broken foot. To be sure, ordinary drivers would lack the
racedriver's helmet, fitted foam restraints, spaceframe, etc., but
even in a head-on collision their lower speeds would imply
one-fourth the racedrivers' crash energy, and even if they were
more seriously injured, that would be a great improvement on their
fate in today's cars(76a,76b).

The main potential safety disadvantages(77b,77a)of the ultralight
hybrids described in section section 6-7 are that with their low
drag and low or absent engine noise, pedestrians may not hear them
coming unless a noisemaker is added that somehow warns without
being objectionable, and obstacles such as small trees, crash
barriers, and lampposts, against which a heavy car can dissipate
energy by breaking or deforming them, may instead stop a light car
or make it bounce off, increasing deceleration and perhaps
bounceback acceleration forces on passengers(78a,78b)

But beyond their general crashworthiness described above, such
"hypercars" also offer important safety features. The 2- or (with
series hybrids) 4-wheel switched reluctance drives offer full-time
antilock braking and antiskid traction, but with far greater
balance, response speed, and effectiveness than today's methods.

Hypercars' light weight means faster starts and stops; their stiff
shell, quicker and more precise handling.

Carbon-fibre designs can be so stiff and bouncy that an ultralight
car, if broadsided by a heavy lorry, could go flying--like kicking
an empty coffee-can. The very unfavourable momentum transfer would
go not into mashing the ultralight car but into launching it. Yet
occupants restrained by belts, bags, and headrests and protected
from intrusion into their protection space might well survive
unless accelerated by more than the often survivable ~40-60 g
range--in which case they'd be dead anyway in any car today, light
or heavy, steel or composite.

In the rare accidents so severe as to crush the composite shell
(usually in hammer-and-anvil fashion), the occupants would be far
less likely to be injured than by intruding torn metal edges in a
steel car; with any potentially intruding carbon-fibre shards
overlain by or interwoven into fracture-masking aramid or
polyethylene cloth, the crushed composite sections can become
relatively innocuous.

Victims' extrication would be much faster (a crucial element of
critical medical care--most victims not dead on the spot can be
saved if brought to hospital within an hour): the doors are
likelier to function, the composite shell can provide easier
access(79,79a) cutting it with a rotary wheel is quick and makes no
sparks to ignite fuel vapours, and breakaway energy-absorbing main
components would no longer impede access to the passenger
compartment.
Ultralights' decoupling of mass from volume makes it
straightforward to maintain a wide track and long wheelbase for
rollover resistance.

Hydroplaning risk should not rise and may fall, because the car
weighs less but has narrower tires.

The small powertrain volume and raked bonnet are consistent with
improved visibility and, as Dr Michael Seal suggests, with
headlamps behind the bottom of the windscreen (so they are cleaned
by the same wipers). The hidden headlamps are also exceptionally
powerful and can cause road markers and certain textiles to
fluoresce.

With careful design, composites', especially foamcore composites',
excellent attenuation of noise and vibration could yield an
extremely quiet ride--important because road noise is no longer
masked by engine noise(80a,80b) This plus the virtually complete
absence of wind noise should make driving less fatiguing,
potentially boosting driver alertness.

"The whole car is so simple, reliable, corrosion-resistant,
fault-tolerant, and failsafe-designable that dangerous mechanical
failures are far less likely."

For all these reasons, the design approach described here could
yield substantially improved safety. Hypercars could also offer
ample comfort, unprecedented durability and ease of repair,
exceptional quietness (sound-deadening materials, no wind noise, no
squeaks), beautiful finish and styling while retaining significant
stylistic flexibility, impeccable fit and weatherproofness, high
performance (light weight means faster acceleration), unmatched
reliability, and--as we shall see next--probably low cost.

One caveat is in order, however. Especially in the litigious United
States, innovation is deterred by the threat that makers of new and
hence initially "unproven" technologies may have to pay damage
claims even for accidents in which they are blameless. Some experts
fear that such potential liability might add exposure up to several
thousand ECU or $ per car-year, especially for manufacturers large
enough to invite lawsuits but not large enough to defeat them.
Absent tort reform, removing this important barrier to market entry
may require some government indemnity or coinsurance to makers of
hypercars meeting a national safety standard, at least until
actuarial experience has field-validated their theoretical ability
to match or exceed the safety of today's cars(81a,81b).


Endnotes

67a Historic data must be interpreted with care. Until 1985, the
U.S. accident population was only ~15% restrained by belts and
airbags, rising to ~50% in 1990 (D. Friedman, personal
communications, March 1993). Although admirably extensive analyses
of mass vs. safety have been performed (e.g., Evans 1991), the
higher crash death rates observed in the average of today's light
cars (but certainly not in all models) are for a fleet all built
with broadly similar methods and materials, and hence cannot be
used to predict the safety of the completely new kinds of cars
proposed here.

68b Such effects are almost impossible to measure because, for
example, larger cars (which tend to be heavier with currently
dominant designs) tend to drive more miles, carry more people, and
be driven in less urban settings (hence at higher speeds) and in
riskier ways, while smaller cars tend to have younger drivers who
are more crash-prone but survive better (Evans 1991, pp. 75-76)

69a A car-design variable strongly correlated with risk is
acceleration--a fact unmentioned since Detroit intensified its
marketing of muscle cars.

70a,70b As Evans (1991) states,"When a crash occurs, other factors
being equal[:] The lighter the vehicle, the less risk to other road
users. The heavier the vehicle, the less risk to its occupants " 
The opposite should therefore also be true.

71A,71B And light trucks and sports utility vehicles. In the United
States these were exempted from safety requirements, and their
crash-test performance shows it.

72A,72B This varies with composition: the ratio of strength in
tension to that in compression is approximately 1 for most carbon
fibre, 3-4 for aramid, and up to 10 for high-performance
polyethylene. Among many proofs of the right composites'
suitability for compressional loads, a carbon/epoxy unmanned
minisubmarine exhibited no fibre breakage at pressures equivalent
to 7 km depth (G.M. Wood and D.A. Waters, personal communication,
26 March 1993).
  
73,73B For example (Kindervater 1991), in "fracture dominated
crushing modes of carbon or hybrid [carbon-aramid] composite
tubes[,] specific energies over 100 kJ/kg [with nearly 100% crush
force efficiency AE, i.e., nearly ideal plastic energy absorption]
could be obtained compared to 60 kJ/kg...in the best aluminium
configurations." Specific energy absorption equal to that of
aluminium tubes, at comparable or somewhat lower AE, can also be
obtained from sinewave-beam composite assemblies. For such reasons,
composites are predicted within the next ten years to be used "for
up to 80 percent of the structural weight of a helicopter." To be
sure, "Pure carbon fibre reinforced laminates under compression
loading can have extremely high energy absorption capability but
disintegrate completely into small laminate fragments," but
"Hybridization with tougher fibres such as Kevlar or high
performance polyethylene [stacked or in intraply weaves]...provides
post crash structural integrity" with lower stiffness but also
perhaps lower weight, since polyethylenes like Dyneema SK60 have
specific gravity below unity.


74A,74B Such a cruciform using hybrid composites to resist
longitudinal crushing (of, say, an aircraft subfloor supported by
cruciform pillars) absorbs ~3.25x the kJ/kg of an aluminium
cruciform (Kindervater 1991); comparable U.S. automakers' findings
are ~4.

75A.75B Kdser (1992), of the Institute for Lightweight Structures
at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Z|rich), shows that
a foam- or honeycomb-filled, nearly rectangular beam wrapped around
a light car (500-600 kg curb weight, 2,5-2,8 m overall length) can
decelerate ~250-kN mean impacts at ~48 mean g without intrusion.
"Higher impact forces and decelerations can be obtained with small
modifications without significant increase of weight."

76A,76B Given such an ultrasafe family car, you could in principle
make it even a little safer in two-car collisions (albeit less able
to maneuver to avoid them, and more hazardous to other cars) by
using more mass, including more of those same safety-producing
materials.  But you may not want to, because the marginal cost
would be relatively high, the marginal benefit relatively low, and
the performance penalty from mass compounding possibly substantial.
However, the better the regenerative braking, the smaller the mass
penalty--hybrids scale up well--so some extra mass yielding
potentially large increments of safety could be accommodated if
desired. Our conclusions therefore do not depend on extrapolating
our qualitative safety conclusions to the extremely lightweight
frontiers of the 400-kg Ultima. 

77A,77B Minor ones might also exist, such as post-crash
high-voltage conduction by uninsulated carbon fibres.

78A,78B Such artificial barriers can be redesigned, but must still
withstand natural forces.

79a,79b The Ultralite's clamshell doors, for example, open up the
entire side of the car at once, giving simultaneous full access to
both the front and rear of the whole passenger compartment. Yet the
thin carbon-fibre door, light enough to be lifted by a small child,
is so strong that it provides adequate side impact resistance with
no B-pillar.

80a,80b Active noise cancellation works much better for engine
noise than for road noise, but a tire tread has been proposed whose
halves make out-of-phase sounds that tend to cancel at some
frequencies (P. MacCready, personal communication, 4 March 1993).
Interior quietness need not require much weight: some modern
aircraft, for example, selectively filter out annoying frequency
ranges with "inhomogeneous layers of polyimide foam."

81a,81b AeroVironment (Monrovia, California) is coordinating a
systematic exploration of the many public policy issues raised by
integrating a new kind of vehicle, the electric "SubCar" into
innovative transportation systems. Like anything different,
including hypercars, the SubCar raises a host of issues from
emissions to liability and insurance. For example, Consulier's
2,59-meter-long, 5,9 l/100 km [40 mi/gal] "Ram-Chop" urban
commuter-vanlet design, seating four abreast ahead of a >1,4-m3
over-engine cargo area, is so short that two can be parked
end-to-end or side-by-side in one U.S. parking space, like Fiat's
even shorter (2,1-m) 3-passenger Downtown (Autoweek 1993); but
would that be legal?

Could you please cite these policies and explain how they kept oil
prices "higher than they should have been"?  Then explain why the
US has the cheapest oil prices in the world?  As far as I understand
it, the oil industry in the US receives tens of billions of dollars per
year in direct and indirect subsidies from the US taxpayer.  Here's
a quote from http://www.wallowa.com/kerr/kerr9.htm:

}Most industrialized nations heavily tax petroleum because government
}spend lots of money keeping the oil flowing and cleaning up the messes
}caused by oil. But not in the USA where income and property taxpayers
}pay through the nose since the tax on gasoline doesn't come close to
}covering the costs
}
}The Institute for Local Self Reliance has issued "Oil Slickers: How
}Petroleum Benefits at the Taxpayer's Expense" (www.ilsr.com or $10
}from 1313 5th St. SE, Suite 306 Minneapolis, MN 55414), a compelling
}analysis of the hidden costs of oil.
}
}Economists call them "externalities." They are costs that are
}reflected in the price of product. For example, all the damages caused
}by cigarettes isn't paid for by the tax on a pack of cigarettes.
}
}ISLR estimates that the additional costs in tax subsidies, military
}protection, and environmental and human health costs is between $42
}and $350 billion annually. (The range is so wide because it depends on
}what and how you count.) For perspective, the federal governments
}deficit this year is less than $200 billion.
}
}First is the $3.3 to $10.9 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies.
}They have convinced Congress to grant them a whole list of tax
}subsidies from the oil depletion allowance to accelerated depreciation
}and a bunch of other breaks given to no other industry. The statutory
}rate of taxation for American business is 35% before deductions. The
}oil companies pay about 11%. Most other industries are much closer to
}35%. Taxes that the oil companies don't pay means that other
}taxpayers---or our grandchildren in the form of debt---do pay.
}
}It's not just federal taxes that are being tapped to meet our
}petroleum addiction, but also local property taxes. ISLR estimated
}that if the transportation taxes paid it's full freight in
}Minneapolis, rather than some of the burden being paid by property
}taxes, gasoline would cost another 18 cents/gallon.
}
}Second, taxpayers spend $26.6 to $70.7 billion to pay for military
}protection in the Middle East and elsewhere. This figure is in
}dollars, not in American blood (and health) that was lost in Oil War I
}(you may remember it as the Gulf War) or could be lost in the upcoming
}Oil War II.
}
}One Defense Department official recently told Congress that the last
}war in 1991 might keep things quiet for 10 years.
}
}Third, and the hardest to quantify precisely-but likely the most
}expensive of all-is the estimated $25.5 to $267 billion annual costs
}in the form of environmental and health costs associated with
}pollution...

He goes on to interpret this data in ways I don't agree with, but up
to this point his "facts" jive with what I've heard elsewhere.

In conclusion, Americans should be the last people on earth to be
complaining about the price of oil.  What you *should* be doing
is complaining about billions of your tax dollars subsidizing it's
price.

Extropians,

	OK, what is this "Quantem Teleportation" stuff?  When you read
the descriptions in these CNN and such articles it sounds like they
are describing a quantem phenomenon which is merely communication
faster than light (not teleportaion, although it would be nice to
teletransport faster than the speed of light).

	But then they say:

> This does not mean that faster-than-light information transfer has

	What does this mean when they say this after describing a
process which is comunication faster than light?  Why?  Can anyone
help me out here, or point me to more information which better
describes this stuff?

Mob vs. mob :-) ?

Anyway, my intent was really on the level I wrote about: awareness as
users, inhabitants or (gulp) consumers.  Which of us has never said
"how stupid of me," having backed into the sharp edge of some bad design?
The reason I wrote that rant is that I actually find it hard to
explain why it's so bad to blame ourselves in such situations.  The
assumption of adaptation-as-virtue is subtle and insidious.

The worst thing about techie culture is the people who take to 
detailed rules like fish to water, who soak up Windows .DLLs and
modem control strings... To the uninitiated these look like the
smart guys.  We the smart people (this is one of those sentence 
structures where you get to decide whether you want to be included in 
"we") need to stop acting the technerd so much, at least not without
a clear disclaimer.  Knowing how to set a VCR clock (okay, it's a
metaphor--or is this synecdoche?) is not smart, it's monkeysheepish.
And a certain percentage of *those nerds*... but wait.

The problem, but also the opportunity, is that we smart people often
have nerd abilities.  The problem is that by displaying them we
spread the association among ourselves that nerds are smart and well-
adapted.  The opportunity is that we can have the clear attitude that 
having to do nerdy things is a stupid imposition of stupid designs by 
actual people who have done something wrong.  By being smart
and having that attitude we can spread the association that it's 
*more* smart to be critical of technology, designs in general, and to
resist the role of the frenetic self-dribbling sheep-monkey.

Anyway as I was ranting: a certain percentage of those clever but not 
smart nerds graduate to a position where they're actually designing things 
and the cycle is perpetuated.  Oh boy more complicated toys to be the 
expert at!  We have to saw them off from membership in the smart club, but 
give them (and ourselves) a path to redemption.  We have to isolate them 
from the general populace until the fever dies down and some sense sets 
in, or else...

...Everybody's got an uncle who knew nothing about computers (for instance--
computers seem to be serving as the point of this nerdification wedge)
and then got one, and now he reads all the magazines and comes to 
Thanksgiving dinner and can't talk about anything but cache memory and
local bus.

In this uncle-at-Thanksgiving sense we're right in the middle of an 
insane culture (& p.s. I love people who pick up new enthusiasms and take
things into their own hands.  I just hate that we have such piss-poor,
sheep-monkey enthusiasms to give them.) and so we're right where things need 
to be changed, and we're just the people who would be paid attention 
to--if we would wake our own selves up from the trance and start pointing 
out the stupidity.

That seems like a big step to me, the switch in attitude.  From there it
can't help reflect back on design as something done by people, which
should be (but isn't) done for people, etc.  But you have to start with
an awareness of what the problem is, where it hits home, how deeply.

I should emphasize that my point was that the absolute price of oil in
the US is lower that it "should" be.  Although Michael may be right
that the price was a little bit higher relative to the standard US
price these days, the fact remains that it never got even close to the
price that it would be in a completely free market.

Max More <maxmore@primenet.com> quotes:

>particle itself.

This is the crucial bit of (disappointing) information.  I looked
carefully into this when the idea was originally annoucned, and decided
that "teleportation" was definitely the wrong word.  It is *not*
teleportation in any sense whatsoever.  It is the merely the ability to
transfer the exact quantum state of one particle to an identical
particle.  The second particle has to exist at the destination; the
only thing that is transfered is the quantum state.

It is almost certain that the quantum state of a normal, everyday object
(like a brick, or a human) is completely irrelevant when it comes to
true teleportation.  For example, the exact quantum state of the atoms
inside the neurons in our head is almost certainly irrelevant to our
consciousness.  This is why people can put their heads into MRI scanners,
and nobody has ever come out of one as a vegetable, an axe murderer,
or anything other than a little bit peckish.

So, unfortunately, it's not teleportation at all, and the guy who
decided to use that term for this effect should be shot for trying
to make the effect look like so much more than it actually is.

Basically because the information is transmitted in the form of a 
photon, which can't travel faster than light. In the original IBM
proposal you took two correlated photons, put them in boxes, and 
carried them to the source and destination of the transfer. At the 
source threw in the particle you wanted to transfer, measured the 
resulting state, sent that by radio, email, or carrier pigeon, then 
cooerced the other particle and photon into the appropriate state. 
Since the two photons were correlated, the second particle was then 
in the same state as the first.

(I've forgotten some details, but this is the basic idea).

In keeping with the fine engineering principle of negative feedback,
how about "The Dribble Glass Awards" for technological stupidity?
Ridicule is my personal favorite form of memetic engineering, but I
suppose we could combine it with a positive award as well to give a
nod to optimism.

What's the opposite of a dribble glass?  A simple, effective piece
of technology that does its job so well and so naturally that we don't
have to think about it?  The ballpoint pen?  The three-legged stool?
The knife?  The funnel?

Concerning Midwest Extropians, there are now four
people who have said they will probably be able to
make it to a gathering somewhere in Chicagoland on
January 10. Great! Any more??

Once again, I'm going to be unable to utilize e-mail
for a few days after today. Meanwhile, does anyone
care to make a suggestion as to where?

January 10 will be here soon, so I think it's best
that we attempt to further solidify the plans.
However, if you guys just want to meet and figure
things out then, that's okay with me.

Just to throw out ideas, how about somewhere we can
play darts? Or something more elaborate like
rock-climbing? (I recently had my first rock-climbing
experience and loved it.) Karaoke? (Just kidding.) 

Hey, you other Chicagoans, help me out here. What's a
good place?

For anyone who might be using public transportation
(bus, train), I offer to meet them at the
station/terminal. That said, we don't neccessarily
need to meet near any station/terminal.

If I want to send a message to a receiver 2 things must happen:  
1) I must change something in the receiver. 
2) The receiver must be able to compare that change with something else, such 
   as the voltage on a wire now compared to what it was a nanosecond ago.

Quantum Mechanics can do #1 but not #2 , so I have just changed one "random" 
state in the receiver to another. The results are not really random but it 
would sure look that way to the receiver. It's only when the receiver  
compared his results with the records of what I did, and that can only be  
done at the speed of light or less, would it become obvious that what I did
instantly changed what happened in the distant receiver.

I'd say the #2 redwood pencil. Or pencil & paper considered as a system.

Not bad, and "Tripos" has a rich historical association--the final exams
in England where an upperclassman would sit on a 3-legged stool (hence
the name) and improvise insults and challenges.

	That's not what I read from the descriptions.  From what I
understand you do have to transport the two "entangled" photons to the
source and destination.  But once the source photon interacts with the
photon being copied the orientation information is spontaneously
transmitted(?) to the other "entangled" photon regardless of it's
distance.  The way you put it it sounds like you have to communicate
the orientation information to the destination photon and then set
that destination photon orientation based on this communicated state
information which would be meaningless.

	From what I read in the description in the article you could
preload a pipeline of "entangled" photons going to the source and
destination of distant communication points.  Then once the entangled
photons started arriving at the source and destination, you could then
communicate by setting the orientation of the entangled photons at one
location and have the corresponding twin photon on the other side of
the galaxy spontaneously reveal the info about the particular state of
the source photon which could be galaxy away.  i.e. faster than light
communication.  Sure you have to preload the pipelines, but once this
is done why is this not faster than light communication?

	Could it be that the orientation cannot be set at either
distant location, but wrather that it's state can be observed or
"collapsed", and that the particular random collapsing would
correspond to the entangled photon a galaxy away?  This might make
more sense, and would definitely not be communication.  But, if this
is the way it behaves what's the big deal?  This sounds like nothing
but quite basic Newtonian stuff to me.

	And how would any of this phenomenon be used in some kind of
"quantum computer"?

Paper I can see, but pencils are too complicated, requiring an extra
piece of non-obvious technology to keep them operational.  But that
brings to mind something that seems like a good fit: sticky notes.
A modern invention that everyone immediately knew exactly how to use
and why and when, and that performs its job admirably.

OK, so there's my award show: The (weekly?) Dribble Glass and
Sticky Note Technology Awards.  To keep the list traffic down,
please send your nominations to me and I'll compile the responses
for the group.  A box of sticky notes to those whose nominations
are awarded (and maybe better prizes if it catches on).

This doesn't necessarily seem true to me...  You don't have to compare your
photons against their previous states, but only against the states to which
we had previously agreed.  Suppose I tell you that every second I'm going
to send you a photon, and that if the photon has agreed-upon property X you
should interpret it as 0, and if it has property Y you should interpret it
as a 1.  This agreement would have to happen subluminally, but what if I
then travelled 4E8 meters away and started up the QT machine?  Wouldn't
that be FTL communication?

A knife? :) ...or that bizarre thing with the handle? :)

I assume everyone here already knows about Doug Engelbart's classic
illustrative pencil-with-a-brick-attached, right? 
I think a Brick(less)Pencil citation/medal/award would be another
good thing. If I can figure out the endowment/award structure, I'll let
you know...

How about a ride back to the station?  Think it over again, and I'll see
how that option compares with car rental.

I second that. If we only could invent more systems like that...

I'm a student, so I hope "elaborate" doesn't translate to "expensive"

How about a ride back to the station?  Think it over again, and I'll see
how that option compares with car rental.

I smell fun...

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

	By "good enough" you mean the addition of a constructor that
can take the communicated information and reproduce (teletransport?)
the subject at the destination?  To me, communication is just a part
of this.

	What?  If you can't detect any change (#2) how could one claim
a change (#1) has even occured?  If it's not detectable wouldn't it be
much simpler (Occam's razor) to simply say the change hadn't really
occured making it all very newtonian?  Isn't it simply that for
communication to occur some DETECTABLE change must be caused at the
destination?

	Hey, didn't you know I can travel faster than the speed of
light any time I want to!!??  Watch this!  There, I just traveled to
the other side of the galaxy and back between keystrokes!  And just to
prove I was really there I made a change while over there.  Of course
this change (and the fact that I traveled there) is completely
undetectable to anyone, but hey, trust me, I really did make that
undetectable change. ;)

Kathryn,

I'm forwarding this to you, I think you'll find it *fascinating*!

****

For all you sci-fi buffs out there, where I work, the American Institute of
Physics, has just put out the most incredible press release.  Teleportation
has been achieved!  It's only on a photon, but they figured out how to
bypass Heisenberg's Uncertainly Principle to transfer the properties of a
quantum particle from one location to another.  And, since the process
happens on the quantum level, it is instantaneous (as in faster-than-light!)
 Now another part of the process right now has to take place at light
speed, so it's not FTL communication yet, but the core of the process is
FTL.  They believe they will be able to make the process work on atoms
within three years, molecules with 10 years.  This is truly a remarkable
step forward.  If you want to see a diagram and read more about it, go
to:

http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics/atoms/1997/teleport/teleport.htm

If you want details, here's a press release:

QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally demonstrated by
physicists at the University
of Innsbruck (Anton Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@
uibk.ac.at; Dik Bouwmeester,
Dik.Bouwmeester@uibk.ac.at). First proposed in 1993 by Charles
Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118),
quantum teleportation allows physicists to take a photon (or any other
quantum-scale particle, such as an
atom), and transfer its properties (such as its polarization) to another
photon--even if the two photons are
on opposite sides of the galaxy. Note that this scheme transports the
particle's properties to the remote
location and not the particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk,
whose body is destroyed at the
teleporter and reconstructed at his destination, the state of the original
photon must be destroyed to
create an exact reconstruction at the other end. In the Innsbruck
experiment, the researchers create a
pair of photons A and B that are quantum mechanically "entangled": the
polarization of each photon is in
a fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely
defined interrelationship. If one photon
is later measured to have, say, a horizontal polarization, then the other
photon must "collapse" into the
complementary state of vertical polarization. In the experiment, one of the
entangled photons A arrives at
an optical device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose
polarization state is to be teleported.
These two photons enter a device where they become indistinguishable,
thus effacing our knowledge of
M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying Kirk).What the researchers
have verified is that by ensuring
that M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization would
now have to assume the same
value as M's. In other words, although M and B have never been in
contact, B has been imprinted with
M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy, instantaneously. This
does not mean that faster-than-light
information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station
must still convey the fact that
teleportation had been successful by making a phone call or using some
other light-speed or
sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't foresee
the possibility of teleporting
large-scale objects like humans, this scheme will have uses in quantum
computing and cryptography.

Cool, huh?

Well, 'nother victory !!!

Teleportation, with low energy required !!! ( You, as I said, just teleport
the data, and discard all the matter of the original body...)

Now, let's try to tune with events ocurred  some seconds late... I still
suppose it will be necessary to replicate 
some brain functions, like those which happen in some (real) PES
individuals' brains... ( Do they really project to the present such events ??? )

Let's work !!!! (To the religious think about :::>  we, the real scientists,
will ressurrect (reinstall) even Jesus, babies...and this will be the end of
YOUR poor existencial world ...)

I've always assumed that this implies the universe (or the galaxy at least)
is littered with near-c-speed dumb couriers depositing one-use quantum
`pads' in interesting places, or maybe at random.  An immortal culture
could use these prepared boxes to teleport their brain states (very
expensively and infrequently) hither and yon `simultaneously'.

If i read correctly, the problem is that the system doesn't always work.
It works 25 % of the time now and they think they can get it up to 75 %
(theoretical limit?) so you would never know which one of the photons was
correctly transmitted or not.  Now, would CRC and parity
bit/photon checking help for such a low reliability rate?

Nor is it a forced discipline.

I personally consider that the right to be a stupid idiot as the
paramount, as well as the most exercised right there is in our society
today. While this could also be considered the main problem with society
today, it seems to be the major excape clause in most situations.

No, what I am saying is that the energy drain to refine the oil that
makes the gasoline, transports the gasoline, etc. further reduce the
efficiency of an IC car, as a systemic calculation, while electric power
plants are very efficient at creating the electricity from whatever
source, that, in the end, according to what I saw a couple years ago
from the Energy Dept, its a 3 to 1 difference. I don't remember the
final, total system, efficiency percentages, just the ratio between
them.

It all depends on what you mean by free. 

WHo decides what are true costs and what is fabricated bullshit to con
hard earned money out of working people????

WHile the establishment scientists tend to support each other on
warming, after decades of warning of an ice age, the majority of people
still doubt that these simulations reflect reality. I am sitting here
with over a foot of snow outside, that started accumulating earlier in
November than at anytime in my life. We normally get at least a few rain
storms here in nov-dec, but have yet to see one, its been too cold. I
also know its colder because the deer migrated to lower altitudes much
earlier than anyone can remeber since maybe the 50's.  While this is
just one area, it is an indication that the Gulf Stream thermohaline
conveyor system is weakening, as predicted, which could shut off the
flow of heat to NE NA and northern europe, starting another pre-iceage
trend.

Thats exactly what Nader et al are complaining about. THey blame big

Right answer for who??? If you want a safe efficient little car, you
should pay for the cost of the added safety. DOn't put the burden on me.
So I should sacrifice my right to good vehicle performance just so you
in your dinky little rice burner don't get flattened when you cut me
off?? Sorry, not gonna happen.

Of course, but people who can only afford a small cheap car cause they
are too much of an alcoholic to save money for a vehicle more fitting,
or safe, or enjoyable. Don't put the burden on me for their problems.

Thats accelerating performance. To disprove the usefulness of this
quote, take a 98 lb weakling in the end zone of a football field. Take a
240 lb linebacker in the opposite end zone. Have them accelerate to full
speed, and hit each other head on. Who do you think is going to be more

Sure one hit and you throw the entire car away. A metal body can be
easily bent back to shape at a body shop in many accidents. This is
another reason why insurance rates are going up. A higher percentage of
vehicles in accidents are declared total losses than when metal was the
norm.

snipping the rest of a mostly excellent post. 

However, as we were originally comparing IC vs EV, and I was trying to
compare apples to apples (production IC vs. production EV) and you went
off on the hyperbody digression, which is all very good and all, but you
have yet to:

 a) show any comparative studies between advanced construction,
ultralightweight small cars hitting a moose or equivalent object, with a
current Chevy Suburban or Grand Cherokee, or my brothers 1/2 ton pickup
truck. No matter what studies you cite, you still can't dispute the 98
lb track runner vs. 240 lb. football lineman collision, which is the
easiest demonstration of what I am talking about.

b) An IC with a similarly constructed body would exact the same
efficiency gains from it as an EV power train would, so using such
construction to increase the efficiency of EVs apples and oranges.

They're both neuter if anything.
_prius_ is the neuter (or adverbial) form of _prior_;
_prion_ is an invented word with a Greek neuter suffix.

GOvernment policies like those that supported the sustaining of Saddam
Hussein's war against Iran. the US and Europe pumped billions of dollars
of tax money into supporting Husseins war machine. The Iran/Iraq
conflict in the Gulf kept oil transport and insurance costs high, and
limited the amount of oil Iran and Iraq could supply to the world
market. Our governments valued high oil prices more than the possibility
that fundamentalists could take over Iraq and come within striking
distance of Isreal for conventional weaponry. US and European support of
Isreal is the cause of the original oil embargo, and our idiotic
policies in Iran allowed a demagogue like Khomeni to take power there.

It doesn't matter that we now have the lowest oil prices in the world. I
don't see europeans spending even a double digit fraction of the hefty
taxes they levy on oil and gas on energy conservation or emissions
reduction. It funds their welfare states. I am comparing 70's and 80's
oil prices to 60's oil prices. Oil was $4-$8 per bbl in the 60's. It
went to $18-21 per bbl in 1973, and peaked at $32 per bbl in 1979. It
slowly dropped, far slower than supply/demand would indicate, partly due
to OPEC and partly due to oil companies and partly due to the US
sustaining Hussien in his war with Iran.

We more than cover the costs. We build our entire highway system with
them. Oil spills are paid for by the spiller. SUrely you remember the
$30 billion bill passed to Exxon by the US gov't, the State of Alaska,
and the local indians and fishermen for the Valdez spill??? One of the
benefits of our highly litigious society.

We in America have nowhere near the same level of socialist nightmare
that high oiltax countries do.

Actually, studies have shown that cigarette taxes do pay for the costs.
States and the feds perfer to spend that money on other stuff and go
back for another helping. The only externalities that fossil fuels do
not pay for is the carbon emissions. I do support the enactment of a
mechanism to include the costs in the marketplace, as the US is pushing

SOrry, the average tax rate for American corporations is about 14%.
SOrry, this is the same old tax justification bullshit. That doesn't

Sorry, I don't think these figures are anywhere near accurate. The $60
billion cost of the Gulf War was paid for by other countries, mostly
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, with the exception of only $5 billion.
Additionally, the total US defense budget is only $240 billion,
supporting over 1 million troops. We have less than 10,000 troops in the
Gulf Region right now, so as a proportionate cost we are talking about
$2.4 billion, though that could be as much as double due to higher costs
for forward deployment. Not much more, I know from experience.

How is it counted???? SOmebody is paying for it somewhere anyways, with
the exception of the CO2 dumping, which is now being addressed in Kyoto.
Whether its paid for directly or indirectly  is irrelevant. Considering
that, according to the debate on this list, the stats show, at best,
that absoluteley no change is taking place. Things are possibly cooling
a bit more by  a half a degree per decade, or warmer by hald a degree
per decade. As I stated in a previous post, since the average global
warming at sea level is mostly because Northern Hemisphere cooling from
sulfates levels reduction is slowing, global warming COULD be caused by
us not polluting ENOUGH.... THink about that...

Hey, I didnt' say anything about prices RIGHT NOW, did I??????? I Like
them where they are, and think they possibly should have carbon taxes
added if, and only if, global warming does indeed seem to be occuring in
a way that we cannot fix any other way. I would prefer that rather than
governments raking in tons of dough on carbon taxes, which they would
most likely misappropriate, misspend, and waste away without
accomplishing anything, that the fees be levied as part of a emissions
trading market.

Wayne Hayes posted a piece purporting to demonstrate
that Americans pay too little for gasoline:

}First is the $3.3 to $10.9 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies.
}They have convinced Congress to grant them a whole list of tax
}subsidies from the oil depletion allowance to accelerated depreciation
}and a bunch of other breaks given to no other industry.

This is valid.  Without those strange tax rules, drilling
practices (and therefore prices) would be different.

}... Taxes that the oil companies don't pay means that other
}taxpayers---or our grandchildren in the form of debt---do pay.

Ha.  How often has the government ever lowered a tax rate
because it took in too much?

On the other hand, the extra money collected if they oil companies
were "fully" taxed would probably be used by regulators to make us
poorer.

}It's not just federal taxes that are being tapped to meet our
}petroleum addiction, but also local property taxes. ISLR estimated
}that if the transportation taxes paid it's full freight in
}Minneapolis, rather than some of the burden being paid by property
}taxes, gasoline would cost another 18 cents/gallon.

For what, upkeep of Minneapolis streets?  I benefit from good streets
if I walk or ride a bicycle.  Merchants benefit, through customer
access, even if they never buy a gallon of gasoline.  Why put the
entire load on gasoline?

}Second, taxpayers spend $26.6 to $70.7 billion to pay for military

This is partly valid.  Libertarians would say, let the oil companies
do their own fighting.  On another hand, the Gulf War was hardly needed
to keep the oil flowing; what was Saddam going to do with the oil he
grabbed, eat it?

}Third, and the hardest to quantify precisely-but likely the most
}expensive of all-is the estimated $25.5 to $267 billion annual costs

Putting those costs in gasoline tax would externalize any benefit
from designing a cleaner engine.  Technology exists to identify
the gross polluters on the road; find them and tax *them*.

	Maybe I've got the wrong idea, but couldn't we use a
photon-pipeline in order to achieve *effectively* FTL communication?
For example, a MIPS Rx000 processor can't really execute a single 
instruction in 1 cycle, but using a pipeline, and executing different
parts of several instructions all at the same time, this appears to 
be happening. Could a similar process be used for communication,
say, on the internet? Assuming that there is a delay of X seconds
between point A and point B, point A could send a continuous stream of
photons to point B for X seconds before communications are to begin,
and as soon as B receives the first of them, A could start encoding a
message via this quantum "teleportation." Perhaps point A would only make
use of every other photon, allowing for B to use the other "channel." 
I guess the big problem here is finding a way for A to store X seconds'
worth of entangled photons while waiting for B to receive the first
of them. So uh... is this plausible?

Handgun Control, Inc.?  That's what popped into MY mind when I saw 
the subject...:)

You can't, not then, only when records are compared is the change obvious. 
There is absolutely no doubt that it is possible to change things far away 
much faster than light, with infinite speed in fact. This is not just theory, 
it has been proven experimentally, but unfortunately that's not enough to 
sent a message. A message must not only make a change but also provide a 
standard the change can be measured against, otherwise the message will look 
random. Let me give a specific example.
 
Some physical processes produce 2 photons that have the same polarization but  
move in opposite directions. A billion years before I was born somebody in  
the Virgo Cluster started making pairs of photons that have identical but  
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion   
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in   
the opposite direction from the earth also a billion light years away.   

A billion years later on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  
record its position, observe if the photon made it through the polarizer or 
not and record that too, the exact time also. Now I spin the polarizer again  
and do the same thing for the next photon and then for the next several 
thousand photons.  I know that at the same time I'm doing this a friend of 
mine in the Coma  Cluster is performing the exact same experiment on his 
stream of photons and I decide to  visit him. I get in a space ship with my
records and blast off for the Coma Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.

After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my   
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the    
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising 
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding.  
The square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon  
pair is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my 
friend's detector.

I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was   
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. But this effect 
can not be used for faster than light communication because before I arrived 
with my records the results of my friend's experiment looked random to him, 
half the time a photon made it through his detector and half the time it did 
not. It's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can  
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that 
turning my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons 
far away. In a way you could say that I did send him a message faster than 
light, but it was encrypted and can only be read when I send him the key at
light speed or less.

Actually cryptography is one area where this effect does have a practical 
value, you can use it to make a communication link that is as secure as the 
laws of physics, it's already been done. I wrote about Quantum Cryptography 
in a post about a year ago, if anybody's interested I'll dig it out.

Overall, I agree with the original poster that this is an interesting
and likely very useful technology, which will have large
implications. But I don't think his paranoia about the FDA and Big
Business hiding it is warranted, and while I think it may be good for
many developing countries it will not likely remove the pharmaceutical
gigants.

How? While this method seems to avoid many of the current problems
with vaccines and may be much cheaper, I seriously don't think the
pharmaceutical industry will be much changed by it (se
below). Besides, vaccines are just a minor part of the industry - what
would really trash it would be remedies against common ailments
anybody could cook, with no ability to patent them).

You are mixing it up with gene therapy. DNA based immunization is
based on that a few cells will produce antigens, which stimulates the
immune system to seek out the real virus. For gene therapy you need
much larger amounts than that. Scaling up the effect is highly
nontrivial, as the gene therapy people are realizing.

No. Guess who will sell the machines? The software? Who will own the
patents of the genes you download? (would you seriously want to
download a shareware gene?). 

In the long run I agree with you, the huge pharmaceutical companies
will disappear. But they will become software gigants instead, doing
the research and development for the software you run in your own
medi-PC. It may be pay-for-use: you are debited for the plasmids you
order it to produce (or other pharmaceuticals; Greg Egan had a
believable such device in his book _Distress_).

According to the FAQ (http://www.genweb.com/Dnavax/faq.html) there is
also a patent for the process:

	Who owns the patents to DNA vaccination?
      
	This question began to be answered on December 2nd, 1996 when
	it was announced that Vical, Inc. had been awarded a United
	States patent covering the use of a "DNA sequence... free from
	association with transfection-facilitating proteins, viral
	particles, liposomal formulations, charged lipids and calcium
	phosphate precipitating agents"

(Although there may be prior art.)

> It is vastly cheaper than the conventional method that
>relies on proteins. Nucleic acids dont have to be refrigerated and
>can be stored without solution.

Is this true? I seem to recall that while they are fairly stable, they
tend to break up anyway.

What worries me a bit is the safety of this procedure. How well has it
been studied?

|Brown Death Case: Gag Order Broadened
|
|By Christopher Ruddy
|FOR THE PITTSBURGH TRIBUNE-REVIEW
|December 11, 1997
|
|WASHINGTON - The chief medical examiner for the U.S.
|armed forces, reacting to press criticism of his
|agency's handling of the death of Commerce Secretary
|Ron brown, issued a sweeping gag order Wednesday on
|military and civilian personnel in his office.
|
|At approximately 1 p.m., Dr. Jerry Spencer, chief
|medical examiner for the Armed Forces Institute of
|Pathology, hand-delivered a memo signed by himself to
|approximately 20 AFIP staff members. The memo placing
|restrictions on those staffers comes in the wake of
|allegations by two AFIP forensic pathologists that the
|agency did not properly investigate Brown's death.
|
|The pathologists, Air Force Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell and
|Army Lt. Col. David Hause, have criticized AFIP for not
|conducting and autopsy on Brown's body upon its return
|to the United States from the site of a military jet
|crash in Croatia in April 1996.
|
|Both men allege that AFIP did not properly investigate
|a suspicious head wound that both agree may have been
|caused by a gunshot. The Two forensic pathologists also
|claim that x-rays of Brown's head have mysteriously
|disappeared from the case file.
|
|Spencer informed his staff in the memo that "a command
|investigation" was underway "regarding procedures and
|individual actions related to the (Tribune-Review)
|article 'Experts disagree on Ron Brown Head Wound'
|authored by Christopher Ruddy and other related
|matters."
|
|Cogswell's concerns were detailed in the article.
|Hause's supporting comments were reported in a follow-
|up article this week.
|
|Chris Kelly, a spokesman for AFIP, said the internal
|investigation does not include a review of official
|findings that Brown died of "blunt force injuries"
|suffered in the crash. Kelly noted that an experienced
|medical examiner ruled the circular wound on Brown's
|head was not caused by a gunshot.
|
|The investigation, he said, would focus on "policies
|and procedures on the Brown case."
|
|He declined to comment on whether the missing x-rays
|would be part of the investigation.
|
|Spencer's memo laid out very specific restrictions on
|AFIP staff during the investigation:
|
|** All Staffers are to refer press calls to the public
|affairs officer. "Do not make any statements to the
|press without prior public affairs coordination,"
|Spencer wrote.
|
|** All staff members are to stay at their duty stations
|in AFIP's Rockville, Md., offices for the duration of
|their working day. Staff, including ranking military
|officers, must seek approval to leave the building for
|lunch.
|
|**Staffers are to turn over "slides, photos, x-rays and
|other materials" relating to the Brown case.
|
|In the past, AFIP medical examiners have been allowed
|to keep such case materials at their homes for use in
|lectures.
|
|The widely distributed memo mirrors one that placed
|similar restrictions on Cogswell alone last week. Last
|friday, Cogswell was escorted to his home by an Air
|Force police officer who demanded entry to his house
|while Cogswell retrieved case materials in his
|possession.
|
|One AFIP staff member told the Tribune-Review that the
|treatment of Cogswell was "unheard of" for a military
|officer and likened the restrictions on his movements
|to "house arrest."
|
|Spokesman Kelly took umbrage at that description and
|said Cogswell and other staff members are free to go
|home at the end of their work day.
|
|Another staff member told the Tribune-Review that
|yesterday's Spencer memo indicated "there is a lot of
|panic" among senior military officials concerned about
|negative publicity in the case.
|
|In a previous interview, Hause told the Tribune-Review
|that AFIP actions against Cogswell ignored concerns
|over the handling of the Brown case.
|
|Kelly reiterated that AFIP stands by its conclusion of
|accidental death and said the internal inquiry is being
|conducted to "make sure things administratively were
|done properly" in the Brown case.

When science will have got human bodies teleportation, it will be 
possible also to treat the data of the individual before reconstructing him/her,
and correct problems like diseases, physical and menthal disabilities and
even celular 
effects of aging... That's great !!! (Hope be alive until there...ah... and

such treatment...)

Well, formally speaking it would be better name it "teletransfer"... (SERIOUS)

PS: It also makes possible "telecopies" of a particle (not destructing the
originals)... 
what about via fax ??? (HUMOR)

Yes, but that is likely very far off, probably much further away than
even mature nanotechnology. Quantum teleportation is rather limited:
it works with individual particles, not complex particle systems (if
we could get that kind of quantum effects on the macroscale, then we
would go far, far beyond even the wildest dreams of nanotechnology
advocates), and the information is not changed in any way - any
interaction with the information would collapse it AFAIK (although you
might sneak around that by having the quantum information being
"debugged" by a quantum computer).

This still seems like I could communicate with you FTL if *I had already
sent you the key* and from there you're just interpreting it.  Again,
suppose I tell you (subluminally) that property (polarization? luck?) X
means 0 and property Y means 1, and THEN we separate.

What more you could possibly demand of teleportation? 
The quantum state is all there is to say about an object, it's meaningless to 
say that the object was destroyed here an another one with the exact same 
quantum state created there, it's the same object.

The only thing we know about Homer is that he was blind, lived in 800 BC and 
wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey it would be meaningless to say that those 
epic poems were not written by Homer but by another blind man in 800 BC who 
coincidentally just happened to have the same name, "Homer".

The exact quantum state of your brain is almost  certainly far more 
information than you'd need to duplicate consciousness, but it's definitely  
not irrelevant.

An MRI scanner will change the quantum state of your brain and thus it will 
change you, so will reading this post or being bitten by a mosquito.

Yes, it is correct. A MRI scan makes most of your hydrogen atom nuclei
align their spins, and then electromagnetic fields twist them around
so that they emit telltale radiation. Very elegant, and quite dramatic
on the quantum level.

Something like that is already being done, 2 banks in Switzerland used it to 
transfer information across Lake Geneva, not because it's faster but because 
it's absolutely secure. It's no faster than light because I can't send you 
the key until I know what the message I want to send you is, the key depends
on the message, and if I already know the message before we separate then I 
might as well just hand it to you and forget about the key and all this 
quantum business.

Nevertheless this could turn out to be very useful, in building quantum 
computers for example, and if anybody does that then Quantum Cryptography 
would be the only form of Cryptography that still worked.

In the method used for teletransfer the particle, it is necessary to

Do you mean to say that one-time pads constructed from, e.g., "HotBits",
would no longer work? Just how strong a claim are you making here? I don't
mean to attack, but I may have missed something here. Please enlighten me.

Why don't you try repeating this silly analogy by giving the 98 pound
weakling a full set of pads and regulation football gear and strip
the linebacker naked.  The weakling will still only weigh around 120
pounds but will be able to walk away from the collision, unlike the
linebacker.  Or to stretch the silly analogy games even further, why
not ask yourself how it is that cops can walk around wearing nothing
but a thin vest of composites and polymers and still live after being
shot with a piece of lead moving fast enough to have KE that makes
your linebacker look like a lightweight?  Kenetic energy is important
when trying to figure out who will survive a collision, but you are
better off betting your life on smart designers and materials
engineers than high-school physics.

And where exactly does this "source" come from?  It is coal dug up
and transported in the same inefficient process or else oil or
natural gas which are refined and transported in the same manner as
the fuel used to power an IC engine (solar and RE sources being so
small as to be completely insignificant in any such analysis.)
Sounds like this back-end cost is a wash as far as efficiency
calculations go, the electric power plant is more efficient than
masses of individual engines but that is as far back as you can take
the calculation.  Distribution costs for both forms are equally fuzzy
(i.e. building and maintaining an electrical distribution network is
expensive and costs energy, the same distribution network for
gasoline is expensive but you had to build the roads in the first
place for the cars which are the subject of this discussion...)

Yes, you can't understand the message unless we have a mutually known
key...  But if I'm only sending you one of two messages, 0 or 1, then we
can both "know what the message I want to send you is," having agreed upon
that subluminally, but then use this agreement to send superluminal
communication.

A very simplistic example of this would be something like "1 if by land, 2
if by sea."  If we were to try something like this using QT, we could agree
that I would either send you a "land" photon with an already agreed upon
polarization or a "sea" photon with a different, previously deterimined,
polarization.  Of course, if relativistic speeds/distances are involved,
that means that I would be able to tell you that the British were going to
attack by land *before they had even chosen to do so* from your
perspective...  The causality problems this could create are enormous.

To simplify this even further, suppose we have only ONE agreed upon
polarization.  "If I send you a particle with properties X, Y and Z, then
the British have attacked by land; otherwise, they have attacked by sea."
This agreement could have been made subluminally, but the information to be
transferred would be superluminal, and again, I would be able to tell you
how the British would attack long before they had actually done so.

Similarly, you don't have to know every word in the english language in
order to write words...  You just need to agree on an alphabet.

Hm... I assume you are regarding HCI as one of the negative 
gradients, as they have never designed anything which would not be 
counterproductive to their alleged purpose.

Or perhaps you have some inside knowledge about their TRUE purpose?  
(There are enough people in that group, of sufficient intelligence, 
that I cannot believe ALL of them are unaware of how their public 
actions oppose their public purpose.  Unfortunately, the alternative 
belief is that some of them -- and I don't know which ones -- are 
committing intellectual fraud rather than intellectual error.)

In that case, I must ask you the same question: cite some policies 
(and tell us who promoted and enforced them) and explain how they 
kept oil prices *lower* than they should be.

Further, explain how *you* decided what oil prices *should* have 
been.

I will absolutely agree with that, as *today* there is an 
identifiable non-free-market cause of *elevated* prices in the US.  
The commonly admitted significance of this cause is, in this state, 
about 30 cents on each gallon of gasoline.

As a first cut at the first-order, non-admitted significance of this 
cause as being at least 15 cents, but probably not more than 45 
cents, out of the price of each gallon.  That is *in* *addition* to 
the admitted effects.

This identifiable cause is: taxes paid directly by the oil industry, 
including the payroll taxes of oil-industry employees.

I forwarded Erik Reid a few choice bits of the conversation going on 
re the teleportation, which he enjoyed reading, and he has the 
following bit of reply to Wayne Haye's post (and in keeping with 
Wayne's lively writing style):

>It is almost certain that the quantum state of a normal, everyday object
>(like a brick, or a human) is completely irrelevant when it comes to
>true teleportation.

Almost, but no cigar for the gentleman.  The state of the particle is the
most crucial part of physical properties.  Yes, the raw materials must
exist on the other end in order to do the recreation.  If you are going to
transport the state of a gold atom from point A to point B, you must have
a gold atom at point B in order to have the state transferred.  That's not
even at issue!  This is not a particle beam; this is quantum teleportation,
faster-than-light, which means actual material can by definition not be
transported, only information about the material.  The state of the
particles creates the larger object.  They believe that they'll be able to
transport molecules within 10 years with this method; in that case, you
won't need the molecule at point B, all you'll need is the raw materials of
the molecule to have it recreated.  So the gentleman in question should
be informed that he is incorrect.  And no, no one is suggesting that we
will have the ability any time soon to do a complete dissection and
recreation of an object, but the fundamental theory is there.

For myself, I think the most exciting part of this is the communcation
aspect more than the object-moving aspect.  If we can communicate
planetary or stellar distances instantaneously, bypassing the light-speed
communication barrier, space travel becomes that much more feasible. 
(By the way, that is *not* yet possible with this scheme; while the
transfer is FTL, currently light-speed communication has to take place
around it, so we haven't gotten there yet.)

Getting DNA injected, and getting cellular translation into protein sounds a
lot like creating custom, beneficial viruses.  There may be side effects.  I
guess the difference is that a virus encodes proteins to make more virus.

One of the startling discoveries which came with the theory of relativity
was that if we were ever actually able to communicate FTL, we could use
this mechanism to send messages backwards in time.  This is part of the
reason, up until recently, I'd been convinced that FTL communication was
impossible.

This is from the Relativity and FTL FAQ at:
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/FTL_StartingPoint.html

A situation which could take place if FTL communication were possible:

>1.  As observers O and Op pass by one another (as they are shown in
Diagram 8-1 ) Op uses some method to send out an FTL bullet from his
reference frame. The event "O and Op pass one another" will be called the
"passing event" from here on. 
>2.  The bullet strikes and kills a victim. This event occurs after the
passing event in Op's frame of reference, but it occurs before the passing
event in O's frame. 
>3.  A third observer is at the victim's side as he dies and thus he
witnesses the death. This third observer is stationary in O's frame of
reference (i.e. his frame is the same as O's), so the passing event (when
the bullet was fired) occurs after the victims death in this third
observer's frame. Thus, the third observer has witnessed a result which
comes from an event in his future--he has information about a future event
in his frame of reference.
>4.  The third observer sends this information about the future to O using
an FTL signal, and in the third observer's frame of reference, O can
receive this information before the passing event occurs (and thus before
the bullet is fired). 
>5.  O receives the message and learns of the victims death before the
bullet is fired. He thus knows about the bullet being fired--an event in
his own future which will occur at his very location. 
>6.  O uses this information to prevent Op from firing the bullet, thus
causing a self-inconsistent situation--an unsolvable paradox. 

For the purposes of consistency, we may suppose that instead of sending a
FTL bullet, Op actually sent an instant message to an assassin hiding
behind a nearby grassy knoll, and that the FTL communique was his DigiCash
payment.  :)

I found an old post of mine that I sent to the list a year ago on this 
very subject.
- --------------------------------------------------------------


Even if everyone had a Quantum Computer in their pocket we could still 
communicate privately because there is a way to make Cryptography as secure as 
the laws of Physics, and the really amazing thing is that it's practical too.
Recently 2 banks exchanged financial information with Quantum Cryptography 
through a cable under Lake Geneva. The idea is to use Quantum Cryptography to 
send a One Time Pad of numbers to the person you want to talk to, the message 
can be detected but NOT without you knowing it was detected.  With a random 
One Time Pad you can generate a perfect encryption scheme, even if to 
everybody's surprise it turns out that P=NP, even if your opponent has a 
quantum computer, even if your opponent has a computer of infinite power, 
he can never read your message. Despite its perfect security it has severe 
practical limitations, how do you distribute the One Time Pad to the person 
you want to talk with? You can't send the pad electronically, if your 
electronic channel is not secure then an eavesdropper can tap your line and 
get a copy of the pad, if your channel is already secure then you don't need 
the pad. The only secure method is to  physically hand a disk with the pad on 
it to the person you want to talk to and then hand him another one when that 
one gets used up. That's not practical in most cases, what is practical is to 
use Quantum Cryptography, and unlike Quantum Computers we know for sure this 
will work because it's already been done.
This is how:

I send you a bunch of photons, each photon is polarized in one of 4 
directions, horizontal, vertical, left-diagonal and right diagonal, - | \ / . 
In this example I send you 10 photons polarized as follows 
| | / - - \ - | - / .

You have a polarization detector, you can set your detector to measure the 
horizontal and vertical photons (+) OR you can set it to measure the 
left-diagonal and right diagonal photons (x). The laws of physics do not 
allow you to measure one photon both ways, because measuring one destroys all 
information about the other.

You set your detector at random, let's say you set it to find rectilinear 
photons and let's say you have guessed correctly and it really is a 
rectilinear photon. If you can detect the photon after it passes through your 
polarized material, you will correctly deduce that it is a horizontal photon. 
If you can not detect a photon after it hits your polarizing material you 
will correctly deduce that the photon is vertical.

What if you guessed incorrectly when you set your detector, what if you set 
it to detect a rectilinear photon but I send you a diagonal polarized photon? 
Then the photon will hit your polarizing material at a 45 degree angle so 
there is a 50% chance the photon will get through, a 50% chance it will not. 
In other words you get a random result.

I send you 10 photons polarized as follows               | | / - - \ - | - /  
At random you set your polarization detector as follows  x + + x x x + x + + 
So you might claim the photons were polarized as follows / | - \ / \ - / - |
 
Now you tell me over an insecure channel how you set your detector for each 
photon, Big Brother is free to listen in, it won't help him. I tell you over 
the same channel which settings on you polarization detector were correct, in 
this example settings number 2,6,7 and 9 were correct    * | * * * \ - * - *
We only use those readings and junk the others, and we agree that horizontal 
and right diagonal photon means 1, and vertical and left diagonal means 0. 
So we have sent the number 0011 and we can be as certain as we want to be 
that there has been no eavesdropping.

An eavesdropper can not know what type of photon is being sent, and just like 
you must guess what direction to set his polarization detector. He will be 
wrong 50% of the time and when he is he will change the polarization of the 
photon and give himself away. We compare N bits in the string of numbers 
sent over an insecure channel, if there are no discrepancies then there is 
only one chance in 2^N that somebody is eavesdropping, so we can use the 
remaining bits as a one time pad. As I said this  has already been done and 
messages have been sent about 35 miles in this way. I learned about this 
stuff mostly from Bruce Schneir's wonderful book  "Applied Cryptography".

The receiver has an apparatus in which a number  of entangled photons 
are
captured.  He measures these photons one by one, noting one of four 
possible
values for these photons: A, B, C or D (these values represent the 
polarization
of the photon.)  He sees an apparently random assortment of values.  He
knows that the teleportation is successful only 25% of the time, so he 
doesn't
know which values are data and which are noise.

The sender attempts quantum teleportation on each of the entangled 
photons
the receiver has.  He is successful one time in four, and knows when he 
is
successful.  He notes when he is successful and the state of the photons
on these successes.  He knows that the receiver has these values for 
these
particular photons, but the receiver has no way of knowing that these 
are
the values that represent meaningful data.

The sender can now send a slower than (or equal to)  light speed message
to the receiver as to which values were successfully teleported, and 
which
were noise.  The sender can now read his message.

Note that the receiver's results will be the same whether the sender 
attempts
teleportation or not: the receiver sees equally distributed random 
values,
each value appearing 25% of the time.  Some of those values may be 
values
sent by the sender using quantum teleportation, but only the sender 
knows.

Does that help any?

This is a side issue from the FTL "teleportation" story, but does anybody
know if travelling backwards in time is theoretically excluded by General
Relativity or any other physical theory.
If reverse time-travel is possible, then I guess (should we fail to
achieve biological immortality in our lifetimes) we have a chance of being
"rescued" by future humans once time travel is invented. In this way,
anybody who has ever lived is potentially immortal if they can be snatched
from the past. I think there are some obvious flaws to this argument,
though. For example I don't see any time-travellers around right now.
But there is the parallel universe thing etc.

Ok, there are 2 entangled photons, one headed toward me and the other one 
headed toward you a billion light years away. We previously agreed that if a 
photon makes it through your polarizer, set at 0 degrees, that means I'm 
telling you to attack by land, if the photon doesn't make it through your
detector that means attack by sea. A billion years after we separate I decide 
you should attack by sea, so I set my polarizer at 90 degrees. If my 
entangled photon gets through my polarizer at 90 degrees then there is a zero 
probability that your photon will get though your polarizer at 0 degrees, 
so I've sent a message to attack by sea and done it much faster than light 
and everybody's happy. There is just one problem, how can I make sure that my 
indeterminate entangled photon does in fact get through my detector when I
set it at 90 degrees?
       
When a photon of indeterminate polarization arrives there is always a 50%  
probability it will get through, regardless of the direction I set my 
polarizer at, there is just no way around it. If my photon is absorbed by my 
polarizer set at 90 degrees, and there is a 50% chance it will be, then there 
is a 100% probability your photon will be transmitted through your polarizer 
set at 0 degrees, and that would give you the erroneous message to attack by 
land. Flipping a coin would work just as well for you, and it would be a lot 
easier.

CTCs (closed timelike curves) are possible in general relativity, but
it is not clear if they can occur or be created in physically
reasonable worlds (the chronology protection conjecture says they are
impossible, but it is just a conjecture). Quantum mechanics seems to
be time reversible, on the quantum level there is no real distinction
between past and future (as far as we know). One interesting
possibility is that quantum mechanics rules out arbitrary time travel
because (gross oversimplification) virtual particles could follow the
CTCs around and around, causing a buildup of vacuum energy that
destoys the time machine (see the papers on wormhole physics by
Visser). On the other hand, Novikov has shown that quantum mechanics
may allow time travel as long as it remains consistent: no paradoxes
are possible because actions that would cause them are prevented by
quantum effects, they simply do not happen.

The conclusion seems to be that it may be possible, but likely very
constrained. But the universe is a weird place, and weird things may
be possible.

This is untestable, so we cannot rely on it.

Hug... 

I'm at work on Sat AM at 7:00... we are about to take a field trip
about 4 hours drive from here to meet w/ some ISP at their annual
meeting. I hope it is worth the effort..

Last night saw my dad for the first time in about 2 years.. which
I'll go into more later..

Also Emman was supposed to MC the xmass party his co=workers where
having.. He got dressed up really nice. Spend about 4 hours TRYING to
find the place.. got the car banged up as he hit something...and was
quite said the got the car damaged (his car) and missed the party!!!

I figured some of the Rhizomers might find this discussion
interesting.  NURBS are Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines and
they allow artists/industrial designers/architects/etc. to
build smooth objects inside the PC.  Anyways, this discussion
started because most NURBS programs convert the 100% smooth
NURBS surfaces to (flat) polygons for rendering.  Yet
some programs avoid this by subdividing the NURBS surfaces
beyond/below the size of a pixel.  Generally the polygon
method is faster and looks just as nice for most purposes,
BUT there are those in the world who feel it is necessary to 
have *ideal* 100% mathematically smooth surfaces on their PC's ;)

WIRED magazine has published the results of a fascinating poll of the "wired"
community.  The article by Jon Katz and some of the poll results can be found
at

       http://www.hotwired.com/special/citizen/

Some quotes from the "tag lines":

    The Digital Citizen
    The first in-depth poll finds Digital Citizens are optimistic, tolerant,
civic-minded, 
     and radically committed to change. And they vote.
 
   The Wired/Merrill Lynch Forum Digital Citizen Survey, conducted by Luntz 
   Research Companies, polled 1,444 Americans to examine their views
   on technology and society.

I highly recommend this article as one of the first empirical "snapshots" of
the emerging "digital nation".

A small but important technical matter:

When quoting someone's post PLEASE attribute it to the writer of the

Subject: Cryoprotectants anyone?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Having an interest in living a long, long time, and not being sure I can make it
from here to when the fountain of youth is invented and marketed, I have an
interest in cryonics.  I've only read a little bit up on it, so I'm no
expert, but with
that preface, it seems the main technological problem which we might tackle
is that of finding a superb cryoprotectant.

To this end, I typed in the following schema, in hopes that someone will
either tell me:

        a) it's already being done,
        b) it won't work, or
        c) it's a brilliant idea and let's get started.

Here is the schema:

        Engineering cryoprotectants:
The basic idea is to 	come up with specificaions for the ideal cryoprotectant
in detail.  And I mean, ultimately, in technical detail.  This will probably
involve
finding some rigorous tests, such as how well it allows cells to not suffer
damage, though I would advise other tests as well.  Perhaps some sort of
microstructure could be used as a test bed.

Next, find existing chemicals that meet one or more of the specs.  There are
already a few good cryoprotectants in use, but I mean any chemical
whatsoever.  This is almost a form of brainstorming.  The idea is to widen
the scope of the search in hopes of a serendipitous solution.

We can also use genetic algorithmns and the like to come up with a
molecular design and try to create a compound or set of compounds
from the results.  This is sort of like crossing a butterfly with a bee to
come up with a graceful stinging bug.  Many of the crossbreeds will
be unviable monsters, but one might work.

After this, the cryoprotectant can be tested on nerve cells and perhaps
networks of nerves.  (Has such already been done?  I am talking about
examining the connections between cells -- which most assume are
responsible for how the brain behaves, including the mind -- for
damage.)  Finally, the cryoprotectant will be tested on whole systems,
such as a whole mouse that is alive.

Can anyone enlighten me here?

Yes, this is an obvious flaw in the Star Drek universe. Either they are
extremely fatalistic, or have laws against the retaining of teleport
files, once used, for privacy's sake. It can't be a thing making
teleport twins illegal, as Riker's accidental teleport twin has been
allowed to live.

How about being able to duplicate macroscopic objects, including all
the details of the relations between adjacent atoms, molecules, their
temperature, chemical bonds, etc.  None of this *needs* quantum
mechanics, because these properties can be described classically.  You
could argue that we'd need quantum information, but we don't know that,
and it's certainly not obvious.

I suppose I should clarify that by "quantum state", I mean things like
the spin, which are describable only by quantum mechanics and by no
other branch of physics.  Thus, things like momentum and position and
mass don't qualify, because they can be described classically.

Another major difference between this "teleportation" and true
teleportation is that, ideally, teleportation would be able to
duplicate the object at the far end *without* the need for raw material
at the other end.  For example, being able to teleport something into
orbit is impossible unless you can build the object from *nothing* at
the far end.  (Well, not *nothing*.  You'd have to get the energy from
somewhere, possibly the vacuum.)  The "teleportation" being discussed
here does nothing of the sort.  It can't dulpicate a molecule, all it
can do is transfer the quantum state of, say, a molecule of H2O to
another H2O molecule far away, but *you need an H2O molecule at the
other end*.  It says nothing about *building* an H2O molecule if all
you have is H and O.  And of course if it's something more complex,
like a brick, then you need a brick at the other end (a *completely
identical* brick, in all respects down to every last atom in every
position, except the quantum state of all its constituent atoms and
molecules), and all this process does is duplicate the quantum state of
the brick.  Big deal.  Do you think the quantum state of the brick is
important?

>The quantum state is all there is to say about an object.

I hope I've clarified this above.

>information than you'd need to duplicate consciousness, but it's definitely

It may or may not be relevant.  You've made no argument that it is.
Please do so.

>An MRI scanner will change the quantum state of your brain and thus it will 
>change you

Changing the spin of some of the particles in my brain does not change *me*.
As far as I know, the latest research on how memory works seems to indicate
memories are stored by chemical reactions that re-arrange molecules between
neurons.  The spin of atoms that constitute the molecules is irrelevant.

Once again, you are comparing apples and oranges. If such high strength
construction were to be used in vehicles, it would be applied to both
minicars and 1/2 ton pickups, so in my analogy as amended by you, both
the 98lbder and the linebacker would have padding, since they would both
have "current technology". In such a case, who would be hurt more????
Stop avoiding the answer you know I am expecting....

In the case of you cop/kevlar vest  vs. bullet: Its easy to stop a
bullet, as its a puny little thing, and the vest does its job not by
being impervious to bullets, but by being impervious enough that they
don't penetrate all the way through by the time the vest has spread ALL
of the bullets kinetic energy across the wearer's entire chest surface.
TO be able to use your analogy, the cop is the 1/2ton truck, and the
bullet is the minicar. Ever look at what happens to a bullet that hits a
vest???? Is it reusable? I didn't think so. Is the cop reusable? Most of
the time. Thanks for the proof....

Because electric plants are big, they typically are built on a pipeline
of whatever fuel they are using. Even coal plants are built alongside
railroads, oil and gas on pipelines, hydro on rivers, wind on hilltops,
etc. Because their sites are chosen ahead of time for their ease of
supply of their fuel, they get a boost from inexpensive supply. They
then, because they operate at constant max efficiency RPM, get
efficiency gains from that, which in themselves are a HUGE savings over
an IC vehicle. Gasoline or ethanol operated IC vehicles must depend on a
much less efficient distribution mechanism that requires fleets of
trucks, millions of miles of roads, etc. Such IC vehicles then are
almost never running at their peak efficiency. Because EVs, at their
power source, use less fuel than an IC vehicle does in situ, the energy
costs to refine fuel per vehicle are lower.

Right.  So, to be clear, the first line of the first quote is correct,
but the second is *not*.  An MRI makes dramatic changes on the quantum
level, but absolutely *no* detectable change in the personality,
memory, etc., of the individual.  Thus, the spin state of the hydrogen
atoms in your brain is absolutely irrelevant to the health and welfare
of your mind, and thus, need not be duplicated by a teleportation
device.

You mean, stop refusing to accept the answer we know is wrong.

Are you asserting that, today, all classes of vehicle have similar 
safety features?  If so, you are misinformed.  In general, massive 
vehicles rely on their mass for protection from accidents; less 
massive vehicles rely more on good design and good materials.  In a 
medium-speed collision between a Mercedes and a dump truck, we can 
expect the Mercedes to be totalled and the dump truck to have a few 
scratches; and we can expect the Mercedes occupants, uninjured, to 
administer first aid to the dump truck driver.

OK, we need to be far more careful about the use of the term "state".
It's being thrown around haphazardly without being defined sufficiently
carefully.  Obviously, if by "state" you mean everything there is to
know about the particle --- it's energy, momentum, position,
temperature, the chemical bonds it's participating in, vibrational
frequency, spin, etc, then obviously the state is crucial.  However,
there are classical (Newtonian) elements of the state, and Quantum
elements of the state.  Things like the spin are describable *only* by
Quantum Mechanics, and have no meaning in classical physics.  It is
these kinds of states, describable *only* by QM, that Quantum
Teleportation is capable of duplicating.  *None* of the other kinds of
states are.  Quantum teleportation does not duplicate momentum.  It
doesn't duplicate energy.  It doesn't duplicate temperature.  And most
importantly, it does not, and *is not capable of*, creating chemical
bonds amongst previously unattached atoms at the receiving end in order
to duplicate a molecule at the transmitting end.  A chemical reaction
requires *energy* (among other things), and quantum teleportation does
not transmit energy (as Erik correctly points out), it only transmits
information.

Correct.  Even more important, if you want to transport the state of an
NH4 molecule from point A to point B, then you must have an NH4 molecule at
point B in order to have the state transfered.  It is NOT suficient to
have one unattached N and four unattached H molecules at point B.

>The state of the particles creates the larger object.

Only, as I said, if "state" includes the classical components of state,
which are *not* duplicated by quantum teleportation.

Incorrect.  They believe that in 10 years they will be able to transport
the quantum state of molecules from point A to point B, but the molecules
must already exist, as identical molecules, in all their spledour of
chemical bonds, at point B.  Again, you need *energy* to create a molecule
from constituent atoms, and quantum teleportation does not provide that
energy.

To a certain extent it's the other way around: because electric

There's not exactly much choice about the latter, you know.

I was under the impression that the whole point to this was that the 
scientists could change the property (before measuring) of the stay 
at home particle to be the opposite of a pre-selected particle?  So 
the only time the result would be random would be if the particle was 
already in that configuration...which I understood to be the reason 
that there is a limit of 75% (according to CNN).  If you can select 
which way the photon is polarized without actually measuring it, then 
you can commo FTL.

In one respect I am already less than impressed with this survey, and 
I haven't started reading the results.

By their definitions I am "semi-connected".

At work I have two phone lines, voice mail, a pager, an Internet 
email address, and two PCs on a network which includes a T1 Internet 
connection (and a third PC which I rarely turn on).  I am browsing 
the Web (work-related) at least twice a week, and receive an average 
of probably 20 emails per working day.  My email is usually running 
constantly.  At the end of the workday I get on a bus and RELAX for 
forty-five minutes.  Since I am relaxing, I don't want to be working 
on a laptop or talking on a cell phone, so I don't have those.

I go home to a telephone with answering machine, a modem on a 
separate line, a different Internet email address, a half-dozen very 
active newsgroups (average about 200 new messages per day not 
including spam), a couple active Internet mailing lists (average 
about 60 emails per day not including spam), a half dozen web sites 
that I look in on at least once a week, and another half dozen per 
week that are mentioned in the newsgroups or email and I judge worth 
checking.

If that is "semi-connected", then anyone who is actually connected 
really should get a life.

I would have suggested a different standard:

Count the number of telephones, modems, fax machines, pagers, cell 
phones, and answering machines dedicated for your use (including 
your family stuff); add one if you *use* some sort of modem pool or 
communal high-speed internet connection at least once a week, ditto 
for a communal fax machine.  Include voicemail.  If you have a 
multiline phone and the lines are dedicated to your use (with no more 
than two coworkers, but including your family), count the extra 
lines.  Count the email addresses you check at least three times a 
week.  Count the web sites or public archives you have maintained in 
the last three months.  Count the mailing lists you've subscribed to 
that result in at least three emails a week on average.  Count the 
web sites you visit at least once a week, and Usenet groups you read 
at least twice a week (that actually have non-spam messages that 
often), and the Web sites that you visit in a typical week as a 
result of receiving the URL in an email or newsgroup message in that 
same week..  Add them all up.  Three or fewer is unconnected.  Four 
to nine is semi-connected. Ten to twenty-seven, connected.  
Twenty-eight up, super-connected.

(The exact numbers that define the categories are not essential.)

By the way, by this standard my count is 30; my 16-year-old 
daughter's is 12.

Occasionally, when other factors weigh larger in determining the plant

Depends. I know of a river in upstate NH that was completely redirected
when it was dammed up because another route would give it a greater
drop  without a long penstock. For a while in the early part of the
century it was one of the largest dammed bodies of water in the world.
Umbagog Lake, Lake Azizcohos, and Moosemeguntic Lake were all treated in
this manner and were three of the largest dammed lakes in the world. The
Volga in Russia was redirected from flowing into the Caspian to provide
water to Siberian wheat farmers.

Yes.  Although institutions are more evolved than designed.
Somehow it's even more frustrating when people accept the
random offenses of the design of some anonymous nerd, than
when they cave in to bad ideas that have the weight of tradition
behind them.  It's a spectrum, though: think of architecture,
computer standards and conventions, government forms, road signs...

I am going to cordially withdraw from this debate, because I can't
answer that question because I don't know.  The problem is this:
things like politics, social practice, and economics, are far
too complicated to analyze in detail with the current state of
human knowledge.  Every few years, I get into a conversation like
this and get convinced about one thing or another.  Later, some
party pooper like you :-) comes along and shakes my faith in my
previous conclusion.  This *always* happens to me in these types
of conversations, no matter how many times I have them.  The only
conclusion I can draw is that either I'm just not smart enough to
figure these things out, or that *nobody* is smart enough to see
all the sides to figure these things out conclusively.

I like to pretend I'm a scientist on most days.  That means I like
to see facts and figures before I make a decision.  The problem, as
we've demonstrated above, is that there isn't even agreement on what
constitutes a salient fact, or what things we should count when we're
building numbers to argue with.  I quote numbers, then you contest them.
I can go and try to quote more numbers and facts, but we'll probably
disagree on what facts are relevant and what constitutes a valid cost
when pricing a barrel of oil.  I really should learn to stay out of
these conversations.  At least I'm getting better at withdrawing sooner.

Understanding Quantum Teleportation is far, far easier in comparison.
I think I'll stick to that thread, and go back to being a lurker on
this one.

Typically because a vehicle like a Mercedes has passive restraints like
airbags, while the dumptruck usually does not, but would be irrelevant
in any case because you typically don't see a dumptruck driver wearing a
seatbelt.

Only if you beleive that the "quantum mind" stuff is true. The spin
states of nuclei are all random normally.

I suggest you forward your definition to the folks at hotwired. The author
of the piece sort of (politely) implied that he had some of the same
misgivings/complaints you have. From my standpoint: I've had a dedicated
modem line for almost ten years; I've had my own domain name for at least
one; that ought to make me "connected" right there. :)

No. But release version freeware with source code sufficiently tested
by several competent people: yes.

Something like 2.0.32 version of Linux kernel.

Yes, their standards are a bit strange.  I, too, am "semi-connected"
despite getting a MB of email a week (30 lists), having my own
domain, a 4-machine network at home, and a dedicated connection at
work (here I work as a Webmaster), because I lack a cell phone and
pager.  Sometimes even the connected want to be unreachable.

Oh hell,. and dadgummit too.

I have to drive all the way up to Flagstaff tomorrow just to get my little 
Lee Enfield rifle back  It's chambered for the Winchester .308 
cartridge, of which I'm sorta fond, and you really don't want to screw 
around with the otherwise nice day of an emotional guy like me.  

(I wore out the firing pin, and it was still under warranty.  I had done 
the logical thing and shot it a lot.  Broke the firing pin the first day, 
dadgummit.)

It wasn't the piss-poor third-world  ammunition that did us in.  It was 
the friggin' firin' pin on the Enfield itself!  My son and I just wore the 
sucker out with a typical morning's shooting practice.  God help the
Indian Army.

Well, the sportin' goods store now claims ithe rifle is fixed. They sent 
my rifle back to the factory.  (Sure.  Would that be the factory in Essex 
or the other one in Bangla Desh.  Cowards!))    I don't believe it for a 
minute.  But we will see.  Those damned little SKS rifles have a 
little 39 mm  short round, don't they?  I hear they load a lot faster than
a 
sniper's rifle.  You just never know where the lead is gonna land.

See you in the forest, maybe.

I fully support your right to spend your money in any manner you 
choose, but think about what you are asking us to congratulate you 
for:  the same $300 could have bought one year of a cryonics contract 
and the insurance to cover it.  Or $300 worth of stock in an advanced 
technology startup.  Or $300 to Extropy Institute or other worthy 
scientific organization.

 Subject: Beware of HTML Mail

I received a spam mail today that was rather sinister.  Many spams that I
receive request that you click on the hyperlink to go to their site.  This
one, however, was much different.  I am running IE4.0, and I simply
highlighted the new message in my mailbox, and clicked on the subject to
read it.  It immediately downloaded and initialized a java applet that
took control of my browser, opened a session to their site as I sat in
amazement.  I then quickly (out of fear) stopped the connection to that
site, went back to the mail message and viewed the source to see what was
in it. Here is the first few lines of the mail - I numbered the lines so
they won't be interpreted as HTML/E-mail here: 

1. <html>
2. <head>
3. <title>webtour</title>
4. </head>
5. <body>
6. <applet
 7.    code=sitewalk.class
 8.    codebase=http://www.netinstrument.com/applet
 9.    name=sitewalk
10.    width=2
 11.   height=2 >
12. <param name="page1" value="jpg, , 300, 200, 4000, ,
start-http://www.netinstrument.com/email2.htm, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, ">
(line 12 repeated for various links at their site)

I never really cared much about the spam I received, because it was really
non-intrusive for the most part. This, however, was scary. It took control
of my IE4 Browser, and forced me to their site. Who knows what the sites
web pages do if you let it run its course. 

Net users, beware. The risks of simply receiving spam have just
skyrocketed.  Turn off auto-preview mode, and look at the *source* of the
message prior to opening the mail item.  I never cared about this before,
but I really feel violated in some weird electronic sense.

Perhaps someday, but nobody has claimed to have done that yet. Teleportation 
means going from point A to point C without going through point B, I said 
they've done that with photons, you said they did not.

Nonsense, if classical physics was correct matter wouldn't even be stable.  
There is no way atoms or molecules can be understood with ideas Newton or 
Maxwell would be comfortable with, and there is no way the nature of the 
chemical bond can be understood without quantum mechanics. In high school 
chemistry they make you memorize rule of thumb approximations, like valances 
and the periodic table, that sort of thing can be useful in simple cases 
involving small molecules, but without quantum mechanics  you can't have the 
slightest understanding of why those rules are what they  are. And much more 
is required for the really interesting stuff, like how  enzymes work, or why
proteins fold up the way they do, or where their reactive site is.

All states are quantum states. Classical states are only approximations,  
sometimes good and sometimes very bad approximations of quantum states.

That just demonstrates the superiority of Quantum Mechanics, spin effects  
every other branch of physics, and every branch of life for that matter, and 
all matter for that matter. The Pauli Exclusion Principle explains why many 
particles with integer spin, like photons, can be in the same quantum state 
but no two particles with half integer spin, like electrons, can be. 
A pretty esoteric idea that has no consequences in the everyday world, right? 
Wrong.

If photons had half integer spin and thus 2 photons could not be in the same  
place at the same time then you couldn't see the moon or the stars or even  
the man sitting next to you. Photons from an object you wanted to look at  
would collide and be hopelessly scrambled by photons moving at right angles  
to them. You'd be blind as a bat.

Even worse, if electrons and protons had integer spin there would be nothing 
to prevent even the earth's weak gravity from collapsing matter into a 
mathematical point turning the planet into a black hole.

Is this a riddle? How can two bricks be completely identical except for being  
totally different down to the very smallest detail?

Since the quantum state of your brain is all the information there is to know 
about that object it must be relevant, I don't see why argument is necessary, 
unless you're trying to make a case for a soul.

I think the enormous magnetic field in the largest MRI machines can be

True, and that doesn't mean quantum effects are unimportant, it means  
classical physics is inferior.

No. A photon has a well defined momentum and energy, if those weren't  
duplicated then quantum teleportation has not happened, I've not read the 
article in Nature yet but apparently it has happened, unless fraud has been  
committed and I doubt that.

The quantum teleportation effect and the uncertainty principle etc. could
be explained by looking at the effect from more than four dimensions. If
we assume that the universe is also made up of, say, a fifth spatial
dimension that has collapsed down to an infinitely small point, then
although from our point of view two particles may appear to be separated
by billions of light years, in the higher dimension, they could be in the
very same place. This is analogous to writing "A" and "B" a few inches
apart on a flat piece of paper ( 2 dimensions) and then folding the paper
(through the 3rd dimension) so that A and B connect. (sorry, this is a bit
a tired analogy, but it works!)

Similarly, if there are up to 11 or even 22 dimensions, as some physicists
believe, that have collapsed down to infinitely small points, then all
places in the universe are in a very certain way "at the same place at the
same time". This is a "spooky" thought.

I'm somehow reminded of the passage in the christian bible where Christ's feet
were rubbed down with an expensive ointment, and he was criticized because 
the money "should" have been used for the poor (insert whatever cause you want).

I've always had the weird idea that "Dammit, I wanted to do it" was about the
best justification. ;-)

Congats Anton! It makes you happy, so go out to the range and have a bang up

By the way, for those interested, a reasonably good book I read recently
on cosmology is "The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report" by
Timothy Ferris. It was here, I think, that I read that physicists have
speculated that the ultimate structure of matter at the quantum level may
be miniature black holes!! In other words, the smallest currently-known
subatomic particles such of quarks may be made up of incredibly small
localized singularities! This fascinating idea links up the two disparate
theories of ralativity and quantum mechanics. It also brings in string
theory and multi-dimensional hyperspace.


"The whole Shebang" is not quite as good as "Hyperspace" by Kaku, but it
is more up to date.

My strong sense is that the creators of the criteria (not, it is worth
noting, the author of the piece) were looking specifically for *marketing
opportunities*. Either direct or indirect. Junk faxes, junk cold call
voicemail, junk pages included. *Shudder*. 

Consider: if you own a PCS cellphone with integrated paging and voicemail,
you get three points with one product. 

Consider: a Palm Pilot was probably not counted as a laptop (I am surmising
here). Why? Shareware SW predominates.

I think my explanation is plausible.

Hi there folks. I've been reading this list for a few weeks now, but I just 
thought I should add, for the record, that there is at least one transhumanist 
living in Montreal.

Oh, and I should point out that I consider myself a Transhumanist, and not an 
Extropian, since it has become clear to me that I have no idea WHAT the creator 
of this list means by the term Extropian. I joined this list under the belief 
(and the list info said nothing to change this belief) that extropy was 
someones pet term for transhumanism. It was not until the recent debate with 
the Dutch Excedo folks that I learned that the Extropy Institute considered it 
had ownership of the term, and of this mailinglist. So, if the list becomes 
pay-only, I'll probably drop out, since I haven't yet been convinced I want to 
be an Extropian, whatever that is.

And finally, on the topic of Signal-to-Noise ratios, I think you folks are 
spoiled. I'm a member of something like 15 assorted mailing lists, and this one 
has one of the highest S/N ratios for an unmoderated list that I've ever seen.

I also thought the definition of "connected" was wrong.  I don't count because
I don't have a beeper, but couldn't live without my laptop, a steady e-mail
connection and a cell phone glued to my ear.  Go figure.

I believe the survey is important because it is a relatively well thought-out
set of questions filtered through at least some proxy for advanced telecom
usage, yielding a picture of the social and political attitudes of such
people.  The thing I found most interesting was the extent to which those
attitudes did and did not reflect extropian values: The survey's "connecteds"
seem to be fairly libertarian on issues of personal liberty and capitalism,
but still seemed to have an abiding faith in existing political institutions
AND were, in the majority, practicing religionists.

The "interesting" part is the "extropians-mail-list-as-social-gathering"
thing, Max.  The extropian part is the fact that gun ownership seems to be a
little higher-than-average among extropians.  (Gizmo-freak libertarians,
situated disproportionately in the western U.S.)

BTW, I have two SKSs.  The first was also Russian, also 1952 vintage, also
virgin; the second an 80s vintage Chinese gun that had seen at least some
service.  Although both are extremely fine weapons, despite the conventional
wisdom, the Chinese gun is more accurate because it has a smoother trigger
mechanism. (I use the Chinese gun for boar hunting.) I recommend removing the
trigger assembly (I'll explain how by private e-mail if you like), soaking it
in gasoline (or other suitable degreaser), thoroughly brushing it out with a
wire brush and then re-lubricating it with a very light machine oil.  This
will take about half of the "clickiness" out of the trigger.  Also, had you
bought your gun two years ago, you'd have paid half as much! Finally, be on
the watch for the occasional "slam fire" double (or more) ignition; if this
happens, keep the damned thing pointed down range and it'll be over before you
can say "oh shit!". (I also have some must-do maintenance tips for you, Anton,
if you've never owned a gas-operated semi-auto, if you'd like them.)

Be careful and have fun.

>but still seemed to have an abiding faith in existing political institutions

I think it is possible to read this aspect as "I'll be damned if I'll let
the bozos run things *without* my vote", rather than any "abiding faith". I
mean, I am one of those that think "Don't vote, it only encourages the
bastards"... but I _do_ vote, every chance I get; more now than (say) 10
years ago.

>AND were, in the majority, practicing religionists.

Four devotional activities of _some_ kind a month includes all sorts of

Hi everybody,

After discussing the many options that we received we are proud 
to present the new, soon to be oficially registered, 
                     Dutch Transhumanist Society:
                        
                            "TRANSCEDO"

And the winner of the contest and a $100 digital giftcertificate 
from Amazon books is:         Max More

    Check out the new site at http://www.dse.nl/~transced

   (we'll be registering our URL soon with Internic)

Henri has done a great job updating our website and work is underway 
to further improve the logo and textual content. We are also working 
on other promotional materials, it's time to go 'live' in the Dutch 
media with Transhumanism. As always we welcome any ideas for 
improvement or links to be added.

Our gratitude goes to all who participated and helped turning a problem
into something that will benefit us as an organisation and our relations
with ExI. Thankyou all, very much, for you support and ideas.

Best regards,
Arjen

Not necessarily. Monodisperse, spheroidal-particle diamond dust has been
suggested as an additive to ICE lubricants (for the same reason as
buckyballs).  Concerning diamond-fueled ICEs: diamond dust as a solid
rocket fuel additive has been discussed by the Russkies.  Don't know
whether anything ever came out of it.

Sounds workable. Not *that* sinister in itself, unless Java has some
serious secrutiy holes. But that it can make your browser at least
briefly run out of your control is disturbing, at least
psychologically (tools should always obey their users, not other
people), and think I can come up with some sneaky uses of cookies to
create targeted marketing for the people who happens to run the applet
(since you get a web connection from the user, you will know he has
seen the mail; that information may be useful for advertising people).

I think in general, this is the main problem: many people have become
too dependent on running their mails through their browsers (this is
why we get those irritating HTML tags in our mails sometimes). It
would be a good idea to have a filter that removes applet-tags and
similar stuff, or simply use a normal, text-only mail reader (here
Anders bursts out in a song-and-dance number about Gnus for Emacs :-).

Why does not linux out-compete Microsoft? (Rhetorical question, let's
not start arguing about the merits of free software, please).

I have no doubt that in the hopefully-not-too-far future we will have
free genetic source code, fairly well tested (but remember, even a
very simple test of a medication is hideously expensive, not something
you can easily do without serious financial backing) and available on
the net to run in our home sequencers. But most people will not use
it, they will instead use the genes from Microgene because they are
widely advertised, widely known, well tested, comes in a convenient
packet and everybody else are using them. Why try a freeware gene
which may not meet FDA standards when you can get a plug-n-play gene?

The problem here is, beside the normal complications of the software
and pharmaceuticals industries, that testing new medications and
methods is so expensive and hard to do. Any ideas of how it can be
done more cheaply? Perhaps something like the voluntary medical
database mentioned in Halperin's _The Truth Machine_?

Once we have reliable bulk-transfecting retrovirus vectors (targeting just
the brain would be fine), we can revolutionize first stages of the
cryonical suspension. Assuming future terminal cryonics patients have full
control over their destinies, we can consider transfecting human cells of
such patients with natural-origin and/or engineered polyol and
antifreeze-protein- prooducing enzymatic systems. Zero-spatial-gradient
perfusion from within, so to speak -- complementary to current modus
operandi.

I would say it is a bit of all three. There is research being done on
finding good cryoprotectants, but it is more narrow than your
approach. A wide search would be useful, but it would be expensive and
we need good specifications. I suppose the cryo people can comment
more extensively on this topic.

I think this is the hard part, since damage is not just quantitative,
it is also qualitative. Is it good if the cell walls are whole but
some proteins are denaturated? I would suggest that the effect on the
brain is the most important, but even there it is not clear what
structures are the most important (sacrifice axons for synapses, or
vice versa?).

Yes, but you can't. I think you're confusing speculation with fact, several  
members of this list may have claimed that the recent quantum teleportation  
experiment was communication faster than light, but none of the original 
researchers said that, in fact they specifically said the very opposite.

I believe if we get good specifications from the start, the search can be done
much more cheaply.  Also, if the search is kept in the public's eye, the cost
might be lessened -- provided most participants agree with this.

I agree, but some rough measures can be used, and as we learn more
better measures can be developed.  We might, e.g., find some protein(s)
that are more sensitive to such damage that are an easy indicator of the
effectiveness of the cryoprotectant.  If such could be found, then the
measurement process could be reduced to testing just that(those)
protein(s) initially to find good cryoprotectants, then doing more extensive
tests after finding a good pool of candidates.

Are any cryonics people listening?  I would appreciate any comments
on this from them.

We're arguing at cross purposes here.  I have no argument with this
statement.  Of course QM is a better approximation than classical
mechanics.  (We don't know that it's perfect, but it's certainly
a better approximation.)  My point is that, for the MACROSCOPIC
observable properties of most objects to be duplicated, quantum
information is not needed.  A classical description is good enough.
And, as far as I understand how brains work, everything in your mind
that defines who you are is encoded in chemical bonds that can be
described classically.  Physicists and chemists that study molecular
dynamics often use only classical descriptions of the particles.
(This is very close to my research area, so I can make this particular
statement flatly, and know it's true.)

I am *not* claiming that we don't need to know anything about QM to
have teleportation; I'm claiming that there are properties that need
not be duplicated in order to produce a FUNCTIONALLY identical
duplicate.  Spin, for example, is probably one of the things that
doesn't need to be duplicated.  And since spin is the only thing
they've claimed to have duplicated, I think calling this process
"teleportation" is a very bad choice of name.

>All states are quantum states. Classical states are only approximations,

See above.  I agree.  The question is whether we *need* the approximations
to be better than classical in order to duplicate the macroscopic properties
of objects.  (By "macroscopic" I mean anything bigger than an atom.)

We can describe the position of every atom in the brick relative to
every other atom without resorting to QM.  If you duplicate that, I
claim that you have a functionally identical brick.  I don't care what
the spin states are of the atoms in my brick, as long as it can still
be used to build my house.  Similarly, I don't care about the spin
states of the atoms in my brain, as long as my memories and personality
and everything else about my mind is duplicated.  And as I believe
MRI scans prove, the spin states of the atoms are indeed irrelevant to
to workings of the brain.

That's interesting, I hadn't heard that some people claim to be able to
detect the field.  However, I don't know how I can state the relevance
any plainer than I did already: MRI scans make dramatic changes to the
brain at the quantum level, and yet the brain's functioning is not
affected.  I think that's clear evidence that spin information, at least,
is not relevant to the brain's working.

I browsed the original article several months ago.  The only
property that was duplicated was spin.  I don't recall that it was
actually photons; if that was the case, it would have been polarization
that was duplicated.  In any case, the process doesn't "duplicate"
energy because the photon already needs to exist at the destination
and as I've stated several times already, this process does not
change the energy of anything at the destination.  And it doesn't
duplicate momentum either.  (That wouldn't be very useful if you
wanted to teleport something into a reference frame moving at a
different velocity, would it?)  They've only dulplicated polarization
(or spin).

Chemical life extension thusfar has show much promise though
it suffers from many pitfalls.  The promise is that animal and
human studies seem to prove that certain diet regimens (CRAN)
and supplementation increase lifespan (vitamin C).  Also, as the
chemistry of aging and dying are better understood, means of
avoiding them are becoming better.

There are several pitfalls, however.  These can be divided into
two major areas.  The first is understanding the mechanisms of
life extending chemicals.  Right now, there are several causal
models of aging.  These models are not necessarily alternative
models.  They do not always contradict one another.  Thus,
aging does seem to occur from the accumulation of damage
from free radicals and glycolisation (actually, two models) AND
ALSO from hormonal changes, etc.  Sometimes a link between
a chemical - e.g., Vitamin E -- and a model -- here, free radical
damage -- is made.  In this example, Vitamin E is a powerful
antioxidant which prevents free radical damage among other
things.  Even so, for the most part, there is no general system
or systematic way of studying these processes.  Of course, this
is a bit of an overgeneralization and the human body is an
extremely complex system.

One would hope for models of aging processes to be developed 
then for means of chemical interruption and reversal of these 
same processes to be invented.  This more proactive approach
would most likely spawn the creation of better antiaging
therapies.

The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery
systems are not very advanced.  Of course, the body can take
care of itself mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often
does work at extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in
your car gets old, you don't merely add fresh oil or oil additives,
you change the filter.  Following the analogy further, when you
can't replace a car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical
life extension is more like filling up with detergent gasoline
then doing auto repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives,
this will be much easier...  but in the interim, we need better life
extension methods.  Many people will not make it to the promised
land of nanotech.

Not a parallel example, and not even quoted accurately.
Matthew 26:6:  a woman applies expensive oil onto Jesus's head during the 
'last supper' and is criticized by the disciples, who say it should 
have been sold for a great sum to buy food for the poor.  Jesus' reponse 
is to the effect that a gift should be accepted graciously.

First, I would like to see some hard numbers before I would believe
that gun ownership is any higher among Extropians than among other
members of the population.  Secondly, I would like you to explain
how the celebration of accountrements of destruction, however well
designed, as a social function of a group devoted to human evolution,
intellectual development and life extension.  

If you detect a strain of anger in this post, it comes from too many 
years spent cleaning up the senseless human waste wreaked by weapons. 
How anyone can look in the eyes of someone crippled and maimed by one 
of these tools and then joyously proclaim ownership of one is simply 
beyond my limited intellectual capacity.

Ah, you got one of those Vietnamese surplus guns. A freind of mine
(those of you in Seattle may know of him as "Scootch") has been bringing
all sorts of goodies in from there for several years now. Ollie North
set him up  with the scheme. He also has for sale several million
various models of M-1A, M-14, M-16, and M-60 carbines and machine guns
that the Vietnamese captured in the fall of Saigon. As you may remember,
we had been shipping tons of weapons over  there during our pullout in
the early 70's, to arm the south vietnamese so they could "fight for
themselves", an outgrowth of the "hearts and minds" part of the Pheonix
program run by the CIA. Of course, most of these weapons were still in
their crates when the NVA rolled into town, and are still in their
crates today as they are being sold all over the world. THey've got Huey
helicopters for sale, Cobra gunships, bombs, missiles etc... It would be
interesting to see what sort of cargo cult springs up over time in
Saigon, excuse me, Ho Chi Minh City.

It speaks more strongly to taking the "cause" so seriously that you lose all 
perspective. Everything must be for the cause, and far be it for simple human 
enjoyment to count for any such. That may not be what you intended, but that's 
how your post came across. As did Max's. I have this funny feeling that if
it were something you "approved" of the reaction would have been much 
different. Neither post said outright "I disapprove". They rather tried a
sidelong approach of questioning germaneness. Compared to some of the other 
posts on this list of late it had more to do with capitalism and the freedom
to do what you want in the face of criticism. That's pretty libertarian
in spirit, and it was interesting to see the reactions to it.
As to the accuracy of the quote, my apologies. I was remembering it from long 
ago. I think, however that the insistence on accuracy has more to do with 
trying to discredit the poster rather than refuting the point made.
I sense a lot of anger in your posts on this subject. I could largely care less
about the gun debate, and was more reacting to Anton finding something he 
enjoyed and seeing someone trying to throw cold water on that enjoyment. 
Geez, lighten up.

Extropian in that he has stood up and accepted personal responsibility
to:

1) Exercise his 2nd amendment rights
2) Defend himself, his loved ones, and his and their property.
3) Expand his personal experiences, etc.

As a caveat I would say: a) I hope Anton has taken, or plans to take in
the near future, gun and hunter safety courses, possibly even self
defense courses, and b) I wish he had bought an American made firearm. I
could have helped him acquire, for the same price or less, a new, fully
tested and posessing a lifetime warranty, Ruger rifle. When I mean
lifetime, I mean LIFETIME. I've seen people send in the most abused,
messed up guns to be fully repaired or replaced at no charge. Anton
couldn't hope to get that from his Vietnamese arms merchant.

The only thing I would criticize Anton about is that.

But Kathryn, if some crack smoking gangsta decides to cap him in the

worthless, and when the FBI or ATF decides that the Extropy Institute is
nothing but a bunch of vitamin popping, head freezing, computer porno
downloading cultists, who is gonna defend it??? I nominate Anton as
adjutant commander of the Extropian Militia.....

SOunds like the article was written by someone living the Hollywood idea
of success. I for one consider a cell phone and a pager to be more of an
enslavement than an aid. A person who is truly connected posesses the
ability, willingness, and freedom to tell the rest of the world to
bugger off when the need strikes.

And when Martha berated Mary Magdalene for sitting at Christs feet in
rapt attention to his sermon rather than helping her with the chores,
Jesus told here that Mary had chosen a far greater chore.

I could not agree more. I think this shows that when two intelligent logical

Dear Anton:
You may wish to test your new toy by loading it, inserting the barrel in
your rectum, wiggling it about, and using it to test for hemorrhoids (and
brains).
Enjoy,

OK, Then, so far, including myself, I've counted four gun owners just in
responses to the original post, and including Anton. We can do a little
census right here. 

All subscribers to the list, please respond as to whether you own a gun.
Of course, privacy rights would allow anyone to not respond, for fear of
being labelled a gun toting nut by the more politically sensitive here,
or if their local jurisdiction puts a crimp on the subscriber publicly
acknowledging ownership (a human rights violation if ever I have seen
one). You may also contact me privately by email if you wish.

No, thank you.
My reaction to Anton's posting has more to do with my reasons for 
being on this list rather than the fact that he owns a gun.  I'm here 
to work with others to find the new ways in which humans will move 
beyond their present state.  I'm looking for the new stories that 
will be told, and the new technologies that will take us there.

If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed 
solely for the killing and maiming of other humans relates to the 
purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along, 
I will listen.

Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't 
explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we 
working towards, anyway?

Yes, I'm a gun owner. 
I was rather surprised by the vehemence of the reaction from some here on
the list. Ah well, tis the sad truth that not everyone will agree with you in 
this world. :-)
I think my reasons for having the weapons I do are pretty reasonable. I don't
foresee getting any others. I think the reasons I have them are somewhat 
instructive in this discussion.

The three I have are:

A shotgun, that I keep because it's the only thing I have that belonged to 
my paternal grandfather who died in an auto wreck shortly after I was born.

A Russian Tokarev pistol that was brought back from World War 2 by my father
(a medic) after he won it playing chess against an SS Major while the war was 
still going on. (Now there's a treasured family story for you. :-)
(I'd not like to give up either of them. Too much sentiment value for me.)

The last one would come perhaps closest to being "reprehensible" in the eyes
of some here.

A 25 auto, that I got while I was in the army. I was a radioteletype operator
and as such worked in a metal radio shack on the back of a pickup truck. 
There was just too little space for the M16 I was issued to be useable there,
either if someone yanked open the door, or if I had to abandon the shelter in
a hurry and had no time to fumble with the weapons rack for the rifle on the 
way out. (My opinion still is that a 45 or 9mm would be a more appropriate
weapon to issue for that job). I wanted something I could easily conceal in 
a pocket or some such, and would give me a small chance in a bad situation.
I was stationed with front line infantry and artillery battalions then, and 
was in Korea when both the KAL shootdown, and much more ominously, the 
bombing by North Korean agents that killed several members of the South Korean
cabinet (1983-1984) on a diplomatic visit by Chun Doo Hwan to Rangoon. We
(the people with me in the 2nd Infantry Division) were very worried that 
war was iminent. The ROK military fully deployed to the border, and the 
sentiment among much of the Korean government was to strike. Thankfully, it
didn't happen. Not only were there US forces in the south, but Russian advisors
stationed with the forces in the north, so it would have immediately involved
forces from two superpowers. Scary.
So that purchase wasn't motivated by paranoia IMHO. But a considerable 
concern for my own life in a war.

The only thing I've done with them for years is to check on them once a 
year or so to renew the coat of oil on them.
Now I agree, there's no real reason of utility (at least any more) for having
even one of them, let alone all three. But I have them, and they'll likely stay
locked up where they are. The chances of them getting stolen are quite small,
and I've never been arrested (and to my feeble recollection not been in a fight
since the 8th grade or so), so I don't rate them a major hazard to me or 
society. The high voltage power supplies, and lasers I work with when doing 
research are much more of a threat to my safety. Though I try to be careful, 
and haven't been in an accident since I was 23 (12 years), I'm sure driving 
my car is a far greater threat to my neighbors than they are.
I don't think that makes me some sort of gun wacko, tho I'll be happy to
entertain comment otherwise. If the laws were changed to make having them
illegal, I'd likely give them up, or send them to a member of the family
that lived somewhere they weren't illegal. (As to whether I think the gummint
would be right in doing that is immaterial. I'll use legal means in my disputes
with it, thank you.)
I will conceed that I have in the past known a gun owner that scared the 
living daylights out of me (A former Earth First type who then joined up with
the NRA, and was working on a PhD in physics. Go figure). But I'd rate that 
was a problem with the man, not the guns per se.

I have no such arguments, but the vibe that I get on this is very similiar 
to a number of people I knew in the L5 Society, and the National Space Society.
Most people were fine, but a small minority got to where they couldn't see 
anything about the world around save in the light of "how will this get us 
into space". They lost all sense of proportion, would attack anyone they 
saw as standing in their way, or even just not actively aiding them. 
They ultimately became a hindrance to the very goals they 
wanted as they so put off anyone else they came in contact with. In fact,
what they resembled more than anything else, were members of a fundamentalist 
religion. I doubt that's the way you really are, but it's how you're coming 
off on this thread.
Given some of the other off topic and inane dreck that's been posted to the
list of late (leading to the whole argument about restricting the list or 
creating a sublist), this thread is by no means that far out there.
I think what's happening is that we've come across a subject you have very 
strong feelings about, and yet you don't feel good about stating your 
opposition in terms of restrictions on individuals due to the libertarian 
nature of much of the traffic on the list, and so you are retreating into 
germaneness as it were, as an argument tactic by other means.

> Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't

What I'm working toward is a future that will allow me and those I care about
to have long happy lives with all sorts of wonderful new capabilities and
possibilities. I've given up a lot to go along that road. I gave up a career
in the Army. I've spent years with school debts hanging swordlike over my 
head to pursue physics when it's been repeatedly and painfully pointed out 
that I could pay them down in just a year or two of sysadmin work. 
I've moved away from family and friends to chase this nanotech phantom in the 
mist ahead of me. But I have yet to lose my sense of humor, and ability to 
laugh at the very goals I strive toward. 
The day I do, I'll be less than what I was. This is far too important (and 
speculative) to take completely seriously.
Along those lines, I refuse to subordinate what I consider one of the best 
parts of my humanity. My ability to feel joy, and to take pleasure in the 
joy of others. Anton's post was one you fealt strongly about, so you 
threw cold water on his enjoyment, and came off as sounding rather puritan. 
Again, I doubt that's the way you really are. The written format of mailing 
lists tends to give a much stronger tone to what is said than usually is meant.
I'm sure that a good bit of what I write sounds "ranting and raving" compared 
to how I mean it. All the more so, since I frequent some very high flame level 
newsgroups. If I come across as denigrating you or your feelings, my 
apologies. But just like you are sensitive to the gun debate, this excessive 
seriousness is an area that I'm a bit sensitive to.

An SKS is a nice gun, don't get me wrong. But buying American and
getting a complete lifetime warranty are worth a lot.

What pray tell, is this "evil legislation"??? If I were to amend my
buying habits for a business man's politics, I'd get rid of all of my
microsoft products because Bill Gates heavily supported the group that
broght the gun registration bill to a vote in Washington state this last
election. I gave, I hear, at least a couple hundred thousand to the
group. (Lord knows, now that I've posted this, Kathryn will probably
dump her Mac and go out and get totally Wintelled.)

They probably are cheaper. We have hardly a fraction of the welfare
state that CA has, so taxes of all kinds are lower than anywhere or
nonexistant. I can also get them much cheaper because my father is an
engineer at Ruger. Employees can purchase a gun at 40% discount every 6
months.

As to the sight picture: I have a brand new 10/22 rifle with a bull
barrel and 8x scope. Its pattern is, what is known in the industry as a
"one holer". I shoot a 1/2" pattern at 100 yards.

I also have on loan, a .44 lever action. It has a 2" group at 100 yards.
The accurizing techniques my father is enacting at the plant this winter
should be appearing on new guns in the market by Feb-Mar that will
reduce the group to less than 1" on average.

Advanced civilizations probably have extensive cooling needs. Computing
and communication equipment both work better at lower temperatures. A
cooler computer means a faster computer with lower energy needs, and a
cooler transceiver has lower thermal noise. Since these equipment cannot
operate with perfect efficiency, they will need to eliminate waste heat.

It's not too difficult to cool a system down to the temperature of the
cosmic background radiation. All you need to do is build a radiator in
interstellar space with a very large surface area, and connect it with the
system you're trying to cool with some high thermal-conductance material.

However, even at the cosmic background temperature of T=3K, erasing a bit
still costs a minimum of k*T*ln 2 = 2.87e-23 J. What is needed is a way to
efficiently cool a system down to near absolute zero. I think the only way
to do it is with black holes. 

Black holes emit Hawking radiation at a temperature of
T=h*c^3/(16*pi*G*M). With the mass of the sun, the temperature of a black
hole would be about 10^-8 K. At this temperature, erasing a bit costs only
about 10^-31 J. If you build an insulating shell outside the event horizon
of a black hole, everything inside the shell would eventually cool down to
the temperature of the black hole. However, it would not be necessary to
build a complete shell around a black hole in order to take advantage of
its low temperature. For example you can simply point the radiators of
your black hole orbiter toward the black hole and insulate the side facing
away from the black hole. 

If it's true that the only efficient way to cool material down to near
absolute zero is with black holes, we should expect all sufficiently
advanced civilizations to live near them. However testing this prediction
may be difficult to test since they would have virtually no radiation
signatures.

OK, so you have some complaints with Kathryn's tone.  That's no
big deal, minor misunderstandings arise on mailing list all the
time.

But Kathryn also had some substantive points, that in her experience
gun work against extropy, based on the horrible damage they often
are used to do to decent, good people (the best source of extropy
these days).  I think discussing substantive matters rather than
tone is more likely to produce productive results.  She has stated
she is open to evidence.  [Correct me if I've mistated anybody's
position here.]

P.S.  Sometime a puritan attitude may be the right one to take, IMO.

Hi Harry Hawk ( good to hear fromm you again ),
and other extropian,

I know nothing about wormmholes and teleportation
I'm very fired-up about information being transfered
or encrypted information being sent faster than speed of light

I'd like to see a thread on Tachyons, aren't these the hypotectical
particles that travel FTL, maybe this is the missing key to 
these wild ideas , wild ideas are great though, keep 'em comin'

Sorry Kathryn. Guns have been in my family for hundreds of years and not
one has killed anyone. They have killed: bear, wildcat, stone sheep (no
not stoned sheep, that wouldn't be sporting), numerous deer, woodchucks,
rabbits, porcupines, quail, pheasant, grouse, woodcock, geese, and
various ducks. As for self defense, my grandfather once had to defend
himself against a wildcat attack. He had a pit in the side of his chest
for the rest of his life, and a wildcat hide to show for it. Guns are
primarily used as instruments to allow us to fufill our responsibilities
as the top predator. You who live in cities have absolutely no idea what
this statement even means. There are on average 100,000 white tail deer
in the state of NH. WIthout hunters responsibly managing the size of the
herd on an annual basis, the population would quickly skyrocket without
any other predators. This would a) cause a huge die-off in a severe
winter b) cause a skyrocketing accident rate from people hitting deer
with their cars and c) attract more wolves to migrate down from Canada
to the point that when the deer population plummets, in order to find
food, they would be reduced to attacking people.

The other two purposes: a) to defend ones life and b) to defend ones
liberty, are entirely in keeping with extropian values.

We are working towards maximizing human liberty and capability. A gun is
a necessary instrument to defend the individual against statists and
criminals.

This is clearly a sensitive subject.

I don't want to engage in "rearranging my prejudices" on this one, but let
me suggest that reasonable minds may differ.

>My reaction to Anton's posting has more to do with my reasons for 
>being on this list rather than the fact that he owns a gun.  I'm here 
>to work with others to find the new ways in which humans will move

These are all valid points. Anton is "guilty" of proclaiming his
acquisition of old tech, and in that sense it is no more relevant than,
say, my announcing that I bought a new "beater" $1000 car.

>If anyone can explain to me how discussion of instruments designed 
>solely for the killing and maiming of other humans relates to the 
>purpose of breaking out of entropy and moving human evolution along, 
>I will listen.

Please don't interpret what I say as some sort of snap reaction. I've
thought about your question for several hours now, and I think it's worth
pointing out that your "solely" has a symbolic component. 

With respect, I'd like to point out that to a great many Russians, the SKS
is emblematic as a tool that helped to save their Motherland from
subjugation, and their wives and sisters from torture, rape and death, at
the hands of the Waffen SS. 

Further, as a symbol in the eyes of aggressors, sometimes the intimidation
factor is enough. This is a function in addition to the two you mention,
and it is absent if only the aggressors possess the artifact carrying the
said symbolic (and functional) content. 

>Until then, I find it sickening, and it frightens me in ways I can't 
>explain insofar as our future as posthumans.  I mean, what are we 
>working towards, anyway?

Again, important questions. I have the impression that functional diversity
implies a sheaf of strategies. If posthuman society can exist in any
meaningful sense, I suspect that some capacity to do violence will be
retained by somebody. Who? Why?

If what you mean is that you don't want to live in a world where violence
is possible--well, I tend to agree; but I don't see how to get there from
here, especially right now. This does not mean that the list should glorify
violence, or the capacity for same.

Let me reiterate that I am sincere in wanting to explore these questions,
and in wanting to avoid kneejerk interchanges--even with a certain
(*other*) "kneejerk". :)

In the few hours since I first posted this, I've gotten a number of
responses, and will include those who have expressed opposition to gun
ownership today as responding negatively to the census.

Tally so far (as of 10:20 pm EST, Sunday Dec 14):

Owners         Non-Owners
7              5 (3 of which are not American)

Total numbers of guns owned (those that did not specify numbers I
assigned a (1) to): 25

Those of you who responded positively but did not specifiy quantities,
but would like to do so, please remail me.

WHile this is hardly a significant statistical pool, but since I do know
that 60 million Americans have been estimated to own guns (out of a
total of 250 million), the 7:2 margin among American respondants does
heavily weight toward the original statement, that more subscribers on
average own guns than the general population. Please keep responding, I
will continue to tally the results for a week.

All email responses will be kept entirely confidential.

As for myself, I must first say that I personally account for 15 of the
25 guns owned by respondents, so I tend to warp the bell curve (as I do
in most things.) I have a hunting camp used by my whole family for deer
hunting and trout and salmon fishing. In the whole family, I'd be safe
to say there's at least 75 guns amongst 6 members of the family, most of
which are family heirlooms. The Fish & Game association I am a Director
of has a membership of over 350 individuals and families, none of which
that I am aware of, has ever used a firearm to kill someone, except for
during military service. We host firearms safety courses for local
youth, and sponsor junior rifle teams.

One Angstrom is a ten billionth of a meter .    [ 1 e -10 m]
This unit is obsolete and is reserved for historical use only.
The SI unit is    nm, nanometer,    [1 e -9 m]

In real surfaces, roughness below 500 dpi, about 50 micrometers is readily
observable in reflection.  Such small imperfections, while not discreetly
visible, scatter light and cause a dull surface.  A good polish takes out
scratches into the sub micron range.

Because you have to know so much more about your computer (and Linux

it would have a shot at it.

I think Laser cooling would be much more practical, temperatures about that 
low have already been reached with it, it's how a Bose Einstein condensate  
was made a few years ago. It's not easy and has only been done over a small 
area, but with Quantum Dot Lasers in the wings that will certainly improve. 

The idea is to tune a Laser beam to a frequency slightly below the quantum  
absorption  frequency of an atom, if the atom is motionless or moving away 
from the Laser it will not be able to absorb a photon from the Laser, but if 
the atom is moving toward the Laser the frequency of the photon that the atom 
sees will be shifted slightly higher due to the Doppler effect. The photon is
now right at the quantum absorption frequency, the atom will swallow it whole 
including the momentum of the photon, this will slow the atom down. 

Yes, now that the atom is excited and no longer in its ground state 
eventually the atom will re emit the photon, but the direction is random, 
it's just as likely to cool the atom further as heat it, so this has no net 
effect on the cooling process. If you have 6 such Laser beams one for, 
forward, backward, right, left, up, down, you can cool things to very close 
to absolute zero.

I first sent this to the list about a year ago, seemed like a good time to
send it again.
===========================================================================

Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff  
that has mass or energy or carries information. Strangely, some things have  
none of these attributes, although calling them "things" may be stretching a
point. It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate  
instantly and for unlimited distances. One system can influence another  
system on the other side of the universe without the slightest delay,  but it 
carries no information because the receiving system just changes from  one 
apparently random mode to another, it's only when you compare the two systems 
(and that can only be done at light speed or less) does the  correspondence 
between the two systems become obvious. The 2 random modes  have equal energy 
so energy is not transferred either.

A less spooky example could be found in the idea of Phase Speed. I'm standing 
in the center of a huge hollow sphere 2 light years in diameter,  I've been 
there for a long time and I'm holding a powerful LASER that makes a  spot of 
light on the distant wall of the sphere one light year away.  Suddenly, still 
holding the LASER and in the space of one second I make a  complete 360 
degree turn. Exactly 2 years later an observer standing at the same place 
would see the spot move much faster than light, it would travel  the entire 
circumference of the sphere, 2PI or 6.28 light years in only  one second. 
No photon moved faster  than light however, and no energy or  information 
between any two points traveled faster than light. A photon of  light moves
at light speed and carries energy and information, a spot of light can move 
at any speed but carries neither energy nor information.

And then there are Tachyons. Actually relativity does not forbid matter  
moving  faster than light , it forbids matter moving AT the speed of light.  
That's almost the same thing but not quite. Perhaps a particle could somehow  
tunnel past the speed of light or maybe Tachyons have always moved faster  
than light from the first instant of The Big Bang..

People have looked for Tachyons but have never found the slightest evidence 
that they exist in nature, much to the relief of physicists. Tachyons are an 
embarrassment, the faster they move less energy they have, one that moved 
just a little faster than light would have a lot of energy, one that moved at an
infinite velocity would have zero energy. Much worse, Tachyons move backward 
in time, they arrive at their destination before they start. You could 
communicate with the past.

Even though they have never been detected and the laws of physics do not 
demand that Tachyons exist, they don't seem to forbid them either. Most think 
nature is totalitarian, if it's not forbidden then it's mandatory.

What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with 
the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons? It would if anybody 
saw them, but suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her crime and 
brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.

Damn, I just knocked my coffee cup off the table, what a mess! I'm REALLY not 
in the mood to clean it up, I think I'll use my Gateway 14,400 Tachyon modem 
and send myself some E mail 5 minutes ago. I'll just hit the send key and

....brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me, 
I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be 
careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over." 
Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a 
safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means
oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life, nature just will 
not allow anybody to observe a paradox.

I know what you're thinking, How could John be so stupid, he must be 
completely out of his mind, why else would he deliberately buy an obsolete  
14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the  
28,800 model is too expensive, besides I have it on VERY good authority that 
Gateway will drop the price next year.

Why do USA-only statistics give heavier weight to statements concerning
extropian-subscribers ?
As the extropian list is obviously made up of both USA and international
subscribers, surely the heaviest weight should be given to figures that include
both USA and international data.
I thought you were linking the extropian *mindset* to *gun-ownership*.

If the question is the link between extropian *mind-set* and gun ownership in
the *USA* then you may aswell use the international figures as you can remove me
from the "anti" and put me into the "pro-gun" column.  I don't believe in gun
ownership for myself in my country, but would certainly own one if I was in the
USA.
You might find that the other two non-USA anti-gun owners would also change
their vote if you asked them how they'd feel living without a gun in the states.
Its a different question altogether than the one that was originally asked.

Right after you explain to me how encouraging people to not
take responsibility for their own lives and safety furthers
any Extropian goal.  Weapons exist because predators exist.
Denying that reality or pretending that non-violent means
are sufficient to counter the threat are grossly ignorant.
And relying on a small privileged class to pretect us from
that reality is grossly irresponsible.

Perhaps when there are technological alternatives that are
proven to work as effectively, then we can talk about ridding
the world of the admittedly barbarous technology of firearms.
But that technology is not here yet, and removing the only
proven technology from the hands of us--the architects of the
future--only gives the predators the upper hand in destroying
that future.

HTML mail has precisely the same security implications as Web
browsing.  If your Java VM is working correctly, a mail message
that invokes a Java applet will do exactly the same thing as a
Java applet on a Web page, and run with the same security, which
means that it cannot access any local files, or open network
connections to any but the sending host, or execute any native
code on your machine.

The current implementations of Java on the market are generally
safe.  The current implementations of JavaScript (an entirely
different technology), VBScript, and ActiveX are /not/ safe, as
they have known security holes not yet addressed.  Most browsers
will let you enable/disable these individually, and your email
should honor the same settings.

> While this is hardly a significant statistical pool,...

Even if you got 1000 responses, it would not be significant
because it's a self-selected sample.  I'd like to think most
Extropians know at least enough math to realize that any
such poll of a mailing list cannot possibly generate useful
information for any purpose, and I respectfully suggest
that others refrain from doing so in the future.

To further show the futility of such a poll, I will point
out that I, personally, will not answer your question either
way, because it is likely to be detrimental to my own
interests to do so.  Announcing that I have no gun invites
thieves; announcing that I do invites cops (presuming for
the moment that there's a difference).

Exactly. And the same goes for freeware genetics and pharmaceuticals:
you need to know more about your body (and genetics itself) to use
them, and most people are just as ignorant of how they work as they
are of their computers. In the DNA vaccine case, I'm not sure even a
good shell would solve the problem. What I really would like to see is
a massive spread of scientific literacy, but I suspect that is hard to
achieve outside the transhumanist movement.

I have been a member of The Danish national guard for ten years and have
in that time had both M75 NATO 7.62mm Riffle and M62 Machine Gun with
250 live rounds in my house.

I like shooting. It's fun.

I have a (Don't know the right word) training in explosives. I like big
explosions too. They too are fun.

I do understand the fascination of guns and explosives. I just cannot
for the death of me see how it should interrest me, as an extropian,
that somebody has bought a gun. I simply wanted to say that I thought it
was off topic.

BTW. I don't think you will find many Europeans on the list, who find
private gun ownership in their countries a good idea. I certainly don't.
I know that Gun ownership and libertarianism is a bit provokative to
me.  Stupid european as I am. I think I can handle it though :-) It is
worth considering at least if the extropian list want's to be seen as
international.

      Hello, Kathryn,

      I understand...

      But here's a contribution I posted to 'Taking Children Seriously' 
      recently.  I discussed all this with Graham Able, the present 
      Headmaster of Dulwich College, last Friday.  A great -- albeit 
      conservative -- friend of mine advised me I could wind up dead if I 
      raised this next matter with him.  Actually, it was kinda mellow...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Hello!  I _like_ TCS!!  I wish we had TCS when I was a kid!!!  >:-}


      When I was a kid, I wanted to live in America, not least because
kids there could have .22 Colt Woodsman 'plinking' pistols and neat Marlin
lever-action rifles, not the replica .45 Colt Peacemaker cap-firer I had.
(ISTR, I got my 'fast-draw' and fire down to .25 seconds).

      I had a father who had been asked by the prewar Fascist Party to
stand as a Parliamentary candidate.  He often used to threaten to kill me
-- and he clearly wanted to, sometimes.  When I read this following motto
for the first time, I understood exactly why I _really_ wanted a gun:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
"God made all people equal, and Smith & Wesson intend to keep it that way."
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


      After attending a primary school where I was routinely and viciously
caned on the outstretched fingers of my  left hand, in an ill-conceived
effort to make me right-handed (afterwards, I would be unable to write or
play the piano for days, which was of course their intention), I started
taking an interest in larger-caliber weapons...  People started to die in
oddly coincidental ways around that time. [ I didn't kill them -- 
directly, any road ]


      I 'won' a scholarship to Dulwich College, where -- as an 11-year-old 
-- I was puzzled by the school's insistence on the little kids swinning in 
the nude, while masters and prefects 'talent-spotted' from the balcony. 
The selected kids would be subjected to ongoing and arbitrary severe 
physical punishments until they agreed to provide certain active and 
passive -- shall we say? -- services...


      By now, I was learning to fire .303 rifles, Bren guns and other toys...


      A favourite practice of the prefects was to round up a dozen or so
kids, and subject them one at a time to the following lunch-time ritual:

      The kids would be told on a Friday that they would attend for
punishment on the following Monday.  This would give the kids all week-end
to dwell on what would happen to them.

      They would have to line up ouside the School Prefects' Common Room
(the room's still there).  The door would be flung open, and the first
kid's name would be shouted out, and the door closed again.  The kid would
have to ask for admittance, and then march precisely up to a raised dais,
where three prefects sat, with several canes lying on the desk.

       The kid would be 'accused', and asked to explain himself.  No
explanation was _ever_ good enough, of course.  The interrogations would
be interspersed with canes being whacked down on the top of the desk.
Other prefects werw seated around the sides of the room, many with
newspapers discreetly positioned over their laps...

       Eventually, when the kid had been suitably terrorized, he would
have to hold his ankles in the middle of the room.  He would then be
cleverly and systematically beaten.  The kids were often very brave, and
would try so hard not to cry.  What they didn't understand was that they
would be beaten until they _did_ cry.  Sometimes all the strokes would be
on the same line; sometimes, in parallel lines.  Clever bastards...

      Afterwards, the tearful kid would be lectured, then told to leave.

      Then the next name would be called...  All the kids outside could
hear all this going on, of course.  The sessions could last up to two
hours...  And they could always pick you again for next week's session, if
they felt like it.  (At Stoneyhurst School, a fellow-CIXen I know was
beaten _every day_ for two years...).


      I was suspended from Dulwich seven times, and 'asked to leave' twice
(a record), the last time for taking an 11" bladed Bowie knife and a .22
pistol to school (I had a .50 caliber percussion revolver as well).

'Cet animal est mechant!  Quand on l'attaque, il se defend!' >:-}

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      I went on to Geelong Grammar School in Australia, where as a cadet I
learned to use Browning .50 caliber machineguns, 9mm. submachineguns and
.45 military sidearms, as well as mortars and grenade launchers.  I was
expelled for refusing to be beaten in the showers by the House Prefects,
for calling a prefect an 'impolite bastard.'  I received a standing
ovation when I left, two weeks before my University Entrance exams.

       One kid hurt me rather up badly one day.  Some weeks later, I
was 'firing-in' a sniper rifle on the range, and this character walked
down the side of the range.  I set the sights, swung the rifle over,
chambered a live round, and lined him up neatly in the sights.  At that
instant, I felt a wonderful sense of healing -- I realized that he now
lived or died with my _permission_, and I didn't have to _hate_ him any
more.  'Empowerment'


       The last handgun I owned was a Remington .45 ACP with nickel-plated
slide. Good 'stopper.'  I thought through very carefully all the
consequences of ever using it on someone, and decided not to keep it.  I
must confess to a slight weakness for the magnificent Barrett Light Fifty
Special Forces rifles, which can take out targets in a red-and-white mist
of blood and bone fragments at 1 000 yards, and blow damn great holes

I agree, although all of the posts on this thread so
far have not added up to much compared to other
threads. AFTER THIS MESSAGE, I will start addressing
my purely co-ordination-al messages directly to those
who have expressed interest. However, I think for the
purpose of advertising that a Midwest Extropian
get-together is being planned for Jan 10 somewhere in
Chicagoland, we might be forgiven mentioning it here
about once a week until the event, on the off chance
that someone who didn't yet know who would want to
would see the posts... like this:

** There are plans afoot to have an informal
gathering of Midwest Extropians on 10 January 1997
somewhere in the Chicago area. Details are being
worked out at this time. Interested people could
follow this thread backwards or contact me at

interested people (including messages not posted to

this number! **

I agree. For the purpose of the hyperlinked archives,
I will now start using the subject line "Midwest
Extropians". However, I include this sentence as a
link to the thread entitled "Chicago Extropians",
which is really the same thread.

Good question. I am. Perhaps it would be more
efficient to ask who isn't?

However, that's a lot more to do with propaganda than anything else. I
grew up in England as a typical anti-gunner, then started shooting and
talking to shooters and realised that what I'd been taught was just
nonsense. One thing I liked about America was being able to go to a
friend's house and shoot beer-bottles in his garden, without the kind
of hideous paranoia we see in Europe; IMHO it's far more civilised.

As for gun-ownership I don't own any, but I do have an IPSC Practical
Pistol competition license and would be out shooting if the assholes
in the British government hadn't banned handguns while I was away. Of
course I might do a conversion course and get a semi-auto shotgun 
instead; quite why the government considers this less 'dangerous' than
a handgun is beyond me.

Frankly I consider gun ownership one of the pillars of a free society,
and in the long-term I'll be moving somewhere where shooters aren't
treated like scum. 

BTW, I was highly amused by a radio news report a few days ago that
the government are having a 'laser pointer amnesty' because people
have been using them to dazzle drivers; don't know if they've killed
anyone yet. Looks like British people can't be trusted with anything 
these days.

Pardon me, but weapons _are_ instances of technology. In fact, many modern
technologies are hi-tech weaponry spin-offs.

Being human encompasses the entire spectrum, from the demon to the saint. 
One should think, as our skills grow, so will the scope of our
possibilities. There is no proof that there will be no conflict. In fact,
I think there will always be conflict in a darwinian theatre.

Perhaps we might need stronger argumentational devices than plain
rhetorics. What will you do if anything you hold sacred is to be tread
into the ground by the equivalent of thugs with guns?

I own 9.  Handguns, rifles, shotguns.

BTW, I have never shot a human, shot at a human, or pointed a weapon at a

I would be interested in seeing various Extropian surveys polling the
members of this list.  It would be best if this was done via e-mail or
on a web-page so we don't have to read through all the responses.

The latest gun discussion brings up the question of whether Extropians
are more likely to own guns.  Extropians are discussing the Wired poll
and trying to decide if we are "connected" enough.  People sometimes
wonder what computers Extropians use, how much money we make, what kind
of jobs we have, what services we offer, etc.

Maybe this could be another Extropian service on the ExI page, polls
showing extropian responses by percentage.  Maybe only paid members
could actually vote, but anybody could read the results.

Aside, wasn't/isn't there an idea exchange where people voted/invested
e-cash on ideas or predictions?  I have lost track of that.

Well, it was discussed that the method recently exposed simply "would kill"
the original living being and
remake an exact copy with the same data than the original... And everybody,
including the copy, would swear that it would de the same... but IT WOULD
NOT !!!

NEVERTHELESS, there is a TRANSFER METHOD which permits to teletransfer
exactly the original individual:

Just execute the teletransfer *step by step*, as if it were a series of
organ transplantations. This way, we would go transfering each part,
keeping something like a "telelink" with the rest of the parts that are
still at the origin. F. ex.: your eyes would "go"first and your brain would
"see" with the transfered eyes, and just then could destruct the original
eyes.. they will have already been substituted... And so on with all the
other parts of the body... Indeed, I suppose that with will be necessary
just with the brain, since I do not need my original eyes >> just
functionally equivalent ones... And more: I am not a physiologist but I am
supposing that the brain has complete redundancy of functions, even if it
will be necessary a momentary and recuperable "coma" while the teletranfer.
Apparently, such "partitioned" teletransfer will be distance-limited by the
maximum time necessary to the mentioned links be mantained... Anyway we can
be teletransfered via lots of  "teletransfer substations" (like airplane
connections...). 

In worse hypothesis, teletransfer cell by cell, ( supposing total
functional redundancy)

It is not necessary reverse time-travel but just reverse time-access, in
such a way we could recuperate the individual to the present (future.....).

approximately 40,000 people are killed on our highways every year....many,

I am interested.  January 10th is a Saturday so it would be easy for me
to make if I don't have conflicting plans (e.g. a promotion test in Tae
Kwon Do that I'd not be able to skip).  Yes, I am 21+ years old though I
don't drink much at all (a bar wouldn't be the best place to meet for
me...maybe a restaurant/bar for dinner).

General Relativity determines the cosmic speed limit by the bent or "warped"
geometry of the universe which can be further stretched in theory by a
Black-White hole held open by a large Casimir Effect Capacitor called a Worm
Hole.  In this case FTL travel is allowed and therefore reverse time travel is
allowed as well and therefore "snatching people from the past", etc. becomes
possible.  Kip Thorne and friends who pioneered this Worm Hole aspect of
theoretical physics at CalTech have solved the twin paradox for inanimate
systems (without free will) but the twin paradox is still not completely worked
out for reverse time travel anyway.  Regardless, to do this engineering of
stellar mass to generate incipient Black Holes and then the huge Casimir Effect
Capacitors would need to be figured out which is beyond the realm of present
day technology by many orders of magnitude.  And yes I agree with you (and
Stephen Hawking) that the apparent absence of time travel tourists flocking to
watch history literally in the making is good support or negative evidence that
Worm Holes may not be possible. Period.  Although an "arbitrarily advanced
civilization" as Kip puts it may have a Prime Directive kind of law or culture
in place so that any visitors are covert spies but that sounds too much like
the X Files for me to be comfortable with it.  The paranoid sound of "Visitors
in our midst" kind of thing is sort of eerie.  -Bill.

About twelve years ago I had an experience which changed my entire
perspective on gun ownership and self-protection.
My wife and I were college students and we lived in a ground floor
apartment.  Since it was Spring in Texas and quite pleasant outside, we
had a living room window partly opened.  After a few hours of sleep, we
were woken by the sound of
rustling blinds.  Our cat had a habit of climbing up into the windowsill
and banging the blinds and my wife would get up and the raise the blinds
out of the cat's way.  Usually, I would fall back to sleep before my
wife got back in bed.  But, this time the sound had a different quality
to it.  So, I remained awake.

>From the living room, my wife let out a loud, horrific scream.  It was
utterly primeval.  I immediately jumped out of bed and ran into the
room.  My adrenaline was pumping to the point I thought my heart was
going to explode; I was ready to fight with tooth and nail.  Next to the
window I found my wife shivering with fright.

In a sleepy state and expecting to find our cat, she had walked up to
the window.  Instead, she discovered a man half-way through the window. 
Upon her scream and my imminent arrival, he ran away.  But not before he
whispered sometime to her.  To this day, my wife's memory still blocks
what he said.

After a few minutes, I stopped hyper-ventilating and called the police. 
They arrived, looked around, took some notes, waited until we were
somewhat calm, and left.  There wasn't much more they could do.

So, my wife and I laughed if off thinking the "burglar" would have been
quite disappointed with our paltry student belongings.

The next Monday I came back from class to find my wife ashened and
sitting on the couch in a stunned state.  She had just gotten off the
phone with the detective who was following up on the case.

Apparently, it was not a burglar.  They come during the day.  Nope, this
fellow was what the detective called a home invader and he was not there
to steal.  The detective was very, very interested in what he had
whispered to my wife before running away.  But, she could not, or would
not recall.  The detective told my wife she was very lucky that she was
not alone.

In that instance I realized that personal protection via a police force
was at most a partial illusion.  I realized I had no means, except a
kitchen knife, to protect myself and my loved ones.  I, also, realized
that I would never, never be in that situation again.  I now own a
street-legal short-barreled shotgun.

People are kidding themselves if they believe they can delegate their
self-protection to a police force.  I am sorry.  But we, as a society,
have not, yet, reached the point where we do not need to assume
responsibility for the protection of ourselves and our families.  To
think otherwise is dangerous.  I wish it were false.

The jungle is still full of lions, tigers, and bears.

First of all , I'm not putting any burden on you, nor asking you to
sacrifice. I was quoting a study. What you drive is your concern,
not mine, and I will defend your right to do the same.

Second of all, at 6'6" and 300lbs, it would have to be at least a

I think your being slightly rhetorical here since Physics 101 would
suggest both would be killed/crippled. This would be the equivalent
of welding 2 York 45lb plates a 5lb and a 2 and 1/2 pound plate
together (okay only 97.5 pounds) and dropping them on your
linebackers head at 32ft persec persec from how high?

We have a difference of type here, there has only been one real
production EV to date, the recent entry by GM. I considerate it a
very bad first prototype. "The regular car with an electric motor,
and a stack of batteries" is a bad idea,the new Toyota which is
just a regular car with a hybrid APU isn't much better.

There have been a number of studies done as mentioned in my second
post on this including a number with the GM Ultralites, they do
better than conventional cars and better than some sport utility
vehicles, I don't remember if the specific vehicles you mentioned
were in the paper I read.

I addressed your football player analogy above, but lets return to
the moose one last time. (poor moose)

The moose is 1100lbs, but 90% of it's mass is 4ft+ off the ground,
(high center of gravity) to borrow your football analogy your moose
is going to get chop-blocked by my low slung Hypercar...

Since by law in NH I can't salvage the meat, I hope at least it
will be given to the poor. After contacting the proper authorities,
I would be happy to help salvage it.

Even a poorly constructed prototype gets better than twice the
performance/efficiency, see reference above. Advanced versions may
get 10 times the efficency.

The good news is that Rocky Mountain Institutes original paper is
now a 450 page proprietary analysis that goes for 10K a copy (okay
that's not the good news) it has also established the "Hypercar
center" and the big three commitment is approaching 2 billion.
Saturn is rumored to be already at work on it's first.

I'll get my Hypercar, and Michael can keep his truck, or maybe get
a better one.

Thanks for this. 

I had a somewhat similar experience while living with a
partner-of-six-years in the then very peaceful and rather Scandinavian town
of Minneapolis, though nowhere near as harrowing as what you describe. 

Ours was a second story apartment, with a "blind", dimly-lit set of
catwalks linking all the back floors of seventeen separate dwellings. The
first contact with the bad guy was his filching my partner's purse off of
the (unlocked but "landlord-chained"--after all, the back gate was locked,
right? and everyone in the building knew and liked each other--very similar
to a college dorm in that way) back door knob, through the crack afforded
by the affixed chain.

Doesn't sound so bad, right?

Nothing like this had ever before happened to anyone in that building,
according to the (trustworthy) resident manager.

I'll spare you all the gory details; suffice it to say that the cops
managed to catch this guy and his wheel man/partner, and still in their
possession was _the newly-minted key of the just-changed locks_ that would
have permitted these two creeps free access to all seventeen dwellings. And
yes, they had long long arrest records.

Even though neither one of us directly encountered this goblin, the sense
of violation lasted a long time.

++

I'd like to add a few metacomments, if I may, about this entire thread and
the related particular element of world (certainly not just USA) culture:

1) It is an observed fact that bullies and fools frequently have use for
firearms.

2) It _does not therefore follow_ that decent people have _no_ use for
firearms. Even ugly ones.

This sobers me, but I've come to terms with it. I am even able to consider
a third point relatively coolly:

3) There is no magic in a uniform (or a job description) that transforms a
bully or a fool into an honest (let alone a _decent_) person. Where is
Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso when we really need it?

Peace,

MMB

John K Clark <johnkc@well.com> writes a nice little low-tech summary of
tachyons, but I'm pedantic so I'll quibble with a few minor points:

>Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff  
>that has mass or energy or carries information.

As you point out later, this isn't true.  Relativity doesn't say things
can't move faster than light; it only says they can't move AT the speed
of light.  (Actually, it doesn't even say *that*; it just says that it
takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a non-zero-mass object
to c.  And experiments bear this out to several decimal places.  But of
course relativity could some day be proved wrong...)

>It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate  
>instantly and for unlimited distances.

No, it's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate
without measurable delay over a few meters.  That's a big difference.
The effects definitely propagate faster than light, but it may only be,
for example, 100c.  As methods for measuring time get better, we may be
able to put better bounds on that (say, >10^6 c), but I doubt we'll
ever be able to prove the effect is precisely instantaneous.  And the
experimental apparatus (I assume you're referring to Alain Aspect's EPR
experiments) is only a few meters big, so saying "unlimited distances"
is far too strong a claim for what's been actually verified
experimentally.

And before anybody gets any ideas about "definitely faster than light",
remember that (as John correctly points out later in his post) these
effects can not be used to transmit information, because the correllations
can only be seen *after* you compare the data using conventional information
transfer methods (eg., walking across the room to the other end of the
apparatus :-).

The problem is that the lasers themselves get hot. It is a very
energy-intensive form of cooling, and you cannot fool entropy with
it. So it will likely work well for small regions, but an even larger
region will get entropic.

This is a very neat idea! I like it a lot. The only problem might be
preventing the occasional speck of dust from falling into the hole,
releasing a troublesome burst of radiation.

Of course, the finite area available will limit the amount of entropy
per second dumped into the hole, but it is likely very large anyway.

Discussing gun ownership ,Kathryn Aegis" aegis@igc.apc.org said:

>beyond my limited intellectual capacity.  

If that someone was a thug or burglar crippled and maimed by one of
these tools then I'll look them in the eye and "joyously proclaim"
ownership
of one.

It's been estimated (Shulman, "Stopping Power") that women use guns to
defend themselves from rapists 416 times per year.  How do we look 
THEM in the eye when we confiscate their guns?

Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, using surveys and 
other data, has determined that armed citizens defend their lives or
property 
with firearms against criminals approximately 1 million times a year. 
In 98
percent of these instances, the citizen merely brandishes the weapon or
fires a warning shot.  Only in 2 percent of the cases do citizens
actually shoot their assailants.  In defending themselves with their
firearms, armed citizens kill 2,000 to 3,000 criminals each year, three
times the number killed by the police.  A nationwide study by Kates,
the constitutional lawyer and criminologist, found that only 2 percent
of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified
as a criminal.  The "error rate" for the police, however, was 11
percent, over five times as high.  Evidence suggests that armed citizens 
are very responsible in using guns to defend themselves.  

Guns are tools. They can be used responsibly, in self-defense, or they
can
be used irresponsibly by criminals or the careless.  

Since violent crimes are frequently committed by repeat offenders, 
reserving prison space for them and having them serve their full
sentence would put a dent in violent crime.

Releasing violent criminals in order to make room for non-violent
drug offenders imprisoned under mandatory sentences is foolish.
I would like to ask the drug warriors how they look the victims of
repeat offenders in the eyes as they release violent felons in the name
of the WOD.

Thankyou both for the generous compliments, it means a lot to me.
I would like to point out however that I only deserve a small part of the
credit, everyone who participated in the discussion in a contructive way
and everyone who sent us their ideas helped make this work. It was a truly
global effort.

I hope this shows that we work out any problem or difference as long as we
keep focussing on 'solutions' and are genuinly willing to reach out to the
other party. Keep our eye on the ball instead of our ego's and all that ;-)

Gotta run.

The original debated statement was that there were more gun owners to
non gun owners on the list than was in the general population. The only
statistic I have that is reliable, to my knowledge, of gun ownership in
a general population, is the 60 million owners figure that I've gotten
from both NRA and HCI propaganda, as well as others. There are also
approximately 200 million guns in  private hands in the US as well. I
don't have figures for the world at large, or for any other specific
country. If anyone has such data and can provide it, I would appreciate
it.

I really only did it for the statistical comparison, though if I wanted
to be snide, I suppose I'd ask if one lived in a country like, say,
China, that one would be just hunky dory happy as a clam that one had no
right to free speech, no right to travel as you please, no right to
domocratic pluralism, etc, just because one happened to live is such a
place.

I personally beleive that all people should have the sort of rights we
have here, and as Mao Tse Dungbeetle said, "Justice comes from the
barrel of a gun". The right to keep and bear arms is the spring from
whence all other political rights come. One either beleives that
political freedoms are gained by force, or that they are granted by God,
and I don't see many theists round here.

Announcing to me, privately, is different from announcing to the goup.
As a dedicated gun rights practitioner, and respecter and defender of
the constitution, I personally feel insulted that my word of confidence

This gives me a solution to the Cosmic Filter dillemma. Rather than a
Dyson Sphere radiating its encircled star's output as black body
radiation, the inside surface would be coated in thermal superconductor
material. The Dyson shell would have a twin around a black hole that
orbited the star at a relatively constant distance, and would be
likewise encircled by a shell of superconducting material. The two
shells would be linked by a spinning tube, the inside surface of which
would be inhabited by a civilization. The star shell end would be the
"hot" electrode of a multimillion mile long particle beam which would be
grounded at the black hole end. The tube surface would have thermal
superconductor embedded in it to pipe waste heat to the black hole. The
particle beam would interact with the helium "upper atmosphere" in the
center of the spinning tube to provide illumination.

OK, here's the tally as of 8:30 pm EST, Monday, Dec 15th.

NOTE: To reiterate a previous post, the only reason I compared the
American subscribers to the stats I had on American Gun ownership in
last nights tally was simply to compare apples to apples as much as
possible. I don't have gun ownership figures for the rest of the world,
or for other specific countries. THose that have such stats are welcome
to post them. I did note that there were 3 non-American, non-gun owners,
two of which have since said that they would, if they could live in
America, own a gun, so that kinda makes them ambivalent as far as
ownership rights are concerned, while still being non-gun owners.

The current numbers:

Gun Owners | tot. guns owned | Would if they could | non-owners

15     |       105         |          4        |         8

As to nationality:

Americans:  13  |  95   |   0    |   3
Non-Americans:  2   |  10   |   4   |   5

I won't break down the nationalities further, for fear of inadvertently,
indirectly violating privacy.

I think that it's interesting that there is such a large group of
non-Americans who, willingly or unwillingly, could be considered to be
politically repressed for not being able to exercise their rights of
self defense. I doubt we'll hear anything from Amnesty International on
this anytime soon. ;)

Lee Daniel Crocker is right that as a self appointed sampling, this
survey is hardly "statistically valid" in that it only applies to
subscribers to the list, but only as a representation of those that may
share extropian values but are not subscribers. In that we are hearing
directly from subscribers, I think that it is a decent indication of the
demographics of those currently involved in the list, and as a
comparison of current subscribing extropians to the general population,
it is valid, as much as any readership surveys compiled by any
group/publication, etc.  is.

As to those who are "ambivalent" about gun ownership, I would suggest
that if the only reason you want to own a gun is for self defense
against criminals, then you are doing it for, not what I'd say is the
wrong reason, but more for not the best reason. 

Homer Simpson said, "Guns are for three things: defending your family,
killing deeelicious animals, and keeping King George out of your face!"

WHich reason is the best one????

Having stood a bit more in uffish thought, I offer a slight reformulation:

++

MMB's CREDO RE: UGLY TECHNOLOGIES, Release 1.0 of 97.12.15

1) It is an observed fact that bullies and fools frequently have use for
weapons--crazy people sometimes use them too.

2) It _does not therefore follow_ that decent, sane people have _no_ use
for weapons--even ugly ones. This sobers me, but I've come to terms with
it. I am even able to consider the following points relatively coolly:

3) There is no magic in a uniform, nor a job description, that transforms a
bully, a fool or a crazy person into an honest (let alone decent or sane)
person. Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso and the Divine Right of Kings are
fiction, and that's too bad.

4) There is no magic in a weapon, nor in commonly available tool-like
technologies--even ugly ones--that transforms a decent, sane person into a
bully, fool, or maniac. Elric's demon-possessed sword is fiction, and thank
heavens for that. 

5) One can imagine other technologies which _can_ perform such a
transformation, and some would argue that they exist today and already are
in use; were such employed, they would make any "menace of firearms"--such
as that decried of late on the floor of the UN, and in US, EC, Japanese and
Downunder media--pale by comparison.

++

Special bonus observations:  

(po) From a certain Bierceian perspective, the aforementioned media are
themselves such a (5) technology. 

(po) Guns don't kill people, _memes_ kill people.

(po) Desensitization (including simulation) is a time-honored working
method for (_attempting to_) lower the willingness-to-kill threshold of
young testosterone-peaking males. 

(po) What ARE mean ghetto streets, Hollywood revenge-/action shoot-'em-ups
and Duke Nukem _GOOD FOR_?

I thank Mike Butler for his sane and balanced post (Sunday).

: Anton is "guilty" of proclaiming his acquisition of old
: tech, and in that sense it is no more relevant than, say,
: my announcing that I bought a new "beater" $1000 car.

Mea culpa.  Worse was my taste in language: describing myself as 
"gun loon" and "threat to public order" was appropriate for the 
other recipients, but not for this list.

My interest in guns has several roots.  First, the future: I bet
even money that the USA will either break up or go fascist within
15 years, and learning to shoot is one way to make myself more
ready.  Abolition of violence would be nice but ain't gonna happen
by then.  Second, the present: I want to be able to do more than
call 911 if necessary.  (A few months ago I picked up my pistol
on hearing a predawn cry for help.  The incident proved to be
minor, but what if?)  Third but not least, I enjoy the technology
of guns, and the simple pleasure of learning to hit a target.

Each of these three purposes, I contend, is extropian in spirit,
though none requires future technology - any more than calorie
restriction or aikido!

Two years ago when I brought home my first gun, my then rentmate
(who owns five) said, "Congratulations. May you never need it."

I prefer not to reward such marketing techniques, all else being equal.
In contrast, it's not obvious how Gates could benefit from 676.

I submit for comment the following.  I know some of this is probably
covered elsewhere, but I just wanted to get this out in case it isn't.

cp = cryoprotectant

Tests:
	Protein:  Anders mentioned some proteins denature.  I'm not
sure if this is because of low temperatures, interaction with cps or
some other process(es).  If it is the second, one would expect a good
cp not to do this.  (Or perhaps not: maybe some damage does not
matter than much.  This needs to be evaluated.)
	Other biomolecules:  DNA, RNA, chlorestorol, lipids, can be
tested too to assess effects and damage of cps.  Together with protein
tests, a damage marker shoudl be sought so as to reduce the number
of initial tests.
	Nerve connections:  Anders brought up a good point of sacrificing
axons for synapses or vice versa.  However, it remains to be seen if any
cps do more damage to one or the other and whether there is a trade
off involved.
	Nerve revival:  Aside from examining damage to nerve 
connections, reviving nerve cells and networks of such to operational
condition should be a test too.  (The ultimate test being full revival
of a brain, but that would be far off into the future.)
	Cellular damage:  Other cells should be examined too.  This
might result in finding a cell type marker.  Perhaps some type of cell
is easier to work with in a lab setting and can be used in the stead of
nerve cells for initial tests.

Measures:
	Need for both quantitative and qualitative measures.
	Ex. quantitative: percentage of protein in solution denatured.
	Ex. qualitative: types of protein damage, such as crosslinking
		versus breakdown.

Other:
	Note tolerance level to cp.
		Does it cause any damage?
	More than one cp?
		Is a cp "cocktail" better than one cp?
		Perhaps different cps should be used for different 
			tissues?
		Perhaps different cps should be used at at different 
			times in the process?
	Storage/maintenance/costs:
		Is the cp easy to store and maintain before use?
		Is it easy to manufacture?
		What is its long term optimal working temperature?

Related issue:
	Design of "home" cryonics kit for use in emergency situations.
		(This involves messy legal issues, but the design of
		one might lead to a wider acceptance of cryonics by
		making it a fait accompli.)

I recall a quotation from Robert Heinlein:

	"An armed society is a polite society"

In the Extropian future I see, we will each, individually, have personal
access to technologies FAR more dangerous than an assault rifle. I don't
think throwing insults around will encourage responsible attitudes here.

I do not own a gun, and I support the right of others (and myself) to
own guns.

About a year ago, I began a relationship with a (then) married woman (we
are still going strong) whose husband was a mercenary in southeast asia
and a multiple personality. He did not take well to the situation and
there was some serious concern that during a 3 week period when the
woman was in Europe, that this man might cause trouble for me. There was
serious consideration of obtaining a firearm.

A friend bought a flare pistol which I borrowed and I obtained some
pepper spray. After some serious thought I came to:

If I was given a warning, I would ask him to leave. If he did not, I'd
use the pepper spray if he attempted entry. If he did enter and was
still mobile after the pepper spray, I'd use the flare pistol. At this
point, I'd have no compunction hog tying him on his belly which for a
middle aged courpulent man has in many cases resulted in death... And
then call the cops...

Well, it didn't happen, and is very unlikely to. I returned the flare
pistol and keep the pepper spray in an accessible but hidden place. And,
I'm VERY glad nothing happened, it would have done incredible (and
likely permanent) damage to my relationship.

And, IF there is ever a violent threat or entry into my life, I will
very likely get a gun, and the needed training.

Pardon me, but why do you feel obligated to attach the entire content of

The above is a smiley.  It indicates I am trying to be friendly, not trying

A web search on either of the words would probably turn up a definition.
They are pretty well known by most of the regulars on this list, and, I
daresay, by a great many people on the 'net. I believe they're both present
in the "JARGON" file, which is stored on many sites all over the world.
Many people try to do a web search before asking a question like the ones
you asked. It can save time for all concerned.

TANSTAAFL is an acronym for "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch"--first (to my knowledge) used in Robert A. Heinlein's novel _The
Moon Is A Harsh Mistress_. It communicates the sentiment that you usually
get what you pay for, and that things that are labeled "free" usually have
some hidden cost.

I seem to recall that "fnord" comes from Wilson and Shea's _Illuminatus!_
trilogy. In the novel(s), it refers to (or _is_, depending on your
interpretation) a symbol/signal embedded in communications which is located
directly adjacent to something that is intended to be forced out of your
consciousness. For instance, the phrase "Bang, you're dead! fnord" would
leave the unwitting reader feeling only puzzled and uneasy, without being
able to recall what was just read.

Suppose you get a sheet of paper and roll it up from bottom to top.
The left side is not any closer to the right side than it was.
In the same way, having compactified extra dimensions does not
in itself mean that A is closer to B than it looks. I don't
entirely discount the possibility of what you're talking about,
but it would require geometries of a sort not presently contemplated.

I think you might have a better chance trying to explain
nonlocality with wormholes. In that case one doesn't need higher
dimensions, just an unusual connectivity (topology) for space.
Another possibility is loops in time (closed timelike curves),
in which nonlocal correlation between A and B is due to a local
causal chain starting at A and proceeding off to C in one 
temporal direction, and another local causal chain starting
at C and proceeding back to B in the opposite temporal direction.
(Or due to more complicated temporal zigzags.)

There is a paper (http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9706018)
which claims to derive "the logic of quantum mechanics" from
time loops in classical general relativity - but I'll only
believe it when someone actually obtains the full Schroedinger
equation that way.

Finally, there is simply the possibility that the world truly
is nonlocal - causally nonlocal, and/or ontologically nonlocal,
with distributed entities whose states are not reducible to
the union of localized properties. In the latter case, my
question is, where does *locality* come from? At what point,
under what conditions, are there truly localized entities?
I don't think quantum mechanics can answer that question -
in general, entanglement ends only with the "collapse of
the wavefunction" or the "projection of the state vector",
and that's the part of the theory whose interpretation
is contentious.

TANSTAAFL is an acronym which most people get from Robert Heinlein's 
book "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" or from another source derivative 
therefrom.  I don't know if Heinlein originated it or not.  It stands 
for:

There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch

Fnord is, in the Wilson/Shea trilogy "Illuminatus", a meaningless 
word that is printed scattered through the text of most published 
matter.  In the world of this fantasy/science-fiction/parody series, 
children are trained using hypnotic techniques to not see this word.  
This creates a conflict within the brain, a source of stress.  The 
authorities (the ones that are aware of the fnords) control the 
reader's reaction to any printed matter by controlling the ratio of 
fnords to other words -- something completely free of fnords is so 
unusual that a positive emotional reaction is virtually guaranteed, 
whereas anything critical of the government is guaranteed to contain 
a lot of fnords to generate a strong negative reaction.

Not even that.  You have no reason to believe that the subscribers 
who respond are representative of those subscribers who don't.  
That they chose to respond to such a poll is a significant 
differentiating fact.

The only discussion I have seen that even vaguely matches that 
description, was protesting against the definition of the categories 
of connectedness in a certain study.  We have several examples of 
people who are obviously extremely connected, but don't meet the 
definition of "connected" or "super-connected" in that study.

For that matter, we don't have (so far) any members who claim to be 
"connected" or "super-connected".  Just in case anyone wants to speak 
up, here are the rules:

(1) either category must actually get on-line and exchange email at 
least three times a week (they don't say if receiving spam counts).

(2) of the following four technologies: a desktop computer, a laptop 
computer, a pager, and a cellular phone, a connected individual must 
have three and a super-connected individual must have all four.

That's the complete definition of those two categories.

Structural conservation would be just fine (functional proof is too
restrictive, imo). However, it is technically most difficult to test. 
Maybe, with the advent of xray microscopy... It would help a lot if there
was an encompassing theory of cryodamage. The exciting field of
cryobiology does not seem to draw too many followers/funds, however. 
No-one hinders you from going out, and becoming a cryobiologist. Just
never, ever say 'cryonics' in public.

It is that 'testing for specs' that is expensive. There is simply no
certified easy/cheap/fast in-vitry model in existance, besides of the
animal model (dogs/sheep), which is neither.

Once again, you wouldn't be able to check much with your computer model. 
Personally, I think it to be the most promising approach on the long run
(when we will have progressed to understanding the cell in terms of its
molecular processes). This is strictly for the future, however.

I once suggested using neural cultures on multi-electrode arrays for such

I don't think fully reversible cryosuspension is physically possible, even

Are there any thermal superconductors? I have a strong feeling this is
a myth started by Larry Niven's mistake in some of his books that
electrical superconductors are thermal superconductors. Of course, I
see nothing wrong the idea of phonons somehow forming coherent pairs
or something similar, but it appears very unlikely.

I got this from Mike Darwin. Obviously some cps do it, but it seems to

Sounds like a good idea.

Irrelevant, since its only purpose is to limit tissue damage doing
suspension. Of course, if it caused continuing damage at -170, then it
would be a concern, but that is rather unlikely.

A fun idea. I can see before me "The Little Cryonicist" for kids:
suspend your pet (liquid nitrogen not included). Not very likely to
work, though, since it likely requires medical expertise.

I've been exposed to the "survivalist" movement via friends for about 20
years.  Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were a lot of
people predicting similar hard times ahead.  At the time, unemployment
was high, and inflation was very high, about 15% or more.  My friends
were buying guns, buying gold, stockpiling food.

We got through that crisis OK.  Inflation and unemployment today are
the best they've been in decades.  Predictions of imminent doom stayed
through the 1980s and early 1990s.  The budget deficit was growing
inexorably, bank failures were on the increase, we were heading towards
fiscal disaster.  When this list first started we had several members
who were convinced that economic collapse was just around the corner.

We got through that OK, too.  The deficit is decreasing, bank failures are
down.

The newest doom prediction is the year 2000 (Y2K) problem.  The intricate,
interdependent financial community will be incapacitated when the
inevitable problems occur.  Even businesses with their own houses in order
will fall when their debtors and creditors are unable to do business
with them around the Y2K transition.  It's a big house of cards and it
is sure to collapse, given that a significant fraction of members are
taken down.

Actually I think this one has some credibility.  I recall after the 1987
stock market crash there were articles saying that it was almost a lot
worse, that a chain reaction of bank and investment failures was aborted
only by extraordinary intervention.  On the other hand the Y2K problem
won't all occur on one day; problems will start to occur and gradually
get worse as the transition approaches.  This will give people time to
start adjusting to the problem.  Maybe it won't be as bad as it seems.

Once we get past that, I don't see any particular reason why the US
should break up or go fascist within 15 years.  We've gotten through
hard times in the past without this happening.

What do you see ahead that suggests as high as a 50% chance of this
kind of change?

I don't have numbers handy, but I would be *very* surprised if the
number was that small, because that's about 1 atom per mole, or about
1 atom per gram (give or take an order of magnitude).  Given that the
brain weighs only a few kg, that's saying that only about 10,000-100,000
atoms are aligned.  That's a pitifully small number of atoms, and I
suspect that it's far too few by many orders of magnitude for an MRI
scanner to do it's job.  I could be wrong, but I'd like to see a
reference for this quote.

Not at all.  Go to altavista (http://altavista.digital.com) and search
for "space filling curves".  There you will find ways to squeeze an
infinitely long 1-dimensional curve into a finite 2-dimensional space
(like a square).  Although this doesn't put *every* point on the curve
infinitely close to every other point, it does put infinitely many
points at arbitrarily large distances along the curve, arbitrarily close
to each other in the square.  This is just intended to give you an
"intuition" about how you can fold up a dimension to do the things
described previously.

There you have it....

The credibility I attach to anything written in the newspaper has diminished
considerably over the last twenty or so years.   I've seen first hand on
numerous ocassions where the journalist (Is that the proper term) was trying
to put forth an "agenda" and wasn't about to let mere facts get in his way.

Regarding this thread....I'm not too bad of a driver...I have a perfect
record...that is I hae no "Chargeable" accidents on my record.  That doesnt
mean I haven't been involved in wrecks...only that it was later determined
that those wrecks were unpreventable from my standpoint and caused by the
other guy.

In each case I barely felt the bump...and in each case the other vehicle...a
fourwheeler (automobile) was pretty badly torn up.  No one was hurt in either
instance...luckily...

I drive an 18 wheeler...not exactly a dumptruck perhaps...but there ARE 18
wheeler belly dumps...and even a ten wheeler probably grosses on the order of
50 to 60 thousand pounds when loaded...That's a whole lot of mass to absorb
the inertial transfer from a puny little 2000 pound passenger car...or a 6
thousand pound one for that matter...

I think this analysis is confused.  Erasing a bit costs one bit of entropy
regardless of what temperature you do it at.  It might cost less free energy,
but free energy costs more per unit entropy at low temperatures.   Negentropy 
is the real resource; not free energy.  

Advanced civs would want to use black holes though, as they are by far the
largest source of negentropy.  The entropy of a black hole goes as the square
of the mass, while the entropy is linear for more familiar uses of mass.
The big problem is that at their low temps radiation flow is very low, so
it seems a very slow process to get negentropy out of the hole by sending 
radiation in.

In general I agree that this is true, but there are some extremely
notable exceptions.  The one that pops to my mind is Linux, and much of
the GNU/FSF (Free Software Foundation) software.  Both Linux and GNU
produce software that is generally better(*) than similar software
produced commercially.

(*) "Better" is a loaded word.  Linux & GNU software is better in many
well-defined ways, like reliability and breadth and depth of
functionality.  (Since they're both Unix-based packages, I'm not making
any claims about quality of user-interface compared to Windows or
MacIntosh, for example.) Linux is a superior operating system than any
commercial Unix that I'm aware of, in that it is more reliable, and has
everything that most other general-purpose Unices have, and also have
some very nifty, clean, advanced features that few, if any, other
operating systems have.  And it is completely free.  GNU software is
similar; it is completely free, and the mature products are just as
good or better than anything available commercially.  This is why, for
example, Sun has stopped shipping a C compiler by default (they still
have one, but they don't ship it unless you wan it), and are telling
their users to use GNU CC.

The interesting question is "Why are Linux and GNU so successful, given
that they are written by people who aren't being paid?"  The answer, at
least in part (and in my opinion almost entirely), is because the
people who write the software do it on their own time, because they
*enjoy* writing good software.  An important practical factor in this
equation is that there are no deadline pressures to "get a product
out".  So things get done slowly, but they get done *right*, and they
get it done right *the first time*, usually.

I think this is a beautiful example of how a non-commercial entity can
come up with a staggeringly successful product that simply blows away
the competition.  "Successful" is also a loaded word; nobody is getting
rich, but the product is clearly technically superior to anything else
available.

I don't claim that an economy can be based on such products, because
most people work because they *have* to, not because they enjoy their
work.  The people who write GNU and Linux do it mostly because they
enjoy it.  ("Bragging rights" comes into the picture as well,
sometimes.)

I'd be interested in hearing other notable exceptions to TANSTAAFL.

>I'd be interested in hearing other notable exceptions to TANSTAAFL.

Two points:

1a) I forgot to mention a third meaning of TANSTAAFL: that somebody always
pays for something labeled "free".
I am kicking myself for this, because it's the most important and subtle
meaning of TANSTAAFL.

1b) I never said that I subscribed to the sentiment.

(however, for the sake of argument...)

2) Are you honestly saying that all the developers of Linux and GNU didn't
"pay" for my ability to pick those things up?
That there was no labor expended, because they haven't asked me to give
them money?

Appearance is not always reality. :)

Superfluid He is a thermal superconductor.

This means every part of a single mass of such liquid helium (in the
form/state, I think, also called Helium-III) is (reported to be) exactly
the same temperature, and fluctuations in temperature occur uniformly in
the entire mass. 
At least, this is how it was reported to me some decades ago.

I think the explanations you give (both re: Niven and re: phonons) are
close to the mark. Niven did get it wrong, and the phonon coupling may be
the limiting factor. If so, there's still be speed-of-light lag in a large
enough mass of He-III.



I *love* telling Anders something he doesn't know.  It happens *so*
rarely!!! :) :)

If you detect any anger in my replies, it is because those who
fight /against/ weapons have far more blood on their hands than
those who advocate them, and their insufferable arrogance and
faux compassion grows thin after years of solid proof that
private ownership of guns /reduces/ violent crime.  After 10
years of relaxed concealed carry laws in Florida and other states,
we now have hard statistics on that.  Maybe decades ago one could
have argued that guns were "designed only to kill and maim
humans" or were "instruments of destruction" or that "senseless
human waste" was caused by the weapons rather than by the laws
against them; but after the long experience of years and hard
numbers, such rhetoric today is hollow.  Even if one is careful
to stop short of advocating laws, sentiments like that contribute
to attitudes that make such bloody laws popular, despite their
proven miserable failure.

It is beyond my comprehension as a compassionate human being to
understand how the disarmers can live with themselves after the
suffering they have caused, and continue to advocate disarming
new generations of victims.

And I find it particularly ironic that such a strong advocate
of women's rights should disdain the very technology that made
equality for women possible.

I had a wonderful poster on my wall for a couple years.
But brace yourselves, it came from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Okay, it said, "The only tool you need," then there was the great
picture, a toolbox with a pencil--as big as the toolbox--coming out
of it.  Then, "to fill out the census."

So I cut off the last line.

You're forgeting the hidden costs and wastes as usual.
Like the fact that you have to sharpen the pencil, so you need a sharpener
and a way to dispose of the waste.
Also, the learning curve for using a pencil and paper system is enormous.
Years of schooling.
It's the embeddedness of the 'pencil and paper system' that make it seem
so 'simple and effective'.  But it's not.

Seriously though, I haven't owned a pencil since high school.
And my handwriting sucks.

Hello.  Last August (1997), I described a nanonuke design in which an array of
quantum-well lasers fired from all directions at a deuterium pellet; this was
an improvement over standard inertial-confinement methods.  Forrest Bishop
replied that he had come up with a similar idea, called "Mr. Fusion", of which
his reply constituted the first public disclosure.

That language makes me think he might want to patent it, and I happen to be
reading up on patent law right now.  I hope that Mr. Bishop has not yet filed
a patent application.  A special statute probibits the patenting of nuclear
weapons.  But as the book goes on to say:  "However, if you've invented a
doomsday machine, don't be discouraged; you can be rewarded directly by making
an application with DOE (Department of Energy), formerly the Atomic Energy Comission."

"We are transhumans.  Our art integrates the most eminent progression of

Out into our solar system the phrase "We are transhumans" is being spread.
It will reach the Saturnian system in 2004.

Imagine, our existence expressed by the word "transhuman" will traveling

The cost of Linux is as high as the cost of any other OS of similar 
complexity, power, and robustness: extremely high.

But many people have VOLUNTEERED to pay it on behalf of everyone, 
without any compensation other than the fact that others VOLUNTEER 
likewise and thus the cost to any one volunteer is acceptably low.

Subject: "Brain Transplant Technologies" - 5th Annual Anti-Aging
  Conference Brief Recap
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

The Fifth International Conference on Anti-Aging Medicine and BioMedical
Technology (A4M - American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine) held this past
weekend in Las Vegas.  

I'd like to recap the "Brain Transplant Technologies" talk given by Robert
J. White, M.D., Ph.D. (Professor of Neurosurgery, Case Western Reserve
University).

"While undoubtedly highly controversial, recent anatomical dissections and
review of the experience of transplanting the animal brain at a subhuman
primate level strongly suggests that the surgical procedure and support
system could be successfully adapted at a human level for brain
transplantation.  Experiments conducted from the 1960's through the 1990's
demonstrated conclusively that the monkey brain contained within the head
could be viably transferred to the body of a similar animal from which the
head had been removed.  The techniques developed within the framework of the
animal operative methodology would be fully adaptable for similar human
surgeries requiring stages vascular association:  arterial and venous....

"Two operative problems, which were solved in the experimental animal, would
also have to be addressed in [hu]man....

"The proposed operative gantries, and the physiological maintenance for the
first human brain transplantation will be presented."

Dr. White was an approachable speaker whose articulation and claim made his
ideas seem not only tolerable by conventional thinkers, but also a rational
approach to prolonging life and also possible applications for neurosuspensions.

Unfortunately the conference was designed so that the speakers were summoned
to give their talks one after another in rapid succession without audience
participation.  They did, however, allot a very small area to meet with each
speaker after her or his talk on the side-lines.  It was here that the
enthusiasm and passion for brain transplant surgery was explored openly
amongst about fifteen people.  Dr. White seemed a bit exhausted at his
profession's negation of brain transplant surgery and present problems of
connecting the spinal column to the brain stem.  In both the primate model
and the human model, the spinal cord cannot be reconstituted at this time.
One doctor volunteered that he has the money and the capability to perform a
brain transplant with a subject, and exclaimed that he would do this
for/with Christopher Reeves.  Dr. White explained, that because of the
nonreconstitution of the spinal column, the brain transplant surgery would
be a same-same physical situation unless Reeves' (for example) body was
deteriorating rapidly -- essentially dying, the brain transplant could be
then put into another body but it would still be paralyzed due to the spinal
nonreconstitution.

Thanks for some great info. Yeah, I can usually count on Anders to come
up with good nitpicks that usually help improve/refine things, as a few
others also can.

Now, what is the operating range of He-III for thermal
superconductivity? At what distance from a given star would a shell of
such material need to be to absorb all imput without going out of the
operating range, and what would a good shell size be for a black hole
for cooling??? WOuld the black hole radius be small enough that you'd
have a huge star shell studded by lots of small black hole shells???

I don't know who told you that Sturm, Ruger & Co. or Mr. Ruger himself
supports the ban on "assault rifles". From the several dozen or so
people I know who know him personally and professionally, and work for
the company in senior management positions, that is not the case. I
would not doubt that, not only in self interest, but in the interest of
the gun using public, the company and the man oppose the widespread
dumping of inexpensive, cheaply made foreign guns on the market, that
are not objects of pride, nor are supported by their manufacturers.
Given that people tend to act more responsibly with something that costs
them something measurable, the idea of dime a dozen zip guns easily
available to anyone at all does not interest me at all, either. As the
old saying goes, you get what you pay for, and an increase in gun
accidents, or an increase in gun use by youths and criminals due to
cheap and easy supply only serve to encourage anti-gunners like HCI to
lobby for ever more fascist legislation.

The reason that Ruger guns are not classified as assault rifles by govt
is because they follow the law and will only install a maximum of two
accessory items on the controlled list. Sounds like you are getting your
info from somebody with a gripe that they can't buy it from the factory
with as many controlled accessories as they want.

Ruger IS a stern advocate for gun safety and responsible gun use. They
will offer a gun lock free to any customer who wants one, and users
manuals are also free to anyone for the asking. In today's political
climate such a policy is only wise defensive politics. I can tell you
that Ruger is working to eliminate as much Microsoft software from their
company as possible, due to Gate's support of recent gun control
legislation.

It is unfortunate that Mr. Ruger's pioneering and prescient policies to
encourage responsible gun use have been painted as anti-gun by the,
shall we say, less responsible gun companies.

Was there anybody there working on the spinal reconnection aspect of the
surgery? Obviously this is just as important as the blood flow. I presume
they finished up with paralysed animals in the experiments you mentioned?

Well, it may take some technology, and I may br wrong, but I recall that

While the Y2K factor could be a contributing factor, I think that the
biggest factor in this already happened in 1990: The end of the cold
war. 

After sitting back and reflecting on my own anti-authority and
anti-government beliefs/opinions, etc., after growing up as a redneck
Reagan republican, progovt to the core, I would have to say that I think
that during the Cold war, we Americans, in our anti-communist fervor and
armageddon fears, were quite willing to put up with government violating
our rights on occasion so long as is was "In the National Interest" for
"The Interest of National Security" etc. etc. Our tradition of
volunteerism and community spirit served to adhere us to loyally support
the government, even when we had to bite it, kind of like how the blacks
loyally served in the US military in the hopes that things would be
different "after the war".

Now that there is no obvious or publicly proclaimed enemy, many people
are not willing to being stomped on by the government bureaucracy for no
good reason, so they question, they resist, they tell bureaucrats to go
to hell and get off their land, and some back such resistance up with
violent action when the government seems to just not get the hint, or
seems to some to vastly overstep its authority without any reasonable
justification. Given that there is no clear and present danger to
national security, many people think that the 9th and 10th amendments
give them the right to resist in any manner within the Constitution
(which does, contrary to liberal popular belief, support the idea of
armed rebellion against a tyrranical government, just read the preamble
for god's sakes).

Where does this leave us? Well, the government has yet to get it through
its thick skull that the world has changed, that it can no longer be the
big bully it has been for a large part of this century. Because of this,
everytime a citizen gets up and stands on his or her rights, and backs
them up with personal force, the government treats that person like an
enemy of the people that either needs to be reeducated or destroyed.
THis is creating a vicious cycle of resistance and repression that
replicates the sort of practices advocated by revolutionary manuals read
by leftist terrorists and guerrillas around the world. The object of
such practices is to advocate repressive policies. THis ticks off a
small, nutty percentage of the population, which actively resists and is
widely publicized by the government media organs to justify the
enactment of even more repressive policies, which causes more
resistance, and so on and so on until you are left with either a fascist
government, or civil war.

Government cannot help itself in this system, it is built to protect
itself, discourage competition, and perpetuate and grow its power and
reach. It is an unintelligent collection of self perpetuating memes, and
unless a leader able to inspire enlightened thought is able to wake the
electorate up as to the cycle that is being bred, this cycle will
degenerate to chaos or darkness. This is the difficult thing, for such
individuals through history have typically been corrupted by power just
enough to take advantage of the situation to attain empire. We are in a
post republican death spiral, that will either end in corporate
dissolution, corrupt transformation to empirical fascism, or enlightened
transformation into a state the likes of which has yet to be seen in
history.

Point taken. 

I haven't delved into the use fo PGP because I haven't found a windows
PGP tool that is easy to use with Netscape Navigator 3.01 Mail. Pure

    Just wondering a few things myself.  Number one, why do you carry a gun.
You mentioned that private ownership of a fire arm reduces violent crime.  I
don't mean to jump on your case, but do you realize that there would probably
be a drastic reduction in violent crime altogether if guns or any such weapon
didn't even exist.  I know obviously that guns are too much a part of our
society to just eliminate all together, but just think for a moment about for
what purpose the gun was originated - to kill.  Regardless of wether or not
you try to argue its value as a defensive tool, an item of sport, etc., its
main purpose is, and will remain to kill.  The problem with our society is
we've slowly become so programmed and so desensitized over the years we don't
even think twice on the matters.
    I'd like to think personally that the human race is entering a new wave
of evolution mentally.  I hope that you could clearly see, if there ever is a
totally unified society, it's not going to work unless we get rid of weapons
of mass destruction, starting with guns. You say the fact that it was
originated to "maim and kill" is more or less outdated.  Well what is its
purpose then, to sit on your mantel, looking bright and shiny?  For sport?  A
sybmol of power.  Let me clear something up, you see, the reason a gun is
built just so, and bullets are produced, is because those bullets are
supposed to escape the barrel of that gun at high velocity, destroying, and
KILLING what's in its path.
    I'm sure you could argue quite well the many good points to owning a
firearm, many argue it's a basic human right, part of the constitution; well
times have changed my friend.  Just think about when the constition was
written, think about what was going on - war.  There are certain basic
statements in the consitition that will remane valid for a long time to come,
but the more specific the statment, the more room there is for it to become
invalid sooner.  The constition states that all men are created equal, yet
slavery was excused for many, many years.  Changes are made to accomodate the
times, and what becomes morally acceptable as time goes on.
    Man started with a club, and from that more sophisticated tools, swords,
then muskets, machine guns, grenades, mortars, tanks, planes, jets, atomic
bombs capable of whiping out mass amounts of peole and causing mass
distruction.  It's inevitable that with guns come other weapons.  Imgaine if
these weapons had never been invented, imagine how many wars could have been,
and will be avoided if men walked onto the battle field armed only with a
sword.  When you don't have the comfort a multi-billion dollar war plane to
aid you so you don't have too see the faces of all the human beings you kill,
you tend to think twice about going to war.
    Now I know you're not concering yourself with this, and you probably
think I'm getting way too into this, but the fact is, this is all tied in
with, and roots from guns and the concept of weapons.  You look down on those
who oppose the use of personal hand guns, saying the laws passed to protect
actually end up working against them.  Sorry but I fail to see the logic in
the statement that those who fight against weapons have more blood on THEIR
hands than those who produce and use them.  Logic.  How can someone who has
never touched a weapon have more blood on their hands if what they had been
pushing for had succeded, and there were no weapons to spill any blood to
begin with.  Hello, get rid of guns all together and imagine just how much
more blood won't be spilt.  There is no valid purpose today to own or use a
gun, unless you are an enforcer of the law, and it is absolutely dire that
you need to use one.  Many argue they use them for sport.  Do you think that
perhaps it might be too much to ask, to give up such a sport that it might
save thousands upon thousands of lives.  What about the tragic stories of
children getting ahold of guns.  The UN peace keeper shot down in Africa by a
small boy weilding a gun, who didn't even know any better. Perhaps you,
yourself, are a responsible firearm owner, congrats, but for every gun that
falls into the hands of  a responsible owner many more fall into the hands of
irresponsible owners.  Do you think that gangs would be as previlent today if
the members went around armed with wooden sticks?  Sure a firearm protects
people from crime, but ever stop to think crime would probably be a lot less
acceptable and convenient with out the ability to end a life with a flick of
the finger.
    Ok well, sorry, I'd like to make it clear im not responding to you
individually, this was just a chance for me to jump in this.  I just tend to
think gun owners exuse the mishaps of guns in general by blaming it on the
owner, which is probably very, very true.  BUT.  When you agree to accept
guns, wether you like it or not, you are indirectly fueling a lot of
violence, and a lot of death.  Think about how many guns are sold to third
world countries, not motivated by soley a concern for the country, but more
or less - profit.  Life is amazing, and a tremendous amount of effort goes
into creating it, and a tool that can end it instantly, that was designed to
do just that, to me, is plain wrong.  Perhaps if people repected that power
it wouldn't be such an issue, but you know and I know that they don't.  What
happens in the future if there is an uprising, I'd hope, and I hope you would
too, that we could come together and solve our differenecs through logic, and
intelligence, compromise, rather than by shear force, death, and fear.  If
we, as an intelligent people, are never able to come together to resolve
conflict in a peaceful manner, than I've given up all hope.

There were a number of enthusiasts. Nothing definitive was discussed to my
knowledge.  But this is an important question.  I had to leave before our

after I left and let you know.

Interestingly enough, Dr. White said that in one of the primate models,
there was some movement detected in the front legs.  This is a good sign,
but I'm not sure if it was voluntary or involuntary reflex movement.
Regardless, there was movement.

If you're in thermal equilibrium with a negentropy source, the amount of
negentropy you can extract out of it depends on your free energy and its
temperature. (Assuming the change in temperature as you dump energy into
the source is negligible, the maximum amount of negentropy you can extract
is F/T.) So while negentropy is what you ultimately care about, free
energy is certainly a real resource.

I'm not sure what you mean by "free energy costs more per unit entropy at
low temperatures." Would you please explain?

There is going to be a tradeoff between the number of bits of negentropy
extracted per second and the energy expenditure per second. Plugging the
black hole temperature and surface area formulas into Stefan-Boltzmann's
Law, and assuming a complete shell around the black hole, we get
(1.57e-60*M^2*Th^4 - 3.56e32/M^2) Joules per second net energy flow into
the black hole, where M is the mass of the black hole in kilograms, and Th
is the temperature of the shell in Kelvins. Divide this by k*Th*ln 2, we
get the number of bits of negentropy extracted per second. With a solar
mass black hole and a shell temperature of 1K, you'd be expending 6.2
Watts and extracting 6.5e23 bits per second. With a Milky Way mass black
hole and a shell temperature of 0.1K, you'd be expending 6.2e20 Watts and
extracting 6.5e44 bits per second.

Another problem with the idea is that if the universe turns out to be
open, and these advanced civs have a sufficiently low discount rate for
fresh bits, they would be better off hoarding their mass/energy
until the universe gets cooler instead of turning them into black holes.

Although I won't try to deny the rough edges of pencils, I don't think an
accounting of costs and complexities will tell you whether a thing is a
dribble glass.  Just as the small number of key clicks to use a "keyboard
shortcut" doesn't make it simple.  Simplicity and non-dribbliness are
specific (and as I said, hard to explain) kinds of overall effect.  A too-
easy association of realism with objective measurements is part of the
problem here.

For some of us, picking up a pencil can
be like walking into a Japanese rock garden.  I would say, if your VCR
or Windows 95 gives you that feeling, don't fight it, but if not, don't
think it's you.  I agree that the pencil gets no exemption from that rule.

In fact, I think with the idea of an "anti-dribble-glass" we've started
falling into the ol' trap of wanting one toy to be the antidote to another.
The antidote (or hope for, start of, one) is awareness.  As much as I
like the pencil, it's not a savior, and no toy is going to be.

The point of TANSTAAFL is much more specific: nothing is free
/even to the person for whom it is free/.  Linux users who think
they get it for free are paying a very high price in learning
to use a more complex system, sacrificing the productivity of
lots of off-the-shelf software that's not available, increased
cost in exchanging data with others, and other costs.  Not a
bargain at all.  Paying $100 to get an OS that won't incur those
costs is a bargain.

Dear Wings:

I don't want to engage in a kneejerk response, even though this is a
hot-button topic for many. 

I used to feel something like the way you seem to. However, I changed my
mind. Please read on.

With respect, the numbers available don't show that at all.

Since you obviously feel very deeply about this, perhaps you won't mind if
I respond to your story about the little kid with a story about another
kind of victim.

***WARNING***: the following description is not for the fainthearted.

Are you familiar with the case of the 15-year-old girl who was hitchiking,
and was picked up by a man--well, genus Homo sapiens--who raped her
repeatedly and brutally *after* hacking both her forearms off?

Do you know that according to the evidence, that "man" left her to die
iwht her raw stumps still bleeding--and while in his car, masturbated with
one of the sawn-off hands while he shoved the fingers fingers of the other
up his anus?

She's still alive, seriously traumatized, and the "man" is, after getting
out of jail, now being prosecuted for a brutal home invasion and slashing
assault/rape/murder of another woman.

**********

Forget about children for just a moment. Are you telling me that no women
should have any recourse to defend themselves against someone stronger?
Someone trying to hack their arms off and let them bleed to death?
Someone carving their chest into a bloody puddle of ribbons?

Please think this through, it's tough when you feel strongly, but try to
feel like those women for a moment. Could you tell yourself that your
death was right and good because it shouldn't have ever happened?

> intelligence, compromise, rather than by shear force, death, and fear.  If
> we, as an intelligent people, are never able to come together to resolve
> conflict in a peaceful manner, than I've given up all hope.

As I mentioned above, I was depressed by this prospect, too--for many
years. I figured things out for myself, over about five years.

It doesn't depress me quite so much any more, because I know what I'm
willing to die for. This isn't braggadocio, no matter what it sounds like
to others. Knowing what I'm willing to die for doesn't mean I'm eager to
die, nor to kill. And I have managed to resolve conflict in a peaceful
manner even when guns were available. And if I ever needed to deal with
someone like that "man", I know I'd do my best with whatever I had.

The world needs all sort of people, doesn't it? Including ones who can
trust each other with things that can be misapplied?

Some folks I know came up with a trademarked slogan, 

"Visualize Armed Peace". 

It belongs right next to another bumper sticker:

"War is over--if you want it."

I find nothing to fault in either sentiment.

Peace,

MMB

Yes the Y2K problem is a hassle and there will be losers. IMHO, the Y2K
is an opportunity - all that old software and hardware should go on the
junk heap anyway, and this will merely ensure that new software on new
hardware will replace all this undocumented old kludgy stuff. And good
riddance.

I recently needed to send some private info to a friend on the net. I
have written
a short, fast, and (who knows?) what I believe to be a reasonabley
secure crypto
program - for the PC only. The zip file (.exe and instructions) comes to
17K.

I did this by sending the zip file as an email attachment. A second
email had the crypto text as a binary attachment. A third email had the
keystring for the crypto text.

If anyone wants this, let me know and I will send you the zip file as an
email attachment.

Indeed.  You can make a functional handgun with standard machine tools,
I've heard.  It won't be professional quality, it might break after a
few hundred shots, but it'll suffice to mug someone.  Or kill.  How can
you eliminate such guns?

Certainly guns are meant to kill.  They're meant to kill creatures
trying to kill me, human or not.  Perhaps you've forgotten about wolves
and great cats?  They're not much of a threat now... because they've all
been shot.  I'd hate to lose guns while they're still around.

Really.  My my.  That is not the impression I get from history.  I'm
pretty sure I've read about lots of wars in the distant past.  The
Persian Wars, the Peleponesian wars, Alexander the Great, the
thousand-year history of Rome, the Mongols, the early Islamic Empire...
all these people thought twice about going to war?  I'd hate to see what
happened when they only thought once.

"Feudalism."

It's amazing how the Cold War, the nuclear era, was one of the most
peaceful periods in Europe's entire history.  It still is peaceful,
apart from some fringe areas like Yugoslavia that don't have anything
more advanced than primitive artillery, and a bad distribution of guns.

Try this idea out: danger is not in how much deadly power is available.  
It's in how it is distributed.  The left doesn't like concentrations of
wealth, of _productive_ power; it's amazing that they don't see the
necessity of ensuring equality of destructive power.  One person with a
sword isn't as deadly as a person with a gun... but it's hard to become
a good person with a sword, so those who do, rule.  Guns are easy.  Guns
are democratic.  There are rather few stable democracies which predate
the gun.  Iceland, perhaps.

> do just that, to me, is plain wrong.  Perhaps if people repected that power

Ah, but people do respect that power... especially when other people
wield it.

I don't know what you mean by the "cost" of entropy. Entropy is free, energy 
is not, because energy is conserved, entropy is not. I don't want to stop the 
growth of entropy, it's possible that entropy will keep on increasing forever 
and I certainly hope it does because the only  alternative is the heat death 
of the universe. Free energy is related to entropy but if the universe is 
open then it's energy any intelligence must be very stingy with if it wants 
to survive for long.

Consider a computer with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The 
computer could be in two states, zero and one. Now record something into the  
computer's memory, for example one. You have reduced the states the machine 
can be in, from 2 to 1 in this case, and because the entropy of an object is  
the logarithm of the number of ways the parts of an object can be rearranged  
without changing its macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the  
entropy of the machine too. 
         
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the  
entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. As Wei Dai pointed out the 
absolute minimum energy it takes to erase one bit of information is  ln(2)kT , 
k is Boltzmann's constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and T is the temperature of the 
computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of energy by everyday standards, 
but it is free energy that must be dissipated as heat if you want to erase 
one bit of information. One solution to this problem is to keep things very 
cold, a better solution is simply don't erase information.
                                       
With reversible  computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the 
input, nothing is erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss 
and a logical operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is 
arbitrarily close to zero. Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that the 
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can be made arbitrarily small 
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can 
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of  time) falls 
as the square of the speed. 
   
I have thought of a problem with the Black Hole refrigerator idea however. 
You're going to have to put your heat radiators pretty close to the event  
horizon because Black Holes are small but they must fill a large part of the 
shy. When you get that close the huge gravitational field is going to blue 
shift light, including the ubiquitous cosmic microwave background radiation, 
except that it wouldn't be microwave radiation anymore, it will be infrared 
or beyond.

These two are interrelated. Some of the laws around the world still in
effect are to my mind extremely uncivilized and relics of feudal thinking.

Are all laws created equal? If a law were enacted tomorrow, not necessarily
here in the Good Ol' US of A, that turned all left-handed people into
slaves, would it be all right, because it was the law?

How about the place where chewing gum on the rapid transit system is a
capital offense? I swear I am not making this up. This is the genuine
current state of affairs there.

If you got instantly teleported into a train car there, and got caught with
chewing gum that happened to be in your pocket, are you honestly going to
tell me that it would be _right_ and _fair_ and _just_ that you be put to
death by enforcers of that law?

So the question becomes:

And we can all trust all of the enforcers of *ALL* the laws? No matter what?

I remember reading a shoft SF story in which superfluid He played a big

In response to the survey I do not own a gun, rather I have chosen to live in an
area where there is very little crime, so a firearm is pretty low on my priority
list.  If I do at some point in the future choose to purchase a gun, then I will
most certainly make a gun safety course a top priority. Personnally I understand
where Kathryn Aegis' concern comes from but as cold as it may sound if someone 
is going to end up maimed or killed by a gun I would certainly prefer that it is
the person aginast whom I might need to defend myself or loved ones from, rather
than myself or loved ones.  Sometimes hard choices are required, in the meantime
I hope that most of us choose to seek solutions to the sources of violence 
before resulting to it.

Yes, I'm a gun owner.
I was rather surprised by the vehemence of the reaction from some here on
the list. Ah well, tis the sad truth that not everyone will agree with you in 
this world. :-)

Sad Truth?  Last time I checked i was not omniscient, so personnally I am glad 
that there are people out there with differing opinions than my own, it means 
that I have plenty of opportunities to learn.  It would appear IMHO that a 
healthy diversity of ideas would be wind in the sails of Extropy.

I think there is reason to be hopeful when it comes to the spinal
cord. People are starting to do amazing things with neural growth
factors, so I think it is reasonable to think that a severed cord can
be re-connected at least to some extent under favorable
conditions. The main problem is of course to make these re-connections
usable, and I think there will still be a significant loss of
touch/dexterity - but it is better than nothing.

A quick guess is that it would correspond to the superfluid state,
around 2.14 K, which means you need an awfully large shell around the
star to keep it superfluid (and you need to do someting about the
background radiation, which is hotter; maybe it can be dealt with
using the black hole cooling).

I haven't tried it on Netscape Mail because I use the Eudora plugin, but I
noticed that PGP v.5.0 for the Macintosh has the option of a PGP menu which
will allow you to decrypt/verify, encrypt, and sign whatever is in your
current window.  I don't see why the freeware or retail versions of PGP
v.5.5 wouldn't have the same option.

I wish this were the case, but it is not.  I perform high-level
technology consulting.  In my experience, big corporations are spending
millions if not billions to have their old hardware and software patched
and kludged around the problem.  In most cases, the cost of "fixing" the
old software is much higher than rebuilding the entire system from
scratch, with new software on new hardware.  But, it is too scary for
management to abandon their old systems and/or commit to entirely new
systems.  Thus, they rather spend more money.  I do not believe they
really understand the complexity and costs of keeping their own systems.

My experience is that it is much easier to do build something correctly
from scratch than to try to add pieces onto a poorly designed system to
make it outperform its intended design.

I certainly cannot speak for anyone else on the list.  But, I would dare
say there might
be some on list who wish that weapons, both mass and singular, were
pitched into the
trash bin of history.  And, we could all live in the bright extropic
future we envision without
needing to protect ourselves and our families.  But, the fact of the
matter is we ain't there yet.

I personally do not see any difference between gun ownership (for
personal protection) and
cryonics, anti-aging supplements, exercise, or any other strategy
employed to gain an extended
life.

Sounds a bit like Joe Haldeman's novel The Forever War, in which
recruits training on Charon had to avoid hazards related to frozen gases.
Frozen lakes of gas were treacherous because the space suits, even with
insulation, would vaporize a layer of the gas underfoot, which could make
you slip and fall.  If the heat exchanger mounted between the shoulder
blades then came in contact with the frozen gas, it would explosively
vaporize and could kill you.  Trapped on a lake you had to scrabble
along on your stomach, trying to dig your hands and feet in enough to
get traction so you could coast off the frozen region.

I've seen some hand-made Malaysian handguns; pretty ugly copies of
the Colt 1911 and Browning Hi-Power, but workable. I've also seen
photographs of Thompson submachineguns built in the Vietnamese
jungle. Modern weapons are probably even easier, as they're often
designed for manufacture under license in the third world.

Guns are simple technology; anyone who thinks they can be eliminated 
is a fool. If you want one, you can make one or buy one; in fact 
buying illegally may well be both cheaper and easier. A few years ago 
a British shopkeeper was locked up for shooting a robber with an illegal 
.32 handgun, which cost him $60. I checked the ads in a British gun 
magazine at the time and couldn't find a single legal handgun at 
that price.

Hello all,

I don't know if this is BASIC:stuff........
But after reading the Blind Watchmaker 
(great book!) I still have a question.
Maybe I missed it in the book. (he did mention it
on page 307 though.......)

Why (leave just pure coincidence out for now)
do we need sex to spread our genes?
Wouldn't it be easier if we could all make a child?
without the sex. I mean why didn't the two 
chemicals to trigger this stay together..........
>From the selfish gene point of view, it would double
the "people" who w(c)ould spread the code.

This is of course not a suggestion to get rid of it :-)

True. But I consider its complexity (it is admittedly a powerful, not a
pointless complexity) a handicap. It has to be complex to be able to deal
with barnacle-encrusted mainframe heritage.  I'd like OS kernels to have
10, not 100 kBytes. It is software which constraints hardware, today.

Everybody has won: Life's not a zero-sum game. (Ok, maybe billge@ has lost
a tiny bit, but he surely can afford it).

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 351 December 16, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein

ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY can supply an atomic-resolution
image both of the atoms in a surface and (unlike STM) some of the
atoms in layers underneath.  Physicists at the University of
Erlangen-Nurnberg in Germany have converted a popular surface-
imaging technique---low energy electron diffraction (LEED)--- into
a form of holography.  In conventional holography, part of a laser
beam (the object beam) is scattered from an object and part (the
reference beam) left unscattered.  The scattered and unscattered
waves meet in a piece of film where they inscribe an interference
pattern which, when reconstituted, renders a three-dimensional
image of the object.  In the Erlangen experiment all of this happens
on a nanoscopic level, with electron waves instead of light waves. 
When an electron beam strikes a surface, any prominent atom can
be thought of as a beam splitter creating a reference electron wave
and---after subsequent scattering by neighboring atoms---an object
wave. From the measured electron diffraction pattern a 3-
dimensional image of the local environment of the beam-splitting
atom can be reconstructed. In this way, the surface structure of the
crystal SiC (a potentially important material for electronics
applications) was determined.  (K. Reuter et al., Physical Review

Yes, carve your box into a dual-boot Linux/Windoze system. RedHat 4.2
(better skip 5.0, it is too buggy) is really painless to install. With the
rpm package manager installing preconfigured software off the net becomes
a trivial task. With all your cable-modem-saturating bandwidth over there,
why, it must be hog heaven!

Seriously, the Linux camp has become astonishingly professional in the
last year or so (and future growth prospects do look bright indeed). Yes,
a fresh install is still formidable, so I cannot yet recommend it for a
truly clueless newbie. Otherwise, it's perfect. Give it a spin, you won't
regret it (but check your backup's integrity first).

I gather ultracold singularities are formed mostly by fusions of
singularities/singularities singularities/stars (if their temperature is
noticeably below 3 K, they can then only grow, not evaporate). (This is
most paradoxical, for the quality of the energy sink increases the more we
use it as such!) 

It would seem sensible to couple cold singularities with fusion power, and
hot holes for energy sources (difficult to detect, for semistationary
microsingularities do not emit significantly more than a nuke). However,
how does one keep the emission spectrum in the optimal range, i.e. keeping
one's PV arrays from being cooked while maxing out on output? (Ignoring
strange matter and boojums just for the sake of argument). Dumping matter
down a microhole will only make it worse: beware of the accretion disk.
Can attenuation of the ultrahard gamma and xRay be an option (emission
maximum homeostasis stops being a problem)? How would a far-sense
signature of such a power plant look like?

"Michael M. Butler" <butler@comp*lib.org> and "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin"
<warrl@blarg.net> make a good point: that in terms of labour expended
to build the product, Linux is no more free than any other OS of
similar complexity.  That is true, but I think they are confusing
"price" with "cost".  I learned while working with a financial company
a few years ago what the difference is: the cost of something is how
much it, um, costs, to build it.  The price is what you have to pay
to get it.

With that distinction in mind, it becomes clear that the cost of Linux
is just as high as other OS's of similar complexity, but the *price*
varies considerably as a function of who you are.  If you are a Linux
developer, then your price can be quite high, depending on the number
of hours you spend developing.  However, if you are not a Linux
developer, then the price is considerably lower.

I hope this doesn't degrade into a religious "my OS is better than
yours" war, but I'll try to answer your points objectively.  I am
assuming that you are specifically referring Microsoft OS's.

>learning to use a more complex system

If you don't need the power that Unix provides, then you are correct.
However, the people who install Linux tend to be people who are already
familiar with Unix, so the cost has already been incurred for other
reasons.  Granted, the people who install Linux these days tend to be
less "guru-like", but Linux has also kept up with becoming easier to
use --- within the bounds of being Unix, of course.

I would also argue that DOS and Windows are not always as "plug-and-play"
as they advertise, and that fixing the problems that can occur can sometimes
be just as costly and annoying as Linux can be.  If not for the owner, then
for the entity that gets called in to fix it.

>sacrificing the productivity of lots of off-the-shelf software that's not
>available

A few years ago that may have been true, but it's not anymore, for two
reasons.

1) Linux is sufficiently popular that some commercial Unix suppliers are
starting to produce Linux versions of their software.

2) Linux is now capable of running DOS and Windows 95 programs.  I have
not tried it, but a friend has run Wordperfect for Windows95, and MS
Internet Explorer 4.0, under Linux, using the WINE pacakage.

>increased cost in exchanging data with others

How?  Linux can read and write DOS disks, communicate over the Internet
as well as (ha! better) than DOS/Windows, read/write DOS partitions on
a local hard drive...

>Paying $100 to get an OS that won't incur those costs is a bargain.

There's one more cost that a Linux user just can't resist mentioning:
rebooting costs.  How often do you have to reboot your Windows 95 box,
due to application errors?  The people who I talk to every day who
run Windows around here say that it is uncommon to get through a day
of heavy use without having to reboot at least once, with the encumbent
loss of time and data.  Linux boxes routinely stay up for weeks or even
MONTHS on end without ever crashing.

Personally I've been offered software contracts by people on the Net 
who've seen the GNU work I've done in the past; so giving software away 
for free certainly can pay.

Hmm, you're not trying to imply that Windows, with its DLLs scattered
all over the disk, is less complex than Linux? The last time I installed 
Linux I just slapped in a CD-ROM and floppy, booted it up, and that was 
pretty much that. 

As for kernels, while a microkernel is nice there's little advantage to
the user in just stripping out most of the functionality and putting it
into DLLs. If you want an OS which can readily perform complicated tasks, 
you're going to get a complicated OS whether the kernel is 10k or 100k.

Most Linux users are using dual-boot boxes, and many own small home
networks with dedicated Windows machines. Usually, the Linuxianer has a
richer perspective (thanks to pirates, I have no problems with el cheapo
CDROMs stuffed with all kinds of (usually unaffordable) delicacies), not
vice versa.

There cometh no power without the price tag attached. If somebody demands
a DWIM, then give him a lollipop. I've learned a lot about networking in
the past few months, all in a very nonchalant way. Can't claim the same
for NT4.0 nor Win95, no ways. 

> lots of off-the-shelf software that's not available, increased

Not available, that's readily remedied. Unless your tastes are very
exquisite, getting a port should come cheap. With Java, even porting stops
being an issue ( http://www.kaffe.org ).

Which obscure formats do you refer to? You cannot mean Microsoft Word and
the Excel spreadsheet.

Make that $2 (CheapBytes). And yes, I'd gladly pay $500 if I got that
functionality. But enough Holy Wars, this is way off-topic.

More worrisome is the fact that the closer you get to the event horizon,
the time dilation effect becomes stronger and the black hole appears
hotter. The blue-shift of the cosmic background radiation is actually a
benefit, since you can take advantage of its higher temperature to run a
heat engine between it and the black hole. A proper design for a black
hole refrigerator would definately have to take relativistic effects into
account.

I think the formula I gave earlier for black hole temperature is the
temperature apparent to an observer far away from the event horizon. Can
anyone confirm this?

One more argument in their favor.  I can't think of anything
more frightening than a "unified society".  The most valuable
thing a society has to offer is diversity, and diversity,
complexity, and competition are very Extropian values.  Though
most people who talk about "unity" probably have no idea what
they mean, I can't think of any meaning for the word that has
anything useful.

Though a little more DoomsDay-ish than I usually get into, I do agree
with many/most of your premises and anayses.  Some small modicum of
positive change is occurring re: reduced deficits and such which I hope
will increase.  Though I'm not a survivalist, I do understand how they
feel.  I'm watching things carefully and considering investing my money
in gold, a Swiss bank account or something to that effect and maybe
finding another place to live if things get bad.  The unfortunate thing
is that there may be no place to go.  I like those who are actively
trying to construct such a place such as in the Atlantis Project
(http://oceania.org/) and the Millennial Project
(http://www.millennial.org/).  I try to remain optimistic and
plan/effect a better (not worse) future.  What else can I realistically
do?

    Perhaps you forgot about something called competition.  In the wild animals
kill and get killed all the time. It keeps things in balance.  Say we take out all
our predators, and have no threat left, the population will explode and food and
living space will eventually run out.  I know thats fairly extreme, but it's
something in the future that we will have to think about.  Before man came weilding
our crafty little weapons, nature was in a perfect balance give or take the many
natural disasters that happen on and off.

    I hope you would have realized by now that societal views and values have come
a long way since then.  I'm not talking about thousands of years ago.  I'm talking
about presently.  Within the last few centuries.  And I'd like to see you look me
in the face and tell me you wouldn't be more confident to go into war armed with
radar, machine guns, tanks, jets, bombs, stealth technology, etc. than if you only
had a sword.  That was my point, I suppose I didn't set it up very well.  I'm just
saying when you don't have these comforts of modern combat, you tend to take a
second thought and make sure what you are about to fight for is really worth it?

    I have to agree with you there.  I'm just saying, guns aren't a necessity of
life.  You could live without a gun no?  And yes you say you need one to protect
yourself, but that's largely to crime that was made possible thanks to guns.  I'm
trying to look at it as a hypothetical situation, where in no guns had ever
existed.  Don't you think crime related deaths would be a lot lower?

    Many of the inner city gangs today view guns as a sign of power and pride.  Too
some, they're too ignorant to realize just how serious it all is.  Almost like a
game.  It makes boys and men equal.  If gangs were based on brute strength and
regular old street fighting, and members didn't have a gun to protect them, do you
really think there would be as many deaths?  Drive by's? etc.

  Peaceful, but fearful.  You're living in your house with loved ones.  News has it
an a-bomb might be dropped on your area any minute, any day, any second.  You live
day in and day out in constant fear.  Is your exsitence peaceful?  No my friend,
being able to live freely, and carefree from that sort of thing, thats living
peaceful.  There's a difference between fearful peaceful.

    Potential energy, kenetic energy, it's still energy.  Potential destruction,
active destruction, it's still destruction.  I'd don't think you see what I'm
getting at.  How bout no destruction at all?  Guns are easy, guns are democratic.
Those are some pretty immature statements man.  Life isn't easy, it's damn hard.
How would you feel if I decided one day just to take yours away and make all your
effort throughout life for nothing with my _easy_ gun?  It's amazing how much
respect I lose when I have the ability to do such a thing, and not even have to
work at it.  If I had to beat you to death with my bare hands,  I'm gonna think
twice, and I'm gonna have respect.  (hehe don't worry just using it as an example,
not threatening you)

    Oh come on...no they don't.  Do you think the little boy who finds his daddy's
gun and accidently shoots his brothers brains all over the wall respected that
power?  Do you think the boy who shoots a schoolmate because he stole his
girlfriend respects that power?  Do you think the grown man who shoots down his
wife because she left him after he beat her respects that power?  If people
actually respected the power a gun weilds, there would be as many gun related
deaths.    I know some of my logic in the first post was sorta messy, and still
is.  I was a little worked up I suppose.  I just think you only half understood
some of the statements I made, and I'm sure I only half understood some you made,
so feel free to reply.Peace. :)

trying to look at it as a hypothetical situation, where in no guns had ever
existed.  Don't you think crime related deaths would be a lot lower?

    Many of the inner city gangs today view guns as a sign of power and pride.  Too
some, they're too ignorant to realize just how serious it all is.  Almost like a
game.  It makes boys and men equal.  If gangs were based on brute strength and
regular old street fighting, and members didn't have a gun to protect them, do you
really think there would be as many deaths?  Drive by's? etc.

  Peaceful, but fearful.  You're living in your house with loved ones.  News has it
an a-bomb might be dropped on your area any minute, any day, any second.  You live
day in and day out in constant fear.  Is your exsitence peaceful?  No my friend,
being able to live freely, and carefree from that sort of thing, thats living
peaceful.  There's a difference between fearful peaceful.

    Potential energy, kenetic energy, it's still energy.  Potential destruction,
active destruction, it's still destruction.  I'd don't think you see what I'm
getting at.  How bout no destruction at all?  Guns are easy, guns are democratic.
Those are some pretty immature statements man.  Life isn't easy, it's damn hard.
How would you feel if I decided one day just to take yours away and make all your
effort throughout life for nothing with my _easy_ gun?  It's amazing how much
respect I lose when I have the ability to do such a thing, and not even have to
work at it.  If I had to beat you to death with my bare hands,  I'm gonna think
twice, and I'm gonna have respect.  (hehe don't worry just using it as an example,
not threatening you)

    Oh come on...no they don't.  Do you think the little boy who finds his daddy's
gun and accidently shoots his brothers brains all over the wall respected that
power?  Do you think the boy who shoots a schoolmate because he stole his
girlfriend respects that power?  Do you think the grown man who shoots down his
wife because she left him after he beat her respects that power?  If people
actually respected the power a gun weilds, there would be as many gun related
deaths.    I know some of my logic in the first post was sorta messy, and still
is.  I was a little worked up I suppose.  I just think you only half understood
some of the statements I made, and I'm sure I only half understood some you made,
so feel free to reply.  Peace. :)

I'm not sure, but I don't see any big benefit from the selfish genes
perspective with hermaphrodites; the child is still a mixture of the
parent genomes. But I think I'm missing something obvious here...

> This is of course not a suggestion to get rid of it :-)

Why not? :-) And why not make ourselves hermaphrodites anyway, so we
can have more fun (and responsibility, if we wish) - our memes should
beat our genes.

    Yeah I hope you read my other response I just posted (should arrive sometime
just before this one).  I was sort of worked up when I posted that other one.  Yeah
that story is seriously sickening.  It is a hard choice to make.  But that's one
life opposed to thousands man.  How about the millions of jews who died in
concentration camps in WWII?  That couldn't really do much about soldiers armed
with guns and other weaponry forcing them to move along, and to do horrible things,
who would shoot them at an instence if they tried anything.  And who's to say that
sicko who from that incedent might not be the one ending up with the gun, and
holding that girl at gun point.  It goes either ways, but I think that the
elimination of guns would on a whole, have a lot more weight  as far as lives saved
than if people are encouraged to own one.
    The problem is, a gun is just too deadly, and too easy.  Newer generations just
have no respect for their power.  Many teenagers wouldn't think twice about ending
another's life at the pull of a trigger.  And if an uprising goes down in the
future, they're going to be the ones wielding the guns.  I know myself I have
friends who own guns, and it's more or less a game to them.  They just want to have
a flashier gun than their friends.  Sure they have a blast, they go out, shoot
things, small animals, they go hunting.  Yeah it's all fun and games.  But the
thing is it's not.
    Im obviously aware that there's really no way we could ever just *poof* take
guns right out of society.  They're a part of our lives.  I'm not suggesting that.
I'm saying hey, take a look at what kind of things are produced from guns.  When
the pros are outweighed by the cons, is it really such a good idea to try and go on
defending it?  I mean if you own a gun, and you're proud, good, I'm happy for you.
Just don't say, "guns are great, I love 'em, there's nothing wrong in the world
with guns," because that's not true.  Guns are bad, not to say they're aren't good
sides. But own up to it, don't deny that when you support guns, you also support
all the unnecessary violence and death that comes with them.  Know that when somone
carries a gun, somone one else is going to die, it's inevitable, wether or not the
person who owns the gun is a moral person or not.  Many try to defend saying guns
protect, so how can anyone say they're bad.  But you don't look far enough to see
that if guns didn't even exist at all there would be a lot less to have to protect
one's self from. Ok I'm out.

    Heh, I don't mean unified as in all one culture, all one language, etc.,
etc.  Of course diversity is one of the most valuable things in this world.
I'm saying a unified body that cares for the survival of the human race on a

religion you are. Dig?

I'm going to keep this brief, and then I'll probably have said all I feel

Bad example. The Jews were disarmed by law, before they started being
rounded up and exterminated. Kind of like my "all left handed people are
now slaves" example.

The Warsaw ghetto was defended by a handful of Jews with a pitiful
collection of arms, put up against a very large number of German troops.
They were the exception.

Nope, I don't know anything of the sort. There are something like 40
states with liberalized "shall-issue" laws for concealed carry permits.
There has been no bloodbath.

I do not promote guns.

I do promote individual responsibility.

I teach Eddie Eagle to people who express an interest:

"Stop. Don't touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult."

If that kid you mentioned had been taught, instead of being ignorant, the
UN trooper would be alive today.

As I say, I used to believe something similar. I still think that if I had
a magic wand that could instantly turn every firearm on the planet into a
puddle of atoms, I *might* wave it. But I'd think long and hard about it.

Because, as others have said, they're just not that hard to build.
People in the 1400s could do it, for heaven's sake. People with
access to nothing more than a corner hardware store can build them.

And since they're not going away, why should only bad guys have them?

Peace, and *I*'m out...

Maybe I should explain it better. If I understand the global
vision of the book right. By natural selection and thanks
to some copy misstakes of the genes (evolution:-) the one's
best equiped stay and the one's who don't go. 
But, at some point in the history of this evolution some
genes split....and could only "build" a new copy when 
they came back together again (ok a bit alterd).
If I see this right there was a point that "they" both were not
able to evolve alone and had (to evolve all sort of things) to get
back together again. In this period "they" could have been 
wiped out.............what am I missing here.........
IMHO it was very tricky to give away the oppertunity to
spread alone!? Of course I accept the "luck" or "random"
factor in this story. But maybe some of you would like 
to share their "why" opinions.

> Just wondering a few things myself.
> Number one, why do you carry a gun.

I don't carry a gun.  I will not say publicly whether
or not I own any, but I will say that I have never
carried a gun in public, openly or concealed.  I am
a rather large fellow (6'3", 220 lbs), so I feel safe
in most public places unarmed.  Petty thugs generally
prey on the weak.

Argument from false premises serves no rational purpose.
Weapons /do/ exist, so quibbling about what imaginary
worlds might be like without them is a waste of time.
Perhaps the existence of these technologies gave more
opportunity for crime to some who might not otherwise
have had that choice; but even if that is true, it does
logically follow that removing the technology--if that's
possible--will remove the effect.  Time moves forward,
not backward; we cannot un-ring the bell.  Our job is to
create /new/ technologies and /new/ social systems that
work in the face of /real/ conditions, not to pine for
imaginary worlds we will never see.

I'll think twice when the gun banners can demonstrate to
me that they are capable of thinking even once.

What I said was that such rhetoric as "designed only to maim
and kill humans" served to perpetuate dangerous memes that
make crime-inducing laws popular.  Of course guns are desinged
to kill.  They are desinged to kill those animals and people
whose death is regrettably necessary to preserve our own life
and freedom.  Where there exist /effective/ non-letahal means
of doing that, they are of course preferred.  But I won't
hide my head in the sand and pretend that non-lethal means of
defense are always sufficient.

People are to be judged by the rationally expected consequences of
their actions, not their motives or desires.  To fantasize about a
world without certain technologies is frivolous; such a thing can
never happen.  The actions that /can/ happen are to create laws.
The more gun-banning laws one votes for and supports, the more people
die.  This is not supposition, there are decades of hard emiprical
observations--look up the numbers yourself (the Cato institue study
is one of the best recent ones).  Since the rationally expected
consequence of passing a gun law /in our present state of technology/
is that more people will die, those who vote for such laws deserve
credit for those deaths, regardless of what they feel or want.
Motives don't count.  Results count.  To answer your last sentence,
it is not possible to "get rid of all guns".  Period.  To argue from
such an impossibility is irrational.  What you might well be able to
do is /ban/ all guns; i.e., pass a law against ownership of all of
them.  If you did that, gun violence would indeed skyrocket, if the
past experience with such laws is any indication.

> What about the tragic stories of...

Trot out all the tear-jerking anecdotes you want.   Believe
that I'm an uncaring ogre if you want.  I don't care what you
believe.  I care what works.  I care about hard proof, not
pretty stories.  If you want a defense anecdote for each of
your tragedy anecdotes, I could probably come up with it, but
it would serve no purpose.  It is the actual history of /all/
uses of firearms that matters, and that history is very clear
that on balance, guns have saved many lives for each one lost,
and the history of gun control laws is a bloody disgrace.  If
it makes you feel better to stay in denial about that, fine--
just stay out of the voting booth, because your ignorance in
there threatens my safety as well.

Hope all you want.  But hope isn't much use against a dedicated
agressor.  And neither is pretending that the agressors would
go away if we just stopped making their favorite tools.

This seems rather odd to me: surely, if the society is totally unified
(or perhaps "enlightened"), then it shouldn't matter whether or not
anybody has a gun?  See Chapter 80 of the Dao De Jing.

And who is "we"?

    Actually yes.  Why do you think the food chain works the way it does?
Animals die, and animals are born.  What happens if all the bobcats stop
killing the rabits?  An over population of rabits, who use up all their food
supply.  Not to mention the bobcats go hungry.  In nature its all a risk.  Some
make it, some don't.  People don't really consider the fact that there might be
laws to life.  I myself happen to believe there are.  All cause and effect.
What do you think an ecosystem is?  The animals who die give life to others.
The native americans knew this and respected it, only taking what they needed.
We on the other hand take whatever we want more or less.  And it upsets the
balance quite a bit.  Why is it do you think, that animals have been around for
thousands of years, millions, and are still here?  They are part of a developed
system of living, crafted and evloved over hundereds of millions of years,
tested against time, and still here.  I think thats a pretty amazing feat dont
you?  And here we come threatening to whipe out everything in just a few short
thousand, which is nothing compared to how long the earth's been around.
Wonder why there was never any global warming when animals still ruled the
earth.  Just some interesting thoughts I've been comtemplating.

We are not in the wild.  We are in civilization.  Humans do not have to
kill and be killed all the time.  If we made guns go away, as you dream
about, we could have many fun predators to deal with again.

It's not whether I have a tank or a sword.  It's what I have relative to
the other guy.  If I have a tank, and he has a tank, I'll have third and
fourth thoughts about going to war.  If I have a sword, and he has
nothing, then he does what I want or dies.

History before guns: chronic warfare.
History when machine guns had just been invented, and weren't fully
appreciated: World War I.
History when machines guns and jets were appreciated but most of Europe
thought pacifism and light armament could work, but Germany had lots of
guns: World War II.
History with nuclear weapons on both sides: peace.  Or perhaps a
frightened lack of hostilities, but still: how many Americans and
Russians have died in conflict with each other?

No.

And you say attitudes have changed.  Yes, partly because of guns and other
advanced technology.

Guns to protect them?  What the hell protects me?  Your historical

unskilled.  They rule.

How bout free energy?  There is no "no destruction".  Any tool can be a
weapon, if you know how to use it.  Weapons are simply tools with no
other purpose than to kill.  Which means anyone can use them.  As
opposed to an elite.

Power exists.  You can't get rid of it.  You can, however, spread it
around so that it balances and cancels.

perfectly logical. Catch some of my other posts if you can, that first one

Btw, I know its more or less impossible to get rid of weapons completely, I

Sex increases the rate at which a species can move along a selection
gradient (since two parents create more possible offspring than one)  From
the selfish sex genes' point of view, they will propagate the best if the
organism is sexually reproducing, since this makes the organism highly
adaptable to a changing environment.  The number of children may be less
with sexual reproduction, but the number of grandchildren/great-
grandchildren/etc will be greater since sex has a greater chance of
finding a "good" combination of genes. Also, sex can get rid of recessive
genetic defects.

That's my theory, at least... I haven't read the Selfish Gene.

    Yeah I know it was, but still I hope you got my point. Like I said, I know we can't
just get rid of guns all together, but my point was, none of that would have been
possible if the gun didn't even exist.  I'm not saying put a stop to guns, if it wa
possible, sure, I'd be fore it, but I know it's not.  I just like to defend the other
side.  I don't like to see gun owners saying there's nothing wrong with guns, because
there is, end of story.  And ya, I've prolly said close to all I want to about this
subject, I'd rather get on something interesting to pool my thoght with on someone,
rather than debate and separate it. Peace man.

    Wether you like it or not, we are under the mercy of nature and the natural world.
Humans may not have any predators, or kill or be killed all the time, but did you ever
stop to think that perhaps this is a bad thing?  I know it sounds very absured, BUT...
nature developed the way it did for a reason, and it has its system of balances.  Ever
stopped to think about what kind of pisition we're really in.  We have no predators.
We've learned how to farm and now have a surplus of food.  We're breaking nature's set
balances, and isn't life grand?  What happens when those checks and balances aren't
there to keep things under control?  Population increase.  With less death, and more
food, the population increases; obvious enough.  Population increases, and demand for
food and living space does too, does it not?  What happens when the worlds population
gets so large that there isn't enough living space and food?  We'll have to end up
destroying critical ecosystems so that we can pile ourselves into their space.  And what
happens when that living space is full?  Predators, and prey are here for a reason.  Our
universe is a universe of opposites. When there is too many of one or the other, things
become unstable, but when there is equal amounts, peace and balance.  Light and dark,
predators and prey, positive charge and negative charge, good and evil.Think about a
virus for a minute.  Similar to something living, a virus' only purpose is basically to
destroy life.  Why did it ever evlove/develope/come to be?  For what purpose?  Maybe a
natural population control.  Ever notice usually when there's a large spread of disease
in nature, it seems to come out of no where, kills of the abudence of animals, and then
is gone again just like that.  Who knows perhaps in that sense guns could be a good
thing, if the population ever gets out of hand, there's bound to be disagreements and
discord, maybe we'll all kill eachother off and things will be all peachy again.  Same
with disease.  We keep finding cures and more lethal and complex diseases arrive.  A
sign maybe?
    Ok I know you're thinking now that I'm way off the subject, and I am. :) Just
thought it was an interesting point to touch upon.  Ever notice it's universally
accepted that basically man was meant to conquer the earth, and that the earth was
almost made for man's triumphs.  We don't even think about it, we just accept it.  Why
live at the mercy of nature when nature can live at the mercy of us?  There are reasons
why.  There are laws to life and balances.  If we don't abide by them, something's bound
to happen.  We keep progressing, and searching for new technology, but to what end? And
for what purpose?  We seem to want to achieve and ultimate standard of living, food for
all, no pain.  But at this rate will we ever get there?  Think of all the cultures we
consider primative.  There are many island cultures, very old, some culutres tens of
thousands of years old.  And the thing is, they have discovered a way of life that works
for them.  They are content, they take what they need, and give back.  They follow the
balance.  Now if they can survive in peace with nature for that long, it's damn amazing
feat.  And when we come and wipe them out with our guns, to take their land and
resources for our expanding population it's actually quite sickening.  That system of
living, all that knowledge, down the drain.
    Heh, well as you can see I'm totally of the subject now, but I'm into this, screw
guns, I have my opinions you have yours.  But now I'd like to hear your opinion on some
of the things I've just stated.  It'd be interesting.  Later.

Generally speaking, sex probably exists because it
allows reassortment of the genome.  This can be useful
for:

a) Changes where change *per se* can be a benefit, as
in host/parasite races

b) Combining useful genes/mutations from what otherwise
would be separate lines of descent.  Say gene A and gene
B are both beneficial compared to a and b, and you have a 
population with both sexual and non-sexual lines:

Non-sexual Ab
Non-sexual aB
Sexual Ab
Sexual aB

Sometime sexual Ab will mate with sexual aB, producing some of each:

Sexual ab
Sexual Ab
Sexual aB
Sexual AB

The sexual AB members will have an advantage over all other
sexual members of the population, and if it's large enough, it will
exceed the disadvantages of sexuality and they will replace
*all* other groups, leaving a solely sexual population. (This
analysis is grossly oversimplified but you get the idea.)

Sex isn't always a win; some species reproduce by selfing and some
of those seem to have been around for quite a while.

Meotic selfing, not sex, is best at getting rid of deleterious
recessives.  In a selfing population with a lethal recessive
the incidence of the gene drops by nearly 1/2 every generation.
With sex, once the incidence gets low, the recessive almost
never manifests and it can exist until drift gets rid of it.

Sex is good at *hiding* deleterious recessives.

Sex is not needed.  Most organisms still reproduce asexually, but the ones
that did turn to sexual reproduction evolved much quicker due to the
mixing of genes, that's why most "higher" organisms reproduce sexually.

(BTW this is not really backed up by "The Selfish Gene" which has the
following to say about it (p43: "...What is the good of sex? This is an

I also think that in the end, there will be some form of new freedom
paradigm, but it wont be an easy or painless road to get there, and that
the dynamism of technology will be at the heart of it all.

I don't count myself among those cheering on an armageddon/downfall, but
I do expect that the liklihood of such an occurence to be high enough
that my failing to prepare at all would be simple stupid negligence.
THis is also why I speak out for individual rights as much as I do.
Given a loud enough message, governments do respond. The more we
publicly oppose continued repression in calm, measured, reasoning ways,
the later will be the day that darkness is likely to fall, and therefore
maximizes the time available to develop a technological out. THose that
simply accept further impingement on their rights for security's sake
will have only themselves to blame when they find themselves having
neither safety, nor liberty. For evil to succeed, it only requires that
good men do nothing.

During WWII, one of the OSS's more successful programs in the continent
was to commission the production of several million cheap single shot
pistols, which they dropped over Poland initially, and France later, for
resistance fighters to arm themselves with. While at a cost of $2.50,
the stamped metal gun was not good for many shots, the point was to use
it to ambush lone soldiers in order to acquire their weapons once they
had been dispatched with. Today these weapons are considered collectors
pieces.

The poem said nothing about guns. It said unarmed. THis means whatever
present state of weapons technology. COntrary to your naive and ignorant
ideas about native americans and aborigines, they were not peaceful
(only in the exception), nor were they unarmed. Despite an early numbers
superiority, they lost out to higher technology in terms of fighting
tactics and strategy, as well as simply industrial vs. hunter gatherer
societies, not because they weren't armed. Almost as soon as we got off
the boat, they were stealing, killing, or trading for our horses and
guns, and when they couldn't they were highly efficient at using what
was considered extremely primitive weapons technology to fight, kill,
and massacre people. Before we arrived on these shores, the different
indian nations were almost constantly at each other's throats due to
their cultural traditions of honor and counting coup. There is a limit
as to how many people can live on the land in a hunter gatherer society,
and that number is far far less than that possible in an agrarian
society. They were always fighting over resources that, to a
hunter'gatherer were in constant scarce supply.

The native americans also knew well the principle of "live free or die".
That is why they died in such numbers, because to them, living by our
ways was not freedom. Fighting and dying opposing the growth of our ways
was the only honorable thing for most to do.

And some switch mid-stream [many, in fact, are fish], depending on their
circumstances.  A brief, brisk treatment is the section `Why Be a
Hermaphrodite?' in George C. Williams' accessible little book PLAN &
PURPOSE IN NATURE (Science Masters series, 1996).  He notes: `there are two
kinds of herm., the *simultaneous* and the *sequential*....  As a general
rule, an org, will be a simul. herm. if the adaptations for one sexual
function can also serve the other...'  In the sequ. varieties, `change
always conforms to what is called the *size advantage* model'.  Male-first
herm.s use *scramble competition*, while female-first herm.s always use
*contest competition*.  I have a complete proof and explication of all
this, but the margins of my emailer are too small to give them.

This is an interestingly bizarre idea for a cosmology, but
what I meant was "not presently contemplated by physicists".
All the Kaluza-Klein-type models of the real world that have
been proposed involve product spaces of the form M x S,
where M is a "large" 4-D spacetime and S is a compact
manifold, constructible by substituting a copy of S for
each point in M. In these models, the extra dimensions
do not offer a shortcut.

What about them?

Their level of freedom varied wildly.  All but the least free were 
armed.

	Viruses have no "purpose." They exist to replicate, period.
Whatever they do to the host is either a side effect or used as a
replicative advantage. (You sneeze, friend gets sick)

	Though your rant reeks of the "Beautiful People Myth," I won't
mention much about that, as I am only vaguely familiar with it, but enough
to avoid believing in it.

	Next, their survival is not an "amazing feat." Those cultures that
couldn't sustain themselves died out.  Natural selection filtered out the
rest, and we're left with those that work... a few primitive cultures, and
a lot of more advanced ones.  Personally, I'd rather be in the latter
category when it comes to matters of healthcare.  

	Lastly, read the Extropian principles.  Wiping out other cultures
with guns (or anything else... why are guns always mentioned?) is not
condoned or advocated.

Are you claiming that replacing some neurons with artificial one would
change phenomena and therefore consciousness would be changed, but
those changes would not change any way other part of brains?

Extropians,

A recent comp.RISKS posting mentions a new machine translation
service accessible through Digital's AltaVista search engine.
See URL:
http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate.cgi?

I know the lurking linguists who read this list will enjoy playing
around with this...if you haven't tried it yet, check it out--it's
very cool. I plug in a phrase :

  4. Intelligent Technology: Applying science and technology
     creatively to transcend "natural" limits imposed by our
     biological heritage, culture, and environment.

...and I get back:

  4. Intelligente Technologie: Wissenschaft und Technologie
     kreativ anwendend, um " natrliche " Begrenzungen zu
     berschreiten, erlegte durch unser biologisches Erbe auf,
     zchtet und Klima.

...which ain't bad for a computer, considering the fact that the
input wasn't even a grammatically correct sentence. Revising the
English fragment into sentence form gives slightly better results.

     We shall apply science and technology creatively to
     transcend "natural" limits imposed by our biological
     heritage, culture, and environment.

becomes:
     Wir wenden Wissenschaft und Technologie kreativ an, um
     " die natrlichen " Begrenzungen zu berschreiten, die
     durch unser biologisches Erbe, Kultur und Klima
     auferlegt werden.

When you feed the response back and ask for English again, though,
don't be surprised if it's somewhat different from the original.
There are a couple of bugs left to work out <g>.

Still, with a web browser handy I can now grok text in Spanish,
Italian, Portuguese or French, in addition to my native English
and bare-bones German. No word on when the Lojban module is
coming online...

Well, I just got the PGP 5.5 Eudora Plugin and am testing it out now.
Boy, a 166 MHz K6 sure creates 2 kbit Diffie-Hellman keys fast! :)

Assuming this test works out OK, anyone who wants to can now write me
in my official capacity as Director of C-CAL with some semblance of

I welcome a test message in reply from any current member of the list

AMERIKA, AMERIKA
 
     by Claire Wolfe
 
Let me run by you a brief list of items that are "the law" in
America today.  As you read, consider what all these have in
common.
 
1. A national database of employed people. 
 
2. 100 pages of new "health care crimes," for which the penalty is
(among other things) seizure of  assets from both doctors and
patients.
 
3. Confiscation of assets from any American who establishes
foreign citizenship.
 
4. The largest gun confiscation act in U.S. history - which is also
an unconstitutional ex postfacto law and the first law ever to
remove people's constitutional rights for committing a
misdemeanor.
 
5. A law banning guns in ill-defined school zones; random
roadblocks may be used for enforcement;  gun-bearing residents
could become federal criminals just by stepping outside their doors
or getting  into vehicles.
 
6. Increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, an agency infamous for its  brutality, dishonesty and
ineptitude.
 
7. A law enabling the executive branch to declare various groups
"Terrorists" - without stating any  reason and without the
possibility of appeal.  Once a group has been so declared, its
mailing and  membership lists must be turned over to the
government.
 
8. A law authorizing secret trials with secret evidence for certain
classes of people.
 
9. A law requiring that all states begin issuing drivers licenses
carrying Social Security numbers and  "security features" (such as
magnetically coded fingerprints and personal records) by October
1,  2000.  By October 1, 2006, "Neither the Social Security
Administration or the Passport Office or  any other Federal agency
or any State or local government agency may accept for any
evidentiary  purpose a State driver's license or identification
document in a form other than [one issued with a  verified Social
Security number and 'security features']." 
 
10. And my personal favorite - a national database, now being
constructed, that will contain every  exchange and observation that
takes place in your doctor's office.  This includes records of your 
prescriptions, your hemorrhoids and your mental illness.  It also
includes - by law - any statements  you make ("Doc, I'm worried
my kid may be on drugs...... Doc, I've been so stressed out lately I 
feel about ready to go postal.") and any observations your doctor
makes about your mental or  physical condition, whether accurate
or not, whether made with your knowledge or not.  For the  time
being, there will be zero (count 'em, zero) privacy safeguards on
this data.  But don't worry,  your government will protect you with
some undefined "privacy standards" in a few years.
 
     All of the above items are the law of the land.  Federal law. 
What else do they have in common?
 
     Well, when I ask this question to audiences, I usually get
the answer, "They're all unconstitutional."
 
     True.
 
     My favorite answer came from an eloquent college student
who blurted, "They all SUUUCK!" Also  true.
 
     But the saddest and most telling answer is: They were all
the product of the 104th Congress. Every  one of the horrors above
was imposed upon you by the Congress of the Republican-
Revolution --  the Congress that pledged to "get government off
your back."
 
 
     BURYING TIME BOMBS
 
     All of the above became law by being buried in larger bills. 
In many cases, they are hidden sneak attacks upon individual
liberties that were neither debated on the floor of Congress nor
reported in  the media.  For instance, three of the most horrific
items (the health care database, asset  confiscation for foreign
residency and the 100 pages of health care crimes) were hidden in
the  Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103).
 
     You didn't hear about them at the time because the media
was too busy celebrating this moderate,  compromise bill that
"simply" ensured that no American would ever lose insurance
coverage due to  a job change or a Pre-existing condition.
 
     Your legislator may not have heard about them, either. 
Because he or she didn't care enough to do  so.  The fact is, most
legislators don't even read the laws they inflict upon the public.
They read the  title of the bill (which may be something like "The
Save the Sweet Widdle Babies from Gun Violence by Drooling
Drug Fiends Act of 1984").  They read summaries, which are often
prepared  by the very agencies or groups pushing the bill.  And
they vote according to various deals or  pressures.
 
     It also sometimes happens that the most horrible provisions
are sneaked into bills during conference  committee negotiations,
after both House and Senate have voted on their separate versions
of the  bills.  The conference committee process is supposed
simply to reconcile differences between two  versions of a bill. 
But power brokers use it for purposes of their own, adding what
they wish.  Then  members of the House and Senate vote on the
final, unified version of the bill, often in a great rush,  and often
without even having the amended text available for review.
 
     I have even heard (though I cannot verify) that stealth
provisions were written into some bills after all  the voting has
taken place.  Someone with a hidden agenda simply edits them in
to suit his or her  own purposes.  So these time bombs become
"law" without ever having been voted on by anybody.
 
     And who's to know?  If congress people don't even read
legislation before they vote on it, why  would they bother reading it
afterward?  Are power brokers capable of such chicanery? Do we 
even need to ask?  Is the computer system in which bills are stored
vulnerable to tampering by  people within or outside of Congress? 
We certainly should ask.  Whether your legislators were  ignorant
of the infamy they were perpetrating, or whether they knew, one
thing is absolutely certain: 
 
     The Constitution, your legislator's oath to it, and your
inalienable rights (which precede the  Constitution) never entered
into anyone's consideration.  Ironically, you may recall that one of
the  early pledges of Newt Gingrich and Company was to stop
these stealth attacks.  Very early in the  104th Congress, the
Republican leadership declared that, henceforth, all bills would
deal only with  the subject matter named in the title of the bill. 
When, at the beginning of the first session of the  104th, pro-gun
Republicans attempted to attach a repeal of the "assault weapons"
ban to another  bill, House leaders dismissed their amendment as
not being "germane."  After that self-righteous and  successful
attempt to prevent pro-freedom stealth legislation, Congress people
turned right around and got back to the dirty old business of
practicing all the anti-freedom stealth they were capable of.
 
     STEALTH ATTACKS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
 
     Three other items on my list (ATF funding, gun
confiscation and school zone roadblocks) were also  buried in a big
bill - HR 3610, the budget appropriation passed near the end of the
second session  of the 104th Congress.  No legislator can claim to
have been unaware of these three because they were brought to
public attention by gun-rights groups and hotly debated in both
Congress and the  media.  Yet some 90 percent of all congress
people voted for them including many who claim to be  ardent
protectors of the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. 
Why?
 
     Well, in the case of my wrapped-in-the-flag, allegedly pro-
gun, Republican congressperson: "Bill  Clinton made me do it!"
 
     Okay, I paraphrase.  What she actually said was more like,
"It was part of a budget appropriations  package.  The public got
mad at us for shutting the government down in 1994.  If we hadn't
voted  for this budget bill, they might have elected a Democratic
legislature in 1996 - and you wouldn't  want THAT, would you?" 
Oh heavens, no I'd much rather be enslaved by people who spell
their  name with an R than people who spell their name with a D. 
Makes all the difference in the world!
 
     HOW SNEAK ATTACKS ARE JUSTIFIED
 
     The Republicans are fond of claiming that Bill Clinton
"forced" them to pass certain legislation by  threatening to veto
anything they sent to the White House that didn't meet his specs. 
In other cases  (as with the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill), they proudly
proclaim their misdeeds in the name of  bipartisanship - while
carefully forgetting to mention the true nature of what they're
doing.  In still  others, they trumpet their triumph over the evil
Democrats and claim the mantle of limited  government while
sticking it to us and to the Constitution.  The national database of
workers was in  the welfare reform bill they "forced" Clinton to
accept.  The requirement for SS numbers and  ominous "security"
devices on drivers licenses originated in their very own
Immigration Control and  Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,
HR 2202.  Another common trick, called to my attention by 
Redmon Barbry, publisher of the electronic magazine Fratricide, is
to hide duplicate or  near-duplicate provisions in several bills. 
Then, when the Supreme Court declares Section A of  Law Z to be
unconstitutional, its kissing cousin, Section B of Law Y, remains
to rule us.
 
     Sometimes this particular form of trickery is done even
more brazenly; when the Supreme Court, in  its Lopez decision,
declared federal-level school zone gun bans unconstitutional
because Congress  demonstrated no jurisdiction, Congress brassily
changed a few words.  They claimed that school  zones fell under
the heading of "interstate commerce."  Then they sneaked the
provision into HR  3610, where it became "law" once again.  When
angry voters upbraid congress people about some  Big Brotherish
horror they've inflicted upon the country by stealth, they claim lack
of knowledge,  lack of time, party pressure, public pressure, or they
justify themselves by claiming that the rest of  the bill was "good".
 
     The simple fact is that, regardless of what reasons
legislators may claim, the U.S. Congress has  passed more Big
Brother legislation in the last two years - more laws to enable
tracking, spying and  controlling - than any Democratic congress
ever passed.  And they have done it, in large part, in  secret.   
Redmon Barbry put it best: "We the people have the right to expect
our elected representatives to  read, comprehend and master the
bills they vote on.  If this means Congress passes only 50 bills per 
session instead of 5,000, so be it.  As far as I am concerned,
whoever subverts this process is  committing treason."  By
whatever means the deed is done, there is no acceptable excuse for
voting  against the Constitution, voting for tyranny.  And I would
add to Redmon's comments: Those who  do read the bills, then
knowingly vote to ravage our liberties, are doubly guilty.  But
when do the  treason trials begin?
 
 
     BILLS AS WINDOW DRESSING FOR AN UGLY AGENDA
 
     The truth is that these tiny, buried provisions are often the
real intent of the law, and that the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
pages that surround them are sometimes nothing more than 
elaborate window dressing.  These tiny time bombs are placed
there at the behest of federal police agencies or other power groups
whose agenda is not clearly visible to us.  And their impact is felt 
long after the outward intent of the bill has been forgotten. 

     Civil forfeiture - now one of the plagues of the nation was
first introduced in the 1970s as one of  those buried, almost
unnoticed provisions of a larger law.  One wonders why on earth a
"health care  bill" carried a provision to confiscate the assets of
people who become frightened or discouraged  enough to leave the
country.  (In fact, the entire bill was an amendment to the Internal
Revenue  Code. Go figure.)
 
     I think we all realize by now that that database of mployed
people will still be around enabling  government to track our
locations (and heaven knows what else. about us, as the database is 
enhanced and expanded) long after the touted benefits of "welfare
reform" have failed to materialize.
 
     And most grimly of all, our drivers licenses will be our de
facto national ID card long after immigrants have ceased to want to
come to this Land of the Once Free.
 
     CONTROL REIGNS
 
     It matters not one whit whether the people controlling you
call themselves R's or D's, liberals or  conservatives, socialists or
even (I hate to admit it) libertarians.  It doesn't matter whether they
vote for these horrors because they're not paying attention or
because they actually like such things.
 
     What matters is that the pace of totalitarianism is
increasing.  And it is coming closer to our daily  lives all the time. 
Once your state passes the enabling legislation (under threat of
losing "federal  welfare dollars"), it is YOUR name and Social
Security number that will be entered in that employee  database the
moment you go to work for a new employer.  It is YOU who will
be unable to cash a  check, board an airplane, get a passport or be
allowed any dealings with any government agency if  you refuse to
give your SS number to the drivers license bureau.  It is YOU who
will be endangered by driving "illegally" if you refuse to submit to
Big Brother's procedures.  It is YOU whose psoriasis,  manic
depression or prostate troubles will soon be the reading matter of
any bureaucrat with a  computer.  It is YOU who could be declared
a member of a "foreign terrorist" organization just  because you
bought a book or concert tickets from some group the government
doesn't like.  It is  YOU who could lose your home, bank account
and reputation because you made a mistake on a health insurance
form.  Finally, when you become truly desperate for freedom, it is
YOU whose  assets will be seized if you try to flee this
increasingly insane country. 
 
     As Ayn Rand said in Atlas Shrugged, "There's no way to
rule innocent men. The only power government has is the power to
crack down on criminals.  Well, when there aren't enough
criminals,  one makes them. One declares so many things to be a
crime that it becomes impossible for men to  live without breaking
laws." 
 
     It's time to drop any pretense: We are no longer law-
abiding citizens.  We have lost our law-abiding  status.  There are
simply too many laws to abide.  And because of increasingly
draconian penalties and electronic tracking mechanisms, our
"lawbreaking" places us and our families in greater jeopardy every
day.
 
 
     STOPPING RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT
 
     The question is: What are we going to do about it?  Write a.
nice, polite letter to your  congressperson?  Hey, if you think that'll
help, I've got a bridge you might be interested in buying.  (And it
isn't your "bridge to the future," either.)
 
     Vote "better people, into office?  Oh yeah, that's what we
thought we were doing in 1994.  Work to fight one bad bill or
another?  Okay.  What will you do about the 10 or 20 or 100
equally  horrible bills that will be passed behind your back while
you were fighting that little battle?  And let's say you defeat a
nightmare bill this year.  What, are you going to do when they
sneak it back in, at  the very last minute, in some "omnibus
legislation" next year?  And what about the horrors you don't  even
learn about until two or three years after they become law?  Should
you try fighting these laws  in the courts?  Where do you find the
resources?  Where do you find a judge who doesn't have a vested
interest in bigger, more powerful government?  And again, for
every one case decided in favor of freedom, what do you do about
the 10, 20 or 100 in which the courts decide against the  Bill of
Rights?
 
     Perhaps you'd consider trying to stop the onrush of these
horrors with a constitutional amendment -  maybe one that bans
"omnibus" bills, requires that every law meet a constitutional test
or requires all  congress people to sign statements that they've read
and understood every aspect of every bill on  which they vote. 
Good luck!  Good luck, first, on getting such an amendment
passed.  Then good luck getting our Constitution-scorning
"leaders" to obey it.     

     It is true that the price of  liberty is 
eternal vigilance, and part of that vigilance has been, traditionally, 
keeping a watchful eye on laws and on lawbreaking lawmakers. 
 
     But given the current pace of law spewing and
unconstitutional regulation-writing, you could watch,  plead and
struggle "within the system" 24 hours a day for your entire life and
end up infinitely less free than when you begin.  Why throw your
life away on a futile effort?
 
     Face it.  If  "working within the system" could halt tyranny,
the tyrants would outlaw it.  Why do you  think they encourage
you to vote, to write letters, to talk to them in public forums?  It's
to divert your energies.  To keep you tame.  'The system" as it
presently exists is nothing but a rat maze.  You run around thinking
you're getting somewhere.  Your masters occasionally reward you
with a little  pellet that encourages you to believe you're
accomplishing something.  And in the meantime, you are as much
their property and their pawn as if you were a slave.  In the effort
of fighting them on their terms and with their authorized and
approved tools, you have given your life's energy to them as surely
as if you were toiling in their cotton fields, under the lash of their
overseer. The only way we're going to get off this road to Hell is if
we jump off.  If we, personally, as individuals, refuse to cooperate
with evil.  How we do that is up to each of us.  I can't decide for
you, nor you for me. 
 
     (Unlike congress people, who think they can decide for
everybody.)  But this totalitarian runaway  truck is never going to
stop unless we stop it, in any way we can. Stopping it might
include any  number of things: tax resistance; public civil
disobedience; wide-scale, silent non-cooperation; highly  noisy
non-cooperation; boycotts; secession efforts; monkey wrenching;
computer hacking; dirty tricks against government agents; public
shunning of employees of abusive government agencies; 
alternative, self-sufficient communities that provide their own
medical care and utilities.
 
     There are thousands of avenues to take, and this is
something most of us still need to give more thought to before we
can build an effective resistance.  We will each choose the courses
that are right for our own circumstances, personalities and beliefs.
 
     Whatever we do, though, we must remember that we are
all, already, outlaws.  Not one of us can be certain of going through
a single day without violating some law or regulation we've never
even heard of.  We are all guilty in the eyes of today's law.  If
someone in power chooses to target us, we  can all, already, be
prosecuted for something.  And I'm sure you know that your claims
of  "good  intentions" won't protect you, as the similar claims of
politicians protect them.  Politicians are above  the law.  YOU are
under it.  Crushed under it.  When you look at it that way, we have
little left to lose by breaking laws creatively and purposefully. 
Yes, some of us will suffer horrible consequences for our
lawbreaking.  It is very risky to actively resist unbridled power.  It
is especially risky to go public with resistance (unless hundreds of
thousands publicly join us), and it becomes riskier the closer we
get to tyranny.  For that reason, among many others, I would never 
recommend any particular course of action to anyone - and I hope
you'll think twice before taking  "advice" from anybody about
things that could jeopardize your life or well-being.  But if we
don't  resist in the best ways we know how and if a good number of
us don't resist loudly and publicly - all of us will suffer the much
worse consequences of living under total oppression.  And
whatever courses of action we choose, we must remember that this
legislative "revolution" against We the  People will not be stopped
by politeness.  It will not be stopped by requests.  It will not be
stopped by "working within a system" governed by those who
regard us as nothing but cattle.  It will not be stopped by pleading
for justice from those who will resort to any degree of trickery or
violence to rule us.  
 
    It will not be stopped unless we are willing to risk our lives,
our fortunes and our sacred honors to stop it.  I think of the words
of Winston Churchill: "If you will not fight for the right when you
can easily win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your
victory will be sure and not so costly,  you may come to the
moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you
and only a precarious chance for survival.  There may be a worse
case.  You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory,
because it is better to perish than to live as slaves."
 
 
NOTES on the laws listed above: 
 
 
1. (employee database) Welfare Reform Bill, HR 3734; became
public law 104-193 on 8/22196;  see section 453A.   
 
2. (health care crimes) Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, HR 3103;  became public law 104-191
on 8/21/96.   
 
3. (asset confiscation for citizenship change) Same law as #2; see;
sections 511-513. 
 
 
4., 5., and 6. (anti-gun laws) Omnibus Appropriations Act, HR
3610; became public law 104-208  on 9/30/96.  
 
7. and 8. (terrorism & secret trials) Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996; S 735;  became public law 104-132 on
4/24/96; see all of Title III, specifically sections 302 and 219; also 
see all of Tide IV, specifically sections 401, 501, 502 and 503. 
 
9. (de facto national ID card) Began life in the Immigration
Control and Financial Responsibility Act  of 1996, sections III, II
8, 119, 127 and 133; was eventually folded into the Omnibus 
Appropriations Act, HR 3610 (which was itself formerly called the
Defense Appropriations Act -  but we wouldn't want to confuse
anyone, here, would we?); became public law 104-208 on  9/30/96;
see sections 656 and 657 among others. 
 
10. (health care database) Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, HR 3103;  became public law 104-191
on 8/21/96; see sections 262, 263 and 264, among others.  The 
various provisions that make up the full horror of this database are
scattered throughout the bill and  may take hours to track down;
this one is stealth legislation at its utmost sneakiest.
 
     And one final, final note: Although I spent aggravating hours
verifying the specifics of these bills (a  task I swear I will never
waste my life on again!), the original list of bills at the top of this
article was  NOT the result of extensive research.  It was simply
what came off the top of my head when I  thought of Big
Brotherish bills from the 104th Congress.  For all I know,
Congress has passed 10  times more of that sort of thing.  In fact,
the worst "law" in the list -- #9, the de facto national ID card -- just
came to my attention as I was writing this essay, thanks to  the
enormous efforts of Jackie - Juntti and Ed Lyon and others, who
researched the law.  Think of it: Thanks to congressional stealth
tactics, we had the long-dreaded national ID card legislation for  five
months, without a whisper of discussion, before freedom activists began
to find out about it. Makes you wonder what else might be lurking out
there, doesn't it?  
And on that cheery note - THE END.

I am discovering that the PGP plug-in's signature "eats" or
"overrides" my standard sig file. This is unfortunate, since my
standard sig tells people how to read my return address. *Sigh*. I
guess it's time to call up Qualcomm again.

I found this on the web while procrastinating.

In the author's own words:

The only reason Einstein's special theory of relativity seems weird to
those learning it is that the velocities we're familiar with are
such a tiny fraction of the speed of light we've never had a chance to
gain an intuitive sense of relativistic effects. If the speed
of light were 100 kilometres per hour, footballers would have no trouble
dealing with relativistic goal shots. C-ship uses
computer image synthesis to put you aboard a starship entirely
consistent with the laws of physics and lets you look out the
window to experience special relativity with your own eyes.

I think that phrase should read "was one of the most peaceful periods in
Europes entire history *since the Roman Empire*.  Peaceful periods in
Europe tend to not last a generation, Europe was at peace for quite a bit
longer than that in the first couple of centuries AD.

Both of those groups had weapons. They were just crappy weapons compared to

Amen.  I agree that "prudence is the better part of valor" and one should

I would just point out that the idea of Extropy is to move beyond
what nature has given us through evolution, and take control over
our own future. If you want to keep living as you "were evolved
to live", then why don't you become Amish or something?

Actually we killed most of them with our germs. Sometimes
accidentally, sometimes on purpose. Here in the midwest there are
scores of huge burial mounds, upon investigation we now know that
the people in these mounds died at the same time, many shortly
after their first contact with British and French fur traders.

I was reading an account of fur traders visiting a group of Mandan
here in Illinois, the village population was in the thousands. A
year later they returned to find a few very sick survivors and the
massive burial mounds.

In at least one incident the U.S. Army deliberately sent a group of
Indians blankets from an area undergoing an epidemic (cholera?),
with predictable results.

As others have already pointed out, the Native peoples waged war
against each other long before we arrived, and has already been
pointed out, had they been BETTER armed, things might have gone
differently.

I am in no way going to defend our then governments despicable
habit of signing and then breaking treatys. They will have to rot
in there own graves with their own dishonor. 

So to get back on the original subject we can see being well armed
includes a great deal more than mere guns.

I don't know where you grew up, or where you live now, but let me
clue you in to life here in Chicago.

When I was a kid there was plenty of gang activity, production guns
were rare, but there was a plethora of the infamous "Zip Guns"
around. If you got caught with a Zip, the cops usually smashed it
on the spot, and you got dragged into the station where your folks
were summoned and you got the ass-whipping of your life.

In the only two cases I recall where someone was caught with a
production gun, we never saw them again. In other words they ended
up in the justice system and were dealt with very harshly.

These days the average parent denies that there "tatoo ridden, rap
sheet as long as your arm, youngster" has anything to do with
gangs, guns, or drugs. There's a new case in this morning's
newspaper involving a shooting outside a high school. When caught
in school with a gun, it's argued whether or not suspending them is
appropriate!! 

In a second case here in the news this morning, a group of these
innocent young men (about 50) from Cabrini green, yesterday staged
a protest at a local CHA (Chicago housing authority) police station
over the arrest of one of there fellow "innocent young men". They
then staged a fight outside and when two CHA officers responded,
they were ambushed with broken bottles. As I type, a team of more
than 400 combined officers are sweeping the complex making arrests.

Want to start reducing handgun crime? Start slapping offenders with
a 20 year no hope of parole sentence, and watch the numbers take a
nosedive. 

Extropian value involved? Personal Responsibility.

In the mean time I'll look after my own, and keep a neighborly eye
out for you.....

Peace through fire superiority

Brian

Unfortunately, Internic won't sell a .gov domain to a private

Obviously neither you nor Jefferson have heard of, say, Canada, or most
of the countries in Western Europe of late.  Jefferson has the excuse
that Western Europe had a substantially different face when he was alive.
What's yours?

You may be right in the long term, but it's too soon to say.

i guess my take on the gun ownership thing is this: i really dont want
anyone telling me that im  A.) too suggestable to read pornography B.)
unable to control my intake of non-lethal drugs, and C.) too irresponsible
to own a gun.

i dislike being legislatively told what i can and cant do. too often these
rules are based on others' morality, statistical analysis, or fears. i am
able to handle pictures of nude women, have smoked pot without succumbing to
crack addiction, and know a gun in my hands wont turn me into frank nitti.
why does the government, or the darker forces of liberalism feel they know
better?

as an extropian, i feel we all progress as humans when we have the least
restrictions. i fear calls for laws about cryogenics and cloning are going
to result in strictures that hurt more than help.

This is, of course, nonsense; the Nazis could have done just about as
well with crossbows and swords if guns didn't exist. I'm also under the
impression that most of those murdered in Rwanda were killed with machetes
or blunt objects, and the Old Testament records plenty of examples of
peoples wiped out with similar weapons.

There is nothing wrong with guns, end of story. There are some things
wrong with the way people use objects to maim and murder. An old 
acquaintance once claimed that he'd worked out twenty-three ways to 
kill someone with a teapot; does that mean there's something wrong 
with teapots? Or with murderers?

>From Kelly McGillis:

I was at my hometown over the weekend and it was that time of early
boring afternoon when recreational drugs are frowned upon, so I busied
myself with quantum physics and the God Particle.  I was surrounded with
my personal version of mathematical formulas when I was asked if I would
babysit a whole slew of children while the mothers went on a shopping
expidition.  I jumped at the opportunity, realizing that with all the
practical adults out of the house, I could indulge somewhat.

Soon I realized there were so many children running around the place
that I didn't know what to do. They were totally out of control.  So I
just shrugged and went back to my quantum physics.  I was at the point
of proving that a wormhole existed in my brain when there was a HUGE
crash.  It occured to me that perhaps the little ones were actually
destroying my mother's house, so I jumped up and yelled "HEY!" and put
my arm up like a police officer stopping traffic.  They immediately came
to attention. "Don't you know that people who live in stone houses don't
throw bricks!"

"Yeah," one of em said, "And don't you know people who live in houses
with Christmas trees shouldn't throw presents!"

"Well, that would be stupid, breaking a present before you even opened
it!  The fun is breaking them *after* you open them!"

A tiny one was pulling on my leg.  "Aunt Kelly?"

"And who are you," I said.  "Do you belong to this family? Or did you
sneak in?"

"I'm...I'm..I'mmm..."

"I knew it!  Not only do I have a wormhole in my brain, you are not my
nieces and nephews!  YOU'RE REPLICATING BEHIND MY BACK!"

"I'm...I'mmmm..."

"Good lord child, don't you know how to talk?"

"Tory!  I'mmm Tory!  And stoooopid is a bad word Aunt Kelly."

I eyed her suspiciously. This one was a replicant for sure.  Then they
all started yelling at me that stooooopid was a bad word.

"Okay, replicants!  That's enough!  Where are my real nieces and
nephews?  What idiot told you stuooopid was a bad word?"

Their teachers.  Their parents.  Every adult on the face of earth except
me, I discovered.

"Well, then, I'll just have to teach you a new word.  Say after me:
REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSSS.  Use that word instead of stupid, OK?"

"Aunt Kelly?"

"Yes," I said warming up to the topic.

"YOU ARE REEE-DICKKK-YOU-LUSS!"

"Hey!  Who do you think you are?  A McGillis?"

The parents thankfully arrived back and were appalled at the mess. 
Their kids, not my prob, right?

One of my ridiculous sisters-in-law had the nerve to ask me when I was
going to have children.  "NEVER!" I replied.  "It's my mission in life
to be an aunt!  And its a mission I think I excel at!"

"Yeah, and she's even got worms in her brain!"

"That, you little replicant, is a worm hole!"

I would suggest that primitive sex evolved similarly to the way it is
still done in bacteria.  Yes bacteria usually are asexual but on rare
occasion they exchange genetic information in a process called conjugation
in which "plus" (+) and minus (-) or positve and negative strands.  The F+
or male has a plasmid that codes for a projectile (called a "sex pilus",
really it is) that then penetrates the F- or female bacteria and initiates
conjugation with an endonuclease that nicks one strand of the double helix
of the F-.  The F- strand then adds this F+ strand DNA to her genome as
she synthesizes a complementary strand. No courting. No romance :-(  oh
well.  It's called  Rolling Circle Replication in the Biochemistry book I
learned it from (Moran et al., 1994, ISBN 0-13-814443-5).  I think that
our eukaryotic cellular structure is mostly or entirely explainable as
symbiotic prokaryotic-types of cells working together.  Meiosis and
"crossing over" is an eloborate "rolling circle replication" in my
viewpoint.  This approach to chemical, prebiotic, protobiotic evolution is
known as the endosymbiant hypothesis.

Shirley Allen released
======================

By
     JOE MAHR
     JEFFERSON ROBBINS
and  LESLEY ROGERS

STAFF WRITERS


ROBY - With an uneasy OK from prosecutors, Shirley Allen was returned 
to her home Tuesday with far less uproar than the day she was taken 
from it.

Christian County State's Attorney Teresa Brown agreed to a request 
from Allen's attorneys to end the 51-year-old widow's 47-day stay in 
mental hospitals. That request followed a psychiatrist's finding that 
Allen wasn't dangerous - to herself or anyone else.

"The state's not saying she's going to be OK," Brown said. "What we're 
saying is that, based on this doctor's report, it doesn't make a whole 
lot of sense to continue hospitalization for her."


Regardless of prosecutors' reasoning, Allen's court-appointed guardian 
Lindsey Reese was content that Allen was back home instead of amassing 
more medical bills.

"She was relieved of a heavy financial burden and will be home for the 
holidays," said Reese, who has estimated Allen's medical and legal 
bills at roughly $50,000.

No one from Allen's family - the people who went to a judge asking for 
the psychiatric evaluation in September - was notified of her release.

"I'm very upset about this," said Byron Dugger, Allen's brother who 
lives in Arkansas.

"I didn't know it was going to happen. Nobody in my family knew it was 
going to happen. We're not happy about the way this was handled."


Allen was released at noon Tuesday after a morning hearing and, after 
a brief stay at Reese's Taylorville office, arrived about 3 p.m. at 
the single-story home in rural Roby from where she fended off state 
police with a shotgun for 39 days.

"She was really happy at the decision," Reese said. "She was really 
looking  forward to getting home and cleaning up her house."

Reese pulled into the driveway while a second car ferried Allen to the 
rear of the house. She entered quickly while Reese gave a brief press 
conference.

Allen could then be seen cleaning the house, one way to save the 
$2,900 estimated cost to eliminate the pepper-spray odor lingering 
from the standoff.

Allen is expected to spend the next couple of days finishing reading a 
large box of letters from well-wishers. Reese said she plans to write 
thank-you's to most people and will use the many canned goods and 
bottles of water sent by supporters.


Allen called her mother Tuesday night once she got home, said Dugger, 
who plans to meet with the judge and Allen's lawyers Thursday to find 
out why she was released.

"They had a good conversation, my mother said. She sounded fine," 
Dugger said. ''She said she was happy to be home."

Allen did not spend her first night of freedom at home but was 
planning to stay with friends to avoid the media, Dugger said.


"No trespassing" signs were posted on the front lawn and in a window 
of the residence. Reese warned anyone who might approach that he would 
call police and prosecute trespassers.

For a neighborhood that hosted up to 75 troopers during the standoff, 
it was unusually bare of any police during the homecoming. That's 
partly because sheriff's deputies didn't know for sure that Allen was 
coming home until told by a reporter.

"We were totally in the dark," said investigator Bob Patrick, who 
oversaw the sheriff's office Tuesday in the absence of the sheriff and 
chief deputy.


Allen's shotgun and ammunition remain confiscated, according to state 
police spokesman Mark McDonald. Troopers did leave behind two pistols, 
one an antique, he said. Neither has ammunition.


The surprise release follows more than a month of legal maneuvers by 
Reese and defense attorney Bill Conroy of Athens. In the latest move 
last week, the pair got Allen's committal case moved to Christian 
County.

The case was first set in Sangamon County because Allen was initially 
sent to St. John's Hospital in Springfield, but state law allows for a 
transfer to the defendant's home county.

Sangamon County State's Attorney Patrick Kelley said Allen's lawyers 
had asked a judge to allow her go home while the case was in his 
jurisdiction, but the judge denied that motion. For one thing, no 
medical authority had come forward to say that Allen posed no threat.


"It's a different set of facts (now) from what we had here," Kelley 
said.

He said one factor in the case is still on appeal to the Fourth 
District Appellate Court, though that appeal may now be moot.

In Tuesday's Christian County hearing, Allen was released based on a 
mental health examination by Dr. Bruce Feldman of Springfield, who 
said she's not a danger to herself or others, which is one legal 
guideline for being committed.

Allen's release came on the condition that she submit to an evaluation 
by a court-appointed psychiatrist within 30 days. Feldman was hired by 
Allen's attorneys.

And even if the court-appointed psychiatrist finds Allen perfectly 
fit, she could still face jail time.

Although police have shunned the idea of criminal charges, Brown said 
she's still mulling over whether to charge Allen for her actions 
during the standoff. Those actions included Allen allegedly firing at 
troopers three times and shooting a police dog, who survived.

Brown said a decision on criminal charges won't be made until after 
the committal process.

"I'm still looking at the (police) reports right now," she said. "I 
can't really say it hinges on any one thing. It's just going to be a 
consideration of all the facts and
circumstances."


State police took Tuesday's news in stride.

"After 47 days in a hospital under a doctor's care, it's not 
surprising that her condition has improved and she was released," 
McDonald said.

"All anybody ever wanted was for Shirley to live a normal life. 
Hopefully, after all this time she's spent in the hospital, she's able 
to do that."

But just what kind of care Allen has received remains a mystery. By 
state law, Allen can refuse treatment, something her family has said 
she's done throughout her hospital stay.

Reese could not say what type of treatment she received during the 
course of her hospitalization or if she is currently taking any 
medication. She has taken anti-depressants in the past.

Reese said after Allen gets settled back into her home, they may 
consider interviews with the media later this week.

"She's overwhelmed right now," said Reese, who expects to end his job 
as Allen's legal guardian soon, possibly before her next 30-day 
evaluation. Reese's legal fees are paid through Allen's estate, and he 
said he cannot disclose how much he is paid.

Once she was freed, Allen spent part of the day at the office Reese 
shares with his father and law partner, Daniel Reese. The elder Reese 
said he was amazed at the amount of media attention paid to Allen, 
whom he called "a very private person."


"I told her, 'You're like Princess Diana,' " he said.


"She said, 'But Princess Diana's dead.' "

Western Europe!?!?!?! you've got to be kidding! I've got relatives

Well actually you probably consider that eastern Europe, but the
western countries all still have militaries and armed citizens to
some degree, perhaps you missed the recent post from one of our
Dutch members?

Canada? Last time I checked you still had a military, not to
mention armed citizens, not to mention a rather large  and
extremely well armed neighbor to the south. If you think thats got
nothing to do with it, you're only kidding yourself.

Is conjugation that rare? I was on a lecture about how plasmids evolve
(they are selfish replicators, after all, and do their best to
maximize their fitness) and I got the impression they are sometimes
almost littering the cellular environment.

And by the way, there has to be some chemical courting for the sex
pilus to find the F- bacteria - chemotactic desire...

Matt Ridley's "Red Queen" makes a very convincing argument that
the primary function of sexual reproduction is to increase the
genetic diversity of the organisms to stay ahead of faster-
evolving parasites.  Evidence for this contention includes the
fact that there is a fairly good correlation between organisms
that reproduce primarily sexually and those with long times
between generations; and that isolated groups of normally sexual 
species that become too inbred die out not because of bad
recessives but because of less effective immune systems (i.e.,
if you're too close genetically to your parents, their germs
have had 30 generations to adapt to them, and are likey to be
well adapted to you too).

    My naive and ignorant ideas?  I'm sorry my friend but how bout yours?
Aborigines are actually an extremely peaceful culture.  Obviously these
cultures _were_ armed.  Of course, that's not my point.  They respected
their weaponry.  Used primarily for hunting.  And yes Native Americans would
constantly fight between tribes, but on a whole, most tribes were a very
peaceful people who respected life, and nature, unlike the European
cultures.
    As far as aborigines being violent.  White men came and take their land,
and kill them.  When they got right off the boat, you say, they were almost
imeadiatly fighting and killing?  Perhaps because they were smart enough to
know what was going to happen to them.  When someone invades your homeland,
first reaction usually isn't to let the invaders walk right in and push you
out.  Of course they fought.  Before white men came Aborigines flourished on
the coastlines, but were forced to move to the intrerior.  You speak of
massacres by the Aborigines, but you conveniently happen to leave out the
fact that the same was happening to their people.  People look down on
"primative" societies, but I for one actually will give them more credit
than what we call "civilization".  Aborigines can trace back their own
history a good 40,000 years.  Under the same system of living, they managed
to be around for that long, in peace with nature.  Here we come, in just a
few short thousands years, and manage to cut down mass amounts of trees, use
up mass amounts of resources, create nuclear weaponry capable of destroying
the earth several times over, cause global warming, etc., and we consider
our society superior?
    And I beg to differ on your views about agrarian societies vs. hunter
gatherer societies.  Nature sets limits, nature sets balances.  When you
offset these balances bad things tend to happen.  Of course the limit of how
many people can live on the land in an agrarian society is much greater, but
is this a good thing?  Whoopy so we've mastered agriculture, and other
various technologies that allow us to prosper.  With a hunting and gathering
society, they live at the mercy of the land, and the population is kept in
balance accordingly.  These cultures had developed a system of living that
worked for them, they generally weren't discontent.  Our society is
flourishing, sure, population on the rise.  That's exactly it, population on
the rise.  Because of our technologies we can avoid the balances set forth
by nature and our population will sky rocket.  And sky rocket.  Did I
mention it will sky rocket.  What happens when the earth is so populated
that our agrarian limit has been reached?  The ability to come up with a
system of living that works along side with nature, and that can last tested
agaisnt time for thousands upon thousands of years, is bar far just as great
as many of the technological discoveries we've achieved.  Perhaps they had
the right idea, but thanks to what we've come to be taught and know, we're
the ones who consider them primative.
    When I made that retort to your poem, I understood well that these
cultures weren't unarmed.  I was hoping you'd be open minded enough to see
my point wasn't that they were unarmed, but that they respected their
weaponry, used it mostly for hunting, and only when needed as a
defensive/offensive tool, yet remained to stay peaceful, to an extent native
americans, more so aborigines.  The position you took was so classic, right
out of white men's history books.  Have you ever read any books written by
people who have actually gotten to spend time with aborigines, who have
closely studied their culture?  If you have you'd find that the aborigines
are actually a very peaceful, intelligent, and wise people.  May I suggest
Mutant Message Down Under by Marlo Morgan.  Could prove to be interesting
reading.  Your answers were of course vary logical, and yes I accept what
you say about losing out to higher technologies, that's selfevident.  But
they were also very onesided.  I've spent a deal of time studying cultures
such as native americans and aborigines and I think your conceptions of them
are actually fairly off, mostly factual, and facts you pulled out of a white
man's text book.  Did you know that know a majority of aborigines have
willingly stopped reproducing because they know their time on this earth is
over, and have been pushed out by our agrarian society.  That is something
very respectable in my opinion, in our culture you know we would never be
able to do something like that, basicallly because people lack that kind of
selfcontrol and respect for nature.  My main point out of any of this, is
that there HAVE been many "primative" societies who have prospered and
enjoyed life, with the use of minimal weapons, and with primative weapons at
that.  The primary use for their weapons being to hunt food, not to kill or
defend from another human being, although yes they were used for that.
Think about how many gun owners today own guns to hunt soley for food.
Think of how many gun owners live in cities.  And perhaps Jefferson was
correct when he made that assumption, because if ever a culture tried to
live peacefuly without being armed, they would probably end up all being
killed off by some agrarian society trying to take their land and resources
from them, because their population has become to great to be surficed with
what they already have.

    Things evolve for a purpose.  If you look at any living thing you can clearly see that.
Perhaps they did come to be just to replicate, but I think the idea that they came about as a
natural means of controling population is just as feasable.  Think about what happens to
animals in a certain area when there is an outbreak of disease.  Animals will die, and when
all the animals are dead, the virus will die out too. (once the population is contained, no
more need for the virus, it goes bye bye, until more animals come along, plus the fact that
since animals spread disease, the more animals there are, the easier it is for a virus to be
transfered, the lower the population, the harder) But yes there's no real way to prove
sucessfuly prove if what I'm saying or if what you're saying is true or not.

   Again the same thing.  When animals ruled the earth so to speak, populations were usually
kept in balance with nature and the natural surroundings by how much life could be supported.
With no real need for viruses and disease, and there weren't as many complex forms of it.  Now
here we are, evolving and in the process discovering ways to combat the effects of disease, so

    Well then what do you think we're trying to do when we continue to progress and make
technological, evolutionary, agricultural, etc., advancments?  Trying to replenish the worlds
natural resources?  Trying to make the world a place where animals, people, and plants can
live together in a natural state?  Trying to expand the mind, yes.  And it seems, correct me
if I'm wrong, that these advancments we make on a whole, seem to entail trying to reach a
perfect system of living, a utopia, where through the wonders of technology there is no more
pain, suffering etc.  But without an overly strong concern for animals and the earth, not to
say that there isn't a concern there, because there is.  Who knows maybe we'll reach that
state of living, and everything will be in perfect balance, and woo hoo for us.  But at the
rate we're going I just think it's questionable that we'll make it, and that all different
perspectives should be considered, which is basically why I try to make the arguments that I
make, I don't think that anything should be overlooked.

    It's apperent in nature.  If you study wild animals and the way they live, study
ecosystems, there are certain "laws" to life that have been set forth by nature.  The food
chain, balance of predators and prey, etc.  What happens when you upset one of these balances,
and so called "laws"?  Hmm well let's see.  Take predators and prey for example.  Wipe out all
the predators in within an ecosystem and the prey will flourish, soon there won't be enough of
a food source to sustain the out of control population, starvation will set in, and they will
begin to die off.  If you kill of all the prey, that's fairly easy, there won't be enough of a
food supply to support the predators.  I'm not going to go into everything obviously, but
that's what I mean by "laws of nature".  Pick up a copy of the book, Ishmael, sometime.

    I'm not speaking of the ones that have died out, I'm speaking of the ones that continued
to survive, and all without threatening the integrity of the earth, and that we have managed
to erase from the face of the planet.  The ones that would continue to survive and have
continued to do so, if we didn't get involved.  They have been filtered out by us yes, and we
automatically assume our way of life is far superior.  What I'm saying is, is it really?  It's
all we know.  Personally I think our way of life is amazing yes, and it allows us to sustain
ourselves very well, and make amazing discoveries and accomplishments.  But its also a very
arrogant way of life that doesn't respect our surroundings overly, and has amounted with our
ability to become our own undoing if we're not careful.  I think we need to make sure we
consider all sides to avoid such a thing from happening.

It may be more common than was portrayed in my Biochemistry book and
indicated by the professors I've had but it is biological "standard wisdom"
at least that bacteria usually reproduce asexually by mitotic division.

    We're still under the mercy of the natural world, and we have to make do with
what the earth can provide for us.  I'm not saying let's not take control over our
own future, I'm all for it.  I'm all for technology.  I'm just hoping humanity can
make intelligent choices about what we do with our technology so we avoid becoming
our own undoing.  I'm not saying yipee, everybody put down all your technology, let's
go through on some animal skins and run around scantily clad in the woods together.

    Yes you're right when you say that it is the person, not the gun.  But we
know that not everyone is responsible.  In fact many aren't.  And when
responsible gun owners promote the ownership and production of guns, you know
well that just as many will fall into the hands of someone unresponsible.  But
yes the best thing to do would be to change how people think, not what people
do with guns.  I think if we could change the way people think, there would be
a lot less reasons for guns to be produced anyways.

I propose the word "babelization" to describe the process of
recursive translation of a text. It seems that "circular
babelization" - translating from A to B, and then from B
back to A  - is a good way to find bugs in a translation
program. Here are the Extropian Principles v2.6, babelized
via English-German-English:

  1. Boundless expansion: Searches of more intelligence, 
  of intelligence and of effectiveness, of unlimited life span 
  and of reduction of the political, cultural, biological and 
  psychological delimitations to selfactualization and for self
  implementation. Delimitations on our progress and possibilities 
  unaufhoerlich overcome. Extension into the universe and advance 
  without end.

  2. Self transformation: Moral one of acknowledging continuous, 
  intellectual and physical self improvement, by reason and critical 
  thinking, personal responsibility and experimenting. Searches of 
  the biological and neurological vermehrung. 

  3. Dynamic optimism: Tanks of the dynamic activity with positive 
  expectations. A rational, activity action based optimism assume, 
  blind faith and stagnating pessimism avoid. 

  4. Intelligent technology: Science and technology creatively 
  applying, in order to exceed " natural " delimitations, imposed 
  upon by our biological inheritance it, breed and to climate. 

  5. Spontaneous order: Support decentralized, voluntaristic
  Sozialkorrdinationsprozesse. Promote from tolerance, from diversity, 
  long-term thinking, from personal responsibility and from individual 
  liberty. 

Being unable to "un-translate" single words is a pretty basic
problem; I've already mailed them to mention the instances
here ("perpetually", "augmentation", "social coordination
processes"), and I'd suggest that anyone else who finds a
single-word error do the same thing, since that sort of
error ought to be easy to correct.

But humans are killed all the time, not only by other humans, but by
viruses, bacteria, etc.  For the record, I feel it is a good thing that
humans are not routinely chased and killed by leopards or wolf packs
in my neighborhood.  Those that feel otherwise are always free to light
out for the wild places and go one on one with their favorite predator.

I disagree.  The Earth's biosphere developed as it did just because of
the contigencies that happened throughout its history.  Humans are
not outside of it, but it is not a system of balances.  There certainly are
some processes that appear to balance, but their is no design or
reason for these.  They just happened to come about and are stable
for now.  Many other things are unstable or only metastable.

The balance metaphor fits more the TV documentary view of the wild
than the reality.  Other organisms, from trees to bees, create
surpluses.
Some even upset so called balances -- look at the spread of aerobic
bacteria or postCambrian animals.  These changes literally destroyed
prior ecosystems.  Today, as far as we know, there are no preCambrian
animals and anaerobic bacteria are still around, but have a very
marginal
existence.

This all sounds like the conventional environmental view of life on
planet
Earth.  The problem is there is no real population problem for humans.
There are some management problems, which free markets and
assigning property rights can take care of, but the Earth's human
population is relatively small given the human capacity for efficient
use of resources.

For a post on an Extropian/transhumanist list this does not seem to
display a familiarity with some of the basic literature.  I recommend
the works of Julian Simon, especially _The Ultimate Resource_.  (Simon
is not an Extropian.  He's merely an economist who decided to see if
the data fit the Malthusian view of scarcity.  It didn't and he was
honest
enough to see that.)

This begins to sound like something from a pamphlet.  Opposites are
only so in relation to the human mind.  In reality, things just are what
they are.

Maybe not.  By this reckoning, anything that depends on using 
something else has its "only purpose" as "to destroy life."  If
"purpose"
can be applied to viruses, then it would appear their purpose is to make
more of themselves.  Destroying only happens incidentally.   In fact,
many (most?) viruses do not kill.  Witness the common cold.

It would seem Mike Everett wants to think there is some cunning power 
that creates diseases to cull the population.  What actually happens is
diseases spread and the ones that kill their hosts tend to burn out
very quickly.  This is not balance.  It's actually a metastable state.
Such diseases can only survive in very regions, which is why epidemics
are so rare.  If they were not, they would wipe out their host
population
and in the process destroy themselves.  To be sure, some do, and
they are no longer around to inflict themselves on other hosts.

>Who knows perhaps in that sense guns could be a good thing, if the 
>population ever gets out of hand, there's bound to be disagreements

Actually, the opposite seems to happen.  In the US, states that have
less gun control, have less violence.  If this was not the case,
humanity
would have destroyed itself long ago.  Recall guns have been around
for how many centuries?

>Same with disease.  We keep finding cures and more lethal and 
>complex diseases arrive.  A sign maybe?

Maybe not.  Perhaps people long ago died of some of these diseases,
but they were diagnosed as something else.  If, e.g., AIDS is really
caused by HIV, would some tribe in the Congo be able to tell whether
one of its member died because of HIV killing his/her immune system
or just that that person had a weak immune system and caugh
pneumonia?

Also, note how few people are actually afflicted with these rare, new
diseases.  Heart disease is still the number one killer of Americans,
for example, and the cure is pretty easy in most cases.

This sounds like a recipe for dictatorship.  I say, yes, there are
natural laws, but these are not the warm and fuzzy "all is balance"
ones.  And they need to be understood not idolized.

Which ones?  The Tahitian society that Cook found, for instance, was
a strict oligarchy, where one tribe basically squashed another.  This
noble savage stuff is way off.

I agree because it is done _involuntarily_.  The actual process of
imperialism does not really pay off and most resources, throughout
history have not come from colonies.  They were usually side issues.
For example, the British in the late 19th century -- the heyday of
colonialism of this sort -- traded much more with the rest of Europe
and America than it did with Africa.

>That system of living, all that knowledge, down the drain.

I would not fret over that but over the violation of individual rights,
specifically the murder and enslavement that went on.  But European
colonials, bad as they were, were not in all cases attacking totally
innocent noble savages.  In many cases, they were just the latest
conquerors.  Recall the Aztecs had a huge empire before the Spanish
decided to get a piece of the action.

>Heh, well as you can see I'm totally of the subject now, but I'm into
>this, screw guns, I have my opinions you have yours.

That last statement is the last refuge of people who have no
justification.
Opinions are not primaries.

    Just heard on the TV News that the FDA
is looking to blame the use of creatine for
the rash of wrestler deaths!  Taking creatine
while they attempted to lose as much as
20 lbs exercising in hot rooms with rubber
suits!?

    Tryptophane ban all over again?

I absolutely agree.

But *how* to change the way people think? 

To scare them? To lie to them? To tell them guns have demons in them that
make you kill people when you're pissed off in traffic?

Or to tell the whole truth, and get people "evolved" (bad word:
"post-evolved" might be better) to a point where violent acts aren't their
first resort during a bad-hair day?

I favor the latter. That means getting everyone rich and calm, AND not
trying to screw each other. Including not lying to each other.

Why no, it's quite easy.  Any replicator evolves to be the best possible
replicator it can.
It's been shown over and over again that a virus will evolve to spread as best
it can;
viruses that are benign to their host evolve to become more virulent if that
aids their replication
(HIV); viruses that are lethal evolve to become benign if *that* aids their
replications
(rabbit myxomatosis).  Effects on the host are just means, not ends.

This applies to any replicator.  Over time, the replicators that replicate
better will replace
those that don't.  There is no way to hold a mutating replicator to any
purpose other than
replication.  People, memes, or viruses; it's all the same.

No, it's not feasible at all, because "purpose" and "means"
requires the existence of a volitional being to have a purpose
and to choose means.  To assume that evolution has a purpose
is a contradiction in terms: it is theism.  Evolution, when
understood correctly as simply an inevitable mathematical
consequence of certain initial conditions, explains precisely
how their can be such wonderfully conplex things as people
and viruses which /appear/ to be designed for a purpose
without requiring the existence of a designer or purposes.

It's really not that difficult a concept once you put your
mind to it.  Dawkins is, of course, one of the best explainers,
but it really was Darwin who made the important conceptual
leap that made it possible once and for all to get rid of the
silly ideas of "God" and "nature" that kept us in the dark.

So do we disarm the responsible, or let them arm themselves so that 
when the worst of the irresponsible show up it is the latter that 
lose?

I wrote a long point-by-point reply to Mike Everett / Wings of the Morning,
but on second thought I won't bore you all.  Suffice it to say that I 
believe neither in original sin, nor in sympathetic magic, nor in Mother 
Nature; nor do I believe that the dramatist's dictum "If a gun is seen in 
the first act it must be fired before the curtain" applies to real life.

    Well disculding natural weapons.  What do you call every single life
form before "man" came around and started using tools and weapons?  Do you
consider them certainly no more advanced than plants?

    No I understand what you're saying.  I know we can't really prove the
purpose for anything, or that there was a creator, etc., etc.  I think that
fact has been well established.  I just like to toy with these ideas, and I
personally think _anything_ is possible.  Let me tell you a little story.
I've come to believe there are elements, of a perhaps you can call them
"higher power".  Not necessarily a "god".  I think the idea of a deity with a
personailty running things is fairly absured (and yes I know I said I think
anythings possible ).  But there are far too many unexplained occurences out
there, they can't even begin to be explained with our ways of explaining
things now.  Even Hawkings himself said he now is starting to disbelieve some
of his own statements, because the evidence of a "devine force" is so
strong.  Any ways, on with my story...    It had to do with the computer Im
using right now in fact.  So I ordered my computer, I was psyched. After just
sleeping really heavily, I awoke, and once I managed to straighten out my
thought I began to think about the computer and wondered when it was coming
(it was due to arrive at any time close to when this occured).  So I sort of
asked/listened, and in my head sort of day dreamingly envisioned a yellow
rider semitruck.  Whoopy I thought, what was that supposed to mean, and I
discarded the idea.  Later on, the computer was supposed to have come, but
had not.  Strange I thought.  And at the end of that day, I began walking
home from school (yes I'm 16).  I noticed a particular friend I sometime got
a ride home with, and thought to myself, should I ask for a ride...and
eventually I did.  Oddly enough, that day, he could only take me up to the
end of my street, because he had to hurry right back to the school for
something.  So he did, and as I was walking up my final stretch of road, I
had an impulse to look back, and what else did I see other than a yellow
rider semitruck.  Whoa, I thought, strange as hell.  So I got home, and began
to think about my "vision".  Playing with this whole pyschic idea, I thought
well let's toy with this, and pick a time.  So I did, something like 3:10.
And right at 3:10 I heard a car engine in my drive way - it was a friend.  Oh
well.  Events like that continued through the day, but the UPS man still
hadn't arrive with my computer.  So I began to get discouraged and said to
myself, "Fine, I'll pick a final time and after that I give up."  So I did,
4:53.  I was almost asleep on my couch when the phone rang, it was another
friend, we began to talk when I heard my dog barking and looked out the
window.  It was the UPS man.  He had my computer.  Now if I hadn't had to
walk to pick up the phone I wouldn't have been able to catch a look at the
clock.  It was 4:53.  And if I hadn't bothered to look back on my last road I
wouldn't have seen that yellow rider truck.  And if my friend had been able
to drop me off at my house, as usual, I would have missed it all together, or
if I had walked.
    So tell me what does this mean?  Probability?  Was this bound to happen?
I've come to believe some things happen for a reason.  How and why, I can't
explain.  But I've had too many similar things happen to just throw it aside
and blow it off the idea.  Now I recount this story in total honesty.  I know
you have no way of nowing this, but I hope that you can trust my word.  One
time while I was sitting down philosophising on demensions up to the 5th or
so, I sort of ran over an interesting thought/theory.  It sort of would
explain these occurances, not to mention many other similar unexplained
things.  I'm sure you'd probably consider them fairly barbaric, but who knows
maybe not.  If you'd like to hear them I'd be happy to tell them.  And btw, I
think after this post, the subject needs to be changed :) No mention of guns
her.

No, not at all.  We started altering the Earth's nitrogen cycle in a major
way about 1 century ago.  All major food crops have been substantially
altered from their origins, some so completely we're not entirely sure what
the origins are.  When the natural world fails to provide we can and do
change the world.  Rather, it's now the "natural" world which requires
the focused effort of large numbers of humans to maintain it in the face
of all the other people who want to change it.

Yes, nobody denies that. But I got the impression that plasmid
exchanges are fairly common (at least so common that a beneficial gene
such as antibiotics resistance can spread quite quickly through the
population if needed).

Who gauged these "major" changes? When were they measured? Where were the samples
drawn? What methodology was applied? Which controls were established? How did the
researchers document the state of nitrogen in the atmosphere before these
supposed major changes happened, in order to determine the differential in change
rate? In what manner could a rational being find this reseach, in order to study
the thesis?

One would only expect that much efficiency from agricultural science. To mention
a single historical case, the Incas succeeded in harvesting potatoes from scrawny
wild tubers.

> some so completely we're not entirely sure what the origins are.

Chemical analysis can trace the origin and composition of any substance,
including foods. And if we couldn't be entirely sure what the origins were, how
could we possibly relate them to major food crops, which have mostly been with us
for centuries, when not millennia?

What has the natural world failed to provide? What natural event does no longer
take place in the natural world?

> we can and do change the world.

So does every phenomenon over the globe, be it rational, biological, chemical or
physical. Unlike the latter three, however, rational phenomena can be regulated
by individual will in order to control the rate of impact upon its environment.

The "natural" world lacks any will or reason that would enable it to require
anything from human beings. Rather, it is humans (and other organisms) who lay
claims to the surrounding natural world in order to satisfy their natural somatic
drives and natural reasonings.

The "natural" world, of which human beings and their activities are an integral
part, is a dynamic system. Regardless of the presence of human beings, the
natural world undergoes continuous changes by dint of its physical dimensions:
space, time, mass and the resultant vectors. Any focused effort by an entity or
collective to preserve a system's status is an essay in entropy, the outright
anathema of every principle cherished by extropians. Indeed, since reason is a
human phenomenon, and humans are a natural phenomenon, and phenomenons are the
dynamic expression of the natural world, any effort to maintain the natural world
in a static condition would be contradictory to the essence of that ever-changing
natural world.

All the other people who want to change the world are known as living human
beings. They are actually performing what comes natural to them.

Dear Friends,


In general, the article "Amerika, Amerika" by Claire Wolfe,
despite some mistakes of fact, does indeed make me wonder
about the future of legislative procedure in America and
the direction of human rights in an increasingly
electronicized and instantaneous, omnipresent "world
order" system where one's total official "file" can be
available at the push of a button and where the individual
has less and less control over the accuracy of the file and
less and less ability to rectify the errors it may contain.

Futurists have long been telling us that trends in the
control and distribution of information make it a sure bet
that one of the great human rights battles of the next
decades will be over privacy and citizen access to
information stored about themselves and their ability to
correct false information.  I am rather new to this forum,
so my question is, what do extropians see of a hopeful,
positive nature in terms of coping with the privacy issue?

	Sincerely,

	John Dale

Subject: creeping tyranny (or tyrannous creeps)

AMERIKA, AMERIKA

     by Claire Wolfe

Let me run by you a brief list of items that are "the law"
in America today.  As you read, consider what all these have
in common.
...

3. Confiscation of assets from any American who establishes
foreign citizenship. 

[The item about confiscation of resources if you establish
a foreign citizenship must be, in my belief, the author's
misunderstanding. It is not a crime to become a citizen of
another country per se, and such an act does not per se
lead to confiscation of one's US properties. -- JD]

...
     STOPPING RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT

[How do you stop runaway government? My partial answer is: make sure that there are
provisions for direct democracy in every state and at the
federal level. Many states, and the national level in United
States, still lack direct democratic procedures. The powers
of referendum, initiative, and recall are vital, IMO, to be
able to redirect and check runaway governance if
things get to that point. Another way may be to allow the Supreme
Court to issue advisory opinions, in the manner of the
International Court of Justice, regarding the
constitutionality of a law before passage of the law and
before actual damages may start happening to people. The
requirement that there be a claim for actual damages before
the constitutionality of a law can be tested seems to me to
be outdated and harmful. Surely there can be some way of
using an ounce of prevention to bypass a pound of cure.
--JD]

... Face it.  If  "working within the system" could halt
tyranny, the tyrants would outlaw it.  Why do you  think
they encourage you to vote, to write letters, to talk to
them in public forums?  It's to divert your energies.  To
keep you tame.  'The system" as it presently exists is
nothing but a rat maze.  You run around thinking you're
getting somewhere. Your masters occasionally reward you
with a little  pellet that encourages you to believe you're
accomplishing something.  And in the meantime, you are as
much their property and their pawn as if you were a slave. 
In the effort of fighting them on their terms and with
their authorized and approved tools, you have given your
life's energy to them as surely as if you were toiling in
their cotton fields, under the lash of their overseer. The
only way we're going to get off this road to Hell is if we
jump off.  If we, personally, as individuals, refuse to
cooperate with evil.  How we do that is up to each of us. 
I can't decide for you, nor you for me.   

... But this totalitarian runaway  truck [Is Claire Wolfe 
is living in the US or in North Korea? -- JD] is never going to
stop unless we stop it, in any way we can. Stopping it might
include any  number of things: tax resistance; public civil
disobedience; wide-scale, silent non-cooperation; highly
noisy non-cooperation; boycotts; secession efforts; monkey
wrenching; computer hacking; dirty tricks against government
agents; public shunning of employees of abusive government
agencies; alternative, self-sufficient communities that
provide their own medical care and utilities. 

[IMO, all the above types of response accomplish is to
provide fodder and incentive for the system to clamp down
tighter. There's got to be a more synergistic way. JD]

Why did you find it necessary to explicitly narrow the terms of 
debate in a way that had never been done before -- and then choose to 
ask people to justify *previous* statements that are true in the 
former, wider context but not in YOUR narrower context?

How many times have you had these feelings and they've been wrong? I know
in my case the answer is 'lots'. And how do you know that you ever had
those feelings and they aren't just false memories created after the
fact? Did you write anything down at the time?

Personally I think our brains go wrong far, far more often than most of
us realise, and that explains an awful lot of 'psychic' experiences...
and why they can't be reproduced in a laboratory.

Last night on the ABC News they reported three recent wrestling deaths. 
They described all sorts of different methods used by wrestlers to lose
weight, and I also know that wrestlers also take all sorts of
suppliments.  The highpoint (lowpoint?) of the piece was that conclusion
that "the FDA believes that one of the three wrestlers may have used
creatine."

IMHO, I use Creatine myself in my weightlifting - Although Creatine helps 
in muscle recover, it does give one's body a _false_ sense of security. You 
can push your muscles past their normal recovery period, but you can also 
stress them out a lot. Only once, during a set I lost my muscle (i.e. I 
could not lift again). It took awhile before my muscle (back) could lift 
the heavy weights again that I was training with.

It would be like any medicine; If your supplement is used wisely, you get 
what you want. If you mistreat your body because of them, you can get into 
real trouble. I am not enough into sports medicine to think that you my not 
die from misuse of supplements though.

I don't think Jefferson was talking about militaries, and neither
are the people in this thread.  The "armed" in this thread clearly
refers to average citizens.  In that sense, the US citizenry is
far more heavily armed than any other (first-world) country I'm aware
of.  Certainly there are plenty of people in Western Europe and Canada
with guns, but the percentage is far lower than in the US, and the
kinds of guns are generally different, too.  Fully automatic weapons
are almost non-existent in Canada (outside the military), and I suspect
the same is true for most of Western Europe.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)

>[Canada] not to
>mention armed citizens

Hardly anybody in Canada (percentage-wise) owns a gun.  I can only
think of one person, in all the people I know personally (including all
the not-so-close acquantences of my family), who owns a gun --- a
pistol.  I used to have many friends who had guns, but they were all
people who were involved with the Canadian military.  (I used to be in
the the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.  I was on the rifle team.  I was the
top cadet marksman in southern Ontario.  It was fun, and some day I may
buy a rifle, but it's not high on my priority list.  So, you see, I have
nothing personally against guns, I'm just arguing your facts here.)

>not to mention a rather large and

>nothing to do with it, you're only kidding yourself.

Nothing to do with "it"?  What "it" are you refering to?

If you mean that the reason some Canadians have guns is because the
US has lots of guns, I disagree.  Most Canadians will name "guns" as
one of the primary differences between Canadians and Americans.  The
Canadians that *do* own guns would probably do so regardless of the
armed-ness of the US.

So, as I said, since it is clear to me that there exist countries
today that are substantially unarmed and also free and peaceful, it is
unclear that Jefferson's statement will be proved correct in the long
term.

Standard chemistry knowledge.  About 1/3 of the nitrogen fixed to ammonia
compounds (the bioavailable form) is done by chemical plants.  The numbers
should be in any basic agricultural or chemical reference; I got it from a 
recent SciAm article.  There are no controls; it's done to get fertilizer,
not to change the world.  It changes the world as a side effect (just like
nitrogen-fixing bacteria or photosynthetic plants).

Natural food production became inadequate about 10 kya.  So humans started
agriculture.  It appears we've just hit the limits of natural fish production;
expect a lot more fish farming in the near future.

Generally we don't completely stop events; just change their frequency.
There are a few examples; we don't get swarms of malarial mosquitos in
the American South anymore, but those are exceptional.

I'd agree.  That's why I put "natural" in quotes.  Nonetheless, lots of people
are trying; that's why you can't even bring sled dogs into Antarctica anymore.

    Obviously it's natural to have those types of feelings and be wrong.  Of
course it happens more than not.  But when instance after instance occur, I
tend to wonder.  And of course I can't prove to you they are false memories
that happened after fact, I can only tell you honestly, that was my
experience; that's what happened.  I'm not going to forget the events that
happened in an instance like that.  On the contrary I remember them quite
clearly.  No I didn't right anything down at the time, but when I first had
that "vision" of the yellow rider truck, I did mention it to my mother, but
at the time I didn't think it was overly significant, but she still can
recall me mentioning it.  And also right after I put down the phone with my
friend, and then came back, I told him what had happen.  I told several
people directly after the incedent.  And they all can recall what I said.
And as far as brains "going wrong" (whatever you exactly mean by that),
perhaps that will explain some failures in attempt to reproduce in a
laboratory, but what about those psychic experiences in which someone makes
mention of something ahead of time and it happens to come true.  Are all of
our brains "going wrong" coneviently at the same time?

Wei posed the problem of cooling to get rid of excess local heat, by making
contact with distant sources of negentropy (= max sys entropy - actual
entropy)
such as the cosmic background.  For this problem, the conservation of energy
constraint is much less important than the constraint that total entropy
cannot
decrease.  In making my contribution to reversible computing
(http://hanson.berkeley.edu/reverse.html) I learned enough say with great 
confidence that there is no particular advantage to erasing bits at lower
temperatures.  If it were otherwise you could make a perpetual motion machine:
erase bits (= replace unknown bits with known bits) at low temps and then
reverse the operation (replace known bits with unknown bits) at high temps.
By the "costs less energy" intution this cycle would create available energy.

CALL FOR ELECTRONIC ART SUBMISSIONS

Touchware
SIGGRAPH 98 Art Show,  July 1998

Submission Deadline:    January 14, 1998

This exhibit will probe the physical, conceptual, and psychological issues of
touch -- the tactility of the image, the responsiveness of an artwork through
the sense of touch, or the ephemeral sensation of touch and connection through
the Internet, VR or telecommuni-cations.  This exhibition will focus on
rematerializations of digitized experiences.  Artists are challenged to
explore
the tactility of materials in the electronic or printed page, touch-based
responsive processes in the interface, or the extension of physicality to the
ephemeral  emotion of being in-touch via the internet.  This exhibition will
highlight the contemporary aesthetics of the electronic image: as visual
image,
interactive image, animated image, virtual image, Web image.   This exhibition
will include 2D prints, drawings, photographs, mixed media and artists' books,
3D sculpture and kinetics, interactive installations, ARTSITE Web projects,
live telecommunication events, and performances.  A catalog will be published.

Fully automatic weapons have been illegal to the average U.S.

It must be a case of like attitudes, almost every Canadian I know

The "it" I was refering to is that Canada has an easier time than
most countries being "substantially unarmed" and free because it's
next door neighbor is well armed.

I haven't seen any proof of this, but I'm unlikely to convince you.

Take care neighbor..... ;)

A dream: take over all the media and any educational institution and
flood "society" with good information that makes them more critical.
More realistic: talk to as many people as you can. Doing that you can
1) make a few (very few) actually change the way the think
2) get better in achieving 1)
3) make up your own mind about the things you talk about
another possibility is writing articles, books, etc. (or creating
computer games) that contain certain messages. Let the critical
characters win, while the others fail.

I've been thinking about this a lot (unfortunately, I didn't get to read
a lot about it, yet). I believe that there are different "levels" to
reach people:
With some people, you can actually start a "philosophic" discussion.
Unfortunately, some people - even if they understand the concept - won't
change because they think that philosophy has nothing to do with real
life. Others simply aren't interested in that kind of conversation, so
either you tell them stories with a message (I recently found out that
most communication among friends is about their experiences, things that
happened to them recently - simply stress the "extropic aspects" in such
conversation), or you "live as a good example". It makes a great
difference, whether you tell people something, or if people ask you, why
you are successful and happy and such a nice person ;-)

Obviously, with these steps, you only reach a few people - but that's
way better than reaching no one at all. If we are lucky, some people
will have the idea of also spreading "good memes" which may result in a
snowball effect.

> To scare them? To lie to them? To tell them guns have demons in them that
> make you kill people when you're pissed off in traffic?

That's what (so-called) governments have been trying for millenia. It
does work for some people, but I rather live among critical people who
know why they're doing what (fear and misinformation are pretty unstable
reasons).

> Or to tell the whole truth, and get people "evolved" (bad word:

So far, I see the major problem in the addiction of some people to
maintain power, while others prefer being ruled to being
self-responsible. Those "power-addicts" would do anything just to keep
their power (including the use of violence), while some of those who are
ruled maybe develop aggression.

Obviously, those in power ("governments", media, enterprises) usually
won't try to get across messages who may result in self-responsible
people who are critical about everything because that would destroy any
centralized power. The only thing I believe I can do about this is
become rich and powerful myself and "do a part of the job" (and I would
never expect anybody else to do anything about it - if someone does, I'd
appreciate it).

later,
Holger

Not quite, although that was the intent: average persons who wish to
acquire a fully-automatic firearm have to pay a $200 tax for each
firearm, get a local LEO to state in writing that he doesn't mind, go
through full fingerprinting and a serious background check, and
(typically) wait up to six months--sometimes to be told at the end of
that time that the application has been denied.

I guess anyone who can go through that gauntlet may indeed not qualify
for the appellation "average". :}

That's federal; there are different laws in different states. For
example, in California it's virtually impossible to get a legal
full-auto unless you are a special-effects supplier to Hollywood such
as Stembridge.

As an aside, since the US ban on new manufacture, rumor has it that
movie companies sometimes hire machinists to build full-autos for a
scene, shoot the scene and then destroy the weapons, all in flagrant
violation of the law, just because THE WORLD (not just the USA) wants
its shoot-em-up entertainment louder and nastier all the time.
*Sigh*...

Wonder why no one in Hollywood gets prosecuted for that...

I agree with you.  I used creatine for a number of months. During this time,
I put on 8 lbs of body mass and maintained a stomach ache and slight nausea
throughout the supplemental routine. (I don't know whether it was because of
the creatine, or my commitment as an athlete.)  Now, I am not taking
creatine.  My muscle mass has maintained.  I am just as strong and cut as
while taking the creatine, if not stronger.

The media tends to "pump-up" information and inaccurately exploit it without
checking authenticity.

The only way an american citizen can have a fully automatic weapon is to pay a

I guess we have a different definition of "freedom'...I've been to Canada a
few times...Toronto as a matter of fact....It doesn't fit my definition of a
free country..(soooooo many rules and regulations...and TAXES!!!!!!!) .and
neither does Greece or Germany...the only european countries I've visited.
>From what I've heard on this list neither England nor Holland are very free
either...

Does anyone know of a free country?  That is...one where the state does not
steal over half your income...can take your property at will, or tell you how
to use it arbitrarily...and has other powers over what you can and can not do
(censorship, consensual sex, drug use, thinking dirty thoughts on a steamboat
landing...like that)

The first and foremost freedom a person has is the right to defend
himself...today that's a rare commodity...many times you have more to fear
from "authority" than criminals..  Which is my whole point....

The first point has some merit.  Sadly, be warned that the book you cite is
a brainless fabrication, a New Age hoax.  (I gather that the publisher,
following its debunking, now reprints it as a `novel'.)

Isn't that exactly what a heat engine does, when you think of it in
information theoretic terms? Of course it is not a perpetual motion
machine since when it erases bits, it raises the temperature of the low
temp heat sink, and when it randomizes bits, it lowers the temperature of
the high temp heat source, so eventually the temperature difference
disappears. (Of course I'm excluding black holes here, since
when you "heat up" a black hole by dumping energy into it, it actually
gets cooler.)

I don't see how you can say there is no advantage to erasing bits at lower
temperatures, since your free energy is limitied, and at lower
temperatures the same amount of free energy allows you to erase more bits.
The trick is to obtain a low temperature without spending energy on active
cooling, and that's what a black hole allows you to do. Perhaps what
you're saying is that it wouldn't help to cool your computer to 0.1K if
the best heat sink you have access to has a temperature of 3K. I certainly
agree with this. 

I think we're probably not really disagreeing, just emphasizing different
aspects of the same idea.

Here's news for you: they are all unconstitutional. In which case they
should not even be part of the political spectrum. SHows you how people
try to bring a buffet type attitude to the Bill of RIghts, taking only
those that they feel are necessary.

I don't know if we know enough about martial conditions at that time to
develop a good opinion. Of course, I would still think that it is
entirely possible, as the ROman's combat tactics allowed them to
overpower the less well developed people's of Europe, and  technologies
like advanced steel, architecture, etc were state and guild secrets.

Thanks Damien. SOunds like another case of the famous Maya fraud of the
30's, where socialist/communist sympathizing archaeologists from British
and American Ivy League schools developed the preposterous and
completely unsupported, and eventually debunked theories that the Maya
civilization was a socialist paradise of peaceful, communistic, unarmed
innocent heathens.

As it turns out, nothing could have been further from the truth.
Following a successful harvest, the preist/god/king typically had a
ceremony in which he sought the advice of the gods/ancestors, etc. by
piercing his penis with a series of sharpened splinters from different
trees. The pattern of splattered blood that formed supposedly told him
what the gods wanted, or that the hallucinogenic state the preist was in
gave him the illusion he was talking to the gods. In any event, the
message almost invariably was this: GO TO WAR.

Now the current politically correct theory of central american native
history was that the crash of that civilization around 800 AD was the
result of their completely deforesting the Yucatan area. "Let that be a
lesson to you!"

Australian abos I am not as familiar with, but given the
bloodthirstyness of New Guineans, Tahitians, and Hawaiians, I would not
doubt that any "socialist/pacifist paradise" theory of current
Australian intelligentsia is about as accurate as the Maya one.

THere also is not a ban on manufacture of full auto machine guns. A guy
I know is a federal automatic weapons dealer and manufacturer. Like a
carry permit, it requires a full background check, etc. and is a higher
fee, around $600. I've ripped off a few thousand rounds with him a
couple of times. He sells almost exclusively to law enforcement
agencies.

I would not say that Canada, nor Western Europe, are explicitly free,
i.e. that they do not have Bills of Rights written that are part of the
Constitution of the nation. That so much speech, arms bearing, etc is
limited in many of these nations "for the common good" indicates that
the governments of these nations do not beleive that authority is
delegated to governments by the people, or that while they may beleive
this, they are able to use staged or exaggerated events (its not what
happens, but what the news say happens) to aid in propaganda efforts
that convince the people that they need to give up this or that
increment of freedom.

Considering the extremes of repression, holocaust, governmental
instability, and outright warfare throughout history in this region, and
even in this century alone, I think that Western Europe is a completely
pathetic example of unarmed countries where freedom and peaceful
coexistence is concerned.

This is not the happiest turn of phrase, although Michael can't be expected
to know this.  In Oz, it conveys roughly the subtext that US citizens would
get from: `American niggers I am not as familiar with...'

Sorry, I misspoke. There is a fed ban on the books WRT sale/use of new
manufacture by regular folks. The people permitted to trade in post-ban
full-auto weapons are dealers, law enforcement, military and of course 
authorized manufacturers.

The described situation (if it is taking place) of machinists producing
full-autos for use in films is still flagrantly illegal in this light, and
thus a very real potential source for enterprising bad guys--no studio in
its right mind is going to report a theft of such contraband, any more
than people who get ripped off in cocaine transactions tell the cops.

There's an easy fix to this. Use a telescope. What telescopes do is
enlarge the amount of sky seen by the telescope's magnifying power.
Using a very low f ratio means your radiator can see a lot of black hole
in the sky, at a reasonable distance. Just focus the telescope on the
black hole and put the radiator on the focal point.

If anyone doesn't get this, I will go to the trouble of drawing an
diagram in ASCII (not my favorite thing....)

Asexual reproduction is fast, and results in a monoclonal population,
which is very suceptible to pathogens and parasites. It is much harder
for a parasite to invade a genetically varied population.

I get quite a few double postings to this list, and I believe that some
of you have your Reply-To: and To: entries set as in the example below.
This creates two messages for me. Please consider finding ways around
this. My email program (Netscape Communicator) has no problem using the
To: field, so how about deleting the Reply-To: entry??

Thank you

I've recently read, if memory serves, that this happened at least once

quarrels - but there's no hard evidence that US forces ever did it.
For whatever that's worth.

Not all schools are so lenient.  I keep hearing about children being
suspended for possession of an inch-long plastic G.I.Joe weapon, or
for giving one another Midol or aspirin or lemon-drops!

When was the germ theory of disease developed?  When was it widely accepted?

In relation to the above (reputed) incident I mean.

That won't work. A lens (or curved mirror) can only bring light to a focus if 
the wave front is parallel or nearly so, and that can only happen if the lens 
is small and far from the light source. The wave front of the blackbody 
radiation near a heat radiator would be almost spherical and so will not 
focus for the same reason a lage magnifying glass placed right next to a
light bulb will not focus. To work you'd have to place your telescope at a 
large distance from the radiator where the wave front has become almost 
parallel, and then only a very small percentage of the heat radiation would 
intersect with the lens.

Another way to see this is that If it were not true you could make a 
perpetual motion machine, just focus the waste heat from a steam engine 
and run another steam engine with it, then do the same thing with that steam 
engine.

Canada?  Well, I live here in fact.  Last month, a bunch of 13 year old
girls broke another girl's legs with baseball bats (please note:
baseball bats are sporting equipment, not weapons?) then threw her into a
lake to drown in the small, peaceful town of Victoria, British Columbia.
My point?  

a) Anything can be a weapon, you can't get rid of
them, so there's no point in saying "it's too soon to say."

b) Canada is not the peaceful little place you think it is, and the peace
you do see is definitely not the result of a lack of guns.  The only way
you can stop people from hurting each other is if you put everyone in
their own padded cell.  Guns just make the process less painful for the
victim. (would you rather be shot in the head or stabbed to death?)

Conclusion:  There will always be weapons(even if it's just a big rock
off the ground, or your fist), ergo the only way to stay free
is to arm yourself against those who would oppress you.

Can anyone recommend an overview of fast natural processes
(e.g. femtochemistry) - even a random listing of processes
taking less than a microsecond? If there are to be
"fast minds", their cognitions will presumably be constituted
of such processes.

There is also the famous case of Margaret Mead more or less making up a
whole load of shit that influenced (especially leftist) sociology for
years in her book "Coming of Age in Samoa".

She painted a picture of Samoans as Noble Savages, the whole shebang
(especially in regard to sexual freedom); actually, Samoans are if
anything even *more* taboo-ridden than we are.  

Recently, one of her then-adolescent informers (now a grand dame in
Samoan society) owned up to having teased Mead a *lot* in the course of
her researches for the book!

(Sorry I can't remember references, but it's quite a well known case in
sociology.)

The book is by D. Freeman and is titled _Margaret Mead and Somoa:
The Making and Unmaking of an Antropological Myth_ (1983).  The
case if sometimes contrasted with that of Jane Goodall.  Mead went
to Somoa (and elsewhere) and basically saw what she wanted to
see -- noble savages in the tradition of Rousseau.

Goodall, on the contrary, thought initially of chimp societies the same
way -- as nonhuman and, ergo, ideal, placid, etc.  However, unlike
Mead, she eventually saw that her preconceptions did not fit the
data.  Chimps not only had a hierarchical society, they warred, and
were even cannabalistic.

IMHO, Goodall was a scientist and Mead an ideologue.  I'm surprised
it would even arise as a point of controversy on this list.

Who are some of these archaeologists?  From what I understand of Mayan
studies, the field was long dominated by a pair named Sylvanus Morley and
Eric Thompson, both of whom painted the Maya as basically a bunch of High
Church Anglicans, remarkably like the scholars themselves!

Thompson held up the decipherment of the Maya script for *decades* largely
because Yuri Knosorov, the philologist who came up with a fruitful
methodolgy for deciphering, was a Soviet citizen and therefore evil,
foolish, and unscientific.  As more and more Mayanists used Knosorov's
methods and the "semeisiographic wisdom" of the ruins turned out to
describe wars, king lists, and other distinctly non-mystical
preoccupations, the image of Maya civilization as a peaceful, communal
*theocracy* died out.

Sorry, I was not aware of this. If any aborigine or excessively
empatheic people were insulted, my apologies. However, as a Native
American freind of mine once told me,"I don't care what you call me,
just don't call me late for dinner."

Having spent fair amount of time traveling through Canada, and knowing a
few Canadians extremely well, including a few former girlfreinds, I
would say that the main reason Canada is so peaceful is, and you are
going to call me racist or something for this, is because it is,
compared to the US, so ethnically homogenous. Minorities are extreme
minorities in Canada, for the most part, and have been that way for so
long that Canadians have never felt threatened or needed to feel
xenophobic, except possibly toward native Canadians, or between the
French and English speaking populations. This is changing, though, as
evidenced by the increases in the asian and islamic populations and
concurrent rises in crime in the areas where these minorities are
concentrated.

ANother big factor I can't identify in words, but it is definitely
related to the Canadian psyche and is possibly the same reason why
during the American Revolution, the Canadians did not join in the
revolt.

If you want to pick nits, Grafton County here in NH has not seen combat
in the local area since the mid 1700's. We have always been much more
heavily armed than even the average american.

Actually, that last one I heard of was the Cherokee people after they

Yes, school used to be much more peaceful when hunter safety was taught
in the school, the school had a rifle or trap team, and high school
JROTC was a popular extra-cric activity. In those days, kids were taught
through experience and with positive role models that guns required
responsible handling. Blame the NEA.

Or the kid in kendergarten or 1st grade or some such who was suspended
for kissing a girl, ugh. ;)

Sorry to make this a short reply, but do you have any dates on when she
was debunked?? I remember clearly in school that my social studies
teachers taught a  lot based on her work in Samoa,and this was in the
1980-86 period.

I first read "The Postman" back around 1987, and really enjoyed it. It
has themes of both liberal and conservative stripes. THe liberal in that
we should never let hate become a force in our internal politics,
conservative in that if the Federal Government stuck to just delivering
the mail and defending against foreign invaders, I bet a lot more people
would be happier with it.

Mailers are supposed to reply to "From:" unless "Reply-To:" overrides
it.  Many I've seen also have a "group reply" or "replyall" function,
but that sends mail to just about every address listed in the header,
which can snowball.  Being able to easily select only the "To:" address
is not a common ability, I think.  

Setting "Reply-To:" is a service performed by the mailing list software,
not by any poster manually.  It is thus beyond our power to 'delete' it,
and it is highly convenient anyway.  (Except when people try to reply
privately, whoops!)

I think your concept of an ethnically homogenous Canada either comes from
only seeing certain parts of Canada, or from the lack of
African-Canadians.  Most African-Canadians come from the underground
railroad, as Canada was the first colony to abolish slavery; however, many
other ethicities are highly represented.  Where I'm from (Vancouver), the
asian population is massive (there are many reasons for this, including
the exodus from Hong Kong)  At my university, as a person of
Western-European desecent, *I* am a minority.  So, this explanation for
the lack of violence doesn't hold water.  I don't buy the whole slavery
thing as an explanation either-- Roman society was built by enslaving the
population of conquered countries then incorporating those slaves into
society as free citizens... the result was a very stable empire.

I'm very sceptical of that.  There has been an increase in crime in
Vancouver, but it is minimal, and there is a very good explanation for it:
Vietnam has decided that they can't afford to imprison their criminals so
instead they ship them out of the country... guess where they end up?
Here, of course.  Canada needs to do something about its immigration
laws... Vietnamese gangs are beginning to be a bit of a problem.

Yes, I agree fully.  I think the best explanation for the violence of the
US compared to Canada is culture.  Americans began their country by
fighting, Canadians just waited it out until we were *given* independence.
Which was the better strategy?  Who cares, but the point is that this is a
reflection of cultural differences (which I think are slowly blurring)
One important motivator for Canadians to avoid violence is that many
Canadians pride themselves on being as un-American as they can, and most
Canadians see Americans as violent (just look at all the movies that come
out of Hollywood!)  Hopefully, the Canadian tendency towards nonviolent
solutions will rub off on the US, and the US tendency to prize individual
liberty will rub off on Canada, as the walls of nationalism slowly break
down.  I'm not much of a nationalist/patriot.  I'm proud to be a citizen
of the universe... call me a universalist!

That's what I thought you meant, but I wasn't sure.  That's obviously
part of the reason, but you have to admit there's another very obvious
reason: North America is sufficiently isolated (geographically) from
the rest of the world that it's expensive to attack.  That's the same
very simple reason that the continental US hasn't been attacked during
either world war.  The same can be said of Australia.  Simple geography.

As for our big, well-armed brother to the south?  There is a joke in
the Canadian military.  It goes like this: "Do you know why the
Canada-US border is the longest undefended border in the world?
Because they don't have to, and we couldn't possibly."

The facts disagree.  After a little web-surfing, I found the following
article.  It's from an anti-gun advocate organization, so you can argue
that they have an agenda --- of course they have an agenda, but this
little article is "just the facts", and the references they cite look
impeccable.  It's from http://www.gunfree.inter.net/csgv/bsc_int.htm

--- BEGIN quoted web-page ---

   Basic Facts...

   International Comparisons
   ______________________________________________________________________

   The murder rate in the United States surpasses that of every other
   industrialized country in the world. The murder rate in Washington,
   D.C. is fifteen times greater than that in Northern Ireland, a nation
   plagued by terrorism.(9) This level of handgun violence does not occur
   in other developed nations.  In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22
   people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the
   U.S.(10)

   The number of young men killed in the U.S. versus the rest of the
   world also is staggering.

   In 1990, the homicide rate per 100,000 population for males ages 15 -
   24 was as follows:(11)

        Country         Rate
        United States   37.2
        Italy            4.3
        Germany          1.1
        Canada           0.9
        United Kingdom   0.6
        Japan            0.5

--- END quoted web-page ---

My favourite sentence is, "In 1990, handguns were used to murder 22
people in Great Britain, 68 in Canada, 87 in Japan, and 11,719 in the
U.S."  Think about that for a second (just one second should suffice)
and then tell me again how the lack of handguns doesn't affect the
peacefulness of a society.

I just sent out an article quoting numbers of murders by handguns
in various countries.  Just after sending it, I realized that it's
meaningless, because there can still be plenty of murders without
handguns.  Perhaps the total murder rate, all weapons accounted
for, is similar in various countries.

Well, after a bit more web surfing, I came upon a chart showing
murder rate is the US broken down by weapon.  The web page is
http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp
and the chart shows that between 1971 and 1995, the percentage
of murders that occur with firearms fluctates between about 80%
and 95%.  So, my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate
in the US is between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed
nations, and the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.

My conclusion: if a society has easy access firearms, they will be
used to cause many more murders than would occur without the easy
access.

You can try drawing other conclusions, such as "the government will
find it much easier to impose unpopular violations of freedom", and
you may be right.  And that may indeed be a good reason to allow
citizens to be armed.  I DO NOT ARGUE THAT POINT.

However, if you think that there's no price, in the form of blood on
the streets and in homes, for allowing citizens to be armed, you are
misguided, for the facts are clearly against you.  "The price of
freedom is eternal vigilance."  Perhaps to that we should add, "and
some extra blood in the form of societal violence."

Freeman's version is by no means universally accepted by scholars.  In
Australian anthropological circles (his home base), he tends to be
dismissed as a somewhat unstable figure with a bee in his bonnet and a chip
on his shoulder.  I have no special knowledge of my own to add to this.  

As an example of on-going debate, here's an URL

http://www.erlbaum.com/472.htm

for a relevant book:

ADOLESCENT STORM AND STRESS

An Evaluation of the Mead-Freeman Controversy

James E. Cote
University of Western Ontario
A Volume in the Research Monographs in Adolescence Series

The outline strikes me as somewhat mealy-mouthed but indicative, e.g.:

"While much has been written about this controversy during the past decade,
a gap exists in the sense
that most of the publicity about Mead's work has missed her main focus
concerning the processes
governing the "coming of age" of her informants. A valuable historical
document and a pioneering
study, Mead's book anticipated changes that are still unfolding today in
the field of human
development. The preoccupation with issues tangential to her main focus --
issues involving the
Samoan ethos and character -- have not only diverted a clear analysis of
Mead's work, they have
also led to the creation of a number of myths and misconceptions about Mead
and her book. The
author also has an interest in Mead's original focus on the relative impact
of biological and cultural
influences in shaping the behavior of those coming of age -- in all
societies. Despite what has been
said by her critics, not only was this a crucial issue during the time of
her study, but it is also an issue
that is now just beginning to be understood some 60 years later. In
addition, the issue of biology
versus culture -- the so-called nature-nurture debate -- carries with it
many political implications. In
the case of the Mead-Freeman controversy, this political agenda looms large
-- an agenda which is
clearly spelled out in this book."

As usual, dichtomomies are not as cut&dried as they might appear at first...

I am not sure about those numbers. But permit me to suggest that your
phrase "a society" begs several questions. For better or worse, some
would argue that the culture of West J'bipp is substantially different
from the culture of Compton or Miami.

I think the "slack" you mention might be taken up _there_: I'd believe
a 1-to-10 ratio in murder rates between Early, Nebraska and
Washington, DC. Are they one society, just because they both pay taxes
to a government that may have complicity in running crack to the
latter, and not to the former? Anit-racist-tarbrush observation:
Farrakhan (whom I deprecate) and Spike Lee (whom I do not) have asked
the same kind of questions.

Further, America has the highest incarceration rate with the stupidest
parole/mandatory time policies. Try factoring *that* in and you may
see another contributing factor or two emerge.

Absolutely. Bullies and fools don't go away. There is always a price

That's one way of putting it.

Another way of putting it: the US murder rate by KNIFE is higher than 
the English murder rate TOTAL.

Eliminating guns is not likely to change this; for that matter, it 
strongly indicates that guns are simply the first-choice weapon, not 
the only-choice weapon.

And this is known: guns are -- according to the FBI -- the LOGICAL 
first choice, the most effective choice, for crime VICTIMS.  Gun 
defense is more effective than knife defense.  More effective than 
struggle defense.  More effective than run-away defense.  More 
effective than non-resistance.

So if you promote the elimination of guns, you are trying to defend 
criminals from their victims.

If you're referring to either of the two cases I can think of, it 
would be more accurate to say that the kid was suspended because the 
girls cornered him and kissed him.

Wayne,

Please explain to me how you come up with the figures of  80-95% of
homicides thru the use of firearms when the year with the highest figure
(1974) was only 71.3%.

As a resident of the state in question, and as a father of three well
defended children, and husband of an equally straight shooting lady, I
would like to point out to you the steadily declining rate of homicides
since the passage of the concealed carry law here in florida. I believe the
law was enacted in '87 and the drop in firearm homicides began in '89,
which tells me it took the bad guys a couple of years to catch on to the
fact that we were tired of their shit and shooting back. 

There is no doubt that easier access to firearms will lead to a higher rate
of homicide by individuals who believe that force is the way to improve
their own well being. This phenomenon is observable on a global scale, and
is the reason that I believe that all governments must be disarmed at once.

Intransigent by Choice, Free by the Grace of Colt,

Dana Lee Kissick

But you didn't look at the relative murder rates using other weapons.
Suppose we kill with knives 10 times as much as the British do?  Then
Americans would kill each other more often period, regardless of weapon.
Which is what I've often heard.

And could handguns be kept out of the hands of those doing most of the
killing?  We can't keep drugs out of prisons, let along the country.
True, we probably manage to keep guns out of prison.  I doubt that our
criminals could be disarmed, though.

Again, you assume that our extra arms are responsible for our extra
violence.  There are other differences between the US and the other
industrialized nations.  Size, long term racial problems, possibly how
we've treated our cities.  Are you sure they're insignificant?

I've got a problem here...

You see...a friend of mine's dad is dying...of cancer.

I've been in a similar situation...twice...Mother and Mother-in-Law.  They
both died of terminal illnesses.

My problem is this.  In all these cases there came a point where the doctors
"ditched" them...and gave them over to the care of a Hospice.  I have nothing
against hospice (s)...I think they do a fine job...and I support them both
philosophically and $$$$$$.  What I'm having trouble with is the hue and cry
against euthanisa.  If a person is in a hospice...they've already given up on
him getting well...he's terminal and nothing else is being done to make the
situation better....he's "as good as dead" as far as the medical, legal...etc
are concerned.

Some of these illnesses in the final stages are very painful...agonizing in
fact.  So they give the patient morphine...my mother was taking HUGE amounts
in the last days.

My friend's Dad has been "gone" for about a week now...mentally....he's not
conscious.    It's just his body struggling on...and on....and on....

The watching...the waiting... the final days is hard on a family. The
"patient" might not be suffering due to being doped to the eyeballs with
drugs...but the family certainly suffers... I'm finding it hard to equate what
I've witnessed with "dying with dignity".  

It would seem to me that what we are now doing is the "moral equivalent" to
euthanisa as far as the dying person is concerned...yet vastly more harmful to
the survivors....

....any thoughts on this?

EvMick

Thanks for validating "something I'd read somewhere"...I'd also heard
something similar.  However...I've a sister-in-law who is working toward a
Master's in one of those touchy-feely "disiplines"...counceling of some
sort....and she mentioned one day when I stopped by for a visit...that she was
studying the works of Madame Mead in her coursework.  I causually mentioned
that I'd heard that Madame Mead was a fraud....and then ran for my
life...(figuratively...she wouldn't REALLY have used that butcher

And this was 1993-95 sometime.  So I don't think that's it politically correct
for the truth to get out in this case....the proper ideology is Sooooo much
more satisfying.

Which brings me to another point....regarding "Coming of Age in Somoa" by
Mead, "Mutant Message Down Under" by Marlo Morgan, "the book, Ishmael, "...and
other various and sundry....bogus books...perhaps by Penrose...perhaps by
Einestein?

How you gonna tell?

As Will Rogers said (kinda)  "It's not what you don't know that's gonna hurt
you...It's what you DO know that aint so that's gonna hurt you"..

So how to tell which of these books is valid ...they all sit nice and pretty
in the proper places in the bookstore.."Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenaince" sitting right down from Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".
...and just up a little from Gould's books..Drexler's books....and a biography
of Noklai Telsa....theyre not labeled "fraud" or "bogus"...they (some of
them). have nice book reviews in the major media....they're even <apparently>
being taught as "real science" in graduate school....

1. In principle one could obtain subjective computational
speed-up through relativistic motion. Start your computer,
go away and travel in circles at ultrarelativistic speeds,
and return. Thanks to time dilation, more time will have 
elapsed at the computer than onboard your rocket, but you 
will still be able to access the computer's output.

The disadvantage of this scheme (apart from the energy
costs) is that everything else you left behind will have 
aged to the same degree as the computer. So unless you can 
bring everything and everyone you care about on your voyage 
with you, the sacrifice might not seem worth it.

2. Imagine this:

You spawn a closed (S^3, hypersphere) universe, linked by 
wormhole to the parent universe, and construct a computer 
and a rocket there. You start the computer on some long
calculation, and then use the rocket to tow the wormhole
portal across the child universe at relativistic speeds.
As before, elapsed computer-time will exceed elapsed
rocket-time, when the circumnavigation is complete.

If you stayed in the parent universe, your time will
match rocket-time, rather than computer-time. So if
you can spawn a new universe, you can take advantage
of this speed-up without leaving everything behind.

3. This scheme could be applied recursively. Call
the parent universe, Universe 1, and the child,
Universe 2. While the rocket circumnavigates Universe 1,
why not have the computer spawn Universe 3, and build
a computer and a rocket there? And so on.

This would be possible if the time required to spawn
a new universe, and build a computer and a rocket
there, is less than the circumnavigation time, i.e. if

k*t[circum] > t[build] + t[circum] + t[readout]

where

t[circum] = Circumnavigation time
k = "Circumcomputational" speedup obtained
  so computer-time elapsed = k*t[circum]
t[build] = Time to spawn universe, build computer 
  and rocket, start computer and launch rocket
t[rocket] = Time to read out result of computation 
  upon rocket's return

4. Consequences for time-complexity of computational
tasks:

Suppose we have a computation which consists of 
the calculation of a series of functions (or the
execution of a series of programs), each of
which uses the output of the last as its input:

  i. Initial input is x0.
  ii. x1 = f(x0)
  iii. x2 = g(x1)
  iv. x3 = h(x2) - and so on.

We can imagine performing step (ii) in Universe 2,
step (iii) in Universe 3, and so on. But this will
only be possible if the inequality above continues
to hold. This means that the x's cannot become
arbitrarily large, for eventually t[readout] will
become too long and the inequality violated. 
(Of course, the rocket might just go on a second
circumnavigation!)

Equally, t[build] includes the time it takes to
tell the computer in Universe N the input and the 
function for step N. In fact, since the computer in
Universe N has to build and program the computer
in Universe N+1, it needs to know not just the
function to be executed at step N, but the functions
to be executed at all subsequent steps.

This would of course be possible if it's the same
function at every step. 

What if the function at step N is g[N](...),
some member of a family of functions g[i](...),
any of which can be determined given i? (For
example, consider g[i](x) = x^i. If you know
what i is, you know what function g[i](...) is.)
Eventually there would be an N so big that the
mere specification of the value of i would
cause the inequality to be violated (thanks to
the size of t[build]).

Nonetheless, it seems that if we have a function
f whose inputs and outputs are sufficiently small
that they can be read into and read out of 
the computer in the next universe in less than
t[circum], then we can calculate an arbitrary
iteration of f within t[circum].

But wait! If we want to calculate, say, f^1000000,
we need the computer in Universe One Million to know
not to continue the process. So the information
about the total number of steps needs to be passed
down the chain, along with the specification of f
and of the input at step (i). 

However, all that this requires is that the computer
in Universe 1 be told "f, x0, and 1,000,000". It
can tell the computer in Universe 2 "f, f(x0), and 
999,999". And so on. So if it takes less than t[circum]
to carry out the very first step - telling the computer 
in Universe 2, "f, x0, k" - then we can calculate
f^k within t[circum].

(Just to be more precise. The instruction at each step
would have this form: "Here is a function f, and two
numbers, x and k. If k=0, then calculate f(x) and
tell me the answer when the rocket returns. If k>0,
then calculate f(x), spawn a universe, build a
computer and rocket there [etc], and give the computer
the same instruction I am giving you, only with f(x)
substituted for x, and k-1 substituted for k.")

5. In short, then, the simplest form of this scheme
should permit major speedups of certain functions,
namely iterations of functions with bounded input and
output. No doubt 'circumcomputational complexity theory'
could be greatly expanded, by considering more 
elaborate variations on the basic theme (parallelism,
conditional actions).

6. A final comment. This scenario has been described
in terms of baby universes, computers, and rockets.
If we think in terms of the universe and the matter
we are familiar with, it might seem that all this is
relevant only to computations that would take years,
if not millennia, since the rocket will take that
long to circumnavigate a universe with a wormhole in
tow. But I wonder whether, amongst the myriads of 
"vacua" described by string theory, there might be 
much more compact baby universes, in which the 
circumnavigation process could occur on much smaller 
timescales. If we could create these, while retaining
a connection, and control over what happens in them,
we might be able to make "spacetime computers", made
out of wormhole-linked spacetime bubbles, able to
take advantage of circumcomputational acceleration
on timescales we would find useful.

I don't remember the authors, but the one psych course I took included
reading two books regarding the Oedipus Complex in the Samoan Society.
The first, earlier book had claimed that because Samoan society was
matriarchal, in which the father left the family and was not as
important as the Mother's brother to the family, that Samoans did not
have an oedipal complex. The later work debunked the conclusions of the
first, showing that, by its mythic structure, there was an oedipal
complex, that was possibly more severe and violent than that in a
patriarchal society, but tended to be repressed by the individual. THe
title of the second book was "Oedipus in the Trobriands". Apparently the
first book had been widely touted by feminists here in the US as proof
that patriarchal society as we had was bad for child development and
family harmony.

I find it facinating that the predominant discussion centers on statistics 
gathered on geographical units that have no relevance to most of us.  How many 
of you spend most of your time within geography which correlates closely to 
one of the mentioned statistical entities?  The bulk of my time is spent in my 
home, neighborhood and workplace.  My individual actions with respect to 
firearms are governed by the reality within those georgraphic zones.  I saw 
nothing that correlates anywhere closely to those zones in your statistics.  
The murder rate of the United States of America is not relevant to me, even 
though I live within its boundaries.  Neither is the murder rate of the 
metropolitan area within which I live. 

Far more relevant is acquiring knowlege about the reason that individuals are 
killing and when/if it matters.  I personally find even this issue somewhat 
boring because I  possess the intellect and the means to avoid high risk 
scenarios without feeling geographically constrained.  So do most of the 
individuals I know who possess intellects which I value.  

The greatest hinderance to our pursuit of knowlege and implementation of our 
discoveries is not armed thugs but the authorities who restrict our activities 
as a rational for protecting us from such thugs.  I might add that the 
greatest threats to my safety and longevity also come from the "protectors".  
Your statistics only serve as a pseudo rationale for justifying their 
existance.  By using these statistics as a basis for arguing "for" or 
"against" you are only legitimizing centralized decision making.

It is interesting that you said absolutely nothing about the Washington
DC Murder rates. DC does, of course, have the most restrictive gun
control laws in the entire country. It is no wonder it has the highest
murder rate, as the murderers are quite confident that the people they
murder are not armed, are not capable of defending themselves.

Studies of gun crime in the US show that gun crime rates are highest in
areas that have the most restrictive gun control laws.

Additionally, it has also been shown that the murder rate among young
men 15-24 is solely tied into the current, and ebbing, wave of gang
violence, which is stimulated by the gangsta-rap culture they live in.

Now, on the overall murder rates being higher, I won't debate, its
obvious that a free society like ours will tend to grant its citizens
the liberty to be able to commit the sort of crimes involved, while
societies like those in europe, descended from fuedal systems in which
only the aristocracy had a right to bear arms, are obviously not free,
in that the government protects the citizens from themselves.

THis sort of attitude does not fly here in the US, except in liberal
enclaves and inside the beltway. As seen in the Ruby Ridge, Waco,
Oklahoma City, and the recent "Roby Ridge" incidents, Americans do not
put up with their government treating its citizens as the enemy, do not
beleive that the government knows better how citizens should live their
lives. Most of us outside the liberal establishment know that the 2nd
amendment is what guarrantees the continued existence of all of the
others against government encroachment, but that knowledge is
diminishing under continued onslaught from the liberal media elite who
refuse to post ANY peices that may put gun use in a positive light. This
is no joke, a memo from Ted Turner to his staff at CNN explicitly
instructs this.

However, this is not the only reason for the high murder rate. Indeed,
prior to the 60's, the US murder rate was no higher than any other
industrialized nation. Up to this time, the 2nd amendment had been in
existence for over 180 years to no ill effect. Prior to this time, as
well, the inner cities of America were more densely crowded, with much
higher poverty rates, much greater levels of prejudice, racism, and
ethnic strife, and gun posession was as high or higher then than it is
now.

What is it then that HAS changed here in the US???

a) the capital punishment laws were first repealed, and then when
reenacted made it almost impossible to execute even the most heinous
criminals. It turns out that a convicted murderer on death row has a
longer life expectancy than if he or she were loose on the streets. Is
that capital punishment???

b) criminal rights protections in the courts are much more respected
than prior to the 50's. While this may be a good thing for individual
rights as a whole, and respect for the rights of the accused to be
treated as innnocent until proven guilty, it is only in the last few
years that the rights of victims and victims families have begun to bear
any weight in court proceedings.

c) the educational system here in the US has been gutted by a
monopolistic union, where gun and hunter safety courses, rifle teams,
and JROTC activities have been banned from the curriculum, so that
children have had absolutely no chance to learn about responsible gun
use, and our cultural heritage of liberty derived from gun use, from
positive role models, while at the same time, the liberal entertainment
industry delights in supplying the population with 'entertainment' that
celebrates violence, irresponsible gun use, and depicts gun owners
generally as radical wing nuts and threats to public safety.

d) and most importantly, Gun Control Laws have been enacted on a very
wide basis across the country since the 60's (originally in response to
the JFK, RFK, and MLK assasinations), which made previously law abiding
citizens into criminals, stripped citizens of the ability to defend
themselves, while imposing pathetically minimal sentences on criminals
convicted of crimes while using firearms, or while violating firearms
laws (like the law against convicted felons owning guns, duh).

Given all of this, it is rather obvious that the high murder rates here
in the US can be mainly blamed on the failed policies of the liberal
establishment in the last 30 years.

How is this a useful concept? you can't calculate the maximum system entropy  
or even prove it's finite because it depends on unanswered questions in  
cosmology. For example, put 2 atoms in a box, the larger the box the larger 
the entropy of the system, but just how large a box can you make?

There is no energy advantage in erasing bits at any temperature, reversible 
computing is always more efficient, although the advantage is greater when  
things are hot.

I don't understand why a free energy generating system that has access to  
both a hot and cold environment is perpetual motion, it looks like a standard  
heat engine to me.

At the focus of the telescope, with a really low f-ratio, the sky will
be seen to be mostly the black hole. Imagine a an ellipsoid, with the
radiaitor at one focus and the black hole at the other. The radiator
will see the full sky as the black hole. All of the radiation from the
radiator will go to the black hole. If you limit the reflector to the
anterior half, you still have half the sky being the seen as the black
hole, exactly as if you were near the event horizon. It still works if
the radiator is a sphere which is smaller than the closest distance from
the radiator to the mirror. (I agree that if the radiator is as large as
the black hole that not all of the light will be absorbed, but someone
with an optics program can resolve this. It's still a large fraction)

Regarding your light bulb example, imagine the reflector to be a big
umbrella. We don't need to focus to a point, just to the diameter of the
event horizon as seen from a large distance.

I think that those bacteria that do not have antibiotic resistance all die out
and upwards of 90% may die out thus leaving plenty of resources/nutrients for
those few that do have such resistance.  Thus it is still spreading primarily
asexually by "extinction" of those bacteria not as fit for survival.  -Bill.

I'm sure that there are many list members who can identify with your
sentiments , and who, too, have struggled to come to terms with the
seemingly  senseless perpetuation of a "life" that is, for all intents and
purposes, over. Perhaps there is a " light at the end of the tunnel"
however.  In time, once Biostasis becomes more widely developed and
available/recognised etc, the Law  could be changed so as to enable a
person diagnosed  with a fatal illness, but who may, say, have 6 months
to live, to voluntarily undergo biostasis prior to entering into the really
traumatic final stages of the illness, thus saving all involved much agony,
and replacing it with hope instead.

This reminds me of one of my pet ideas: a "retirement community" for 
immortalists on a nice little tropical island with private law. The elderly and
terminally ill could finish their lives there (or get well) in comfort (holiday
resort
style living), among like-minded people and with cryonic suspension teams
standing by. You can use any drugs you want to ease the discomfort of
terminal illness (or just for fun), and you can choose euthanasia if things get
unbearable. There are no legal hassles. Planned death of course also means a
(much) better suspension. Bodies of the deceased can be stored on location,
again preventing legal problems (but you'll have to officially become full citizen
of
this island state first, I suppose, so that some moronic relatives supported by
an even more moronic government can't "claim" your body for "decent burial").
Too bad there is no money for something like this...

P.s: whatever happened to the Oceania Libertarian Island project? Can't get 
any useful (up to date) information from their website, and they don't reply to 
info-requests...

And how real did they get, anyway? I read some info on them a while ago,
but realised that they were trying to raise money after being ripped off by
an architect, which seemed fairly serious. Given that they were trying to
build a floating country, this caused  some concern. They seem to have been
fairly quiet lately, however.

I believe I heard about this in the early 1990s and dismissed it as yet another
quixotic "new country" project.  Such projects have been around for a long
time.  (See Erwin S. Strauss's _How to Start Your Own Country_.)  Usually,
they turn out to be too head-in-the-clouds or just real estate schemes.

This does mean I'm against the idea.  It's a great one, but until someone can
come up with a practical plan, as opposed to a neat idea with some slick
brochures/web pages, I remain skeptical.

....... (thinking, doubting whether I should reply to this)

Last year a close friend of mine also died of cancer, after some test and
surgery he was diagnosed as 'terminal' which basically meant he still could
live 6 - 18 months but that he was beyond curing. In spite of his declining
abilities he spent a few of those months doing some of the stuff he never
had gotten around to and after half a year (when he was really in pain) he
decided enough was enhough.

Because he didn't have much family a bunch of friends (including myself)
spent a long day with him, talking, laughing, crying. In the evening a
doctor came and, after a final series of questions, injected him with a
morphine overdose. We all sat around his bed while he slowly dozed off. He
died without much pain, in the presence of the people he cared about most.
In a terrible situation this was the best (IMHO) of all possible choices.

When death was pronounced the doctor then called the Justice Ministery to
report what had taken place. By standard procedure he was be interviewed by
the DA and the case reported as a 'legal' instance of euthanasia.

I'm really sorry a 'solution' (for lack of a better word in my vocab) like
this isn't possible in the States. There's a lot of pain in your post Ev, I
wish I could offer something besides my warmest sympathies (please convey
those also to your friend and his family if you think this'll help any).

My mother (54) is suffering from Parkinsons disease and after her surgery a
few months ago, which seemed to help a lot, things have now taken a turn
for the worse. Another operation to her brain is hardly possible because it
could result in loss of vision and speech or worse. She's been fighting
this thing for 13 years now and seems really tired sometimes. It scares me
to think what will happen next year if there is no improvement. The only
small comfort is that she wil be able to make her own choice as long as she
is concious.

Warm regards,
Arjen

The problem I see here -- and I'm not about to becom a scholar of the
subject -- is that too many people seem bent on reading into Mead's
(and other's) work(s) to support a political agenda.

Even so, I tend to think that anyone who makes wildly utopian claims
about another society, especially one that only a handful of people
have had contact with, are distorting the truth.  This might be
unintentional, but I'm wary of such claims, for the same reason I'm
wary of spam which claims I can make $1K a day.

If guns somehow cause people to become murderers, what about Switzerland?
What is the Swiss gun homicide rate compared with the US one?

Also, for those making such comparisons, I read a few years ago that Britain's
murder rate by guns (or anything) has always been very low, even before the
current strict gun control regime was in place.  Ergo, this might be a cultural
thing.  In other words, Britains are merely less violent than Americans.

[Please pass this on]

A holiday message from the Libertarian Futurist Society:

Happy holidays, and thanks for reading this message, forwarded to you by Matt
Gaylor. Matt has just joined the Libertarian Futurist Society because he
supports individual freedom, enjoys reading science fiction and fantasy and
wants to live in a free future. If you share Matt's interests and values, you
might want to join us, too!

Founded in 1982, the LFS sponsors the annual Prometheus Award and Prometheus
Hall of Fame, publishes the quarterly "Prometheus," arranges a Prometheus
awards ceremony at the annual Worldcon, debates libertarian futurist issues
(such as private space exploration) and provides fun and fellowship for
libertarian science fiction fans.

Edited by Anders Monsen, the LFS's "Prometheus" newsletter contains more
reviews of freedom-oriented science fiction and fantasy from a libertarian
perspective than you can find anywhere else. Plus, our newsletter includes
regular news updates about libertarian and individualist authors, interesting
columns, reports on Worldcon events and occasional short fiction.

Now is an exciting time to join us because the LFS is reorganizing to upgrade
our programs, provide better services and offer more opportunities to get
involved. For example, effective in 1998, we are recruiting volunteers for
several new projects and committees, such as Worldcon outreach and organizing
LFS parties at other cons.

There's another good reason to join or subscribe now. For the first time in
more than a decade, we are raising membership dues, effective Jan. 1, 1998.
But if you join now, you can take advantage of cheaper rates: $15/yr. for
Basic membership ($20/yr in 1998). Make your checks to LFS and mail them
(postmarked in December for the cheaper rates) to LFS Offer, c/o Victoria
Varga, 89 Gebhardt, Penfield NY 14526.

Basic membership, which includes the newsletter, helps support the Prometheus
awards, which have helped bring recognition to up-and-coming writers at
crucial times in their career, and ensure a continuing libertarian voice and
vision in science fiction.

The LFS made history earlier this year when Victor Koman's "Kings of the High
Frontier" was chosen the 1997 Prometheus Award winner. In a living embodiment
of libertarian futurism, this is the first time that an electronic/Internet
novel has won a major award. Past Prometheus winners include L. Neil Smith
("The Probability Broach," "Pallas"), James Hogan ("Voyage From Yesteryear,"
"The Multiplex Man"), F. Paul Wilson ("Wheels Within Wheels"), Vernor Vinge
("Marooned in Real Time") Victor Koman ("The Jehovah Contract," "Soloman's
Knife"), J. Neil Schulman ("The Rainbow Cadenza"), Michael Flynn ("In the
Country of the Blind"), Brad Linaweaver ("Moon of Ice") and Ken MacLeod ("The
Star Fraction").

As a Basic member, you will have the right to nominate current novels for the
Prometheus Award and older classics for the Hall of Fame. Basic members also
vote for the annual Hall of Fame winner. Past winners include Robert
Heinlein's "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
George Orwell's "1984," Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," Ursula LeGuin's "The
Dispossessed," Poul Anderson's "Trader to the Stars," Alfred Bester's "The
Stars My Destination," Eric Frank Russell's "The Great Explosion," C.M.
Kornbluth's "The Syndic," F. Paul Wilson's "An Enemy of the State" and Robert
Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's hilarious "Illuminatus" trilogy.

If any of these novels happen to be among your personal favorites, you really
should join us or subscribe! If you're not ready to join just yet, you can
find out more about us by subscribing to Prometheus. If you subscribe now,
you pay only $12 for four issues ($15/year in '98.) Overseas (airmail): Add
$5.
    Sample back issues: $3, 2 for $5 or 3/$6.

More information about the LFS, including a complete list of past
award winners, is available at

http://www.libertarian.com/LFS/

but contact Varga directly to join.

With your support, the Libertarian Futurist Society can make further strides
toward a free future and continue to give outstanding writers the recognition
they deserve.

Sincerely,

Michael Grossberg, LFS co-founder (mikegrossb@aol.com)
Victoria Varga, LFS director (vvarga@compuserve.com)
Anders Monsen, Prometheus editor

P.S. If you have read a 1997 novel that may be worthy of the Prometheus
award, we'd like to know about it. Although only LFS members may officially
nominate novels for our awards, we'd be happy to check out your suggestions.
Just email Michael Grossberg (mikegrossb@aol.com), chairman of the Prometheus
Finalists (Judges) Committee, by mid-January. (And keep him posted if you
read worthy 1998 novels.)

Since we seem to be going far afield of Extropianism/transhumanism (how to
achieve, what it would be like, etc.), I think it might be good to start a
debate
with my essay "For a Free Frontier: The Case for Space Colonization."  It's at
_The Free Radical_ web site:

        http://freeradical.co.nz/

Check under backissues.  I offer the essay up for comments both critical and 
laudatory, and expect more of the former and none of the latter.

I also realize some might argue that humans will not colonize space because
the singularity will be upon us before it really gets under way.  So be it,
though the singularity itself is a topic for debate.  Also, if said singularity
occurs after some colonization takes place, it might be less widespread
because of this.  (Another topic to discuss?)

I look forward to your comments.

In my feeling, the right not to live, not to play the game at all, is 
the most fundamental and "sacred" of all rights. I'm not sure it 
makes sense to speak of "objective and inalienable human rights", but 
if  anything is such an absolute right, I feel it would be the right 
to die when one wants to.

Actually, the chart shows the percentage of all murders from firearms
fluctuated between 42.6% and 71.3%.  Where do you see this 80% to 95%
range?

Well, after a bit more web surfing, I came upon a chart showing
murder rate is the US broken down by weapon.  The web page is
http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp
and the chart shows that between 1971 and 1995, the percentage
of murders that occur with firearms fluctates between about 80%
and 95%.  So, my argument is complete: the per-capita murder rate
in the US is between 10 and 50 times higher than in other developed
nations, and the slack can almost entirely be taken up by firearms.

I agree, but it's not just in the political arena that people pick and
choose what they want.  This same attitude occurs with facts from any
subject area.  People beleive the ones that support their beliefs and
disbelieve the ones that conflict with their belief.  Even on a supposedly
enlightened list such as this one, I see no difference in the way people
absorb ideas they wish to be true and reject ideas they hope aren't true.
Virtually everybody joins a "cult", and viretually every "cult" claims that
it is different and more realistic.  People believe what they choose to
believe, and like to claim that facts support their belief.  But somehow,
everybody seems to find a group that is totally objective, that also
believes what they have always believed.  Religious followers find their
religion, Sci-Fi fans find their futurist groups, political types find
their political agenda groups, etc.

Hmm, you're right.  I was looking at the "other" column, which fluctuates
between about 7% an 15%, and subtracting that from 100.  The problem
is that the percentages quoted don't seem to add up to 100.  Something
is not being counted, and I don't know what it is.  But you're right
that if you add up the columns "handguns" and "firearms", the numbers
are closer to 50-70% of murders being committed using guns.

>[stuff about defending himself and his family from criminals]

As I've said, those may be valid reasons for wanting to own a gun.  And,
if I lived in certain parts of the US, I might be more prone to own a gun,
too.  This leads nicely to...

Possibly.  Another possibility:

True.  As a friend of mine puts it, "Canada *exists* primarily for
the purpose of not being the United States."  Before the American
Revolution, Canada was just as much a French colony as a British
one.  Then the "United Empire Loyalists" fled north to Canada during
and after the American Revolution, and from that point on, they (we?)
were the majority, and have loved to define Canada as "not American"
ever since.  One of Canada's most proud differences from the US is
our lower rate of violence.  Many people think this is *because* we
don't have easy access to guns.  I don't think it's that simple, but
it's probably a factor.  I think a larger factor is simply our culture,
which *tries* to be less violent than the US simply because it's one
of the most obvious ways we can differentiate ourselves from the US.
Which leads me to...

It would be nice, but unforunately the exact opposite is happening.
Canada is becoming more violent, while the US is becoming less free.
In Toronto, for example, overall crime rates have dropped slightly
in the past few years, but *violent* crime has gone up.  I'm not
sure why.  Perhaps the violent culture of our Big Brother to the
south is finally rubbing off on us.

I agree wholeheartedly.  Parts of Canada are indeed very homogeneous;
other parts are extremely multicultural.  Like Vancouver, Toronto has
a huge asian population.  Also plenty of Indians (not the North-American
type), Italians, Portugese, Greeks... the list goes on.  One of the
best benefits of this is the diversity of food.  :-)  I love the fact
that, within walking distance of my office, there is genuinely good
food from all over the world.  And like Vancouver, many departments
on the U of Toronto campus have huge numbers of asians; in my own
department (computer science), I believe asians number at least as
many as people of European descent.

"Never ascribe to malice what can adequately explained by ignorance."
I didn't mention them because I didn't have them handy, and I'm not
familiar with them in any case.  I don't claim to be an expert on
gun use in any part of the world.

>Studies of gun crime in the US show that gun crime rates are highest in

Another interesting data point indicating that the US is generally
more violent than other first-world nations, since most other countries
have more restrictive gun control laws than *anywhere* in the US, yet
gun crime rates are *not* higher than in the US.  I'm not flinging
mud here, I'm just emphasizing again that the extra freedoms that
you have come at a cost of a more violent culture.

Huh?  Why are they obviously not free?  And to what extend freedom?  We
are free to travel as we please, within and between countries; we vote
for our leaders, just as you do; we have (as a practical matter)
freedom of speech, religion, association, and the press, just as the US
is supposed to have.  (Of course there are problems, but legally and
in practice we have similar rights.)  I don't know about the European
countries, but Canada has a Charter of Rights and Freedoms as part of
our Constitution (contrary to what somebody said a few days back).
Certainly there are minor differences of degree and kind in the details,
but I would hardly call Canada or any of the western European countries
"obviously not free".

>[obviously not free,]
>in that the government protects the citizens from themselves.

It seems that your definition of "free" lies solely in the right to
bear arms.  I believe this is an extremely narrow view.  Are the
other freedoms I mention above worth nothing?

Don't get me wrong.  I don't believe, a priori, that gun ownership is
bad.  As I've said, I've been on a rifle team where strict safety
procedures were taught.  People on this list (including yourself)
have complained how gun owners are often portrayed as madmen.  Would
you complain if, for example, the *only* law that stood between you
and a gun was a requirement to take a safety course?  Would that
be an opprossive law leading to a state that is "obviously not free"?

[I'm trying to figure out if we're talking at cross-pursposes here,
or if we really do have a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes
"freedom".]

OK Folks, Here are the final numbers:

rabid gun owners: 20
total guns owned: 114
"Would if they could" non-owners, pro gun rights: 8
Non-gun owners, and happy that way: 8

Now, I don't happen to know how many subscribers there are to the list.
If Max or someone could post a total number, I'd appreciate it. All we
are trying to measure is if there is a greater percentage of total
subscribers who are gun owners than the percentage found in the general
population.

Using the stats for the US, in which 60 million of the 250 million
citizens are gun owners (this includes children and little babies, bed
ridden oldsters, and everybody in prison, so there is a sizable
percentage who aren't capable of owning a gun), we would have to have at
the very least 84 subscribers to even seem to disprove the test
statement, and this does leave out anyone so protective of their privacy
on this list that they have not even thought that a private reply to me
was safe.

I would like to thank everybody who took part in this and associated
threads this week. I personally think that the numbers show that
extropian posters, those who are active participants, tend to be pro-gun
to a far greater degree than the population as a whole, so I think that
this might also be included in any description of extropians, as having
this tendency.

I personally view gun ownership as part and parcel with my Libertarian
beleifs/opinions, and not just as a part, but as the guarranteeing right
which creates all other rights for the individual. As previously posted,
I think that history has shown, and this has been confimed by even the
most heinous statists, like Mao, that, in his words,"Justice comes from
the barrel of a gun". With a world where such tyrants still exist,
conspire, plot, oppress, and rule, it is a moral imperative that any
free thinking individual support individual gun ownership, and posess
and be knowledgable in the use of guns and other weaponry. 

Political rights, authoritiy, and power are thought to be derived from
one of two sources: a) as granted by God, which is known as the Natural
Law doctrine, and from which tyrants throughout history have used to
support the "divine right of kings", as well as that supported by the
framers of the American Declaration of Independence and its
COnstitution, and b) from the exercise of force by individuals willing
to fight and die to gain such rights, authority, or power, either for
themselves, or for the group of people they represent. Since
Libertarians around the world tend to also be athiests, especially
non-American Libertarians, I cannot understand any justification for a
libertarian atheist to not support the force doctrine, and givne the
nature of Libertarian philosophy, which holds that all power and rights
derives from the individual, I cannot understand how any Libertarian
atheist can not support the right of the individual to keep and bear
arms. ANything other than this seems extremely hypocritical to me.

Its not that Gates might benefit, but that I and other members of the
gun owning public are penalized. As a non-resident of Washington State,
who travels there frequently, I would be severely limited in my ability
to a)carry for personal protection b)bring and use firearms in sporting
events in that State c) bring and use firearms on hunting trips to that
state. Given that this penalizes me, I could only have retaliated by
refusing to use microsoft products.

FOrtunately, and hopefully, there is a bill pending in congressional
committee which will do for carry permits what the Interstate Motor
Vehicle Compact did for drivers licenses. If it passes, my concealed
weapons permit here in New Hampshire will be applicable in all other
states. In such event, I could then thumb my nose at Bill Gates. I am
surprised, with the large number of his employees that are Libertarians,
that he didn't experience a walkout or something for his support of that
gun registration legislation.

SHow me one western european country, and you can include Canada, where
the national Constitution, if one happens to exist, explicitly
acknowledges that all political power derives from individuals, and is
delegated to the government by the consent of the people. France might
be one, but all of the others have peacefully transformed themselves
from monarchies to constitutional monarchies, to parliamentary
democracies, and in the fine print, you will always find a clause that
states that ultimate political power has been granted by God to the
monarchy, and the monarchy has delegated this to the people. Any nation
that has this Natural Law "divine right of kings" clause is a nation
where the people are NOT free, they are merely being treated "extra
special" by the true power. Canada, which peacefully was granted
independence by the British monarchy, acknowledges that their government
exists by the grace and good will of the British crown.

The British government, as peaceful and democratic as it is, is, after
all, a constitutional monarchy, in which the sovreign power is in the
body of the monarch, not in the people or in the parliament. There is no
freedom of speech or any other officially recognised rights that belong
to or originate from the people. The most that the government has is the
Magna Carta, which is a 'divine right' document, no matter what its
democratic implications. WHile the government does today observe human
rights as a matter of practice, and as required by the UN Charter, there
is no reason or legal requirement for them to do so explicitly.

Non-AMericans just can't seem to understand how importatant this
prinicple is, nor do many americans today. People think that if the
government observes a particular political right of the people as a
matter of form even though it is not legally bound to, that the people
actually, legally, posess this freedom. Not so. And I am not sorry to be
delivering this wakeup call, no matter how much you might deny or resist
its validity.

People react to labels.

Please consider a different label, such as "pro self defense", "pro
peacefully armed" or "anti victim disarmament".

"Pro gun" is exactly what antigun activist like as a label; meanwhile
they're busy as hell trying to keep themselves labeled "anti-violence".

WEAPONRY AS A REPRESENTATION OF ENTROPIC MEMES
by Kathryn Aegis

This essay will explain more fully my thoughts regarding the subject
of weaponry as it relates to transhumanist and Extropian endeavors. 
The depth of my reaction to Anton's posting shows that an exp
lanation of my perspective on this topic is in order.  Anton has
already stated that the tone of his posting was not appropriate for
this list, and I, in turn, say that my outburst did little to
elevate the level of conversation on the topic.  I also mis took my
own frustration at a memetic blockage for anger.  Others mistook
that frustration for blind committment to a cause, but transhumanist
thought has never been a cause, and I don't agree with it being
labeled a movement.  Sometimes a movement provides a convenient
framework within which to form coalitions and find networks to work
to break out of limitations.  But movements also imply ideol ogy, and
ideology imposes its own restrictions. 

In his second posting, Anton listed his carefully-considered reasons
for owning a gun and his contention that those reasons are extropic.
 No one on this list would suggest that ownership of a gun sh ould in
any way be restricted by a government entity or removed from the
rubric of personal choice.  On the other hand, if he states that his
reasons for making this choice are extropic, then by logi cal
extension other members of this list are allowed the floor to state
that they disagree.  The subject of guns has become so politicized
that to state any sort opinion on it often leads to the list eners
[compartmentalizing] the speaker into one of two ideological and
opposed camps--'gun nuts' and 'peace freaks.'  Extropian thought,
however, provides a more neutral framework within which to con sider
the topic.  

My own credentials on the topic are both experiential and
research-based.  About ten years ago, a certain network of domestic
terrorists moved into my city, headquartered themselves here, and
proceed ed to attack women and women's reproductive health clinics. 
They were armed to the gills with money from the religious right and
military equipment from supremecist groups.  A coalition of
activists and community members formed to respond to this wave of
violence.  We all agreed, as did our local and federal law
enforcement, that to respond with armament tactics would only worsen
the situation. My role in this effort was to design tactics and train
volunteers, and I spent hundreds of hours in field work, observation
and discussion with weapons experts, security experts, martial arts
trainers, and even militia.  I left after seven years of this work,
as staying up all hours of the night every week took a toll on my
health, but by then the tide had turned in our favor.  We now share
information and training on the internet as part of a nationwide
network to combat the violence as it spreads to other cities.

The level of respect and patience accorded to me by these people
always amazed me, and their lessons remain with me to this day.  A
core lesson taken was a basic one in the psychology of persons who
engage in the use of weapons, which I have come to think of as a
source of entropy.  In devising counter-tactics, we were encouraged
to utilize the single-track mode of thinking in which a human
engages upon picking up a weapon.  Over and over again, we were told
that our greatest weapon was the ability of the brain to devise
multiple solutions to problems, and that the person holding the gun
ha s probably placed all of their reliance and expectations on the
piece of metal in their hand.  Fast and easy solutions rarely exist
in a violent situation;  often you will have to try several methods
of dealing with it before experiencing success.  

Therefore, to extend that lesson, it is not gun ownership per se
that seems entropic to me, but rather a single-track focus on guns
as a superior means for achieving certain goals, with the swift dis
missal of proposed or proven alternatives.   As we move into a time
in which the exponential elongation of life finally becomes a
possibility, the subject of how we protect it or end it deserves
more serious consideration.  We have over two thousand years of data
as to the effects of the continued usage of overt violence as a
solution to human conflict--do we really want to plan for several
more millenia of the same?

Extropians maintain that one of the primary methods by which humans
will achieve further evolution is the development of increasingly
sophisticated tools.  And humans have devised ever more increasin gly
complex gun weaponry.  But another method by which further evolution
will be achieved is through creative thought and invention--thinking
outside of the box.  On a functional level, a gun can be viewed as a
tool comprised of a hollow tube and a mechanism that shoots
projectiles, much as a fountain pen can be described as a hollow
tube that shoots ink, or a rocket ship as a hollow tube that s hoots
itself through the atmosphere.  Use of these implements can be
considered an engineering problem, with the counter of more
sophisticated tools.

On another level, the use to which these mechanical tools are put
leads to the inanimate tools being imbued with humanist moral
characteristics.  Fountain pens are considered 'good' because of
their beauty and use in literary endeavors.  Rocket ships are 'good'
because they take humans into new realms of exploration.  Guns are
viewed as 'good' or 'bad' depending on whether they are utilized for
defense or attack.  Religious and ethical arguments usually function
at this level, and it is on this level that most discussion is
conducted regarding the use of weapons.

On yet another level, these tools can be viewed in terms of the
paradigms that engendered and continue to support them, as well as
within the context of future trends and developments that render the
m relevant or outmoded.  They become symbols of the prevailing
social system or cultural modalities.  It is on this level that
futurists can most effectively analyze their utility and span of
continu ed relevance.  Once inserted into the context of achievements
like space travel, human rights advances, and eradication of
disease, the paradigms that support the use of weaponry as a
solution to conflict seem increasingly limited and of a milieu that
appeals to the baser human traits.  Our future progress as humans
will most probably originate in visionary thinking coupled with
diligent, unglam orous work.  With a presently limited lifespan and a
limited amount of resources to invest in a future, it seems most
effective to allocate these resources and time to endeavors most
likely to produc e a sustainable human and posthuman future.

The force doctrine doesn't imply that *firearms* are necessary to
preserve freedom. It merely requires that an individual have the right
to keep and bear arms. I agree that this essential point is obvious and
unassailable in light of the Second Amendment. Much of the debate going
on around here concerns whether firearms are a practical means to this
end.
  
Firearms are easy to make, relatively inexpensive, and the most powerful
type of weapon the average person can get. In this regard, they seem to
be the most practical choice for self-preservation. 

However I'm not so sure that the production costs of firearms reflect
the external costs associated with their distribution. Firearms are
practical in large part because they are so inexpensive. But are they
artificially inexpensive? Shouldn't the price of purchasing a firearm
mirror the increased risk to self, and others even if only accidental
harms are involved?

The purpose of a firearm is to throw metal at high speeds, over a
considerable distance, with accuracy. We all know that the intent of
such a stated purpose is to make killing more efficient.   

A tool used for killing is useful only insofar as the probability of
causing death increases with its at-will use in a wide variety of
circumstances. Firearms seem practical for self-preservation in large
part because they are useful by this standard. Consider that a nail-gun
has the same general purpose as a firearm (throwing metal at high
speeds) and would suffice to kill something, but its effectiveness for
killing is limited (a nail-gun has a short range, it is heavy, it
requires a pretty powerful compressor, it is inaccurate, etc.) In short,
it is an impractical killing device.

Now, the point: the purchase price of a nail-gun may not reflect the
external costs of accidental harms, but it also does not reflect the
external benefits that result from its use for the purposes it is
designed for and the purposes it accomplishes most efficiently. A
firearm designed for the express purpose of making killing more
efficient has external benefits only insofar as killing something can be
a benefit (rare and isolated situations which constitute a separate
issue).

However, this analysis neglects to weigh a possible external benefit
involved in throwing metal at high speeds, over considerable distances,
with accuracy. Namely, it is amusing for some people. Does this benefit
(in the aggregate) outweigh or equal the aggregate costs of accidental
death? I would guess that it probably doesn't.   

If this is so, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is
telling us, and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring
your own personal autonomy and freedom.

Possibly, depending on what distinctions are made re: terminology (a fight
I have no interest in entering with you).

This, while it is arguable, is a complete non-sequitur. The "if this is so,
then" part of your sentence suggests a sequitur for which I find no
evidence in any of the rest of your post. Are you, perhaps, throwing sand
in the bull's eyes?

--

I could argue that there is no method available that "-ensures- {emph.
mine] [one's] own personal autonomy and freedom", but I know of an approach
that seems to be recurrently popular the world over and has some success
rate: monopolize power and subjugate everyone else. It worked for Bokassa,
Amin, Dzugashvili, Emperor Ch'an... And _it's_ not a sure thing, and you
have to be a certain type of person.

I don't want this to devolve into a kneejerking match, but let me pose the
same question I asked earlier in a slightly different form: what is the
external cost of that left-for-dead fifteen year old girl?

I specifically included that, and is the main bone of contention between
individualists and statists. I myself would define the body to which
defense may be delegated would be every able bodied adult, which is not
so far off the Title X of the US Code which defines every able bodied
male between the ages of 18 and 40 as members of the militia (keep in
mind this dates back to the early formation of  our government, so of
course women weren't counted at that point). Statists would say whittle
this group down to a single monopolistic small omnipotent paramilitary
force controlling an anarmed populace.

WHile statists would paint Libertarians as advocating every man, woman
and child for themselves, this obviously is not practical (which is the
point of such propaganda, to make the Libertarian viewpoint, as defined
by statist media, seem ridiculous). Anyone who has studied libertarian
thought is familiar with the concept of private, competetive, free
market law enforcement. THose of you who have read Vinge's short story
_The Ungoverned_ are also familiar with this.

At the heart of it, the right of the individual to keep and bear arms is
possibly the most demanding right (which is possibly why it is in such
disrepute with today's lazy bread and circuses populace), in that it
requires the individual to take responsibility for the defense of
themselves, and of their community. Most people in today's world of rush
rush, maximum overtime work, etc, just dont have the time or energy to
exercise this right. It also requires that the individual acknowledge
that they may have to sacrifice their very lives to exercise this right
when it counts the most, while the unarmed individual, in their blissful
denial of responsibility, willingly place themselves at the mercy of
criminals and governments (any terms that connotate both?? There doesn't
seem to be much difference) in a form of Russian Roulette every day, and
look on armed citizens as crazy. Excuse me?

As extropians, we also expect to, in the future, have technologies,
tools, at our common, everyday disposal which will make firearms seem
like childrens toys. Will we one day have lobbying groups called
Deathstar Control, Inc., Coalition to Ban Laser Stations, out to ban the
private posession of planetbusting weapons, even for the peaceful use as
mining equipment or interstellar communications or spacecraft
propulsion? As extropians, we should even now recognise that we accept
the responsibility to exercise our rights as individuals to the fullest
of our abilities, that we deny that common governments have even an
inkling of the ability to better decide for us how to live our lives.
Because of this, we should also accept that it is our responsibility as
extropians, as transhumans, to excercise our rights to master the
responsible use of present day technologies, among which, guns and other
weaponry used for defense of the individual are a part.

Kathryn's idea of "moving beyond the use of force" seems nice, but how
is it practiced when those who are not as advanced as the trans-Kathryn
decide that she is an evil abomination to their religion and should be
wiped out? We seem to be moving into a world where the most rude and
repressive ideologies that still exist, due to the easy communications
and transportation of our era, are able to exert their influence in the
most advanced centers of culture and technology. Every Abdullah,
O'Reilly, and Phan Tri seems to be able to travel the world and attack
anyone who seems to not conform or to oppose their primitive beleifs.
Additionally, as the singularity nears, the disparity between the
technological haves and have nots will only get wider, leading to
greater class resentment and strife, and technological possibilities,
like cloning, genetic manipulation, and mind uploading will been seen by
a large percentage of a still primitive population as perverse, evil,
and "against God's will". 

The singularity will not be a pretty time, my freinds, and those who
wilfully refuse to take action in their own immediate defense will not
make it through that period. WHile Kathryn's work against abortion
clinic bombers is admirable, and I salute her work, what she experienced
fighting those bombers is, IMHO, nothing compared to what is in store
for those who will continue to push the boundaries of technological
possiblities. WHy? because as technology advances, such radicals will
show no compunction against using technology to fight against those of
us trying to advance the human race, much like the Unabomber was not
opposed to building bombs to fight his war against technology. 

As technology advances, so will the weapons of such terrorists. Already,
it is acknowledged in anti-terrorism circles that it is only a matter of
time before some group uses anthrax or some other biological weapon
against a population center. WE have already seen the Sarin bombing of
the Aum Rykyo (sp?) in Tokyo a few years ago. I am pretty convinced that
the only reason Ian Wilmut is opposed to human cloning is merely to hold
off the fundamentalist assasins.

And it is not like governments can go out and magically eliminate
knowledge from the world. I myself know enough to be able to build
several pretty powerful bombs out of household materials that are in my
house right now. I know enough about explosives to be able to even make
a bomb from a persons urine and feces.

How do we progress, then, when it seems like the only 'peaceful'
solution is to reprogram the entire populace's minds? THe solution is to
arm oneself with the ability to present an active defense against those
who would oppose such progress.

Given that the annual number of times firearms are used in self defense
here in the US is anywhere between 600,000 to 2.4 million, depending who
you talk to, this comes out to a rate range of 240 to 1,000 incidents of
successful self defense with a firearm per 100,000 population. Comparing
this to a murder rate of around 10 per 100,000 population, and a
firearms related accident (not necessarily fatal) rate of .06 per
100,000 population, I think it shows pretty clearly that the benefits,
not even counting the recreational benefits, far outweigh the potential
costs.

This could be formulated in a very easy question as an analogy: 

If you could take this magical pill that would increase your chances of
living to 100 years of age by 24 to 100 times, would you take it??? I
sure would.

The most interesting thing in the recent book I read about it was that
it explained her pseudo-science as a response to the pseudo-science
that came before it. 

Her book was seen by herself and her critics as part of the "nature vs.
nurture" debate (in its original form - it was this historical period
which gave the debate its popular name) which was a struggle between the
ridiculous movement of eugenicism, stemming mainly from the work of
Galton, and the anthropological school of thought of people like Franz
Boas (Mead's tutor), who held to the other extreme of environment being
all.

She stated quite clearly that her intention was to give a boost to the
"nurture" side of the controversy, and specifically to her master,
Boas's representation of that side of the debate. And she did - so much
so that the pendulum swung completely the other way, and from the 30s on,
"nurture" was seen as all important, and culture was understood to have
little or no genetic roots at all.  This was a hugely important book.

Curiously, *before* this dumb pseudo-controversy, the general opinion
was pretty much as it is today - both nature and nurture contribute
something to the formation of culture and character.  Somehow the "nature"
side got out of hand, and people one would nowadays loosely call "fascist"
got a hold of the wrong end of the stick (which kind of gives some
support to those who say that even if there's some truth in, say, claims
that black Afro-Americans have a lower IQ than white Americans, you
shouldn't broadcast that truth, because it only encourages wankers to use
those claims to support their crackpot political ideas). 

In it's time, therefore, Mead's book served a useful purpose in
(apparently) offering very strong, almost overwhelmingly convincing
evidence on the other side.

But all the same, when you look beneath the surface, the degree of
wishful thinking and gullibility Mead displayed is quite sad, and there
can be little doubt (in my opinion, based on this book I read) that most
of her Samoan work has to be ditched.

Another point that's of interest here is that Samoan anthropologists
have been pissed off for years about the wacky ideas people have gotten
about Samoan culture from reading Mead.  It is extremely ironic that
leftist intellectuals have in fact "colonised" Samoan culture for their
own, "Western" ends.

Of the four co-founders of the Atlantis project, Leader Eric Klien
is now running colossus.net, an ISP, to earn enough money to pay
off the debts the project incurred building the model and other
expenses.  The model is complete and in his possession.  Mike Oliver
is still doing real estate development, Chuck Geshlider is no longer
easy to find (last we heard he's on some Indian reservaton trying
to teach them what "sovereign" means), and I'm here hanging out
with Extropians.  Eric still plans to do something with the project,
but I don't work with him directly anymore, so I can't say what his
specific plans are.  You can reach him through colossus.net.

WHY  GUNS?

                       -- by L. Neil Smith --

          From the "Webley Page" <http://webley.zq.com/lneil/>

    Over the past 30 years, I've been paid to write almost two
million words, every one of which, sooner or later, came back to the
issue of guns and gun-ownership.  Naturally, I've thought about the
issue a lot, and it has _always_ determined the way I vote.

    People accuse me of being a single-issue writer, a single-issue
thinker, and a single-issue voter, but it isn't true.  What I've
chosen, in a world where there's never enough time and energy, is to
focus on the one political issue which most clearly and unmistakably
demonstrates what any politician -- or political philosophy -- is
made of, right down to the creamy liquid center.

    Make no mistake:  all politicians -- even those ostensibly on
the side of guns and gun ownership -- hate the issue and anyone,
like me, who insists on bringing it up.  They hate it because
because it's an X-ray machine.  It's a Vulcan mind-meld. It's the
ultimate test to which any politician -- or political philosophy --
can be put.

    If a politician isn't perfectly comfortable with the idea of his
average constituent, any man, woman, or responsible child, walking
into a hardware store and paying cash -- for any rifle, shotgun,
handgun, machinegun, _anything_ -- without producing ID or signing
one scrap of paper, he isn't your _friend_ no matter what he tells
you.

    If he isn't genuinely enthusiastic about his average constituent
stuffing that weapon into a purse or pocket or tucking it under a
coat and walking home without asking anybody's permission, he's a
four-flusher, no matter what he claims.

    What his attitude -- toward your ownership and use of weapons --
conveys is his real attitude about _you_.  And if he doesn't trust
you, then why in the name of John Moses Browning should you trust
him?

    If he doesn't want you to have the means of defending your life,
do you want him in a position to control it?

    If he makes excuses about obeying a law he's sworn to uphold and
defend -- the highest law of the land, the Bill of Rights -- do you
want to entrust him with _anything_?

    If he ignores you, sneers at you, complains about you, or
defames you, if he calls you names only he thinks are evil -- like
"Constitutionalist" -- when you insist that he account for himself,
hasn't he betrayed his oath, isn't he unfit to hold office, and
doesn't he really belong in _jail_?

    Sure, these are all leading questions.  They're the questions
that led me to the issue of guns and gun ownership as the clearest
and most unmistakable demonstration of what any given politician --
or political philosophy -- is really made of.

    He may lecture you about the dangerous weirdos out there who
shouldn't have a gun -- but what does that have to do with you? Why
in the name of John Moses Browning should you be made to suffer for
the misdeeds of others?  Didn't you lay aside the infantile notion
of group punishment when you left public school -- or the military?
Isn't it an essentially European notion, anyway -- Prussian, maybe
-- and certainly not what America was supposed to be all about?

    And if there are dangerous weirdos out there, does it make sense
to deprive you of the means of protecting yourself from them?
Forget about those other people, those dangerous weirdos, this is
about _you_, and it has been, all along.

    Try it yourself:  if a politician won't trust you, why should
you trust him?  If he's a man -- and you're not -- what does his
lack of trust tell you about his real attitude toward women?  If
"he" happens to be a _woman_, what makes her so perverse that she's
eager to render her fellow women helpless on the mean and seedy
streets her policies helped create?  Should you believe her when she
says she wants to help you by imposing some infantile group health
care program on you at the point of the kind of gun she doesn't want
you to have?

    On the other hand -- or the other party -- should you believe
anything politicians say who claim they stand for freedom, but drag
their feet and make excuses about repealing limits on your right to
own and carry weapons?  What does this tell you about their real
motives for ignoring voters and ramming through one infantile group
trade agreement after another with other countries?

    Makes voting simpler, doesn't it?  You don't have to study every
issue -- health care, international trade -- all you have to do is
use this X-ray machine, this Vulcan mind-meld, to get beyond their
empty words and find out how politicians really feel.  About you.
And that, of course, is why they hate it.

    And that's why I'm accused of being a single-issue writer,
thinker, and voter.

    But it isn't true, is it?

Many ways some answer than why nobody used Internet in the beginning
of the decade.

1) Nobody uses it

  I looked at Internet growth figures and thought that it's going to

  From http://www.redhat.com/redhat/linuxmarket.html :

  My guess: now 5,000,000 to 15,000,000

  So if it's going to continue with these growth rates, it's going to
  be big.

2) Too hard to use
<<
  Then became www.
>>
  There are projects underway that address it:

  LinuxConf/COAS for easy administration.
  http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/
  http://www.caldera.com/coas/

  Gnome/KDE for ease desktop.
  http://www.gnome.org/
  http://www.kde.org/

  Maybe in a year or two LinuxConf (propably) and Gnome (sure when
  it's ready) are going to be part of Red Hat distribution.

3) There is nothing
<<
  More there are people/companies in the Internet more there is
  content (while S/N is worse)
>>
  More there is users, faster it gets applications and faster it's
  current applications become better.

  And just like Internet most of them are free!

Actually I already have same question than Bob Young has:
How is Microsoft going to compete with Linux?

There are already people that try non FDA approved things.
What is needed is some way to make rigorous unofficial testing ;-)

1) Simulation.

2) There maybe some people in future that are developing and using
test version to themselves despite it being dangerous and very likely
forbidden by authorities.

3) Haven't read it but maybe.

Without the right to bear arms, the rest of the rights are temporary, and
can be withdrawn at any time.  As long as the citizens of a country are
militarily more powerful than the government, that government cannot step
too far out of line.

Such a rule would eventually become oppressive, if only because the
government itself would in time determine the standards for *passing*.
Although such laws are often meant to be protective, they tend to become
a wedge for the introduction of more like them, at least in the US.

If you are free only with another's permission, then you are not free at
all.

If you want to consider the external benefits of firearm-related
defenses, then you must also consider the external costs of
firearm-related offenses. As far as I can tell, firearm production has a
tenuous causal relationship to both.

A few thoughts for your comments.

On the market, different agents bet that their own knowledge of the situation
is better than their competitors'; the resulting price is a weighed average of the
bids.  An efficient/rational system, by definition, is one that uses all its 
knowledge in an optimal way.  In this case, the optimal projection of the price
would probably arise if all traders assembled and put their fragments of
knowledge together (otherwise any dispute could be replaced by gambling).
So the market cannot be rational?  Or maybe it can be fixed by the traders 
betting on some particular aspects of the market - the ones they actually
claim to understand.  For example, instead of having meteorologists and trade
analysts bet against each other based on their partial knowledge of the situation,
meteorologists could put forward statements like "I bet that the floods will not
destroy more than 5% of the crops this year", while the trade analysts will say
something like "I bet that if the floods do not happen at all, the government will
stockpile 10 million tons of the product".  Then, everybody would put their bets
on what they know, without the risk of losing money from the reasons beyond
their competence, and the resulting prediction would not only be more balanced,
but will include a model of the expected market behavior.

I wonder if something like this has been tried or researched.

      Hello!


      From time to time, people over here in England ask me -- with an 
      occasional nuanced edge of annoyance: "If you think Americans are so 
      <expletive deleted> great, why don't you go and live in America?"


      There are several reasons why I don't live in America, in addition 
      to the peculiarly difficult immigration procedures for us Brits;


      America has lost so much that is _irreplaceably_ precious.

      Having to live right alongside this dissonance might prove to be 
      intolerably painful for me.  Having to live with:
      
      [1] The nightmarish and oppressively unjust 'legal' system;
      
      [2] The systemic political corruption -- Democrat and Republican -- 
      with its attendant numbskull politicians subservient to the monied 
      oligarchies and special interests.

      [3] The random and remorselessly escalating official and unofficial 
      violence in society.
      
      [4]  The massive concealed violence against children; look at the 
      'superpredators' and ask: How would you bring a kid up, for him (or 
      her) to behave like this as an adult?"

      [5] The horrifying social insecurity -- most people are one paycheck 
      away from ruin, and there's no 'safety net' either.  The medical 
      system sucks.  This gives far too much bargaining-power into the 
      hands of employers etc.  This may be OK if you're young and fit and 
      into adrenalin highs, but to those of us with a more reflective 
      temperament...

      [6]  The yawning gap between the constant 'official rap' about what 
      the country's supposed to stand for, and the unbearably harsh social 
      reality itself, is a widening chasm, which causes unbearable social 
      dissonances.  Incomes falling every year since 1973, while taxes 
      rise and weekly hours worked rise by 33%.

      That is: America is being steadily remade from 'America the Free' 
      into a Continental-Scale Slave-Labour Maximum Security Prison, with 
      all the mores and practices of a Maximum Security Prison reproduced 
      into the wider society.  

      Claire Wolfe is -- in all the essentials -- right.
       
      As Chris Rea sings:

      "This ain't no Technological Breakdown;

       This is the Road to Hell."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     The future of America matters _intensely_ to me.  I have two 
     relatives buried at Arlington -- Dene Smith, who worked with Oliver 
     Franks (later 'Sir Oliver', and 'C' -- Director of MI6) at the 
     American Interests Section of the Foreign Office; and her husband 
     Hawley Armistead Smith, a senior US Army officer and US Consul in 
     Canada and Italy.

     If a quiet patriotism is the love of the _idea_ of a country, I'm a 
     North American by choice, rather than by accident of birth.

     Here's why:  'Policy Review' republished this next piece in Fall '83. 
     I and my friends are among the all-too-few people around who are 
     crazy enough actually to subscribe to these principles...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[TRACK TEN]  "The Role Of History".

   TEXT: In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine
   advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve 
   o'clock, imagining this staccato message to his partner:-

      "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for..  It's you and our little 
   house and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the fighting 
   chance, to go ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want out here... 
   to win this war... to get home... To go back to living our lives in a 
   land -- and a world -- where *every* man is free to grow as great as 
   he's a mind to be...  where *every* man has an *unlimited* opportunity 
   to be useful to himself and his fellow men ...

     "Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no 
   matter what they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to 
   keep America a land of *individual freedom*!


      _That's_ what we're fighting for... 

      _That's_ what we're willing to die for... 

      _That's_ the America we want when we come home."


      So say Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and I.  Amen.


      We're the sort of people who smash the Bridges at Toko-Ri...

      See the video of James Michener's inspiring story, with William 
      Holden, Mickey Rooney, and Grace Kelly.

      Michael Levin closed off his article on the draft (which quoted the 
      above passage) with these words:

      "We had better figure out what happened if we expect _any_ army,  
      conscript or volunteer,  even to _remember_ what it's fighting for." 


      Too bloody right.  Here's what happened.  All the bloody conformists 
      and 'obedience trainers' and 'discipline' freaks crushed the spirit 
      out of most Americans, didn't they?  So you have a mostly 
      broken-willed conformist population where those who 'fitted in' and 
      did what they were told ended up with the career 'credentials' 
      (paperwork) for positions of social control, and will now put up 
      with damn nearly anything, and will fight for _nothing_ worthwhile.

     As things are in present-day America, a wealthy corporate oligarchy 
     with state surrogates owns and controls _both sides_ of the political 
     process, and the legal system is in the grip of authoritarians and 
     lawyers (often the same people) who are hideously destroying 
     everything the American Dream actually stands for.

     The administration of 'justice' is so oppressive, tyrannical and 
     unsafe that no free person would possibly consent to live within its 
     jurisdiction if they truly understood the risks to their lives, their 
     liberties and their property.  The entire country is being turned 
     into a maximum-security prison; this steadily reproduces the mores 
     and practices of a maximum-security prison in the wider society.


     1.3 million citizens are presently 'internally' imprisoned (and often 
     tortured as well), most for victimless 'crimes.'  Viz:

    Barry Goldwater's chief speechwriter Karl Hess, and murdered actress 
    Jean Seberg ('Lilith', 'St. Joan') -- one of many activists murdered 
    by FBI serial-killer J. Edgar Hoover -- also supported the Black 
    Panthers, by the way.


    So I -- and many North Americans also -- live in a state of _exile_ 
    from a Free North America that does not yet exist.  As Cookie Rankin 
    of the glorious Scottish-Canadian 'Rankin Family' (go get their CD 
    'North Country') said here in Bristol when asked for a song for 'we 
    exiles':


    "We are _all_ exiles.'


    In present-day North America -- again, at this time -- 250 000 
    military veterans are homeless, this bitter winter of '97.  Give them 
    all high-powered firearms, and just watch the political 'priorities' 
    suddenly shift.  There are Fire Control Officers who are _really 
    pkssed off_ about the fate of their comrades -- and their country -- 
    and who are quietly programming in the the GPS coordinates of the 
    authoritarian "Right"'s -- illegal -- propaganda mills and 
    antiConstitutional 'law' factories _right now_.

    I advise every libertarian in North America to get a rifle (semiauto); 
    a shotgun (12ga. pump with 00 buck and rifled slugs) and a handgun 
    (9mm. or up -- Walthers and Browning Hi-Powers are good, compact and 
    reliable). Right now. Take competent range instruction.  Practice 
    regularly. Sharpen up!  Watch the legislators suddenly address your 
    concerns most assiduously!

    <sigh>  OK: Maybe we have to go; but we can take out _all_ the goddamn 
    authoritarians right along with us...  And their fell mouthpieces. 
    There's an exact correlation between intelligence and accuracy with 
    firearms.  And we're _smarter_ than they are.


    In the UK under Thatcher and the Tories, homelessness multiplied 
    ten-fold, while the average age of the homeless at death dropped from 
    47 to 42.  Average life expectancy is 74.  Same thing happened under

TITLE: "SUPERCARRIER"

TEXT: The cover article in March's issue of "Popular Mechanics", an 
excellent American magazine, is titled "War Machine!" and subtitled 
"America's Newest Supercarriers Pack More Firepower than all of World War 
II"  There is an interesting and well-written article, and a colour wall 
poster.

The inset text for the colour poster reads:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
                            << SUPERCARRIER >>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

'First commissioned in 1975, the USS Nimitz (CVAN 68) launched a new class 
of carriers that now numbers five.  The other members of this supercarrier 
family include the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVAN 69), the USS Carl Vinson 
(CVAN 70) the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVAN 71) and the newest member, the 
USS Abraham Lincoln (CVAN 72), commisioned in December, 1989.

Nimitz-class carriers are enormous nuclear-powered self-contained floating 
cities. Supported by a Carrier Battle Group, they can stay at sea 
indefinitely.  And with a full complement of 9 to 10 air squadrons, two 
Sea Sparrow missile launchers, four close-in weapons systems and 5400 men 
and women, they can be deployed tactically and strategically.  Each 
Nimitz-class carrier costs approximately $3 billion, and they'll be our 
number one instrument of Naval striking power well into the next 
century.'

(The averaged age of the crew of a Nimitz-class carrier is 19 yrs, 2 mo.)

Huh? If the aggregate external costs are greater than the aggregate
external benefits, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is
telling us because those costs are not included in the cost of
production. If guns aren't as inexpensive as the market is telling us,
then before we decide if they are practical we best figure out how much
they *do* cost us. I'm using "practical" in one of its common sense
meanings: "efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose."

This stated purpose is securing power and rights (personal autonomy and
freedom) according to the doctrine of force presented in M. Lorry's
post. I don't dispute that they can help, I merely suggest that if you
care about doing this with minimum cost, then you have to also take into
account the externalities.

My initial post flowed out of the assertion that firearms aid in the
exercise of force. Again, I don't dispute this at all. Nor do I dispute
the fact that the exercise of force *enables* one to secure personal
autonomy and freedom. I may have mischaracterized Mike's argument by
using the word "ensures," if so, apologies. My only issue with all of
this is that firearms may not be the most practical means to this end.

It is beyond my ability to assign a monetary value to a human life.

I already did the guns-discussion once on this list so I've stayed out of
it so far. I feel obliged to make a few comments here however, after this
I'll start preparing for my X-mas/newyear trip in the Alps.

I'm certainly no legal expert but my rights of free speech, assembly, a
fair trail, legal representation and so on are guaranteed by the Dutch
constitution.
If a group of politicians or the Monarchy ever tried to seize power they
simply would not get any cooperation from the police or the military
because those are the same citizens that democratically voted a
social-democrat into power. They live in the same neighborhoods as the
people who's rights they would be trampling. Their children go to the same
schools as the children of their new 'political enemies' (everybody else).
The fine-tuned machine of our economy would grind to a halt very quickly.
They are also sworn to defend the principles and rights as stated in the
constitution (and not The Queen or such).

We have a Queen because we like it that way, she's a nice person, wears
funny hats and relieves our governement officals from a lot of ribbon
cutting and such so they can get on with their work. She also attracts a
lot of tourist revenue and has no real political power (and that is the way
it should be).

But aside from legal issues, let's look at the practical implementations.

In the Netherlands:

- I can have a beer or any other drink in any bar from the age of 16.
- I can drive a car from the age of 18.
- I can use almost any drug without fear of gov retaliation of any kind.
- Women can get an abortion if they so wish without having to fear
retaliation from religious right groups
- I can legally take control to end my life if I'm terminally ill.
- I can walk right up to the a MP, Minister or the Premier to ask a question.
- I can own most types of firearms for sporting purposes (no full-auto's).
- I won't have to be afraid of SWAT's BATF's or other dark forces (there
has never been a situation like Waco or Ruby Ridge in this century).

>From what I understand, In the US:

- I can't go to a bar 'till I'm 21.
- I can drive a car from the age of 16.
- I can get arrested for just owning some Pot, Coke or Synthetic drugs.
- I have to fear the FBI, CIA, DAI, NSA, BATF, IRS and a score of other
agency's
- I have a 10 - 30 times greater chance of being killed (depending on how
you interpret the statistics) compare to most European countries.
- I can own most guns in most states (except full-auto's), and carry
concealed (with a license).

So what's this freedom everybody is talking about?
As I have stated before, our little neck of the woods is far from perfect
but even if only half the stories that I read on this list are true it's
the Americans living in a police state, not me.

I just re-read the article 'Amerika, Amerika' that was posted a few days
ago and it makes me sad. If it's true Americans are living in a totally
rotten police state which must be awful. If it's not true the lack of
mutual trust and cohesion in American society is aparently so low that the
term 'society' may not be apliccable any longer. Just some people sharing a
language and a currency, a country going to pieces (that's BAD - remember
Yugoslavia?).

It's a shitty situation any way you look at it.

Instead of worrying about the right to pack a .44 magnum when you're taking
a shower maybe it would be prudent to think about what it is about US
society that makes it neccesary to do so (as opposed to various other
countries). As Kathry stated: The guns should just be a temporary fix
untill we can find some better way of _structurally preventing_ violence.
It seems to have worked here to great extend (guns are a fairly non-issue
in Holland) in spite of our much higher pop.density, cultural and racial
diversity and lower standard of living compared to the US.


And BTW, I used to legally own a rifle (.308), it was for keeping the polar
bears away when traveling in the Arctic. I never needed to fire it at
anything living, most polar bears seem to prefer seals to funny-smelling
tourists ;-). I would still own it if I would have continued those kind of
trips, maybe in a few years...

You have fun with your SKS Anton, I hope you won't ever have to shoot
anything that has a greater than 75% genetic resemblance with yourself.

Wishing everybody a peacefull X-mas and a healty, Extropic newyear!

This depends on what you mean, and where you are. Given that the wars had
to actually -take place- somewhere, there were more than likely areas which
saw frequent combat, being close to a major travel/trade route etc. 
Post-Roman Europe was a pretty nasty place, and aside from icky foreigners
coming in and bashing people up, there were the fuedal lords to reckon with
as well...

	I have paid much attention over the past couple years  to many
debates on the issue of who should own guns and why.  At first, it seemed
like a very important debate to me and I followed the arguments with
interest.  But a simple realization gradually began asserting itself more
and more insistently:  The only reason guns are a problem is because
people kill each other with them.  But the real problem is not that
people are using guns to kill each other but the fact  that they're
killing each other at all.  The really important issue isn't guns; it's
violence itself.  If we could get rid of violence, nearly all of our gun
problems would disappear.  Now when I hear gun control debates, I am
mostly disgusted that so many intelligent people are wasting so many
hours and so much money debating gun  issues, which seem so trivial
compared to the more encompassing and more important issues of violence
itself.  What people ought to be doing is studying violence, working to
understand why people behave violently and how we can prevent young
humans from developing violent behaviors.

	Solving the violence problem is a very extropian goal.  Humans
are simply not as productive in a violent environment as they are in one
where they don't have to worry so much about their personal safety. 
Also, the people engaging in violence could be using their time more
productively than by harming or destroying intelligent systems.  We have
no idea how many societies could have flourished and contributed
immensely to the progress of Civilization but were held back by the
violence of oppressive governments.   How many thousands of years was the
industrial revolution held back because of the oppressive violence of
monarchies and other violently suppressive social systems?   We have no
idea how many geniuses were sent off to war to be killed or how many
geniuses were abused so severely by their schoolmates and parents that
they had no self-confidence to develop their abilities and help pull
Humanity forward immeasurably.  Violence has cost us far more than we
know.

	I think this forum is an excellent one to discuss the violence
problem.   Violent acts have a great potential to disrupt our visions of
the future.  I don't think we can pursue our extropic ideas for long 
without doing much to solve the violence problem.  We need to consider
why humans are violent.  From there, we can discuss ways of  effectively
deterring violent behavior.  I think discussing the violence problem will
be more interesting and more productive than  discussing the issue of who
will be allowed to possess firearms.

What makes you think we don't know enough about the martial condition of

Most of Europe, well at least the bit around the Mediterranean Basin, was
part of the largest empire between the Atlantic and China. It stands to
reason that -within- said empire it would be rather peaceful, doesn't it?

Here's a computer translation (free from Altavista) of the start of my most
recent novel, THE WHITE ABACUS:

Am Tag, den ich, die KI Conclave geboren war, deputierte ich zu einem
huausschu bezglich des allgemeinen Interesses. Meine Sitzung war vier
Stunden lang nach meiner Geburt rtlich festgelegt, also
verbrachte ich dieses mal, das zu den schnsten Pltzen im Solar hexing
ist. Die Frhlingsblte des Tuileries war in ihrem profusion wohlriechend,
das als die murals Monet im Orangerie reizend ist. Es war warmer Morgen,
als ich den groartigen Canyon besuchte, und khler Morgen, whrend ich
bestimmte Minuten spter im Grn stand, Strom-torrent-foaming Valles
Marineris auf Mars und spter noch den vollstndigen Ocker und die
khakifarbige Welt berwachte,  es schien, von den 'ian-ein-Mnnern Piazza
an der Calderaspitze von Olympus Mons, Kilometer ber der betrchtlichen
planetarischen Ausbuchtung von Tharsis Planitia. Von der Sternwartenblase
Pluto
war die Sonne ein poignant Stern, ein kstlicher Kontrast zu seinem
Fireball ber der
Lippe des Kraters hinaus, die ber eisiger polarer Sdstation des
Quecksilbers hoch ist. Ich lingered in der hupoesiekonserve an
Stratford-upon-Avon: wunderlich, meditative, alt ber dem Glauben
hinaus, lang repariert nach seinen Jahrhunderten des industriellen ruination 

and here's what that looks like re-translated back into English by the
devilish machine:

On the day, which I, which was born AI Conclave, deputierte I to one
huausschuss concerning the general interest. My session was four hours long
after my birth locally determined, therefore I spent this times, which is
to the most beautiful workstations in the solar hexing. The spring bloom of
the Tuileries was in their per fusion probably-smelling, which is
attractive as murals the Monet in orangerie. It was warm morning, when I
visited the great Canyon, and coolly morning, while I monitored certain
minutes
later in the country, current torrent foaming Valles Marineris on Mars and
later still the complete ochers and the khakifarbige world, it seemed, by
the T'ian in men Piazza to the Calderaspitze of Olympus Mons, kilometer
over the considerable planetary projection of Tharsis Planitia. From the
observatory    blister Pluto was the sun poignant asterisk, a koestlicher
contrast to its Fireball beyond the lip of the kraters, those over icy
polar Sue 

which has a certain weird AI charm I could never have managed by myself,
although Norman Spinrad got close in a couple of novels.  Maybe this is the
birth of a new sf genre...

Something like this already occurs in the financial markets.
You can buy bonds with the coupon intact, or you can strip the
coupon from the bond and buy just the pieces.  Similarly, there
is a large market in exotic swaps and derivatives, some of which
are customized to match the characteristics that a particular
buyer wishes to address.

You should also realize that sometimes people bet not because
they have "better knowledge" but simply to hedge their positions
from unfavorable circumstances which they cannot predict well.

Hag, old bean:

I feel the need to tear into this a bit more thoroughly, like one of those
magic-store vdieos that take a whole half-hour to show you one trick.
Please don't interpret this as me tearing into you, OK?

When we last saw our intrepid explorers, we heard Hag's rejoinder as
follows...

_That's_ not where I have a problem. Your quote only shows the second thing
I quoted. 

Please consider again what you wrote, with the two pieces glued back together.

>If this is so, then 
>firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is telling us,     <- That's
the first part >
>and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring        <- That's
the second part >
>your own personal autonomy and freedom.

OK, let's play word pseudocode / algebra for a minute.

Assumed: Value = Cost + Benefit      
    (...Cost treated as a negative; non-positive value if magnitude of
benefit not greater than magnitude of cost)
Then Value - Cost = Benefit.

What you said, I read as
   If PropositionP = True, then 

      ( | TrueCostOfF |  > | MarketCostOfF | )

      AND

      ( ValueOfF  .MayNotBeEqTo.  Optimum ).

You see the ringer there now?  Somehow I think a card got stuck to your
hand there, pard'... :)

You never dealt with any reading of Benefit, either True OR Market. And
*then* some OPTIMUM came blackwinging in from hypertheticalspace (your
phrase was "most practical") ...as if such a thing could be determined or
was the measure that was being discussed. AND you never said anything about
the fact that without any other data, if all you've determined is that the
magnitude of your expenses is greater than the total of the checks you
registered in your checkbook, you can't tell if you're broke.

You might as well have said "Since orange juice might be more fairly priced
higher than $1.75 a quart, which is what they charge me down at the store,
orange juice may not be the perfect food."

Huh? yourself. : Until you mentioned it, I don't recall anyone talking
about the "most practical" (the "perfect food").

Seems to me someone with that limitation would have a hard time evaluating
TrueMarketBenefit and TrueMarketCost, no?

:)

I'm left with only one possible explanation for this misunderstanding: Is
it your impression that one side of (or even _any_ of) the participants in
this specific discussion think that "orange juice is the perfect food" (to
use my analogy)? Did they SAY that anywhere, or is someone doing a little
amateur mindreading here?
 
_I_ certainly never said that. Who did? Raise your hands, please... 

:)

The current issue of Skeptic magazine (Vol. 5 No. 3) has an article by 
Derek Freeman about Margaret Mead. It seems she has become a sort of a 
mother-goddess to some anthropologists, many of whom still will not 
admit that the Samoans played a big joke on her. For these people, 
anthropology is a religion, not a science.

 A poor explanation. My impression is that bugs and poor designs are
introduced about as often in freeware as in commercial software, and
that user demands for improvements create similar pressures as those
that competent managers produce at commercial companies.
 And anyone who thinks freeware gets done slower should compare the
speed of bug fixes.

 Eric Raymond has a much better explanation for the success of Linux
style software in his "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" paper at:
http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html
 His main point is that debugging can be effectively parallelized with
much greater brainpower when the source is freely shared.

It is interesting to note that the murder rate in Vermont, which is the 
only state in the country that does not even require a permit to carry a 
concealed gun, was 2.1 per 100,000 in 1992. (Source: Statistical 
Abstract of the U.S., 1994 edition.) The overall Canadian murder rate 
has been around 2-3 per 100,000 in recent years. As a matter of fact, 
most of the states bordering Canada, which tend to have similar ethnic 
composition, have comparable murder rates. 

Murder rates in the U.S. have been dropping in recent years despite an 
increase in the number of guns.  

Those interested in gun control should be interested in a recent CATO 
Institute study. CATO concluded that states which have liberalized their 
concealed carry permit systems to allow all law abiding citizens to 
carry a handguns have experienced drops in their murder rates much 
higher than the national average. 

I would say that politicians who refuse to allow people to arm 
themselves have blood on their hands. Unfortunately, the anti-gun nuts 
don't seem to want to be confused by the facts. I am pro-gun, but I 
would at least admit it if gun control really did work. The other side 
seems to be more of a religion (and a lethal one at that) than a 
rational position.    

This issue is especially important for extropians because I assume that 
it is obviously in our own best interests not to be murdered. Duh!

anyone know of any cool aero math modeling sites? Like, say, a Java

The lower the f-ratio the shallower the depth of focus, that is, the more 
nonlinear it becomes. This fact is of some importance when dealing with real 
light sources that are not mathematical points.
           

        >Imagine a an ellipsoid, with the radiaitor at one focus and the

I haven't worked out the calculation but my intuition tells me that you'd do 
better to forget about the huge ellipsoid and just make your heat radiator 
bigger. It's true that a light beam passing through one focus of an ellipsoid 
will pass through the other focus too, but it's not necessarily true that a 
light beam that passes near one focus will pass near the other one too.
 
It's a little off the subject but this reminds me of something I read a few 
years ago about a man who made elliptical pool tables rather than the more 
traditional rectangular ones. They were not very popular. The trouble was 
that skilled professional players were not much better than rank amateurs at 
the game. Chaos took over and nobody had any idea where the billiard balls 
would end up when a shot was made. Skill plays no part when a elliptical 
table is used, it turns the game into one of chance.

I suspect a circular table would be more playable.

Years ago we tried a superball. (the first superballs were about the
size of pool balls) What a joke...

Ignoring the argument about guns, I find this attitude frightening and
cultish.  Ignore all fact, don't do any research, just make all your
decisions based on a single binary question.  At lease religious
fanatics have to interpret their beliefs.  This sort of commandment
requires no thought at all.

Certainly this is important, but it's not enough.  You can throw as
many people as you want at a project, but if their *hearts* are not in
it, the product will not be as good as software written by people with
their heart in it.  Furthermore, the people that tend to work on
freeware like Linux tend to be "Guru" types --- the kind of people who
are better programmers than average.  Why are they better?  Because
they're the type of people who spend their spare time programming,
because they enjoy it.  Their driving force is coming from an inner
need to produce something beautiful (yes, computer programs can be
beautiful).  In a way, the Linux kernel is a work of art, produced by
some of the best programming artists that Earth has to offer, all in
their spare time, all directly out of their hearts.  When a bug
appears, it gets fixed quickly precisely *because* the artists suddenly
feel a pang of ugliness, and are compelled to fix it in order to
restore beauty.  When you get hundreds of artists together doing this
(here's where Eric's idea of parallelism comes in), you can get
pretty spectacular results.

Compare this to a software company with hundreds of programmers.  There
is *always* "dead wood" in a commercial product of this size.  That is,
people who are there solely because they need the money, not because
they *want* to be there.  These people can be non-productive, or worse,
can hinder the project as they produce code that is incomplete, buggy,
or interacts badly with other sections of the code.  They simply are
not capable of going at it with their entire heart and soul like
freeware programmers do.  The result is shoddy software.

Another point: imagine the things of beauty you would produce if you
only worked on them when you felt like it.  If you get bored, you stop
and do something else.  You *only* work on the project when you feel
like it; when you have a positive mind-set about doing it.  That's what
happens with Linux.  People working on something only when they want
to, as compared to people trudging into work every Monday morning and
starting to work when they really should still be home in bed.

I know it sounds wishy-washy, but "having your heart in it" is
something that is too often neglected today.  Imagine, for example,
what this e-mail list would be like if instead of being *us*, it was a
bunch of people who were *paid* to argue the points we debate here, who
stopped arguing at lunch time and at 5pm, went home and watched TV all
night without ever thinking about the issues again until 9am the next
morning.  Do you think the debate would be as interesting?

I agree completely. As I see it, it can be divided into two main
problems: one is how to decrease the amount of violence in general,
and the other is how less-violent groups should deal with violent
groups.

Violence is an expression of aggression, and deeply ingrained in our
mental structure. This suggests that we cannot easily get rid of it
without some clever re-structuring of out brains (not something we are
likely to be able to do within close future), although it can likely
be controlled by setting up good mental safeguards (which are of
course fallible, given sufficient irritation) during maturation. The
big question is how to do this well (without stopping other,
beneficial behaviors or limiting defense ability), and how to spread
useful controls among people who have dysfunctional controls.

The second problem seems to be a variant of the Prisoners dilemma:
mutual defection is much less valuable than mutual cooperation, but a
defector can exploit cooperators. Axelrod's results suggest that the
non-violent group should adopt a "nice" strategy (no first strike), be
forgiving (do not try to punish competitors too much), provocable
(respond immediately to aggression), avoid envy (focus on increasing
their own absolute fitness rather than their relative fitness compared
to competitors) and be clear (make sure others can interpret their
actions).

On a game theory website I also found the suggestion of attempting to
change the rules so that one avoids getting caught in a prisoners
dilemma. This might occur by becoming immune to attack in some way,
for example by being essential for the defectors or moving out to a
different niche (place); do we have any better meta-strategies?

Well, adopting it certainly requires thought, and given that you can't
know everything that's relevant about each and every politician, you must
limit your fact-finding in *some* way.  And of course you still have to
do enough research to find out what the politicians involved in your
election have voted in the past re victim disarmament, which might be
quite a chore in and of itself.  I notice, btw, that to make your point,
you had to cut the entire argument, and leave only the bare assertion...

So, what is violence, and how can humans decrease the total amount of it
in the world?

Anders suggests that violence comes from our deeply (biologically)
ingrained aggressive drives.  I agree with this.  However, most
aggressive acts are not violent acts.  Aggression has more to do with
being determined to get one's way in the world than with harming or
destroying other sentient systems.  Although, humans who believe that
others must be hurt or killed to get their way will express their
aggression through violence.  Other humans aggressively pursue their
studies, their carreers, their breakthrough inventions, their scientific
discoveries,  their hobbies, their love lives.  

So, as I see it, the problem is not aggression itself, which can be used
for extropic or entropic purposes, depending on the goals and beliefs of
the user of aggression.  The problem is when people believe that harming
or destroying others is an appropriate and effective way of accomplishing
what they want in the world.

Most of our behaviors and beliefs are learned after we are born (although
our fundamental drives, like our sex drives and our nourishment drives
were learned through the long process of genetic evolution).  We all have
conditions that we want in our lives, such as having sufficient food,
being socially accepted, emotionally bonding with others, etc.  These
fundamental desires are part of our evolutionary heritage, selected for
because humans and pre-humans with those fundamental desires tended to
have more success in surviving and reproducing than those who had those
desires to a lesser extent.

We have these fundamental desires and drives from the time we are born,
and as we mature, we experiment with different ways of fulfilling these
desires.  We cry, we get fed, or our diaper gets changed.  We reach out
our hand and pick up the block we wanted, but then drop it because we
didn't grip it hard enough.  We do many things which don't get us what we
want, and some things that do.  And over time, our mind fine-tunes itself
to our environments, and we learn many excellent strategies for getting
what we want from the world.

Now, the problem is that many people learn, mostly through observation of
others, that violence and threats of violence are somewhat effective ways
of getting others to do what they want them to.  This strategy works, to
some extent, so it is reinforced.  It also tends to cause the adrenal
glands to secrete adrenelin, which can be quite pleasant, so the behavior
is reinforced further.  However, the violence strategy is flawed in some
major ways.  The most obvious flaw is that it places the attacker in
significant danger to their own life and well-being, which conflicts with
their own internal drive for safety.  It also tends to encourage others
to avoid them, thus conflicting with their drive for social acceptance. 
The violence strategy also makes it difficult for the user to bond
emotionally with others since they tend to use violence most frequently
against those they live with or are around most often.

There's no denying that violence or the threat of violence can be an
effective strategy for getting what one wants sometimes.  That's the main
reason people use it.  However, in the long-run, whatever benefits were
gained from violence tend to be lost, with quite a bit more lost besides.
 Violence gives many short-term benefits, much like crack cocaine, but
its long-term results can be quite devastating to the user, much like
crack cocaine.

I believe violence is a learned behavior and the idea that violence is a
good solution is a common and powerful meme.  What we need are some very
good counter-memes.  People need to realize that violence is not a good
long-term solution.  And they need to teach their children that, and to
teach them much more effective ways of getting what they want, so that
violence will seem like a ridiculous alternative.

Since so many people are violent, how do the rest of us effectively
protect ourselves from them?  I think that part of the basic training of
humans, along with communication skills, problem solving skills and other
such basic skills should include highly effective self-defence skills and
strategies.  People should be trained to use their bodies effectively in
situations which require close, unarmed combat, and they should be
trained to effectively use weapons of all sorts, especially how to use
ordinary objects as weapons.  With everyone well-trained, violence would
no longer be a good solution, even in the short-term, since there would
be few potential victims, and the risk of trying violence would be very
great, especially since any bystanders would be quite capable of
apprehending you.

A highly trained populace is probably the most effective way of stopping
violence.

So, how do we achieve that?

I'm sorry, I thought you were debating the substance of my post.

What I originally posted was:

> If this is so, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is
> telling us, and they may not be the most practical method of ensuring
> your own personal autonomy and freedom.   

After your accusations of illogic, I explained myself:

> If the aggregate external costs are greater than the aggregate
> external benefits, then firearms are not as inexpensive as the market is
> telling us because those costs are not included in the cost of
> production. If guns aren't as inexpensive as the market is telling us,

This is the extent of my argument, I have gone no further than this. 

Even after this explanation, you are still telling me that I am drawing
a conclusion which does not follow. And you explain why:  

> You never dealt with any reading of Benefit, either True OR Market.

In my original post I wrote:

> A
> firearm designed for the express purpose of making killing more
> efficient has external benefits only insofar as killing something can be
> a benefit (rare and isolated situations which constitute a separate
> issue).

There is no reason for me to discuss benefit at all because I have only
attempted to show that external costs may exist. If external costs
exist, this means that they must enter our calculations. You will recall
that if aggregate benefits do not outweigh the aggregate costs (I don't
say they do or do not) then guns COST MORE THAN WE THINK. If this little
bit of theory becomes fact, and guns cost more than we think, then that
means that thanks to the existence of external costs, guns may actually
be inefficiently accomplishing their stated purpose.

Sure, other data is necessary, but I did say "may."

You continue explaining why I was so illogical:

> And
> *then* some OPTIMUM came blackwinging in from hypertheticalspace (your
> phrase was "most practical") ...as if such a thing could be determined or
> was the measure that was being discussed.

You don't like my superlative? Deepest apologies. But don't tell me that
the practicality of firearms is not "the measure being discussed." In
fact, the *ENTIRE* debate up to this point has been about whether
firearms are more trouble than they are worth. We've discussed whether
crime rates increase, we've traded fancy anecdotes about horrible deaths
by handguns, we've traded fancy anecdotes about self-defenses, we've
given numbers of extropians that have guns (as if this is will prove
guns are more extropian), we've lectured and nitpicked.   

As I said in another post, practicality is "efficiently accomplishing
the stated purpose."  The question this debate has been trying to answer
is whether we should have guns, regulate them, or let them do their
thing without concern. I've attempted to show that they may cost us more
than we think they do. If they cost more than we think they do THEY MAY
ALSO BE INEFFICIENT FOR THEIR STATED PURPOSES. I have chosen, in my
utter disregard for Michael M. Butler's sanity, to use the word
"practical" to convey this concept. 

 
> AND you never said anything about

I sure did. I said "you MAY be broke." This seems to suggest the proper
measure of nomothetic causal uncertainty. Maybe I should have said
"ceteris paribus" but I mistakenly assumed you might fill in the blank.
Profound apologies.

<sigh> You're totally mischaracterizing me.

If orange juice costs us more than than we think, it may not be
practical for us to do drink it, no matter how much we like it.
  
If guns cost us more than we think, it may not be practical for us to
make them, no matter how amusing they are.

> 
> Huh? yourself. : Until you mentioned it, I don't recall anyone talking

Again, I apologize for using a superlative. But we are talking about
practicality, whether you like the word itself or not. Are guns
efficiently accomplishing the stated purpose?

Please point out where in any of my posts I was trying to assign a
dollar value to the two variables you invented above? 

<sigh> For the last time, I'm trying to show that costs may exist that
do not enter the cost of production. I do not care what the dollar value
of these costs are. If they exist, and the age-old economic cost-benefit
balance shows that costs exceed benefits, then guns cost us more than
the market is telling us. If guns cost more than the market is telling
us, then CETERIS PARIBUS they may be inefficient.

Okay, Michael. So now I am not only illogical, I am irrelevant? I have
made a logical argument. And now I must prove that I'm relevant. Fine.

The very beginning of the first post I made on this subject said:

> The force doctrine doesn't imply that *firearms* are necessary to

end.

If the purpose of guns is to protect your freedom and they are
inefficient, why not find something else to protect your freedom that is
more efficient? As Lorrey explained, the right to keep and bear arms is
necessary to protect our freedoms and secure power. Great. Fine.
Wonderful. But where does it say that in order to protect our freedoms
and secure power we must necessarily use guns? Why not something else
that might not have the external costs of firemarms?  
 
I've attempted to show that external costs may exist, with all of the
attendant ramifications for efficiency. If I can show guns are
inefficient economically speaking, then I can argue that the right to
keep and bear arms should probably not include guns. If I can show that
external benefits make guns even more efficient, then I can argue that
more guns should be produced. Either way, every argument for or against
gun control implicates practicality. 

> 
> _I_ certainly never said that. Who did? Raise your hands, please...

I don't have the time to pull out examples of statements you have made
that implicate practicality.

In the interest of clear, concise and straightforward speech...as evidenced by
the gun and other threads...this is put forth for everyone's consideration and
enjoyment....

                 PC Christmas  
<< 
 'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
 Yuletide celebration, and throughout the place of residence, kinetic
 activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,
 including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus (mouse).
 Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood
 burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure
 regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among
 whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.
 
 The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
 accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual
 hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically
 through their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our
 nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the
 hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the
 grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt
 compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose
 of ascertaining the precise source thereof.
 
 Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this
 fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,
 reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,
 might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus
 permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature
 airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the
 genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and
 nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our
 anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may
 possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar
 predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through
 contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her
 respective cognomen - "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. - guiding them
 to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I
 could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven
 pedal extremities.
 
 As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing
 a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost
 celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He
 was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from
 oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls
 thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the
 plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious
 cloth receptacle.
 
 His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his
 submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging
 amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance
 were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the
 former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter
 that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.  His amusing sub- and
 supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their
 ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and
 columnar crystals of frozen water.
 
 Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey
 fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a
 decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was
 high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region
 undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical
 container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund,
 multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly
 frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly
 lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to
 one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.
 
 Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the
 aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned
 articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously
 dorsally transported cloth receptacle.  Upon completion of this task, he
 executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral
 juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a
 gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by
 renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself
 in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of
 air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of
 burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable
 chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard
 his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation
 beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary
 constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a
 salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between
 sunset and dawn."
 
 
 
Merry....er.....Merry whatever

Well, adopting it certainly requires thought, and given that you can't
know everything that's relevant about each and every politician, you must
limit your fact-finding in *some* way.  And of course you still have to
do enough research to find out what the politicians involved in your
election have voted in the past re victim disarmament, which might be
quite a chore in and of itself.  I notice, btw, that to make your point,
you had to cut the entire argument, and leave only the bare assertion...

I think that we have had this discussion before, but once again I 
am compelled to state:  Psychologists, biologists, and social 
scientists are not yet ready to state definitively what 'causes' 
violence, partly because it has origins in a complex of factors:  
brain biology in *some* humans, cultural acceptance, the need to gain 
and maintain power, and inability to control anger.  

Please, could we apply the same academic rigor to this topic that we
apply to others!  I've got three bookshelves on the subject, 
entire libraries exist on it, and none of those scholars is willing 
to make the generalized statements on the topic that are being made 
here.  If we decide ahead of time what 'causes' violence, then we 
automatically shut off possible methods of dealing with it.

Thank you,

The Chairman asserted that *Power* comes from the barrel of a gun.  A

The problem with this cite is its partiality.  As I understand it,
Freeman's standing is hardly secure.  He might well be correct - I have a
lot of sympathy for his analysis - but I'd like to see an array of
commentary from several sides of the controversy, not just Freeman
repeating himself.  Incidentally, the noted Australian playwright David
Williamson recently had some success with THE HERETIC, a stage
dramatisation of the Mead-Freeman scandal (which has Freeman's imprimatur).
 Williamson, formerly a sardonic but engaged chronicler of the left, has
lately been adopting a different position, with plays dealing with
malicious and deceitful claims of sexual harassment by a young female
student against her male university teacher, and the supposed failures of
`multiculturalism' and attacks on the English literature canon by evil
postmodernists.

Putting aside for the moment the realities of the day
(something I am loathe to do, but can be coaxed into
on occasion), and what technological/political solutions
work in the present, it probably does make sense to
think seriously about whether technologies designed to
end life are a necessary part of /any/ extropic future,
or whether they should properly be seen as a stopgap
measure that can be done away with under the proper
conditions in the future.

It is, after all, our goal to encourage development of
life, is it not?  Is it really possible that we might be
able to evolve into beings/societies that don't find
violence as necessary as we do today?  Is evolutionary
progress possible wihtout using death as a method of
selection?

I think this last question is the salient point: if we
don't have death as a means of selection, what will take
its place?  Speed of expansion?  Control of resources?
Is perfect passive security even theoretically possible?

What is a resource?  Ultimately, if mass-energy is finite,
and "life" must be implemented as patterns of mass-energy
that can be destroyed and re-used by other patterns with
volition (whatever that is), how can our patterns prevent
themselves from being destroyed by sufficiently energetic
predators?  Can we prevent the creation of such predators
to begin with?  After all, since our evolution is memetic
now instead of genetic, can't we just produce anti-death
memes exclusively?

I think that last question is a no: I can't imagine that
sufficient diversity for growth is possible without fatal
risk.  Discoveries cannot be planned or controlled: they
are made at random, and risky ones are often made before
the safe ones, and failure to exploit the risky ones will
cause us to fall behind those who do.

Can we manipulate the variables of the evolutionary
equation to maximize growth and minimize death?  Again,
I don't see how.  Maximizing one variable is likely to
strictly determine all the others.  Can we maximize
under the constraint of non-violence?  Would the winner
of such a scenario be the non-violent one or the one who
took more risks?

I don't have any answers here--as fits a subject about
the possibilities of the future instead of the details
of the present--but even the questions make me doubt
whether non-violence is really possible, even in the
future.  I'd like to be proven wrong.

OK, I just spent the past couple hours looking at various constitutions
of the world.  I specifically concentrated on the US and Canadian ones,
although I glanced at the French one, too.  The *fantastic* web page I
found, that seems to include constitutions for all the nations that
have them, is

    http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/law/home.html

Michael Lorrey <retroman@together.net> seems to be correct that the
US and France are the only ones that have explicit references to
phrases like "of the people, by the people, for the people".  (There
may be other countries, but I only looked at those three mentioned
above.)  However...

Michael Lorrey <retroman@together.net> wrote:

Not true.  Although I acknowledge that the *origin* of the US
constitution is based more on individual rights than the Canadian one,
I can find no mention anywhere of those rights being withdraw-able by
the government, or the monarchy, for any reason.  If you take the time
to compare the US Bill of Rights, with the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms, you'll see that they're very similar.  Furthermore, both
of our countries inaugural documents contain references to God-given
rights---Canadian, in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; US, in the
Declaration of Independence.

We certainly acknowledge that our independence was granted by the British,
but we don't *exist* anymore due to that goodwill.  We are independent,
just as you are.  We simply got our independence in different ways.

You're right, or so the Web document claims.  Canada is different.

I agree that rights granted "by the people, for the people" is a better
principle to base a set of rights on than granted "by the king".  But...

>People think that if the

>matter of form even though it is not legally bound to, that the people

I disagree.  Even though the rights were granted under different
conditions, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is just as
much a legally binding document as the American Bill of Rights.
There are plenty of cases where Canadians take the Canadian
government to court for violations of our Constitution, and the
people often win.  I think that's pretty strong evidence that
our Constitution is just as legally binding as yours, even though 
they were originally derived in different ways.

However, I'll restate what I've already stated previously: I agree that
if the people are armed then it's more difficult for the government to
install unpopular violations of freedom.  (And I'll also re-state that
the cost of the right to bear arms seems to be increased violence in
the society, although others have pointed out other possible cultural
causes of the US's tendency towards violence.)

They are not temporary; they are *potentially* temporary.  Serious
violations of them would require the co-operation of the police and
the military.  In Canada, for example, the military is significantly
more independent from the goverment than in the US.  For example, the
Prime Minister of Canada is *not* the Commander-in-Chief of the 
military.  When I was a cadet, I was taught that, with respect to
internal affairs, one of the main directives of the Canadian military
is to defend the constitution, including possible future violations of
it by the government.

>As long as the citizens of a country are

That would be a good point if it were actually true in the US, but it
isn't.  And besides, your Constitutional rights in the US are being
eroded faster than you can keep track of them, despite your citizens
being armed.

>If you are free only with another's permission, then you are not free at
>all.

I should mention here an important point: the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms was produced in 1982, more than a century after our
independence from Britain.  As such, it is a purely *Canadian*
document, written by and for Canadians.  (I suppose it's a bit
embarassing that it took us that long to create one, but that's a
different story.)  Queen Elizabeth did signed it, but then-Prime-
Minister Trudeau made it perfectly clear that it would go into effect
with or without the Queen's signature.  Having her sign it was merely
a polite gesture to the crown, nothing more.

In re Lee Crocker's essay:
OK, I'll bite:  How would the pursuit of standards of cultural 
nonviolence limit growth or evolution?  and, How do you support your 
contention that violence is a necessary prerequisite of evolution?

Please refer to my previously posted essay in answering, 
because it sets forth the exact opposite case:  that choices 
involving violence impose limits on growth and evolution, and 
therefore act as a source of entropy.

It's a good point anyway, even though it isn't true in most places.  Only
a few citizens in the US are armed at anything like the level which would
be required. That's not so much a problem with how few guns the citizens
have, as with how many the government has.  I would like to amend my
earlier statement to point out that I meant 'militarily' to include
*useful* military power.  Strategic nukes don't really count, since they
can't use them against their own citizens.

On Nightline tonight, they were discussing future technology,
including uploading via neuron replacement and evolving AI.
They showed some cool video of what appeared to be evolving
GAs in a "real" 3D environment. This was the first time I'd
seen that, and unfortunately I didn't catch the person's name
who had done it. Basically they started with a simple organism
composed of two cubes, and let it evolve into successively
more complex organisms based on how well they could "swim"
through the simulated environment. The result looked very
similiar to a sperm cell :-) I couldn't help but think about the
possibilities should a 3D Cyberspace ever replace the web-
would it become possible to evolve AIs by letting them grow
and learn within such a system?

In other media, the 6.01 issue of Wired is quite an extropian
cornucopia.

That appears to sum it up. I am of late, thankfully, rarely at such
loggerheads regarding what I think of as simple communication, and I didn't
mean to nitpick or lecture. Perhaps I did anyway. Regarding our present
contretemps: I thought it was worth noting that you seemed to be carrying
some Platonic ideal around and doing a little jackdaw epistemology. I am
not completely without sin on that score myself.

Judging from your reactions, you got your buttons pushed. Sorry, honest.
Humor me, grab a beer and look at this pair of exchanges as if someone else

Facts not in evidence, and all that. If a bunch of people had been saying,

*sigh*

Keith, the level of discussion we have achieved here is far below what I'd
hoped.

Perhaps I am hallucinating. Somebody around here is conflating economics
with externalities, and ethical-social-esthetic costs with dollars and
cents, and pragmatic circumstantial maxima with ideal abstraction "ceteris
paribus" maxima; and I don't think it's me.

When he invoked a benefit not received by the firearm producer. There
are myriad resource costs in producing a firearm. There is one benefit
-- the firearm itself. Any remote benefit not balanced against costs in
the decision to manufacture is external. Self-defense falls into this
category.

I don't know about any formal studies, but in all areas of the 
economy investors and investment managers are trying to get all 
relevant information they can and appropriately use it in their 
forecasts.

So I don't know if (to follow your example) any firm that does a lot 
of investing in crop futures, actually employs meteorologists; but I 
will guarantee that many of them read long-range weather forecasts 
and have a pretty good idea just how accurate such forecasts have 
been in the last few years.

All by impetus of the free market, without any government program to 
"rationalize" anything.

That's exactly the question.  ARE the aggregate external costs 
greater than the aggregate external benefits?

The early evidence says not.

For example, a randomly-selected American is -- even according to the 
most anti-gun of the credible studies -- many times more likely to 
use a gun in a successful defense against a crime, than to be injured 
by a gun.

But this apparently contrafactual hypothesis is the basis for your 
entire argument.

Yes, I was implying that participants in this discussion would choose
efficiency over inefficiency. I was also implying that at any point in
time there is what can be called the most efficient means to an end. I
do not imply that I know what it is. I merely question, by suggesting
the possible external costs of production, whether firearms are the most
efficient means to the end in sight.

One caveat: this "single best way" is necessarily in flux because costs
and benefits change constantly, but this doesn't make the notion of a
most efficient solution untenable, just a bit difficult for slow
computers.

I never implied I was being helpful. ;-)

I'll agree with you there. There is no absolute best under all
circumstances -- only under the circumstances we've frozen in time for
rigorous analysis. Whether we can ever know what it is becomes another
issue.

The value of self-defense, surely, is reflected to some extent

Why single out weapons for scrutiny of these "externalities"?

The problem with this proposal is that it identifies no source of 
funding for the necessary payments.  

Most people who acquire a firearm and get basic training in its use 
and care, slightly DEcrease the risk to themselves, and thus under 
this proposal should be paid.

Some people SUBSTANTIALLY decrease the risk to themselves, and thus 
should be paid a lot.

My counterproposal is that said decrease in risk is payment enough; 
but we certainly shouldn't tax guns or otherwise penalize people for 
being concerned for their safety.

The usual economic use of the term "externality" refers to a cost (or 
benefit)  imposed on someone who is not part of the transaction or 
does not have a choice in the matter.

When chattel slavery was legal, some labor cost was an externality: 
the loss of enjoyment from being required to work 16 hours a day 
would be imposed on the slaves who had no choice, not on the 
slaveowners who make the decision.

Today, if an employer tries to impose the same work regimen, he will 
pay his laborers dearly and still see many of them depart for more 
pleasant positions elsewhere.  Labor is no longer an externality.

In regard to a gun, benefits received by the gun buyers are not 
externalities.  Neither are costs imposed upon criminals who attempt 
to rob gun buyers.  The benefit to PEOPLE IN GENERAL from having 
those criminals removed from circulation, is an externality; and 
almost everyone benefits in this way.  The cost to PEOPLE IN GENERAL 
from gun accidents is an externality; but in most cases this cost is 
born by the gun buyers, *not* by people in general.

The benefit of self-defense accrues to people who willingly take part 
in the gun buying transaction and who willingly pay a price for that 
benefit.  About as far from an externality as any effect can be.

That was likely Karl Sims work. Very impressive! I think more can be

Note the similarities to other dysfunctional but widespread social
strategies (such as inventing excuses for coming late; nobody believes
them, but we still invent them). There are plenty of bad strategies
around, but since they are tenacious and self-reinforcing they are
hard to get rid off. I have a feeling we need to develop cognitive
psychology and memetics more in order to really do something about
this general problem. Violence is more specific (and immediately
dangerous), so it is worth focussing on it.

To make things worse, adrenalin also is a memory enhancer. And let's
not forget the dominance-submission behaviors which we mammals are so
fond of.

Note the self-reinforcing effect here too, since this isolation can be
broken by more violence, or by associating with other violent
individuals in a group situation.

A good idea. I think we should introduce children to the logic of the
prisoners dilemma as early and possible, showing them *why and how*
cooperation in general is better than defection (instead of the
traditional way that just says cooperation is "good" and defection
"evil"). I have no doubt that it is possible to raise kids into
balanced, rational people, but it may be hard to do it in
general. That is what we need memetics for.

In principle I agree with you. I train ninjutsu myself, and have found
that the training has benefits on many levels ranging from fitness to
an improved ability to deal with people and situations I wouldm
formerly have found threatening. If people in general could get the
same benefits, it would be great and likely reduce violence
significantly. Unfortunately it is not easy to implement this, both
practically and given the fact that a significant number of people
tend to be too passive (not to mention effects such as diffusion of
social responsibility).  But I think it is worth looking into.

Given this, what do you think should replace guns? If access to force is
necessary, but guns are not the most appropriate force, what do you think
should replace guns?

I'm not sold on the force issue, myself. I'd rather be a turtle than a
tiger (well, only insofar as this silly force argument defines the issue,
I'd rather be a tree or an elemental or such), but there seems to be quite
a lack of useful armour other than distance compared to the force which can
be mustered. But I don't own guns, live in a country where guns are now
very heavily regulated (and have zero problem with it) and am in no great
fear of ever coming across one in a life-threatening circumstance unless
I travel overseas, really. I don't deny that use of force could be required
in some circumstances, but I'm not sure that firearms are the right force
to use. Should we scale up or scale down? Knives or nukes? 

Dwayne.

I would be more inclined to suggest that it is a mechanism through which
tension, anger or frustration (or other emotions) may be easily released
and coped with. I'm not so sure that aggression contains an element of
intent, which seems to be what you are suggesting.

Aggression may well be frequently used to achieve a desired result, but
often it is just -there-, expressed, and then is gone. Consider someone
muttering expletives under their breath, or an individual stamping their
foot when something doesn't work properly.

I think it is more a matter of how people express their aggression.
Motivations and strategies are another problem, as I'm sure someone calmly
and peacefully trying to achieve world domination would upset some people
just as much as if a psychotic maniac were trying to do this.

And I think that aggression, also, is a product of evolution. But the way
in which it is expressed, and also the motivations people have, are mostly
acquired after birth.

This could be modified with proper victim-targetting strategies.

There are societies which value and accept violence, and a certain level of
violence in certain individuals would result in an increase in their
status.

I'm sure there was a point where any given population lacked highly-trained
individuals, at which point it was a matter of violence and natural
abilities versus much the same.

As far as I am aware class-based structures based on oppression (feudalism
etc) rise up from such a society.

I do agree with you, however, in that if an individual is highly-trained
and capable of self-defense, this individual will suffer less violence and
feel happier and more confident (I'm fairly well-trained, I'm glad I am, I
haven't been injured in an assault in over 12 years). But if -everyone- is
trained, then the training is of less value.

Take a look at Rudy Rucker's novel THE HACKER AND THE ANTS, when CA-bots do
just that (and infest the optical cable network while they're at it).

I concur. I noticed that too. Particularly extropian
is a one page essay near the beginning which quite
matter-of-factly explains, through comparisons with
other stages of life's evolution and the role played
by information "technologies" in evolutionary leaps,
that life on Earth is about to witness another such
evolutionary leap. (There's even a picture of a lemur
operating a computer mouse, connoting the idea of
evolution through information technology.) Also,
there is an article in favor of individuals (as
opposed to governments) having the right to alter
their genetic makeup. I remember the title of this
article, it's "Overcoming Yuk".

It's enough to make you wonder who needs the magazine
"Extropy"...

wanted to be able to cite authors and quote page

To the extent that widespread gun ownership promotes freedom, then there
is a positive externality to gun ownership in the form of maintenance
of a free society.  Someone who does not own a gun obtains an external
benefit from their neighbors who own guns.

To the extent that guns are more efficient at killing than other weapons,
there is a negative externality as well.  Someone who does not own a gun
is potentially at increased risk of being killed when their neighbors
are well armed, should one of them have an accident or become irrational.

Very interesting!  One problem with such simulations though is that
sometimes they are "cooked" so that a particular outcome is more or less
inevitable.  There may be implicit constraints on the types of forms the
genetic algorithm can evolve, and the authors will have been careful to
set things up so that a sperm-like shape would be one of the possible
outcomes.

Could they take that same simulation, make the fluid thinner (like
air) and change the fitness function to evolve something that flies?
That would be a test of whether they had a good general model of evolution
or just a toy.

Theoretically, other "geometries" for cyberspace would not preclude the
evolution of AIs.

I've been reading Dan Simmons' science fiction series Hyperion recently.
(I can't really recommend it overall because much of it is terribly
violent and sad.)  He has an AI society called the TechnoCore which at
first I assumed was an outgrowth of 21st century AIs.  However later
in the series he claims that it actually evolved out of alife parasites
like our computer viruses and worms.

The problem with this idea is that it is hard to see how or why alife
would evolve intelligence.  Current viruses are about as smart as natural
viruses, probably.  And it's not clear how much it would help them to be
more intelligent.  If you added today's AI technology into a virus, like
a fuzzy logic based expert system to choose a strategy for infiltrating
a new computer, it would probably not be successful.  The virus would
become so bulky that it would be hard to remain undetected.

Maybe in the future things will change, computers becoming so big and
sloppy that smarter alife can find a niche.  Then it may be possible to
see a real form of alife evolution where it smartens at least in the
biological sense, where a bacterium can be considered quite "intelligent"
in its adaption to its environment.

Yep, the various things associated with Extropy seem to have
really started percolating into more and more mainstream media
as people become more positive about the future...

Have there been discussions on the list previously regarding
ways to increase the rate of spread of Extropian memes?
It seems like it might eventually get so widespread that it
could turn into a political party.

What about creating an Extropian GIF and everyone putting it
on their websites?

Yes, later on after that they showed how they changed the
constraints to a "land" environment. They dropped the best
swimmer (the sperm) on it and let it start wiggling. After
many generations they had several good "walkers" evolved,
but they mentioned that many of them were quite different
than what they had expected to end up with.

Well, I don't see how a virus could ever do anything unless they
build some sort of genetic algorithm into it that lets it mutate
when it reproduces, or even trade bits with other viruses.

But if you had a nice Cyberspace that actually created a sort
of real world then things would be interesting. You would have
an environment with light, sound, gravity perhaps, and most
of the other things that we have here on Earth, plus live
people (avatars) interacting inside it and tons and tons of
data (the whole web would presumably be incorporated inside,
plus original content developed for Cyberspace). Now imagine
someone releases some software that allows people to use the
spare cycles on their computers to run an organism inside
Cyberspace, and the organism is allowed to mate with other
people's organisms using various genetic algorithms (perhaps
mutate the algorithms too?), and then the best of the offspring
(best for Cyberspace) is kept. So you could have thousands of
these things running around, and with sufficient algorithms
and time then they should become more and more complex.

I haven't really thought much about this, but it just seems
that a good Cyberspace would be a much better environment for
this than trying to do it on the web/inet.

 I couldn't agree more.

I tried for a number of years to interest the NRA/ILA to propose a
simple law based on this fact.

I proposed that the law ban the depiction of guns, or there use, on
TV and in the movies.

Just imagine, no more cop shows, no more bang-bang shoot'em ups.

The average kid would grow up without seeing the hundreds, (or is
it thousands) of murders they now see by age 5.

We ban gun advertising, why not the often illegal portrayal of
there use?

A "virtual" gun law?

For another perspective on this issue, you might read "The History of Samoan Sexual 
Conduct and the Mead-Freeman Controversy" in the "American Anthropologist" (98:555-567).
Interestingly, Freeman's response to the article was not published by the magazine. Not 
a good sign if you think the Mead defenders are interested in real scientific debate and 
not just preaching to the choir.

After reading several utilitarian non-arguments on guns I wish to point out
a few flaws- First the American left has tried to pin violence on firearms.
Their propaganda from HCI and others suggests that if guns were eliminated
we would be safe.  Many of the posts on Extropians center on "guns".  The
facts are that firearm violence accounts for a minor percentage of American
violence.  You are much more likely to be stabbed or clobbered with a bat.


According to the US Department of Justice' Bureau of Justice Statistics...

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/

Most violent victimizations did not involve the use of weapons.  Offenders
were armed in 34% of victimizations of males (2,042,000) and in 24% of
victimizations of females (1,126,100)

Read "Violence-Related Injuries Treated in Hospital Emergency Departments
August 1997, NCJ-156921 Michael R. Rand BJS Statistician"

* People injured in violence were treated for a
variety of injuries:

34% for bruises or similar injuries
31% for cuts, stab wounds, or
internal injuries
17% for fractures, sprains, dislocations, dental
injuries, or other muscular/skeletal injuries
5% for gunshot injuries
5% for rapes/other sexual assaults
4% for concussions or other head
injuries
5% for other injuries.

* About 92% of violence victims treated in ED's were released at
once after treatment; about 7% were hospitalized for further
treatment.

It really is true the adage: "Guns don't kill, people do."

What, because it doesn't allow the voter to be hypnotized by meaningless
BS? It really doesn't matter what issue you think of. Ask them what they
think about pot legalization, or the right to take vitamins, or the
right to expose oneself to all of the nastiest pornography one can find
on the internet. The reason he uses this is because a) since the 2nd
amendment IS a part of the constitution, and a well defined part at
that, if the elected representative has already sworn to defend and
protect the Constitution in his previous inauguration, then he either a)
is lying to you when he/she says they are against guns, or b) made a
fraudulent statement when they swore their oath of office. If he or she
is a newbie, and signs a pledge to oppose the 2nd amendment, then they
could be sued for making a false oath when they are sworn in. This is
actually rather briliant, and I am surprised that this issue has not
been raised in court to fight the election of anti-gun representatives.

And all along we thought you were talking about consumer side
externalities. Please be clear. As for producer side externalities,
beyond tort expenses that are a function of how ridiculously tortious a
given jurisdiction, combined with device safety factors, there would be
little in the way of external costs, unless you want to go into
externalized energy production costs, mining costs, etc. which,  in the
end ARE paid for by somebody, which eventually comes around to effect
the market cost/value of a gun. Given that a gun bearing populace seems
to effect a lower tax rate (comparing the datapoints of Europe, the US
in general, and New Hampshire (the main production point of Sturm, Ruger
& Co., the only significant firearms manufacturer left with production
facilities in the US)), gun production seems to have a synergistic
effect on maintaining low labor and tax costs, a high quality of life
and low cost of living for employees, and given decades of annual
profits and rising stock prices, a positive return on investment.

This is an excellent differentiation. Law abiding gun owners typically
focus on the second while anti-gunners are focused on the first and
narrowmindedly see guns as an easy PR pseudo-solution to what seems to
be an intractable human condition. This difference in goals is probably
why the two groups always seem to be talking past each other.

A couple good reccomendations for producing well adjusted, non-violent
people:
a) require a certificate level license to preproduce
b) make child abuse a corporal crime (not necessarily a death sentence,
but a public whipping or caning would be a good eye for an eye. For
those of you thinking that this may at cross purposes to the goal of
reducing violence, just think about what just the IDEA of publicly
televised canings would do as a deterrent factor. An exection, IMHO is a
poor deterrent, because the offender is not around afterward to live
through the public humiliation.)
c) Outlaw divorce while the children are minors. This would a) ensure
that people thought long and hard about getting married, ensuring that
only those truly commited would do it, and b) eliminate the severe
strife that typically occurs between divorcees, using kids as the pawns,
and c) would eliminate, eventually, families where there is no positive
male role model.

Don't like any of these? Hey, your dealing with human nature here.

The way to avoid being caught in a prisoners dilemma is to avoid being a
prisoner. Live Free or Die, buddy. The best defense is a good offense.

You have yet to get beyond theorizing. How about some actual data to fit
in the nice words? I would say that, considering that no other
technology has shown as high a benefit to risk ratio as guns, which is
proven by the fact that no other technology has been able to replace
guns in the American free market, you are not being comprehensive in
your analysis if you only count murder statistics to compare the US to
non-gun countries.

While the murder rate in the US is the highest in the industrialized
world, nobody has mentioned how the US compares to other indutrialized
nations in other crimes, like robbery, mugging, burglary, rape,
extortion, kidnapping, etc... For example, every American I know who has
traveled to Italy has been robbed at least once, likewise a large
percentage of the Americans I know who have traveled to France (yet
France cries about 'human rights' while it shelters a monster like Ira
Einhorn).

We know from the stats here that privately owned guns have prevented
between 600,000 and 2.4 million crimes annually. Thats not just murders,
but CRIMES. What is the overall crime rate in other countries, and how
does this compare to the US?? Do other countries REPORT crimes with the
same criteria as the US?

In addition to self protection, another benefit is the recreational. I
have found that people who initially purchase one gun for self
protection, practice with it a few times, quickly become hooked on the
enjoyment of the sporting aspects, and frequently expand their
collection beyond that that might be reasonably needed for self defense,
unless they planned on a David Koresh-like showdown with federales. That
60 million Americans own 200 million guns means that those people own an
average of 3.333 guns per capita. Self defense experts will tell you
that there really is no reason to carry anything more than one main gun
and a small backup, at most. This leaves  1.333 guns in the average
American gun owners posession which really has no defensive purpose. If
there was no significant benefit beyond self defense, the law of
diminishing returns would say that the per capita rate should be between
1-2, and not much over 2 at maximum.

I can say that only 2 of the 15 guns I own could be classified as useful
for self defensive purposes. The rest are purely recreational, unless
chaos falls tomorrow. Given the per capita rate, and the law of
diminishing returns, we need to measure the comparative value of the
1.33-1.88 guns owned by the average gun owning American that can be
described as for recreational use. Off the cuff, I'd say that the
recreational value is between 25% and 50% of the total value. Also keep
in mind that recreational weapons tend to be more expensive than purely
self defense weapons. (i.e I can purchase a decent new self defense
pistol for between $75 and $250 while a decent new over and under 12
guage shotgun with a sporting clays barrel, briley chokes, and vents
will cost between $700-1400)

In comparing firearms to other technologies: pepperspray, mace, and
tasers are an extremely limited market. This is partly due to legal
restrictions, but also due to utility. A determined human predator would
not be inhibited significantly by any of these weapons, except if the
taser was used to kill. Such non-lethal means typically merely pisses
the assailant off, makes them angrier and more determined to exact due
punishment upon the victim.

ANother reason why such non-lethal technologies are limited by law and
by appeal, is the bang factor. Because non-lethal technologies are seen
as just that: non-lethal, a person is more likely to use the weapon
under circumstances which would not be life threatening, thus likely to
bring legal charges against the user, and, more than likely, are liable
to be used against the victim by the assailant when its deterrence value
fails to sway the assailant from his goals, and thus increase the
likelyhood of greater harm to the victim. A gun, due to its positive
'bang' factor, i.e. since it makes a big bang, it must be more powerful
and effective, is, in the mind of the assailant, a more fearful weapon
than spray of a taser, and thus has a greater deterrent value. meek
sprays and zapping tasers do not nearly scare the bejezus out of an
assailant as a .357 going off in one's direction.

The only real external costs that exist are a) the possibility that the
assailant's family may bring and win a wrongful death lawsuit against
you or that the police might rule that you were not acting in self
defense(increasing less likely these days), and b) artificial ones
imposed by gun control laws imposed by anti-gun activists.

A great book on externalities in general is Roy Cordato's _Welfare Economics
and Externalities in an Open Ended Universe_ (1992).  Cordato uses Austrian
economic insights to forge a non-neoclassical view of market efficiency -- one
based on disequilibrium, imperfect information and subjective value theory.
This might not only prove helpful to the gun debate here, but to other social
problems.  Though some might still argue the point, at least the economics
won't get abused in the process.:)

Just in case you liberty buffs out there haven't quite gotten what you
expected for X-mas,Newtonmas, Huh?nukah, or whatever, I just got, hot
off the presses, the 1998 Ruger catalog.

New for '98 are the 77/50RS inline percussion muzzle loader rifle, the
77/44RS .44 mag bolt action rifle, and the Ruger Carbine PC9GR (9mil and
.40 cal).

I've tested the muzzle loader, and I can say they have a group at 50
yards of less than an inch, on average. The .44 lever action, in its
second year, which was just reviewed by American Rifleman, and tested to
a 2.4" average group, has undergone an accurizing program which will
bring the average group for that gun down to less than an inch as well,
come February shipments.

Check out: http://www.ruger-firearms.com/

I've noticed that Ruger is putting out a lot of models in the .44 magnum
pistol round.

That David Koresh and company were under-armed for such an event is 
demonstrated fact.

That they were in fact under-armed as compared to a comparably sized 
group of Texans selected at random, is an equally well established -- 
but less well reported -- fact.

This assumes that any given firearm will either

*never* be among the first two choices as a defense weapon.

www.cyc.com still exists. It looks like they just got $1.6M from
the US Commerce Dept. - see the homepage.

They have the "Upper CYC Ontology" on display at
http://www.cyc.com/cyc-2-1/cover.html. I mailed info@cyc.com
once to ask if Cyc had an epistemology as well as an ontology;
they never replied.

True. The pediatrician who delivered myself and my siblings had the
habit of keeping loaded weapons in drawers and closets all over the
house, yet his home was still invaded by a biker gang and he and his
wife and kid were shot in the head execution style (not by his own
weapons). My grandfather was his best freind, and a year later when the
feinds were apprehended, he had gone to the trial with the initial
purpose of taking the bastards out. They are all still rotting in jail
thanks to appearances by freinds and families of the victims at parole
hearings (those that are still alive).

It seems inconsistent that you would object to Big Brother controlling
your choice to own and use a gun, and yet you cheerfully suggest that
Big Brother control your choice of reproduction, marriage, divorse, and
family role model.  Do you really want someone else to define how a
family should live and then force that definition on you and your
family?

What if they decide that your gun ownership makes you too dangerous to
reproduce?  What if they consider having guns around your kids to be
child abuse?  What if they decide that a gun owner is not a "positive
male role model".  I can easily see fanatics making all these decisions
in an attempt to reduce violence by following your very own rules stated
above.

I totally agree with your conclusions, and this is not a counter
argument against guns.

However, in the interest of using statistics accurately, I must point
out that this study only counts victims who survived the attack and
later received hospital treatment.  It excludes victims who were
killed.  This shows that guns are not the most likely cause of
*non-fatal* injuries.

(It is my hobby to harp on how statistics can be misinterpretted.)

A law as evil as it is unworkable. I'm certainly not in favor of banning guns, 
however if I had to choose between banning guns and banning ideas, even bad 
ideas, I would not hesitate in banning the guns. Fortunately the question is 
academic. Modern governments have had little success in keeping their 
subjects from having access to objects they don't like, they will have even 
less success in stopping changes of voltage on a line because they don't like 
the bits of information that some interpret those changes to mean.

I spent the past year in graduate school studying the topic of 
violence, and I have been following this thread with interest, but I 
must confess to some confusion as to the points being made.  Can 
someone please address the following:

(i) just what type of violence is being discussed?  War, assault, 
torture, hate crimes, etc?  The literature in recent years has 
branched off to address these in singe form, as the complex of 
factors that lead to them is different, and some areas are better 
understood than others.  (ie, serial killers can be labeled mentally 
ill in most cases, but perfectly sane people commit hate crimes)

(ii) again, I must please beg of you not to immediately cast all 
violence into the catagory of neurochemical causes, as to 
predetermine that all violence is caused by mental chemical imbalance 
automatically shuts off other avenues of dealing with it.

I hope everybody has a merry christmas, but I think it's important to remember 
the true meaning of the holiday. Christmas is the birthday of our savior   
from ignorance, Isaac Newton. We should also remember that GOD is the answer. 
The question, of course, is "How do you spell "DOG" backwards?".

Sounds like some work by Karl Sims, while he was at Thinking Machines.
It was pretty general.  A tree structure of segments where parents and
children were connected by joints.  Each segment was a rectangular prism
and contained a neural net and maybe some sensors.  The net's inputs
and outputs connected to neighboring segments' nets, local sensors
and joint "muscles."  He made the physics fairly realistic.

One cool effect resulted from a bug in the physics where you could gain
momentum by clacking two parts together.  Organisms evolved to exploit
this and that's how he found the bug!

He evolved things using selection criterea for: getting far
in water, getting far on land, getting high off the ground, and winning a
two-player grapple-the-hocky-puck game.  For each of these a variety of
forms evolved.

ANNOUNCING MAPS-FORUM

The MAPS forum is the electronic discussion group of the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). MAPS is a 501 (c) (3)
corporation chartered in 1986 as a membership-based research and
educational organization. Currently numbering 1400 members, MAPS focuses
on the development of beneficial, socially-sanctioned uses of psychedelic
drugs and marijuana. MAPS pursues its mission by helping scientific
researchers design, obtain governmental approval for, fund, conduct and
report on psychedelic research in human volunteers. 

The MAPS forum supports this mission by allowing members to interact with
each other and with international experts in the psychedelic field. Topics
may include current news, book reviews, factual questions about
psychedelics or marijuana, psychedelics and marijuana in the media, ideas
for research and fundraising, and articles in the MAPS quarterly
bulletin/newsletter. Students who have written class papers on psychedelic
topics are encouraged to share their work here. M.D. and Ph.D. 
researchers funded by MAPS are also asked to participate. The forum also
serves as a rapid response network when there are opportunities to
influence drug policy decisions that are critical to MAPS' mission. 
Questions about anything MAPS is doing, or suggestions for anything MAPS
should be doing, are encouraged. 

To maintain the high standards that members expect from MAPS, this is a
moderated list. Subscribers to maps-forum are assured of a high
signal/noise ratio. A maximum of five messages are selected for posting to
the list each day by the moderator. Although questions are welcome at all
levels of interest, the moderator prefers posted comments to be presented
at a level appropriate for a classroom or a professional meeting. 

To subscribe to maps-forum, send email to majordomo@maps.org with
"subscribe maps-forum Albert Hofmann <youraddress>" (if your name is
Albert Hofmann) without the quotes, in the first line. Make sure
youraddress is enclosed within the <brackets> as shown. Leave the subject
line and all other lines blank. To unsubscribe, send email to
majordomo@maps.org with "unsubscribe maps-forum youraddress", without the
quotes, in the first line. Leave the subject line and all other lines
blank.

Subscriptions to maps-forum are free to MAPS members, and free to
non-members for a 90-day trial period. Memberships, which include a
subscription to the quarterly MAPS Bulletin, are available for
$35 (non-US: $50) for General Members, and $20 (non-US: $35) for
student/low income.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GUIDELINES FOR AUTHORS
(1) Questions are welcome at all levels of interest but posted comments
should be presented at a level appropriate for a classroom or a
professional meeting. Primarily, this means to assume a skeptical
audience. Make an effort to support your assertions with argumentation and
evidence. Clearly state the central point you are trying to make early in
your message. Provide definitions and/or examples when using unusual
terminology or advanced concepts. Make references to the literature and/or
URL's whenever possible. 

(2) By the same token, please provide an introduction, summary, or
discussion of all references or URL's posted to the list. Don't just post
web addresses and say, "check this out." 

(3) A maximum of five messages will be selected for posting to the list
each day. Short posts are prefered over longer posts. Consider breaking up
longer works into a series of installments over a week or several weeks.
If you have already received five messages from the forum in the past 24
hours, please wait until the next day to post. 

(4) Persons who have not submitted recently will be given priority over 
those who post to the list often. In general, it is prefered that 
individual subscribers post no more often than once per week and only once 
or twice per thread (although there are numerous exceptions). Consider 
whether your response to a post is better sent to the author rather than 
to the entire list.

(5) For purposes of legal safety, first person narratives confessing one's
own illegal drug use are always sent back to the author with a reminder of
this guideline.

(6) Relevant cross-posts from other sources are welcome (especially when
an introduction explaining the relevance is included), but original
content is prefered. 

(7) General drug policy discussions (prohibition vs. legalization) are
not encouraged unless they specifically relate to research. Examples of
acceptable drug policy topics include: the influence of drug policy on
research, or the policy implications of research.

(8) When responding to a post on the list, *briefly* quote only the
relevant part of what you are specifically responding to, and write your
message under the quote.

Don't you see a glaring contradiction here?  The label "hypocrite"
pops immediately to mind.

(PS: Lorrey had written "preproduce".  I'm assuming that's a typo, and
have corrected it.)

This I'm not so sure about, but it may actually work.

>c) Outlaw divorce while the children are minors.

This is really rich, Michael.  "Live free or die", indeed.  Pray tell us,
what brand of freedom is this?

>This would a) ensure

Outlawing divorce does not ensure that people will think long and hard
before getting married, any more than outlawing anything else makes
people think long and hard before breaking the law.  Even smart people
sometimes end up getting a divorce, no matter how hard they think about
it beforehand.  This proposal is also unenforcable.  A marriage can
exist on paper while the partners are separated.  Are you going to
force the partners to live under the same roof, too, even if they can't
get along?  Are you not willing to admit that sometimes it is better
for a bad partnership to live apart?  What about joint custody, so that
the child(ren) can still have both parents, just not simultaneously?

>b) eliminate the severe
>strife that typically occurs between divorcees, using kids as the pawns,

I think you have a warped view of what "typically occurs".  *Sometimes*
children are used as pawns.  But I personally know people who are divorced,
have joint custody, and seem to be doing just fine raising the kids.  Sure,
it would be better if the parents got along and could live together.  But
given that they can't, it seems better for them and for the children
that they live peacefully apart rather than violently together.

"Live Free or Die---except when you disagree with me."

Its obvious I did not go far enough so that even the most dense

I don't agree with you at all, I hardly think the constant barrage
of illegal gun usage in the media constitutes an "Idea", and
"Idea's" are banned all the time. Let's just incorporate it into
the so called "Safe Harbor" ruling that confines erotica to hours
between 10pm and 6am. Now it's not banned, "just confined to
reasonable hours."

Besides with over 20,000 gun laws in this country, which in my
opinion is quite an effective ban, whats wrong with one little law
striking at the source.

By the way, it would be trivial for the government to stop this in
the mass media, (TV and Movies). Some cable companies as well as TV
stations already have voluntary anti-gun policies.

What it might do is put an end to "Hollywood Hippocricy" i.e.
Sylvester Stallones conscientious objector status during the
vietnam war only to make million's playing a big gun shooting war
hero later.

      Hello!

      Some thoughts on the 'violence' issue, prompted by the thoughful 
      contributions of Anders Sandberg and Kathryn Aegis.

      Swiss psychotherapist Alice Miller's horrifying book on the subject 
      of 'poisonous pedagogy' -- "'For Your Own Good':  The Roots of 
      Violence in Child-Rearing" (Virago, [1987] -- is an inclusive and 
      comprehensive descriptive and explanatory account, which answers the 
      basic question: "How would you have to bring up a child, for him or 
      her to be a violent adult?"

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      When I lived and worked at the Alternative Bookshop in Covent 
      Garden, Central London, I used to go for (unarmed!) walks after 
      midnight arond Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and other 
      night-life venues.

      With experience, it often became possible to see attackers and 
      'attackees' seeking each other out, and pairing off.  Many of the 
      'attackees' seemd to give off 'attack me!' signals ('Kick me!' 
      signals, in Eric Berne's (albeit flawed) Transactional Analysis 
      theory. Clearly, learning to spot 'aggressor' signals and 
      suppressing 'victim' flags would be most worthwhile.


      I (used to) cultivate 'invisibility' (there's a whole literature on 
      how to do this in the world of spookdom -- field operatives often go 
      unremarked, as grey, unnoticeable people).  After doing Werner 
      Erhard's -- albeit flawed -- 'est' training in 1979, I had access to 
      a further intellectual arsenal of self-defence and self-projective 
      techniques.

      I never did much martial arts training, because under UK law, using 
      martial arts skills against someone counts as 'assault with a deadly 
      weapon', and there are many deadlier weapons around.  I have a 
      preference for 'action-at-a-distance' anyway.  >:-} In retrospect, I 
      may also have felt that I would be more aggressive (maybe just a tad 
      more self-assertive, anyway!) if I had greater martial arts skills. 
      And I _really don't like hurting people_.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      In my motorcycling days, I had a friend (Dave Watson) who was an 
      accomplished street-fighter (he took out three 'bouncers' in twenty 
      seconds in one incident).  He gave me some lessons.  Yet he ended up 
      in the 'fastest gun' trap, with thugs looking to make a reputation 
      who came looking for him.  Not much 'deterrent effect' there.

      Another friend (Tony Owen) had his girl-friend harrassed in a 
      coffee-bar by three goons. He was too 'puny' to defend her, so he 
      just walked out (whereupon the harrassment stopped, AFAICR).  Half 
      an hour later, the goons exited the coffee-bar.  A large black car 
      was parked outside...


      As the goons walked up the road, a voice called out:


      "Turn around.  I'm not going to shoot you in the back."


      There was Tony Owen, holding a single-action .45 revolver on them.


      He pulled back the hammer, and >click<.  Misfire...

      The three goons started towards him.  He calmly pulled back the 
      hammer again, and shot the first goon in the face.  The two 
      remaining goons stopped.  Tony Owen pulled back the hammer agiain, 
      and the next goon dropped, clutching his shoulder.  The third goon 
      sank to his knees, and started begging not to be shot.  Tony Owen 
      shot him anyway, got back into his big black car, and drove off to 
      Johnson's 'Rising Sun' motorcycle cafe.  He turned himself in to the 
      police an hour or two later, and was later sentenced to nine months' 
      imprisonment for all this.  (No-one had died: and it was pointed out 
      at his trial that his mother had been a victim of domestic violence 
      during his childhood).  People rather avoided him when he came out 
      of jail...


      Many historians have suggested that the origin of English good 
      manners originated in the practice of duelling.  The same may be 
      true for America.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      One of my favourite books is "Civilian Resistance as a National 
      Defence"  with a chapter by Gene Sharpe, and another by April Carter 
      (a relative of mine).  I agree, that non-violence is prudent _and_ 
      effective, as well morally acceptable.  It _is_ the best policy, up 
      to a certain point.  Social innovation could further enhance its 
      effectiveness.  Ferinstance:

      If each of us is equipped with uniquely-coded radio 'panic alarms', 
      (SARA beacons) so that we can personally summon assistance to our 
      exact location from our chosen service provider, we would see a 
      transformation of policing from a useless state-provided 
      social-control system into a customer-driven _personal protection 
      service_.  Crime would be vastly reduced.  Evil-doers would be 
      massively deterred by fast response times; and harm would be 
      reduced.  It would become less necessary to carry self-defence 
      weapons.

      An illustration:  I am a formal external adviser to the Boulder, 
      Colorado District Attorney's Office (and to the Denver, Colorado 
      office of the FBI) in the investigation into the homicide of 
      JonBenet Ramsey a year ago (winner of many child beauty pageants, 
      JonBenet was just six years old).

      It is my hypothesis that the slaying of Jonbenet Ramsey was a 
      deliberate act of terrorism, planned and carried through by 
      authoritarians with close connections to 'the authorities'; and that 
      the slaying was aimed at the child beauty-pageants' participating 
      parents and their children.  The repressed authoritarian mindset 
      hates the sight of liberated, free-spirited children (it reminds 
      them of the child they once were, who was destroyed by authoritarian 
      parenting).

      Very recent press reports state that a police-type 'Taser' 
      electroshock gun was finally used to torture and kill JonBenet after 
      she had been systematically sexually tortured for many hours in the 
      basement of her parents' house.

      If JonBenet had been wearing a 'SARA' alarm, she could have 
      instantly summoned help.  She might well be alive today.

      Three guesses why 'the authorities' aren't too keen on this idea...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      There are five political dispositions in Britain and America:


      disposition:    US   UK
      ============    ==   ==

      conservative:  35%  36%

      libertarian:   20%  19%

      socialist:     13%  18%

      authoritarian: 20%  13%

      centrist:      12%  15%

     
      The authoritarians were intellectually and emotionally and 
      spiritually crippled in childhood.  In 'adult' life they are hostile 
      to (and even attack) those who remind them of the free, capable, 
      spontaneous child they could have been (and in some cases perhaps 
      even once were).  They now abuse and oppress their own kids, 
      replicating their fell type.  They can be found in State employment, 
      'law enforcement', corporate hierarchies and blue-collar jobs.

      How to deal with authoritarians will be the 21st Century's greatest 
      problem.  They killed over 100 million people in this century alone, 
      and 'soul-murdered' countless millions more.

      Understand this: they'll destroy us if we permit it.

      Three times this Century, Atlantic liberalism has smashed 
      authoritarianism by military force.  (WWI, WWII, Cold War)

      And we'll do it all over again if we have to.  

      Even better, next time.

I've seen a similar phenomenon myself.  I used to have a roommate who
seemed to attract trouble without actually inviting it, getting into fights
at bars and clubs about every other weekend.  In most cases, a complete
stranger would "step up" with no provocation and try to start something.  I
think it was something of an alpha-male type thing; my roomate was 6'2",
250 lbs of solid muscle, and a fairly good looking guy.  Fortunately for
him, he could flatten 3 of his average aggressors at the same time without
breaking a sweat.  The times that I was with him I hardly ever helped him
because he never seemed to need any.

The *real* story to this, though, is what happened afterward.  Half the
time, the police would show up (late, of course) and throw *him* in jail
for assaulting the 3 or 4 guys who would be laid out in the parking lot by
this time.  Because of his size, the police didn't consider it
self-defense, even though he was usually outnumbered and the victim.  On
one particular occasion when I was with him, the police showed up ten
minutes after it was over and proceeded to use pepper spray and clubs on my
roommate even though he was no longer fighting his aggressors and was
attempting to cooperate with the police (at which point I nearly got myself
taken with him).

Note: After this happened for the third time in about 2 months, a
successful legal action/investigation was taken against the San Jose police
regarding some of these incidents and all of the charges (resisting arrest,
assault, et al.) were dropped and two of the officers involved received
official reprimands, if I remember correctly.  It is fairly obvious that
the police did not believe him to be of the socio-economic class that would
have a good lawyer.

My daughter, at 14 years of age, 5 feet of height, and about 95 
pounds of weight (and with absolutely no martial-arts training),  
could generate "aggressor" signals plain enough to terrify her best 
friend when they went out for a walk *together*.

The friend, unfortunately, couldn't stop sending "you're a big bad 
wolf and I'm a lame rabbit" signals if she were driving a tank.

 If beauty were the main motivation, rather than a desire to use the
software or to acquire a reputation as a good programmer, then we would
see Linux hackers giving low priority to dealing with bugs that result
from commercial hardware vendors' mistakes. I don't think that's what's
happening.
 From what I have seen of the Linux kernal and gcc source code, I'd say
they are no more beautiful than the median for commercial software. gcc
in particular had (last time I checked) a number of ugly lines that were
accompanied by comments of the form "needed to handle a bug in the FooBar
compiler v. 3.5".
 Curiously, I seem to recall a much larger variation in beauty of commercial
source code than in freeware. I wonder if this is due to a selection
effect in what code I see (determined in part by who gets hired at the
companies I work for), or in what code actually gets written?

 My experience has been that money can be as effective a motivator as
anything else under the right circumstances.

 That would depend a lot on exactly how their superiors decided whether
to continue paying them. If their pay was contingent upon how many hours
they spent writing arguments, the results would be worthless. If their
pay was a function of the number of hits the mailing list archives got,
the debate would probably be a bit more interesting than it is now.

OK, so you were using satire.  Ha ha.  But recognizing satire requires
knowing the author well enough to realize that it's out of character, and
not recognizing it doesn't necessarily imply anything about the reader,
other than the reader doesn't know you well enough to know whether you're
kidding or not.

I apologize for using some "ad hominem" language in my reply to you.

Well, since I've been a subscriber to this list for 1.5 years now, and
the >H list for a year or more before that, I would expect that there is
enough of my writing on the list for people to see what I was getting
at. The solution that Kathryn  & Comapany would like will take nothing
more than a totalitarian regieme that would make the communist and Nazi
regiemes look like naughty cubscouts. The solution that I propose is
that people acknowledge that violence is enough of a genetic thing that
we will never be able to wipe it out and remain expansive, extropic
creatures. Given this acknowledgement of truth, individuals should
accept the responsibility to a)defend themselves, their property and
their loved ones in a way that minimizes risks to themselves and their
selfsame loved ones, b) work to reduce or change their own actions that
could incite or lead to violent action by others.

Brian D Williams thinks censorship is moral, I think it's an obscenity.  
I can't prove It's wrong, I can't prove murder is wrong either and don't feel 
I need to, I would put both in the same category. There is no disputing 
matters of taste however so I will try to concentrate on practical 
considerations. 
         

        >I hardly think the constant barrage of illegal gun usage in the         
        >media constitutes an "Idea" 


Don't be ridiculous. You may not like the "guns are sexy and fun" meme and  
I'm not too crazy about it myself, but it certainly changes peoples behavior  
and it can be sent over a wire, so of course it's an idea. 
              

        >and "Idea's" are banned all the time. 


Sure they could be banned, government thugs pass laws like that all the time, 
but making laws is easy, enforcing them is not. 
                 

        >Let's just incorporate it into the so called "Safe Harbor" ruling         
        >that confines erotica to hours between 10pm and 6am.         


If you believe that if your children see a picture of 2 people fucking or  
even seeing the word "fuck" will ruin them for life then it's your 
responsibility to stop them from seeing it, not mine. Personally I don't 
think the matter is important so I won't lift a finger to help you, but 
they're your kids so I won't try to stop you either, however if you use that 
tired old excuse to limit my freedom I will fight you with everything I have, 
including violence if I think I could get away with it.   
                 

        >Now it's not banned, "just confined to reasonable hours."


By the same token books are never banned, they are only burned because of a 
lack of "reasonable readers", the government of course determines who is 
reasonable and deserves a readers licenses.


        >Besides with over 20,000 gun laws in this country, which in my        
        >opinion is quite an effective ban, whats wrong with one little law        
        >striking at the source.


For one thing, such a law has nothing to do with guns, it has to do with 
speech and the inability of government to convince people to  do what they 
want. The only solution these gangsters can think of is to use force to stop 
citizens from hearing the other side of the argument.

For another thing, if we have 20,000 idiotic laws that are largely ignored 
then having 20,001 is unlikely to improve the situation.


        >By the way, it would be trivial for the government to stop this in        
        >the mass media, (TV and Movies).
                    

If the thought police in the USA stop people from  printing books or making 
movies they will simply do it in a country that has more freedom, and there 
would always be such places because of the considerable  financial reward 
that would result. Smuggling has always been lucrative, and now with trade 
becoming international and several trillion dollars flowing across "sovereign" 
borders every day, and doing it in every direction, it has become even more 
so.

The government has shown that it is utterly incapable of stopping even 
something as concrete as an object from coming into the country, an object  
like hundreds of tons of cocaine or many thousands of tons of cannabis.  
Encryption is just Mathematics and a cryptograph program like PGP is not an 
object, it's a sequence of bits. If you can't even stop objects from entering 
the nation how on earth  are you going to stop bits, bits  that can be 
duplicated endlessly at virtually no cost,  bits that can be easily and very 
effectively hidden with encryption, bits that can make use of the new 
communication channels that open up daily to every part of the planet?

A cable company with a anti-gun policy? A cable company without CNN, NBC, ABC,

I think not.

The man is not a war hero, the man is an actor and that's a perfectly 
honorable profession. He showed intelligence in getting out of the Vietnam 
war, more intelligence than most. When it's a question of survival, when a 
bunch of goons want your labor and try to enslave you so you can perform a 
very dangerous, unpleasant, and pointless job for them 12 thousand miles away, 
you do what you have to do to remain free. I wouldn't have held it against him 
if he shot off his big toe to prevent it, or bribed someone, or pretended to 
be insane, or showed up at the recruiting office in a strapless evening gown.

Regarding my claims that a well-trained (in personal combat /
self-defense skills) population is a good way to deter violence, Dwayne
commented that if -everyone- is well-trained, the training is of less
value.  I don't see why.  There would, of course, be wide variations in
different people's skill levels, but it would be difficult to detect how
well-trained someone was just by watching them in ordinary activities. 
Right now, most people aren't well-trained, so a street thug who is
alright at fighting knows that he (or she) has a very good chance of
assaulting someone and getting away with it.  But if everyone or most
everyone was at least fairly well-trained, assaulting someone would be
very risky.  The small woman you thought you could easily rape could have
been training ninjutsu since she was a child.  Or the old man you thought
you could hold up and knife-point for his wallet could have been training
all his life.  You just never know.  It becomes too risky to just try
assaulting people to find out if they're less well-trained than you are. 


The other factor is the other well-trained people around them.  People
who are well-trained in self-defense aren't going to walk alone in
dangerous places.  When bystanders are capable of mangling and killing
you in a matter of seconds, violence simply becomes too risky to engage
in.  

When the populace are the police, criminals cannot survive.

I don't believe any such thing, (see above) I'm quite pissed to

It has everything to do with gun violence, which is a learned
behavior. The gangsters you refer to, are in my opinion, the major
television and cable networks which have written policys against
running anything which might put gun ownership or use in anything
except a negative role.

I've been on cypherpunks since it was founded, have used PGP since
it was created, have autographed copies of both of Schneier's
book's on the subject, and now the truth can be told, was one of
the many people who distributed it ahem .... widely. The major
networks are not encrypted to the curb, much less the home, so your
argument fails completely.

As someone else already pointed out CNN has a written policy to
this effect, as does CBS, the others you mentioned are rumored to
as well. Don't believe it? try running an NRA commercial during
prime time.....

I'm not questioning his choice about the Vietnam War, I've always
thought the draft was wrong, and such things are a matter of one's
own choice. I got in considerable trouble for supporting that
position when I was in the USMC. I had a two star general tell me
"unofficially" to cease and desist. By the way I was in Boot Camp
during the fall of Saigon, I enlisted and was 17 years old at the
time.

You choose to call what he did after "a perfectly honorable
profession" (acting), I call it hypocrisy.

I distinctly remember an incident about the U.S. Army, but I
haven't been able to relocate the referrence. I do however also
remember the incident you mention, and did locate that reference.
Maybe one learned from the other?

W.M. Denevan, "The Native Population of the Americas in 1492"
(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1992).

Smallpox may have been the most useful weapon of biological warfare
in world history. European colonists repeatedly took advantage of
the special susceptibility of the Amerindian population,
deliberately spreading the deadly virus among Indians who were
sucessfully defending their rights to the land and resources of the
Americas. For example, in 1763 Sir Jeffery Amherst, commander in
chief of all British forces in North America, was having great
difficulty controlling the Pontiac Indians in the western
territories. At Amherst's insistence, blankets innoculated with
live smallpox viruses were distributed to the Pontiac, obliterating
the tribe. The deliberately induced epidemic quickly spread to the
northwest, claiming large numbers of Sioux and Plains Indians,
crossed the Rockies and inflicted huge death tolls among Native
Americans from southern California all the up to the Artic circle
tribes of Alaska. This devastation was cited in the official WHO
history of smallpox: Fenner,Henderson, Arita,et al,(1988) op.cit.

I also found this in Laurie Garrett's "The Coming Plague":

"According to historian Williams McNeill, Cortez's capture of
Mexico City with just a small army of exhausted Spanish irregulars
under his command was possible only because the Europeans had
unknowingly spread smallpox throughout the land. When Cortez
launched his final assault on the capitol, few Aztec soldiers were
alive and well. Smallpox, together with measles, tuberculosis, and
influenza, claimed an estimated 56 million Amerindian lives during
the initial years of the Spanish conquest."

Yikes....

Anyone who claims to come anywhere close to answering a question
like that can be immediately dismissed as a crackpot.  There are
so many completely unstudied and misunderstood aspects of learning,
socialization, genetic predisposition, and blind chance involved
in child-rearing that any claim of any "scientific" result in it
is utterly specious.

Hope everyone is in recovery from a fabulous holiday, or at least had 
a day or two of quiet.

The DNA chip posting reminds me--there was a short blurb in several 
newspapers about an announcement at the Society of Neuroscience 
regarding the growth of baby rat neurons in a computer chip.  The 
keywords are so vague as to bring up several hundred unrelated 
articles when doing a search on this--has anyone heard about this or

True enough; but also true of the species Geoffrey Dahmer, and
species Ted Bundy,...

My problem is that I want to take some action to ensure that the
Species Lee Crocker encounters a lot more Hara Ras than John Wayne
Gacys.  Historically, evolution has selected the fit by the simple
expedient of killing off the unfit.  And its criterion of judgment
was nothing more than that very act: staying alive to reproduce.

In the new phase of memetic evolution, where "we" are teleological
threads of execution, represented by patterns of mass-energy, and
acting upon resources of mass-energy, how can progress be achieved
without risking the creation of errant threads and killing them
off when necessary?

Pursuit of non-violent means would not limit anything--I only
question whether unquestioning avoidance of violent means might be
Violence is not a prerequisite for evolution, but /selection/ is.
Differential success of mutating replicators.  Selection requires
both a criterion (which ones are selected?) and a means (how are
those selected given future advantage?)  I'm all for using support
of non-violent cooperation as a /criterion/ for selection; those
are the kinds of beings I want more of in the future.  So how do
we then ensure that those beings flourish and violent ones do not?
And can we be free and effective in creating new kinds of beings
if we don't risk failure (i.e., creating a violent one)?

> Please refer to my previously posted essay in answering,

Your essay makes a good case that narrow-minded focus on
single means leads to bad solutions.  I wholeheartedly agree.
That's why I'm also unwilling to narrow-mindedly focus on /only/
non-violent means.  I'm perfectly willing to admit that it is
possible that all the predatory people in our society who
necessitate violent restraint might have been prevented from
becoming such by different societal systems, medical treatment,
economics, education, or other means.  It is even possible that
we may find technologies to non-violently protect ourselves
from them as they are today.  But since it is most definitely
the case that violent restraint of them is necessary now, I
cannot rule out the possibility that it will be necessary in
the future as well, or that we will have to find other ways to
deal with malevolent beings.

For much of my life until my late 20s, I was a LeFebvrian
pacifist.  I've never thrown a punch, and I hope I don't have
to.  But I am no longer willing to believe that all lives are
equally valuable.  My life is worth more than Geoffrey Dahmer's
life, and if I have to end the latter to protect the former, I
have to do so, and take responsibility for it.  If I can
prevent it from happenning in the first place, that's even
better.  But sometimes we don't get that choice.

I would not go that far.  I would say it is good to ask the question, but

      I think censorship is wrong, and I can prove it.  The common 
      regulating principle in both science _and_ morality is _truth_. 
      Obstructing intelligence and knowledge is wrong, and to censor for 
      _anything_ you have to censor _everyone_ for _everything_.  This is 
      why the 'kiddie-porn' hoo-ha is such a snare and a delusion.  Nearly 
      all the 'kiddie-porn' is produced by or with the cognizance of the 
      governments (and their criminal accomplices in 'organized crime', 
      which is 'organized' by the government -- no-one else can let them 
      get away with it) who then seek to 'censor' it.

      In the USA, up to 90% of hardcore 'kiddie-porn' is FBI entrapment 
      stuff -- 'dangles.' But the great 'kiddie-porn' scare is an 
      indispensible pretext for getting the Federales into your mailbox 
      _in the first place_, where they can then go on fishing expeditions 
      for other things altogether.  Intrusive surveillance and Social 
      Control is the name of the game.


      Odd, how the uptight "Moral Majority" crowd seem completely 
      unconcerned by 350 000 children dying hideously each day in the 
      world, of entirely preventable disease and malnutrition.  Photos of 
      children starving to death are commonplace, unremarked.  This 
      indifference is far more obscene than (say) Maxfield Parrish 
      paintings could ever be, or stills of (say) Brooke Shields in 
      'Pretty Baby' or 'Blue Lagoon'; or (say) Jodie Foster in 'Taxi 
      Driver' or 'The Little Girl Down The Lane.'

      Again, notice the assymmetry:  by 15, the average American kid will 
      have seen around 15 000 real or staged slayings.  Yet (some) people 
      can get all uptight about kids seeing lovemaking.  Bizarre!  If the 
      kids are incapable of arousal, it means little or nothing to them. 
      If they are so capable, what's all the fuss about?  Taboos tell us a 
      lot about the psychosexual hang-ups of _adults_.  Kids can enjoy 
      erotic experiences quite innocently.  Like Adam and Eve in the 
      Garden, before the Fall.  It was the Bad Guy who made them ashamed 
      of their natural nakedness, not God...  >:-}
 
      And they're not 'his kids.'  On Lockean self-ownership grounds, the 
      kids' lives belong to the kids.  At best, the parents are trustees 
      and protectors and guardians.  Defending people against objective 
      knowledge of matters of biological necessity and good clean fun 
      (i.e. reproduction) seems quite utterly daft.

      Amen to that.  I'd have killed to avoid conscription (I grew up 
      under its shadow).  Whereas I might have volunteered for combat jets 
      or some Special Forces work...
 
      Stripped of all the nonsense, a soldier's job is to kill.  The work 
      is unpleasant; it can be dangerous.  But there are worse fates.  I'd 
      have volunteered to fight for _his_ strategy with John Paul Vann in 
      Vietnam.  Read Neil Sheehan's magnificent biography, "A Bright 
      Shining Lie."  An intensely moving and unmissable history.

      I don't think that has to be true.
      
      First, you don't distinguish between aggression, and violence.  They 
      aren't the same thing.  Aggression has biological and psychological 
      functionality.  Violence may not.  In a world where children are 
      treated as chattels of their parents, and subjected on a horrifying 
      to abuse and 'child-control' procedures of stupefying cruelty and 
      destructiveness (usually 'for their own good', natch), it's not 
      morally possible or socially-practicable to take a 'laissez-faire' 
      position.  If we don't protect your kids' bodies and minds 
      adequately, they can grow up to kill or enslave _us_.

      
      Second, you don't really take into account the use of social 
      innovation to address these problems.  I advance the idea that 
      _no-one_ has a _right_ to impose upon another person a _risk_ of 
      harm that cannot be fully and immediately compensated for (on a 
      standard indifference-curve restitutive basis).

      
      In practice, this means that everyone gets to carry fully-reinsured 
      insurance cover for the harm that they may inflict on other people. 
      For people who in practice _don't_ inflict harm on others, the 
      insurance is trivially cheap -- a few dollars a year.  Premiums rise 
      in line with claims records; and if claims of certain kinds get out 
      of hand (hurting people in bar fights, say), insurers may impose 
      restrictions -- like staying clear of alcohol, etc., unless all the 
      barflies consent to the risk of harm.  Insurers may also 
      specify recovery of claims payouts from the offender.


      Also: you could readily get insurance for concealed-carry of a 9mm. 
      Browning Hi-Power, -- but probably _not_, for toting a thermonuclear 
      suitcase bomb.  This seems eminently sensible.  >:-}

For the record, I didn't know what to make of it, either. 

Irony, sarcasm and related communications styles carry risk.

Taking them the wrong way is not always an indication of the density of the

I gained the impression from Jared Diamond's GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL that
this kind of bacteriological warfare was largely inadvertent, despite the
occasional egregious salting of contaminated blankets, etc.  Even without
such criminal incidents, I suspect the microorganisms would have done their
work anyway.  Diamond notes of deaths in the Mississippi Valley: `Eurasian
germs, spreading in advance, did everything.  When Hernando de Soto became
the first European conquistador to march through the southeastern US, in
1540, he came across Indian town sites abandoned two years earlier because
the inhabitants had died in epidemics... transmitted from coastal Indians
infected [unintentionally] by Spaniards visiting the coast...  For the New
World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the century or two
following Columbus's arrival is estimated to have been as large as 95
percent' (down from perhaps as many as 20 million).  (p. 211)  This
astounding holocaust was mostly due to the inevitable microbiological
ecology  transition, which as the first part of the quote demonstrates was
bound to happen with or without malign human intervention.  We are less
potent than we imagine, even in our powers for ill.

I think the most we could say is that some child-rearing practices 
are statistically more likely to produce violent people.

I agree, but what was the original point of this debate?  Something about
guns?

I think the same would apply to uplifted octopodes.:)

Then somebody is using your name, somebody claiming to be Brian D Williams  
most definitely did say:

 "I tried for a number of years to interest the NRA/ILA to propose a simple  
  law based on this fact. I proposed that the law ban the depiction of guns,  
  or there use, on TV and in the movies."

Obviously working on a project for a number of years goes way beyond Devil's 
advocacy, so the message must be a forgery, you really should start signing 
you posts with PGP to prevent this sort of thing in the future.

It's no different than anything else, everything is a learned behavior, the 
only reason anybody censors anybody about anything is to get people to do 
what they want.

What's wrong with that? I wouldn't like people saying things I don't agree 
with on my network either. If you don't like their policy then start your own  
network, it's never been  easier technically. Of course nobody will watch if

They are not encrypted because at the present time there is no reason to do 
so, but you must know the categories of broadcast TV, the Internet, telephone, 
and cable are starting to blur. The strong trend is to treat them all the 
same way, as bits of information, massive censorship would accelerate the 
trend. The only way to stop it is to destroy all private computers and
dismantle the internet. Unlikely.

does that make you a hypocrite?

      Do yo mean that you were (as I am) an admirer of Bob LeFevre's?

      Whoaa!!!  We usually use market prices to assess 'valuable' within a 
      social context.  If someone rich values Dahmer as a research 
      specimen, or as a contract killer, and outbids what a 'hit' on you 
      would cost (around $1 000 for a Russian-sourced 'hit' -- lots of 
      kids in St. Petersburg said they wanted to be hit-men in a recent 
      poll) -- does that mean that Dahmer lives and you die?
      
      Or do you mean a more obscure 'internal' concept of value?  Dahmer 
      may think his life is worth more than yours is (to him).  How do you 
      suggest we resolve this clash of 'values'?  Of metrics, even?


      BTW: The British Government values a 'typical' human life at 180 000 
      UKP.  That's how much they'll -- grudgingly -- spend to save a life 
      via road improvements and so on.

      But doesn't that just mean "If it's him or me, it's gonna be him"?  

      Which hardly adds anything at all to our understanding, since nearly 
      everyone on Earth thinks that way (at least where there's some 
      social distance involved).

      An extreme aprioristic response...  This person dismisses an 
      argument without understanding what it says, or evaluating its 
      accuracy.  Try studying Alice Miller's hypothesis first.  Then make 
      some testable deductions from it, and check them out against the 
      factual and statistical bases.
      
      In the UK, around 80% of people in prison are from State childrens' 
      homes.  Additionally: virtually everone convicted of violent 
      offences has had an appallingly violent childhood -- physical and/or 
      sexual and/or gross emotional abuse.
      
      Alice Miller's thesis seems to fit the facts very well.

      We are not presented with a choice of 'explanation' _or_ 'too 
      complex to understand.'  We are presented with alternative 
      hypotheses. Alice Miller's hypotheses describe, explain and predict 
      violent behaviour very well.
      
      So, what alternative hypotheses do you offer?

How do you propose to achieve this, or at least how do you differ from the
position you held until your late 20s? This brings to mind the martial arts
discussion elsewhere in this thread.

Would John actually use violence if someone tried to prevent him

As someone who is not from the USA, I find such a comment strange given the
fairly "pro-liberty" overtones to this interminable and occasionally
fascinating thread. He hasn't hurt anyone has he? Isn't he free to do what
he wants?  He's made a lot of money doing something harmless, shouldn't you
be cheering him on? 

Hell, the irony of it tickles me to death. Good luck to him, I say.

Less difference in skill levels between highly trained and untrained
individuals.

This is not true. I have had extensive martial arts training in the past,
and I can spot people who have a fair amount of training a mile away. I've
not kept this up recently, but when I was going to classes most nights of
the week, and therefore constantly around people trained, in training 
and training others, I found that after a while I could spot people if 
I was out, and would quite often walk up to them and discuss whatever 
style they practiced with them, introducing myself at the time.

There's a weird physical meme people acquire, almost like an "accent" and
if you have this "accent" yourself, or are familiar with it, you can
readily detect it. At one stage I had a few friends who all shared a house
who were Federal Police (erm, I'm in Australia, I think they are similar to
the US FBI or Scotland Yard in the UK). One night I was at a pub, and there
was a guy standing in the bar who reminded me of my friends. I pointed this
out to a friend of mine sitting beside me, who said he had noticed the same
thing. So my friend walked up and asked him if he was a Fed. The guy was
surprised to be asked this, but showed his badge to my friend (who refused
to believe the guy and so asked him to produce ID).  The only way I can
explain this is that the Feds work together, and have acquired an "accent"
to their stance or gait or some other physical habit.

In fact thugs will generally not take on people who might be able to fight
back, and unless they are telepathic or engage their victim in discussion
before the assault, I don't see how they could do this, unless it is
possible to detect the lack of a certain element in the victim's physical
movement.

An aside: I read a very long time ago in a magazine that a movie studio was
hiring people to be trained as steadicam operators, and found that nearly
all of the people hired had martial arts experience, as martial arts tends
to produce a flat gait (the person doesn't rise up on their toes when
taking a step, and so the head doesn't bob up and down as much). I have no
idea where I read this, it just stuck in my memory at the time, as I had
started training about 9 months before, and went out to see if i walked
with a flat gait.  I did. But hadn't really noticed how I waked before my
training started

But if the thug was as well trained as an average person to start with,
then I would assume they'd get better at hitting people with practice, and
so would be as good as the highly trained grandmother you mention.

Or at least notice that the grandmother was highly trained (I would think
that this would be a fairly easy thing to do given that this sort of
training produces a reasonably nimble elder practitioner, and very few
elderly people could be described as nimble.

I walk all over the place in Melbourne where I live. I'm not a very
physically strong person, and can only assume that I would be quite
vulnerable ordinarily.

But as it stands, it is very very rare indeed for me to feel bothered by a
location I am walking through, and I can count the number of times I have
been hassled in the last 10 years on two fingers. Mind you, guns are very
very very rare over here, the number of people killed by gunshot in the
city of app. 4 million people I live in, on an annual basis, would be maybe
20-30. I can find out if people -really- need to know, but it's a pretty
rare thing for someone to be shot dead. Whatever is on television at the 
time is usually interrupted, or a "special news bulletin" follows the
program. So it comes down to physical strength, speed and training, I
suppose. And on that level I generally feel pretty well-armed.

> When the populace are the police, criminals cannot survive.

I would agree with this, although you would, I suppose, need to introduce
fairly rigorous police training for everyone who *does* want to take the
law into their own hands.

Which is not such a silly idea, you know. If everyone was trained in the
law, unarmed and armed combat, ethics, etc, given the same training as the
police force in other words, as a requirement before they were allowed to
go off and arrest people, and were responsible for their actions when
making the arrest, society may well wind up a bit quieter.

Mind you, we have "citizen's arrest" over here, which allows anyone to
arrest anyone else if the arrestee has committed or is committing a crime.

But hardly anyone is as well trained in it as the police, so we tend to
just ring them up and let them come and take care of it. Mobile phones are
useful in this regard, and I suppose eventually very very small video
cameras will be built into phones, which would be a great way to record
evidence.

Special "Stream" at the 20th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society

Madison, Wisconsin, August 1-4, 1998

Co-chairs:

Sean O Nuallain

Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland &

National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada

(sonualla@compapp.dcu.ie)


Robert L. Campbell

Department of Psychology, Clemson University,

Clemson, SC USA

(campber@clemson.edu)

WHAT THE STREAM IS ABOUT

Though deep and contentious questions of theory and metatheory have
always been prevalent in Cognitive Science--they arise whenever an
attempt is made to define Cognitive Science as a discipline--they have
frequently been downrated by researchers, in favor of empirical work
that remains safely within the confines of established theories and
methods.

Our goal to is redress the balance.  We encourage participants in this
stream to raise and discuss such questions as:

* the adequacy of computationalist accounts of mind

* the adequacy of conceptions of mental representation as structures
that encode structures out in the environment

* the consequences of excluding emotions, consciousness, and the social
realm from the purview of cognitive studies

* the consequences of Newell and Simon's "scientific bet" that
developmental constraints did not have to be studied until detailed
models of adult cognition had been constructed and tested

* the consequences of attempting to reconcile contemporary psychology
(which includes developmental psychology) with formal linguistics of
the Chomskyan variety (which appears to be resolutely
anti-developmental if not anti-psychological)

* the relationship between cognitive science and formal logic

A wide range of theoretical perspectives is welcome, so long as the
presenters are willing to engage in serious discussion with the
proponents of perspectives that are different from their own:

* Vygotskian approaches to culture and cognition

* Dynamic Systems theories

* Piagetian constructivism

* interactivism

* situated cognition

* neuroscience accounts such as those of Edelman and Grossberg

* accounts of emergence in general, and emergent knowledge in
particular

* perception and action robotics

* functional linguistics

* genetic algorithms

* Information Processing

* connectionism

* evolutionary epistemology

Contributors should make their submissions to the Cognitive Science
Society, following the standard rules for formatting their papers (if
you have not received the hard-copy call for papers, check the CSS Web
site at http://www.umich.edu/~cogsci/cogsci.html).


        THE DEADLINE IS FEBRUARY 6, 1998.


Contributors should attach a *separate cover page,* indicating that their
submissions are intended for the stream chaired by Sean O Nuallain and
Robert Campbell.

Otherwise papers will be reviewed by Cognitive Science Society's
regular reviewers, and are not likely to get a sympathetic response.


The "stream" will consist of at least two paper sessions (a
total of 8 papers, 20 minutes each) at the Cognitive Science Society. *If
we get enough good submissions, we can request more paper sessions*.

All submissions to our stream will be reviewed by *our
special reviewers*.  Besides the co-chairs, these are:

Since violence or its threat would have to be used to stop me from saying 
what I want, I would have no moral reservation in using violence in return. 
However I'm a practical man, I don't fight for glory and I don't believe in a  
fair fight. I would only engage in violence if I hopelessly outmatched my 
opponent and victory was virtually assured, unfortunately in dealing with the 
government this never happens, that's why I pay my taxes. I'm no hero, and 
I'm not stupid either. 
             

        >or showing people fucking to that person's children?
                 

That is none of my business. I respect other people's rights, all I ask is 
that they respect mine.

Well, that was my point, however rude I was at the time. I could have
gone beyond mere satire into an absurdist bender, but I bet at least
someone out there would have thought I was serious, and not necessarily
because they were dense, but because they were simply taking things a
little too seriously for a mere mail list.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

These discussions over European vs. American violence leave out several key
points-

One-  Europe at various times this century has been very unsafe-  Shouldn't
world war be included in any serious discussion on violence?  What about
Bosnia?

Second-  We should define precisely who we are talking about-  If you
factor in race and location, the difference is startling.  White suburban
America has similar violence rates to Europe-  Of course writing about race
is taboo in American society.

Third-  Due to the first Amendment, Americans enjoy a free press-  Canada
as an example censors many lurid crime details from being reported.  The
American press' sensational tabloid reporting style doesn't do much for the
American image either-

Fourth-  There is a lack of correct historical perspective-  How many of us
have heard about the "Wild, wild west?  Crime rates in the late 1800s in
the US were low-  Do you really think that a bunch of civil war veterans on
the western frontier would let a gang terrorize their town?

This is the first I've seen this, and I'm not sure that it merits a 
response, other than to say that if a group of list members proposes 
to expend bandwidth arguing about my supposed anti-gun stance--well, 
you are wasting your valuable time and revealing your inability to 
read and comprehend written English.

Anyone who missed my posted essay, I'll gladly forward it to you, but 
I don't see the need to endlessly clarify my own thoughts on this 
matter--it's a waste of list members time.

One of the greatest problems facing Humanity is the spread of infectious
diseases.  This has always been a problem, and it has the potential to be
quite devastating in the present and future as people pack more tightly
together in cities and as single individuals come into close proximity
with more and more other people every day.  If one person has an
infectious disease, they can easily expose a hundred other people, who go
on to expose others to the disease.  Most of these diseases are fairly
minor, like the common cold, strep throat, etc, but some are quite
deadly, like Ebola.  These diseases have the potential to interfere
greatly with the productivity of humans at best and to destroy large
numbers of people at worst.

What if humans developed a procedure which could detect most or all known
infectious diseases in a human that was fairly fast (< 2 hours) and
fairly inexpensive (< US $100)?  Is such a procedure possible?  What
would be the consequences of its availability?

One obvious consequence is that when humans traveled to different
countries, Customs, while ensuring the humans are not smuggling anything
illegal into their country, will also make sure they are not smuggling in
any infectious diseases.

Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens
to be screened for disease periodically.  How often would depend mostly
on the cost of the procedure, since disease control would be more
effective if people were screened more often, although there would be a
point at which more frequent screenings would not be any more effective. 
Some may consider the diseases they harbor a matter of privacy and decry
the governments' actions, while others (I believe the majority) will
consider it a public safety issue and believe that no one has the right
to (knowingly or unknowingly) infect others with deadly or debilitating
diseases.

Then there is the question of what to do with people who have been found
to have a highly infectious, deadly disease, or how to deal with people
who have an infectious disease, such as the common cold, whose symptoms
are not deadly but are very unpleasant and prevent one from being able to
work and earn money for a period of time.  Should people with these
diseases be allowed to leave their houses? Should they be confined in
hospitals?  By infecting others, they are imposing a real financial cost
on them, and it could be argued successfully that sick people are not
legally entitled to associate with others who don't choose to associate
with them, until they are rid of the infectious disease.  Although,
enforcing this would be difficult.

Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas
for achieving this goal?

Lee Daniel Crocker, in his last posting, clarifies his thoughts on 
the dynamics of the spectrum of violent<--->nonviolent alternatives 
to defense against violent attacks, and the prevention thereof.  I 
find myself in agreement with most of his comments, except for when 
he seems to slip into the underlying assumption that one must choose 
definitively between a violent or a nonviolent set of options.  I 
tend to approach this with more of a sliding scale, with a commitment 
to explore less deadly options first, but accepting deadly force as a 
necessary thing in some cases, and with a full awareness of the 
gravity of that course of action.  

Or, in the more poetic words of Lao Tzu (as translated by Stephen 
Mitchell):  
	Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them
	except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them
	only with the utmost restraint...His enemies are not demons, but 
	humans like himself.  He doesn't wish them personal harm.  Nor 
	does he rejoice in victory...He enters a battle gravely, with 
	sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral.

David Musick's posting on self-defense, as well as a few of the
follow-up postings, apply this scale on a personal level.  

Of course, our highest goal would be to avoid the necessity of having to 
engage in physical or armed conflict altogether.  It is eminently 
possible for every human to develop a skill base that will enable 
each person to determine when something is going wrong.  We still 
carry those instincts from our ancient beginnings, and we must learn 
to trust them to tell us when danger is imminent, so that we can 
remove ourselves from the situation or warn others.  This set of 
skills can operate on a personal level or on a national level, as 
Chung-ho chi wrote centuries ago: 

	Deep knowledge is to be aware of disturbance before 
	disturbance, to be aware of danger before danger, to be
	aware of destruction before destruction, to be aware of
	calamity before calamity.  Strong action is training the
	body without being burdened by the body, exercising the
	mind without being used by the mind...By deep knowledge of 
	principle, one can change disturbance into order, change 
	danger into safety, change calamity into fortune.

However flawed our present system of conducting international
affairs, if you take the broad view from the beginnings of our
history, humans are on the course of developing more effective
preventative measures that continue to reduce the occurrences of war
globally.  In keeping with this broader view, I direct your attention
to a poem by Eon currently in residence on Natasha's Transhumanist
Art site (http://www.extropic-art.com/gallery.htm), called
'posthuman germinate'.  It is a sort of past-future history of
human.  The first stanza highlights the limited scope of our
relations and perceptions at the beginning of our history:

	In the beginning was man and the creature gods
	who dominate at the will of the slave.
	Drumbeat on the horizon announces intention
	while eyes shift from spear to shield
	for trade or war, no other use known 
	
	<snip>

Fair enough. It just seemed a rather extreme position, given the situation
from which it arose.

Sure, but you *did* use this as an example of one of the things you'd use
violence to preserve your right to do it. Which I thought was a wee tad
extreme.

This is what I thought. I suspect there are some nationalistic memes some
people need to root out.

HEADLINE: Cell's mortal coils hold key to ageing 

Scientists are beginning to understand how cells die, reports Nigel
Hawkes 

SCIENTISTS in the US have discovered an ageing mechanism in yeast
cells that may one day make it possible to slow the process of human
ageing. 

They have found that the yeast cells become clogged with tiny coils of the
genetic material DNA which break off from the chromosomes and
proliferate until the cell becomes overwhelmed and dies. These "mortal
coils " - to borrow from Shakespeare - appear to be responsible for the
process of cell death, at least in this kind of cell. 

"It is remarkable that this mechanism of ageing in yeast cells is so simple
at the molecular level, " Professor Leonard Guarante and Dr David
Sinclair of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology write in the journal
Cell . "It is conceivable that inhibitors of this ageing process can be found
and if so, such strategies might eventually prove useful in forestalling
ageing in yeast and, perhaps, in higher organisms. " 

The search for the elixir of youth is a recurrent theme of fiction, from the
story of Faust to Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray . The desire
for immortality has led to countless theories of ageing, but until recently
little was actually known about how deterioration in function is related to
cellular and molecular changes. However, earlier this year the MIT team
identified a gene in Werner's Syndrome, a rare disease, whose carriers
have symptoms resembling a speeded-up ageing process. They also
showed that modifying that gene in yeast speeded ageing. 

>From other yeast studies they found a series of genes that appear to
determine lifespan, and found that the products of these genes moved
into the nucleolus - a structure in the nucleus of the cell - implying that
perhaps the nucleolus was the "Achilles' heel " of cells as they get older. 

They found that the nucleolus eventually breaks up, preventing yeast cells
from continuing to divide. The latest work identifies what it is that causes
the nucleolus to grow larger and ultimately to fragment. This, the
scientists say, is the accumulation of the DNA rings, which they call
"extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles ", or ERCs. They are created
from lengths of DNA pinched off from the chromosomes as the cell
divides. They have found that the older the cell, the more ERCs it
contains. Ultimately, they become so plentiful that they gum up the
normal processes of cell division, and the cell dies. 

The ERCs act as a kind of clock, Professor Guarente suggests. "Once an
ERC is formed or inherited, the period of time until a lethal number of
ERCs has accumulated may be the clock that determines the lifespan of
the cell. " 

ERCs can apparently form as a result of two processes. One is damage
to DNA, which occurs all the time, and is usually efficiently repaired. The
suggestion is that the ERCs are part of the repair process but,
paradoxically, ultimately accumulate and cause cell death. But ERCs can
also be inherited, suggesting that some cells are designed to have a
built-in clock that limits their lifespan. 

The implications of the research are that it may one day be possible to
inhibit ageing in cells that are analogous to the yeast cells used in the
experiments. In mammals, these are the so-called stem cells, found in
organs such as the skin, kidney, liver and blood. The scientists say: "Next
it will be important to determine whether ERCs or other circular DNAs
accumulate in stem cells of ageing mice or humans. " 
=============================================

BYLINE: By Roger Highfield, Science Editor 

BODY: 
   THERE is more than a ring of truth in Hamlet's reference to the "mortal
coil ", according to an article to be published today. An American team
reports in the journal Cell that it has found a mechanism of ageing in
yeast cells that suggests researchers may one day be able to intervene in,
and possibly slow, the ageing process in certain human cells. The work
marks the culmination of efforts by a team at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Boston that has shown that an aged yeast cell is full of
small "mortal coils " called ERCs, which consist of coils of DNA. Now
the hunt is on to find the DNA circles in aged human cells. The article,
co-written by Dr David Sinclair and Prof Leonard Guarente, reveals a
mechanism of ageing that the team says is "elegant in its simplicity ".
"There is no certainty that these will be found in humans but it is certainly
a possibility, " said Prof Guarente. During the life of a yeast cell,
whenever a particular coiled piece of DNA pinches off from one of its
chromosomes, the "extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA " or ERC
replicates until the cell becomes overwhelmed and dies. Ageing begins in
a yeast cell when the first ERC forms, although that does not seem to be
at the start of its life. "They occur early in the lifespan of a mother
cell and
then accumulate by virtue of the fact that they can replicate, once formed,
" said Prof Guarente. "When that cell divides, each circle of DNA
replicates. Every time the cell doubles the number of ERCs double. "
Prof Guarente says the ERC is like a clock in the yeast cell's mortality.
"Set the clock early and the alarm rings early, " he said. The researchers
suggest that the sheer abundance of ERCs could clog up components of
the mother cells' replication machinery, leading to an inability to replicate
the DNA necessary for life. "When a cell is old, the number of ERCs is
very high, " he said. The biologists wrote: "It is conceivable that inhibitors
of this [ageing] process can be found and if so, such strategies might
eventually prove useful in forestalling ageing in yeast and, perhaps, in
higher organisms. "

I most certainly did NOT. I made it clear, as clear as I am able, that I

How about reading the book before offering your opinion?

BTW, I don't see Tony stating that Dr Miller's work is "scientific". I
could just as easily call you a "scientistic bigot". Also, Dr Miller's
work provides a starting point for research which definitely needs to be
done.

Well, Dahmer is dead and I don't know the fate of Bundy. I know that as
a cryonicist, I increase the probability of creating more members of my

Well, there's always destruction of habitat. I expect some threads will
control more resources than others and that there will be contention.
Some of it peaceful, as controlled by the market, with less robust
threads consigned to static storage. Some of it by forms of combat in
upload space, who knows what that will be like?? Then there's good ole
war, right??

You are incorrect.  It is permissible to write at any length you

This is an excellent question. While a low level of urban conflict seems
to be a characteristic of American Society, does such a low level act as
a relief valve, while the European tendency toward repression of
conflict simply act to store up the 'pressure' until the time is right,
until the culture is weak, so that widespread violence erupts in war?

THis century, between 20-50 million people have died in various levels
of conflicts in Europe, yet, even if you apply today's high murder rate
in the US to every year in this century, that only totals 2-3 million
people. Which region is it more dangerous to have lived in this
century???

Its also obvious by US emigration/immigration data that, on the whole,
the US is still a more attractive place to move to than to move out of
than most other countries. That we have such a big problem with illegal
immigration indicates that poeple much prefer living in the US in a
illegal status than as an upstanding citizen in their own countries.
THis is not just third world countries. SOmeone a bit back cited that
one is more likely to be murdered in the US than in Northern Ireland,
yet why is it that many more Northern Irish immigrate or travel as
tourists to the US than the reverse?? Even if solely US-European stats
are used, it show that more people from Europe wish to go to the US than
the reverse.

Yes it is unfortunate, but indicative of the attitudes of those in power

order to keep their jobs.

This is another point relative to my first response here. Why is tourism

I think that the "wild wild west" was the first example of the
sensationalist tendencies of the free American press, but I think that
the term came more from the habitat, originally.

Agreed, which is why it would be nice to have a model of what is going on

It might be possible that some cps flow into tissue at different rates, in
which case, a cp cocktail might be made which can be administered
in the same way current ones are.

Also, some tissues/organs might be more important than others here
-- depending on the goal.  If one wants merely to preserve the brain,
then one cp might be better at that and not as good at preserving
the whole body.

Perhaps a multistage process might be used in which blood is removed
and cps are injected into the tissues rather than through the main
circulatory system.

Well, one might make it simpler and work on organisms that are easy to
revive.  Such a kit would not only make for good science fiction, but
also might get more people interested in the movement.

(Stanislaw Lem's novel _Fiasco_ has cryonic suspension units inside
walkers on Titan, so that if the pilots of the walker wind up in a pinch,
they can suspend themselves.  Early in the novel, there is no way to
revive people, but later on a means develops and one of the
preserved persons is revived.)

A good question. Evolution is based on three things: reproduction,
variation and selection. It is the selection step that kills, at least
so far. But if resources are unlimited, there is no need to kill off
unfit units, they will be out-bred by their fitter relatives. So one
way of having progress without killing anybody is to get unlimited
resources to grow in. Too bad about Malthusian reality, even in a
technosphere growing with lightspeed...

However, the creation of new threads could of course be done with more
finesse than the current "shake the dice" method - instead of relying
on luck and some skill at upbringing we could use what we know to
increase the likeliehood that the new thread will be fit and happy and
make it less probable that it will be terminated for some
reason. Quality over quantity. Of course, evolution and selection
still occurs, but now we weed out a lot of unfit *potential*
phenotypes instead of real phenotypes.

Hmm, I feel quite at home with talking about child rearing (for this
is what it really is) in terms of process forking, evolutionary
strategies and selection. I wonder if this is rare? :-)

Density isn't the main problem, it is the ease of
transmission. Practically no place on earth is more than around 12
hours of travel from anywhere else given sufficient money, and a
noticeable fraction of the earth's population is travelling at every
moment. This makes spread of disease much quicker.

Note that density may also be positive, since it means it is easier to
organize defenses against the disease, vaccinations etc. Even keeping
people at home works better in a city than in a rural region.

I think something like this is possible and even likely to be
developed. We are getting better and better at bio-assays, and many
common bacteria can be tested for very quickly (matter of minutes at
least for some kinds).

Viruses are harder, but the new DNA-chips combined with a miniature
PCR device could do wonders. Add a sample, dissolve it, PCR, divide
into sections with special restriction enzymes, compare to known
diseases (ignore unrelated stuff like human DNA). Hmm, that sounds
feasible within a few years, maybe it is a good idea for somebody to
think through it more carefully, start a company and help humanity
while earning good money on it?

The above device would today be very expensive, but the combined
version would be so useful that it would likely be a mass-market
object that rapidly fell in price (a big hospital version with
sophisticated analysis, and a bedside device able to identify common
pathogens, possibly able to download "lookout sequence of the week"
from the Internet).

Yes, this is quite likely. And IMHO a good idea too; I don't like
customs by principle, but as a defense aganst pathogens they are a
good idea (I have a half-baked essay about the problems with global
travel and communication, where I argue that some barriers are useful
to keep global diversity high. How to reconcile them with global
freedom is a hard problem).

> Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens
> to be screened for disease periodically.

I think most people could be convinced to scan themselves; it is after
all in their own best interest to get treatment quickly too. There
will of course be a group of recalcitrant or anti-hypochondriacs (the
kind of people who never go to the doctor even when they have a quite
obvious illness; this includes many doctors :-), but even an
incomplete screening is a good thing to prevent spread of many diseases.

> Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas
> for achieving this goal?  

I think we should try to find ways of spreading medical know-how to as
many people as possible, in order to help them be in control over
their own bodies and to select suitable treatments. My hope is that we
could gradually move to more decentralized medicine, with easy to use
and safe systems in the home that can deal with simple complaints
(such as the screening device suggested above), local "health shops"
to keep our bodies in trim and larger, more specialized hospitals
dealing with the real problems. 

It is obviously the later that should work on the epidemological side,
by gathering information from the more local levels (I don't think it
would be much of an invasion or privacy if health monitoring data from
your home scanner with your name and number removed was automatically
sent to the central database for statistical processing; just keep
Microsoft out of it :-) and disseminating alerts and suggestions.

Yes, that would be helpful. But simulating the interactions between
arbitrary cps and a more or less living tissue is a *heavy*
problem. Of course, some approximations could be done (such as a
simple phenomenological model of crystal formation depending on some
properties of the cps), and then more detailled studies could be done
with the successful combinations, but I guess there will be a lot of
both beneficial and problematic interactions that are very hard to
deal with using general rules (cp X forms a complex with cp Y that
limits perfusion, cp X, Y and Z appears to be very bad in simulations
but due to serpendipity they interact with some body-chemicals to form
a very good cryoprotectant solution).

One could also look at cps or additives that bind more or less
strongly to certain tissues, "opening" or "closing" them for each
other. Sounds complex but interesting (maybe something that opens the
blood brain barrier first?)

It is hard to get better access than the circulatory system - it is a
spacefilling fractal.

Yes, it is a quite reasonable idea with emergency vitrification. A bit
like an airbag...

I question this, simply because there are more people of northern 
Irish descent living in the US than in Northern Ireland.  (There's a 
tad more room for them, for one thing.)

Now I could easily believe that the *percentage* of people in 
northern Ireland who wish to travel to the US (temporarily or 
permanently) is higher than the percentage of people in the US -- 
even if you restrict consideration to those of northern Irish descent 
-- who wish to travel to Northern Ireland.

One reason for this is a psychological factor: many people of 
European descent in the US think of visits to their ancestral 
European homeland as visits to "the old country" and much of Europe 
still looks upon the Americas as "the new world" -- and, particularly 
in the US but to some extent in most of the industrialized world, 
there is a bias in favor of the new as compared to the old.

(I'd be interested in seeing some statistics to show whether I'm 
right about that or not.  I confess to having nothing but 
reasonable-sounding speculation.)

You know, "Wild Wild West" really *should* be capitalized: it's the 
name of a touring theater company and the series of plays they did.

  My favorite subject, the teleological threads.
I do not think weeding out potential phenotypes is much different from
getting rid of the real ones. In order to weed a potential process out,
you have to run a representative model of it, or test the beta/final version
on a small time/resource scale. The differences between a model, test run
and a "full" process are quite unclear, especially in the environment where
every process is a test/model of its future self and forks lots of parallel
children trying to resolve different and similar issues at the same time.
Sometimes, one of the children may have resolved the problem that
the whole batch of them was created (the task could be, for example,
improving of default communication protocols between intelligent nodes
in a knowledge network - i.e. development of a basic ethical system).
After the solution is found and tested, it can be implemented, and the
rest of the children can be suspended or killed in mid-execution.
They won't feel "hurt" , and neither will the environment - so what's the
problem?

Let's imagine an absolutely unlikely (IMO) world with infinite resources of
all kinds, where all potential things are generated at the same time, and
nothing is ever erased (I have a problem here, with entities trying to
exercise their freedom and get rid of their unwanted parts, with these
parts disagreeing.  Could I shave off my moustache if it was intelligent
and arguing for its right to continue its existence in its natural habitat?
Or I could only create a clone of myself without the moustache, leaving
the moustached original enslaved to a tuft of intelligent hair.  How intelligent
do we want the [sub-]entities to be to grant them such rights? )

  Even in this situation of infinite resources though, all interesting and efficient
things/beings will be distinct from the ones created under "Rights of Continuing
Existence" or "Rights of Implementation" Acts.  Those entities will be all
garbage, and every single one of them that has any intelligence will be aware
of it.  They will represent practically all existing structures at any time, and may
occupy any point in the Universe, except that on its semantic map they will
never be on the frontier, always banished to the inner semantic junkyard/ the Slow
Zone, knowing that they are completely unneeded, their goals have no meaning,
and their wishes to attach themselves to anything else, though always granted,
create nothing but useless, ever-suffering cripples.

If this all starts sounding like a bizarre dream, this must be for a reason.  I think
we should drop the remnants of anthropomorphism.  We made a step in this
direction when we started discussing evolution instead of static identities, and
another step - with transition from structure threads to goal threads as the
subjects of progress.  Now lets drop persistence and continuity - I mean as
things that *must* be maintained in the development process; they can still
exist here and there, just as structural threads and even static formations - but
only as temporary/specialty tools.  Another concept that I think should be
abandoned in the discussion of future intelligent entities, is that there will
be clear borders between them.  Instead, I expect the teleological threads
(or flows, as this term doesn't suggest linear succession) to employ and
share multiple remote sensors and actuators and distributed specialized
knowledge servers and communication vehicles on a time sharing/contract
basis.  It may look quite weird, but it still seems plausible - unlike the
world of infinite resources where everything starts and nothing ends.

With that, I am ending the process of writing this message, and it's OK,
because it has fulfilled its intended goal.  It can die now.  Other processes
may later start their own typing threads partially based on this one.

This is a good point. The MIT wearable group have suggested that
wearable computers with video cameras make a good crime deterrent (and
I think somebody suggested on this list, last time the subject came
up, that if you show signs of high anxiety level and stand still, the
wearable will start transmitting pictures automatically to people who
might call the police for you if you are robbed). David Brin had
glasses with a similar function in _Earth_ (and old people driving
teenagers nuts by *watching* them intently). 

Overall, the mobile phone is already transforming our society
immensely in unexpected directions.

Not all defenses against violence need to be direct counter-violence,
although surveillance is hardly a solution to all forms of violence
either; the local transport company here in Stockholm has recently
fielded a new model of subway cars with video cameras, in order to
make people feel more "secure". But the events that make people the
most insecure usually involve drunk or drugged offenders which most
likely are not rational enough to worry about surveillance cameras.

In general, a more well-connected social network seems to be both
psychologically healthy and gives better security (not necessarily
along the lines "If you hit me, I'll tell my friend Don
Fettuchini...", but it helps :-). This is an area where social
technology (like mobile phones, wearables etc) might come in handy.

Since Extropians are spread out around the globe, perhaps I can obtain
several
perspectives on these questions.

Now that the assets of a citizen of the U.S. may be confiscated in
retaliation for 
changing his citizenship to that of another country (Health Insurance
Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996, HR3103, Sections 511-513, Public Law 104-191,

Effective 21 August 1996),  I have begun to wonder about other strategies
for 
emmigration from the U.S.

The most obvious course of action is to become a stateless person.  But I
know 
nothing of the consequences of this, not to mention the procedure for 
accomplishing it.

Does anyone have any ideas on how one goes about becoming a stateless
person?

Is statelessness merely a lack of any citizenship?  Or is it an
officially recognized
status?

How does one go about becoming a stateless person?

How does doing so affect international travel?  With no country of record
to
issue a passport, what sort of documents does one produce at borders?  Or

does some agency, such as the United Nations, issue passports to
stateless 
persons?

Are there (m)any legal or tax consequences of becoming stateless?

Any answers or suggestions for further investigation would be
appreciated.

Ciao for now,

It may be that this particular mechanism is the proximate cause of
death in these yeast cells.  But this is obviously a special case of
a more general "accumulation of garbage" problem.  Cells are designed
to keep themselves clean; they have metabolism to deal with various
undesirable products and digest or excrete them.  But these mechanisms
are not perfect; the possible variety of things which can go wrong is
almost infinite, and inevitably some waste products accumulate.

It may be that specific treatments can be found for certain wastes, like
the amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease or these DNA rings in stem
cells.  But my guess is that this won't lead to a breakthrough in life
extension (although it may help with certain diseases).  Fix the DNA rings
and some other chemical buildup will kill the cells a little while later.

Not to say that this information is useless; curing some diseases and
possibly even a moderate 5-10% increase in maximum lifespan would be
a wonderul advance.  But it is not likely to solve the aging problem.

I understand pre-industrial societies suffer frequent and deadly
epidemics of many  infectious diseases, flus, pnemonias, TB, smallpox. 

However, today infectious disease constitutes only a small % of all
causes of death in the industrial world. Improving general sanitary
conditions and nutrition, improvements in shelter, etc., seems
correlated with declining mortality from infectious diseases. In the US,
mortality rates for diptheria, whooping cough, smallpox, etc were
falling precipitously before the widespread introduction of vaccines.

I'm troubled by the entire concept of public health, which is based on
the notion that a healthy lifestyle is not a matter of personal
responsibility, but also a government management imperative. Its' tools
are quarantines, mass immunizations, control of food
and water supplies, aggressive family planning programs, expensive
"wars" against cancer and AIDS, and regulating or restricting access to
alternative health therapies or dietary supplements.  

When it comes to some crucial health matters, the state often does not
allow minority views. And there is no guarantee that the opinion
expressed by the FDA or NIH or CDC are correct. 

Here's 2 examples...

1. Many people think that child hood vaccinations are safe, effective,
and should be mandatory, and that those that disagree are needlessly
endangering their children and others. Others point out that deaths from
these diseases had already plummeted before the vaccinations were
introduced, and that vaccinations carry their own risks. Further, some
argue that vaccinations prevent the full maturation of the immune
system. 

Whether I agree with them or not, I will allow them their minority view.
I would also want the state out of the vaccination biz, including
limiting the liability of vaccination companies. 

2. Many people think the government was right when it told us HIV=AIDS
and launched a billion dollar War on AIDS.  Others argue that this has
been a collossal mistake:

http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/analy.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/turno.html
http://www.duesberg.com/ch3.html

Whether I agree with them or not, I will allow their minority view. If
they are right, then the War on AIDS has been a tragic mistake. 

I would be wary of even more government control of our health.

> Another likely consequence is that governments may require their citizens
> to be screened for disease periodically.  

Likely, but is it desireable?

For example, there are good arguments that the AIDS test is non
specific:
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot1.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/blot2.html

and that HIV has never been properly isolated:
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation1.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation2.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/oz/hiv_isolation3.html
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/aids/evidence.html

So there is a minority (myself included) who would be opposed to state
imposed mandatory screening for AIDS, for example. 

> What if humans developed a procedure which could detect most or all known

Than those humans should quickly market their procedure and make
millions. 

Should the state take over this development and oversee its benfocent
use, IMHO, no. Should the state be picking which labs to fund and which
diseases to target? IMHO, no. 

> Disease control is certainly an extropic goal.  What are some good ideas

Increase the wealth of individuals (this will improve their nutrition,
shelter, etc). Allow a full liability free market in health, replace the
FDA with private sector certification, get the state out of the health
care biz.

Watching the news last night while doing the washing-up, I half-missed a
story that seemed to announce a new (Australian?) device-on-a-chip that
would do ten or a hundred thousand medical assays simultaneously from a
drop of blood.  Not on the market yet, but projected as costing a couple of
hundred dollars each.  No more trips to the path lab with a tube of blood,
all done at the local clinic from a pinprick.

I don't know if I can.  Maybe I shall, but it might preclude other options in my

to go from intelligent layperson to cryobiologist -- assuming I am the former?

Then, perhaps, it is time to develop -- even one that only works sometimes.  A
bad model can be improved.  No model is worse, don't you think?  I think there
is enough information to build a rough model that can be improved.

It's a good idea and I think the Prometheus project is actually doing some-

Whatever happens, the point is we need a method which will work
well enough to get us better results than current research and
projections.  If things then work out, more funding and effort might
be able to clean up some of these problems.  Genetic algorithmn
searches, e.g., are not perfect, but they are often much better than
brute human engineering or trial and error.

This is just one example.  Another might be to inject directly into the

that the cp works only on that organ/tissue and does not reach others

Quite.  No reason we can't draw up one for fun.  Maybe someone else

An American citizen may renounce his citizenship and remain in American
territory.Much to the chagrin of the current pro-statehood Governor of Puerto
Rico, some Puerto Ricans have officially renounced their American
citizenship. Mr. Juan Mari-Bras, an attorney and veteran advocate of Puerto
Rican independence, succeed in obtaining an Acknowledgment of Renounced
Citizenship from the American Department of State plus a decision from the
Puerto Rican Supreme Court decision granting him voting rights in island
elections, despite the fact that the independentist leader is currently
"stateless" (lacking the only official citizenship available to Puerto
Ricans) in his own land. Since citizenship is a function of sovereignty, and
Puerto Rico is not a sovereign polity, Mr. Mari-Bras's claim to "Puerto Rican
citizenship" are more of an aspiration than a legal reality.

The Jones Act of 1917 imposed/granted American citizenship to Puerto Ricans
(just in time for World War I) and allowed Puerto Ricans of legal age who
wished to reject such citizenship to do so at the time and remain "Puerto
Rican citizens", a legal construct established in the 1898-1899 Treaty of
Paris between Spain and the United States and confirmed in the Foraker Act of
1900. Again, since Puerto Rico hasn't been a sovereign country since
Spaniards settled and "pacified" the island in the early 1500's (with the
exception of a brief autonomous regime in the first five months prior to the
1898 American invasion), such citizenship is legally bogus.

The funniest part is that, short of keeping a list of Renegades, there's no
way an uninformed U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services agent would be
able to keep Puerto Ricans "citizens" from re-entering American territory at
any time, since all they need to produce is a birth certificate and voila!
unarguable instant rights to re-enter the country.

Given the above cases, I'd say that statelessness might indeed be an
officially recognized status within the United States.

> Are there (m)any legal or tax consequences of becoming stateless?

The United States Internal Revenue Service (the dread IRS) will collect taxes
even on Americans abroad and on any persons or legal entities generating
income within this country, regardless of their immigration or naturalization
status.

I've heard that the IRS is the only tax collection agency in the world to
pursue such a relentless policy.

I trust this information is helpful.

Though I've not read it yet, the latest issue of _American Scientist_ 86(1)
Jan/Feb '98 has an article on longevity in humans: "Confronting the
Boundaries of Human Longevity" by S. Jay Olshansky et al.

I intend to read it today.  Skimming through it, it seems more a descriptive
summary of changes in aging via modern medicine than one of evaluating
life extension techniques.

My hope is that many of you on the list will read the article and write letters
to the authors and to _American Scientist_.  It is a way of getting nearly
free Press.  Please please please do not throw this opportunity away.

This is from the October 1997 special Transportation issue of
Scientific American page 28 "In Brief".

I thought it of interest to the list, and possibly in particular,
Extropian investors.

This was a particularly good issue, there is an article on hybrid
electric vehicles as recently discussed here.

"Immortality" Gene Revealed

Two teams of scientists-from Geron Corporation, the University of
Colorado at Boulder, and the Whitehead Institute for biomedical
research, among others-have cloned the gene for the human
telomerase catalytic protein, the "holy grail" of aging research.
This enzyme serves as a key of sorts for rewinding the celular
clock: cells that produce telemerase, such as cancer cells, are
immortal. Those that lack the enzyme have a limited life span. The
researchers hope that by having identified the enzyme, they will be
able to screen for drugs that can inhibit or activate it.
Inhibitors might prove to be highly specific and potent anticancer
agents, where-as activators may well ameliorate diseases caused by
cell death, including Alzheimer's.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

The issue of government control over health issues is difficult because
it threatens people with the use of force.  In order to discuss them in
a less threatening way a slightly different scenario may be helpful.

Imagine that you are going to live on or visit a space station.
In different stations there are different policies involving quarantine
of people who carry infectious diseases.  In some stations there is no
quarantine and everyone can wander freely.  In other stations anyone
who carries any infectious disease, even a common cold, is required to
be isolated until the disease is no longer infectious.  Other stations
take a more moderate stance, where only the most serious diseases lead
to quarantine.

There might also be stations where people are not quarantined, but where
they are required to inform others (perhaps by a low-power data transmission)
of which diseases they are carrying.

You are going to make your decision about which station to visit on the
basis of its policies in this regard.  Those stations with more restrictive
policies give you the advantage of not being exposed to as many diseases,
but if you should become infected your own mobility will be limited.  It's
a tradeoff, and you can make your own judgements about which you would
prefer.

It seems to me that I would prefer the more restrictive policies, because
by living there I would be exposed to many fewer diseases, so in practice
the chances of my becoming infected and subject to quarantine would be
small.  It's true that the consequences to me would be significant if I
should be so unlucky as to become infected, but the chances of that are
so reduced that I think this would be my preferred option.

Others can make their own decisions.  This is the extropian way.

The paragraph in which you first described this work did not
use terms like "presenting an hypothesis"; it used terms like
"comprehensive", "explanation", and "answers the question..."

If she presents a good hypothesis and shows some evidence for
it, that's great.  If she claims what you said she claims in

In Dahmer's case, I achieved it by hiring an agency of violence
(the government) to restrain Mr. Dahmer.  I would have preferred
to hire such an agency in a free market rather than having it
chosen for me by violence, but that's another discussion.  In
either case, it was necessary for me to use violence (and hiring
violence is no different from pulling the trigger or dropping the
pellets myself).  Until there's an alternative, that's the only
effective means I see.

If the claims above are Tony's claims about Ms. Miller's book
rather than Ms. Miller's claims, then perhaps it is he who should
be dismissed as a crackpot rather than her.  Having not read the
book, you are correct that I cannot make that judgment.

I do, however, stand by this particular prejudice of mine: as I
have pointed out, it is impossible to study every question that
affects your life in the complete detail necessary to make
epistemologically ideal decisions.  Human brains just can't
process that fast.  So it is useful to have heuristic short-cuts
to make most of them, and to study in more detail when the need
and/or opportunity arises.  This is called "prejudice", and it
is a valuable cognitive function.  It can also be dangerous,
especially when those prejudices are irrational ones.  

The cure for irrational prejudice is not to get rid of prejudice,
but to form more rational ones, and to understand, acknowledge,
and be honest about them, and to know when to break out of them
and study further.

I have a definite prejudice in favor of those who express ideas
with scientific skepticism, and against those who make grand
claims of solving difficult problems.  It serves me well.  There
are times when I have broken out of that prejudice to study
further.  This is not one of those times; perhaps when I have
children, and the need for more accurate knowledge of child
rearing strategies makes further study worthwhile, I might take
the time to do so.  But until then, I will continue to call
anyone who makes such gross claims as to know what child rearing
methods produce violence--or even that child rearing is the
primary determinant--crackpots.

I also recognize that this area--and other areas of psychology--
"scientific" knowledge is so scarce that "crackpot" ideas are
worth more serious study than in other fields.  I would feel just
as comfortable talking to a shaman about some psychological
problem as I would a "trained" Freudian, because I know that they
are equally unscientific, so one is as likely to succeed as the
other.

<sheesh> this was only one example, hollywood is full of people who
make a living shooting guns then walk around saying how they should
be illegal.

Politicians are even worse.

1) The suburb of Morton Grove IL announces they are banning
handguns, the news is carried worldwide,the Morton Grove council
exempts itself (including concealed carry) and the wife of the
mayor buys a handgun the next day.....

2) 1983 The city of Chicago city council makes registering new
handguns illegal, thereby effectively banning handguns within the
city limits, they of course exempt themselves, and numerous Chicago
alderman practice concealed carry......

The list goes on and on...

Since this thread is going nowhere, this is my last comment on the
matter.

Some comments on:

'The Case for Space Colonization'
                    by Daniel Ust

"There are at least two candidates for terraforming in our
          solar system, Mars and Venus.....
          One notion is the slow seeding of the target planet
          with tailored organisms to make it more and more earthlike.
          This can take a long time -- perhaps thousands of years. 
          Another proposal suggests using "fast and dirty" techniques
          such as crashing comets or forcing volcanic eruptions with
          nuclear bombs on Mars to make its atmosphere thicker."

     Venus is probably the hardest terrrestrial planet to terraform, and
will take 
the longest time. Most of its atmosphere has to be stripped off or
sequestered 
first. Just cooling it down may take centuries. Its day is 243 Earth
days long- not 
very useful, although possible to revise with orbital mirror-and-shade
systems. 
It's a nasty place.
     Mars is far and away the planet of choice, not only for early
colonization 
with existing tech, but also for rapid terraformation processes.
Crashing comets 
on Mars is probably quite unnecessary if you believe the higher end
estimates 
for permafrost mass. There is probably enough water on Mars to cover the 
planet evenly to a depth of tens of meters, perhaps up to two hundred
meters. It 
only needs to be thawed out.
This might be done with geothermal heat pipes, replicated by the
millions  (my 
proposal), simultaneously building up the atmosphere as well. This might
only 
work one time, but that is all that is needed to bump Mars away from its
cold 
cycle attractor.
     Seeding  Mars with "organisms" need not take millennia- if you are
willing to 
consider replicating machinery in this class. Depending on energy and 
hydrocarbon availability, as well as self-replication rates, this may
take a little as 
_a few months_ to achieve a planet-wide shirt-sleeve environment. Mars
also 
may have so-called "fossil  fuel" deposits similar to Earth's oil and
natural gas 
reservoirs. If not, there are plenty of  carbonaceous asteroids to
choose from, 
many resemble large blobs of coal tar.

"The posthuman alternative is to redesign humans, either
          through genetic engineering or by a machine-like fix such
          as artificial lungs that can process Martian air."

! The current Martian atmosphere is 99% CO2, useless for animal
metabolism.

        " This demands technology of a higher order than today....
         We can easily imagine
          someone adapted to a Martian habitat later being adapted to
          suit a Titanian (after Saturn's big moon) one and so on. "

This demand a far higher tech level than terraforming.

          "Next, there's O'Neill-style colonization.  (Named after G.
          K. O'Neill, "

It bugs me to see a concept named after its popularizer.

"...  Instead
          of living in a space station, whether large or small, the
          individual is redesigned to live in space by a melding of
          space suit and organism or, in another scenario, to live in
          space without a space suit.  This demands a higher level of
          technology, but the roots of it can be seen in our present
          technology."

This is very much simpler to do than the planetary environment
modifications.

          "How will it be done?....
          What modifications are necessary?  Current space stations
          are designed for short crew rotations, not as permanent
          homes. Reworking them will have to take this into account. "

Current designs do not incorporate artificial gravity. This is a must
for 
near-term permanent habitation. Modding existing would be very much
harder 
than designing new.

"To put it bluntly, since NASA isn't
          footing the bill, efficiency is not its concern.  (David P.
          Gump's Space Enterprise: Beyond NASA contains an inventory
          of what is wrong with NASA along with some rather tame
          proposals for reform.) "

To put it even more bluntly, NASA has been the main obstacle to
colonization 
for the past two decades. It is first and foremost a corporate welfare
program. 
My reform proposals start with instant and total shutdown of the Space
Shuttle 
program. Anyone who has anything to do with it should be thrown out on
the 
street, and (most important) the records burned. Note this is not so
different from
what happened to the Apollo program.

"To make things cheaper and more
          efficient, the current space programs should be privatized
          -- or at the very least laws restricting private enterprise
          in space should be repealed."

This is starting to happen after a fashion. There are more subtle forces
to deal 
with that operate, in effect, outside of the law.

"One plan
          that is still being studied is to use colonies to build
          solar power satellite stations (SSPS). These will supply
          Earth with cheap electric power.  SSPSs would gather
          sunlight, change it into microwaves and then beam these
          down to collecting antennas on Earth's surface"

This has been studied since the late '60s, it is just now starting to
make economic 
sense. The primary obstacle was and is high launch costs (c.f. NASA).

        "  Moving manufacturing to space is yet another payoff
colonists can give to surface dwellers.  This would not
          only lessen the pollution impact and the land use of
          factories but could possibly eliminate mining on Earth too."

Mining asteroids will, IMO, completely eliminate Earth mining. The ore
quality 
is very much higher, and delivery will be very much cheaper, once an 
infrastructure is in place.
See "The Interworld Rapid Transit System (A Transportation Network for
the 
Solar System)"
for some ideas on how to do this. The abstract is at
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb
The draft article should show up fairly soon. Also, Robert Forward's
company, 
Tethers Unlimited, is working on a linked tether system for Earth-Moon 
transportation using lunar dirt as the mass and energy source.  This
system can 
be enhanced to provide transport to near-Earth asteroids.

        "  Who will call the shots? Most of today's space activities,
          from launching communications satellites to planetary
          exploration, are done by government funded and run space
          programs."

This may not be true anymore. Teledesic, Iridium, NEAP, and others are
all 
private efforts. The number of LEO satellites involved is of the same
order as 
the number of .gov sat launches.

"....  Given that the larger
          corporations tend to operate hand-in-hand with the
          government -- often to curtail competition and to get
          subsidies -- this might be a problem.  The solution, for
          those interested in making sure the high frontier is a free
          one, is to try to drive government out of space.  The less
          government there is up there, the fewer favors there are to
          be handed out."

Agreed. Elements in the US gov in particular seem to be operating under
the 
delusion that they own outer space. See G. Harry Stine's "Halfway to 
Anywhere" for some horror stories.

" ...On Earth,
          as better transportation technologies become available (in
          the past, these included trains, planes, and automobiles)
          because of the limited space centralized control has been
          enhanced..."

Safety and standardization were central motives of gov regulation. Some
of this also applies to my "Interworld" proposal, unfortunately.

"...          As an example of how space can become really cheap, look
at
          all the Cold War ICBMs stockpiled.  Currently, there's talk
          of destroying them outright, but wouldn't it be better to
          sell them as space vehicles?  "

The private Conestoga rocket of the early '80s was made from a Minuteman
booster. The company was destroyed  by someone who notified some obscure
gov agency that dealt with export law. The spent booster landed in the 
Caribbean, outside US territorial waters  and was, you see, a form of
"exporting 
munitions".

My concept is for a nuclear reactor, not a bomb. The name is taken from
a movie
depicting such a device. I had considered patenting some time ago, but
have
abandoned it for several reasons. Firstly, "reducing to practice" is
very 
problematical. Many isues would have to be clarified, and I have other
things
to do. There are also much sweeter means of acheiving the same thing,
which I
might patent.

Being unnecessarily told I was being tested is unacceptable in my social

changes the system to be tested as little as possible.

I am not an attorney, but I believe that this is a libertarian pipe 
dream at the moment. As far as a know, if you go down to the State 
Department and renounce you citizenship, it will be ignored unless you 
present proof that you have become a citizen of another country. There 
is no legally recoginized entity as a "stateless person."

How about the behavior of encoding whatever one feels is
socially approved behavior into enforcible law?   How about
the very idea that "society" exists as an entity in its
own right, and is entitled to protections beyond those of
its constituent individuals?

As far as I'm concerned, there is no such thing as "socially
unacceptable" behavior.  There is behavior that individuals
seek to protect themselves from, and behavior individuals
seek to encourage.   I only have a right to complain about
behavior that potentially harms /me/, not society.

How do you reconcile the conflict here?  And isn't calling
"rudeness" a "socially unacceptable" behavior a circular
definition?

I think I'd list "politeness" for its own sake the most
destructive behavior to effective social interaction.

It's a trick question.  No one can "deem" any behavior to be socially
unacceptable. Societal norms (wholly distinct from law) develope from shared
values, tastes, and prejudices.

Some comments and personal experience with being stateless:

As everybody gets born in a place for which some territorial power structure
has a claim, each person becomes a citizen of something; the following option
is to denounce it, and then you can be treated as an ex-citizen, unless that
entity has dissolved.  I was stripped of my Soviet citizenship in 1989 as a
person who was trying to leave the country.  I didn't want to do it - it was my
country, even though it was occupied by the bad guys, bad laws, and stupidly
configured territory.  Still, there were things and people I loved there, I definitely
did more to create value there than those who took my rights away - but that's
the rule.  Anyway, this is personal and not really relevant.  
So I am now an ex-citizen of an ex-regime of an ex-country.
In U.S. I have refugee status turned into permanent residence (and the right to
obtain the citizenship which I do not hurry to execute).
I can work here, own property, travel around.  I can't vote.
Have to pay taxes, don't have to do the jury duty, or army service.
Travel to Canada takes only a driving licence, it's easy.
For travel to Europe, I need to apply for "refugee travel permit" - it probably
would be some other kind of permit for somebody who is not a refugee.

I think real problems may arise when you or the country you are currently
in, would get into some kind of trouble, as there is no authority that is
interested in protecting your interests.

All non-country-based citizenships I know of issue play-papers, nobody
really recognizes them.  Maybe  there are better ones.  I haven't really
researched it; would be grateful for some useful information.

A good thing about being stateless maybe that since there are very few such
people, the governments may not have put a lot of effort into regulating their
lives and figuring out how to take away their money.

It may be useful to start a community of stateless persons - a global "phyle"
that would protect your interests and supply you with some information - in
exchange for financial or other contributions.  What would be a good name for it?
Anybody knows the etymology of the word "citizen" ?

I would only offer one -- It should unacceptable to prejudge a
person on classifications just to remove them to an *undesirable*
mode (eg. niggers, liberals, etc.) Classification in this manner is
just a means to make you and your group *desirable* w/o offering
anything back to society.

I've kept quiet on this mailing list for awhile,  but I couldn't resist
this tempting question.

I won't dance around the question, trying to be cute by "thinking outside
the box".  I feel that it's a fairly straight forward question and deserves
a fairly straight-forward answer.

I believe the most important change that I'd make would have to do with
self-expression in public,  especially concerning children.  I've just left
an environment where children were really not allowed to express themselves
fully without the constant fear of peer-rejection and authoritative
disapproval.  Being that the future of humanity rests in children,  such as
myself,  I hate to see them being bound and limited in their behavior and
thinking.

Of course individual civil rights would play a large role in saying when
too much self-expression is at hand... who am I to say when enough is
enough?  This personal indecisiveness will probably take away from my main
point,  but I thought it was important to add that there will always be
limitations to socially-acceptable expressionism.

That's enough for now... but as for us being "tested",  I make it a point
never to trust anyone using anonymous e-mail... After all, I've got a
hotmail account as well. ;]

David is correct as far as this statement goes.

Allow me to suggest, however, that continuous improvement in the martial
arts or any other form of physical self-defence might be best deferred in
advance of first achieving the ability to engage in continuous critical
reasoning and  the ability to make broad based value judgements that are
wholly concerned with reason, social justice, equity  and devoid of
selfishness, passion and unneeded emotion.

With best wishes for the season. May the New
Year bring forth a better way of life for all beings everywhere.

Assuming you're not pulling our leg with this question...

citizen (noun) [from Middle English "citizen"; from Old French "citeein"; from Latin
"civitas", genitive "civitatis", a state, city] (according to Webster's New Universal
Unabridged Dictionary [Deluxe 2d. ed.])

I regard my body as a kind of legacy system. Though various kinds of
life extension and anti aging treatments obviously have their value,
there comes a point where the variety and proliferation of breakdowns
becomes irreversible, or too costly to continue treatment. I am not
hopeful that this mongrel body of mine can be maintained much beyond the
100 year mark.

I envision that when this cost horizon appears that the best thing to do
is to perform an upload and transfer to a newly constructed body. For
those of us enamored of inhabiting the same body, this becomes a cycle,
repeated every 30 - 50 years or so...

For interactions between adults, the only important rule is that 
taking anything from another person without their consent is 
prohibited except by order of a court on finding that the taking is 
necessary either as compensation for a taking which the other person 
has done or in fulfilment of a contract which the other person freely 
entered into.

There are no other moral imperatives for relationships between 
adults.

There are of course other issues where it is not important *what* 
behavior is accepted, but it is important that a small group of 
acceptable behaviors be defined and everyone behave appropriately.  
For example, it really doesn't matter whether you drive on the left 
side of the road, or the right -- so long as everybody else in the 
area drives on the same side.

And the responsibility of a parent to his/her child, and 
relationships involving children, are a more complex area.

        However, in most forms of day to day interaction, there is no
reason *not* to be polite; there is a substantial difference between
politeness and altruism...one doesn't necessitate the other.  Neither
politeness or rudeness will contribute to social breakdown...they are
simply two ways of looking at reality: through an optimistic, polite view,
or a pessimistic, rude view.

But of course such fuel is useless without free oxygen, and even as a chemical

I think you're being a little hard on O'Neill, the man did some original work 
and he asked a very deep question, "Is the surface of a planet the best place  
for an advanced civilization?" His answer was no, and I think he was correct. 
Besides, naming a concept for its popularizer is a tradition, 2  continents  
were named after one.

yes. Yes. YES! The space Shuttle started life as a terrible way to perform a

At one time I was a big booster of SSPS, but now I have doubts they will ever 
make economic sense in delivering power to earth, I certainly wouldn't invest 
my own money in such a venture. It's possible to transmit power by microwaves 
from 22 thousand miles, I'm just skeptical of its practicality  given the 
alternatives. If you had a sky hook things would be very different, just send
the power down a wire, but that's a project that makes even SSPS look modest.

I may be a wimp but the idea of using the Earth's atmosphere as a brake to 
slow down a large irregularly shaped asteroid to change its orbit, as some  
have suggested, scares the hell out of me. I think there will always be a lot 
of opposition to crashing any asteroid larger than a small bus to the Earth, 
and if they were that small I wonder if it would be economic. Rather than 
pushing material down a gravity well it might be better for us to climb out 
and use the resources there.

I don't see politeness as optimism at all; I see it as capitulation
to irrational standards.  Learning to use the dribble glass, as it
has been put so eloquently.  And the expectation of politeness gets
in the way of plain no-bullshit communication.

   This discussion is really disappointing me.

   Dr. Alice Miller's book is outstanding, and brilliant.  Trailblazing.

   Am I failing to explain what it is that she says so well?

  Or am I dealing with a know-nothing who can't understand basic English, 
  and is simply indifferent to resolving one of the world's most difficult 
  problems? Problems which adversely affect the achievement of extropian 
  goals and damage present and potential extropians personally?  A problem 
  which can terminate all human life on the planet, given the existence 
  of some 40 000 nuclear weapons...

  To say it again:  Dr. Alice Miller advances a hypothesis which answers 
  the question: 'How would one have to raise a child, for it to grow up to 
  be a violent adult?'

  Degrading dormouse--talk for the dormouse:  This is not the same as 
  advancing a hypothesis to explain all violent adult behaviour.

   For 'advanced' dormice: 'necessary condition' and 'sufficient 
   condition' are logically different ...

   Dr. Alice Miller's hypothesis has descriptive power (how things are); 
   explanatory power (why things get to be that way); and predictive power 
   (how things will get to be that way); and this is all we can ever ask 
   from any scientific hypothesis.  It has meaning; and it has content, 
   and -- best of all -- It's empirically testable and _falsifiable_.

   Furthermore, the thesis is painstakingly researched, with extensive 
   quotation and citation, and it is written with passion and clarity and 
   attention to detail.  It's a classic.

   Frankly, I don't know what more any scientific thesis is supposed to 
   offer.  Especially in the 'social sciences.'

   Dr. Alice Miller demonstrates convincingly that there is no shortage of 
   evidence -- the blasted German pedagogical writers wrote horrifying 
   manuals describing in appalling detail how to _torture_ children into 
   submission and plasticity.  Just as the slave-breakers did in the 
   American South.


   And the damaged children and the damaged adults are all around us, for 
   everyone to see who can bear to look at them.  Why is it that I get 
   this feeling that Lee Daniel Crocker _doesn't want to look_?
 

   Sure, we all have our 'monster-barring' screening and 'touchstone' 
   theories.  Sure, intuituion can be very valuable, not least since it 
   incorporates tacit or unarticulated knowledge.


   What I cannot understand is how Lee Daniel Crocker can be so little 
   interested in this problem.  If he waits until he has children of his 
   own, it'll likely be too late.  He'll either bring his kids up the way 
   he was brought up; or he'll make a conscious effort to bring them up 
   differently.  If he thinks he can master this subject in a few years, 
   he's simply living in a dream-world, and will believe anything.
 
   Here's my standard offer:

   Buy the book.

   Read it.  Or even have someone whose judgement you trust read it for 
   you.

   Come back to us, and if you can honestly say the book and the time 
   taken to read it were wasted for you, I'll refund the full price.

   In gold.

   And just pass the book on to someone who has a better chance of 
   understanding it, is all I ask.

I suppose that in some people's ethics there would be a problem here. 
If you live in the desert and nobody else knows you exist, and then 
somebody shoot you in the head from behind, then it seems (to much of
conventional ethics) that you have been done wrong, even though you 
are not around to complain about it and nobody else cares about you.

When you say "Nobody will feel hurt, so what's the problem?", does 
that mean that you are a hedonist? If so, then the optimal 
organization of the world might be one where there is some amount of 
emotionless AI, and the rest of the available matter is transformed 
into pleasure-maximal structures -- say simulations of 
human brains having orgasms, but highly optimized and without 
unecessary cognitive functions.

Interesting question. I think that Anders has the rule of thumb that 
an entity has rights if and only if it can demand them. That rule 
has some repugnant consequences though. It seems to imply that we 
could torture animals and butch humans who are retarded. (Perhaps the 
rule is only supposed to state a sufficient condition for having 
rights, not a necessary one?)

But then again, they may be perfectly content with watching TV, or 
looking at their navels. There might be a pill that rids them of 
their extropian urge for achievement.

BTW, we have the same problem today, with an increasing number of 
old, decrepit people vegetating away in the old people's homes. These 
people take up resources that could be used to sustain 
vibrant, productive, life-enjoying young men and women. But nobody 
seriously suggests that we massacre the old.

Yes, I think that the view that in the future values will serve as 
the principium individuationis has much to be said for it.

[snip]

I've read Miller, and having done an emotional healing workshop based in
part on Janov's "primal therapy", I think that whole approach is
basically along the right lines.  It's pretty clear that one simply
*learns* a violent way of life in a violent family, and the pain of
being constantly subjected to voilence as a child has serious repercussions
in adult life. (Everyone ought to read what Miller discovered about
Hitler's childhood.  The poor kid really did have a terribly hard time.)

But there are some complications: for example, if we're saying that
torturing kids turns them violent how come the German burgher was so
law-abiding? (Or was he? Is that just a myth? Or is it that all that
pent-up burgher's aggression burst out in two World Wars?)

19th century German pedagogical manuals are not in much use in 20th
century America, yet American society seems to be more causally violent
than 19th-20th century German society.  (Or is it?)  This would seem to
point to other factors: what could they be?  (The thesis that, for
example, in the case of Afro-American male violence, the lack of a
father in broken Afro-American homes has something to do with it, bears
examination.)

Also, consider: women who are treated that way generally don't become
outwardly physically violent - typically they turn that violence on
themselves (intense lack of self-esteem, self-mutilation, etc.)  

IOW, it seems that there's something about the male psyche under certain
conditions that leads to the male adult being more likely to reflect
childhood-conditioned violence outwards in physical form.  There does
seem to be a genetic component (i.e. males are simply by nature more
violent), and a cultural component (e.g. the "conditions" might include
lack of good male role models in childhood).

What is it about 'social justice' that requires the distinction from
plain old justice?  And, since plain old justice *wasn't* mentioned,
does that mean 'social justice' is more important than normal justice?

I see politeness as social "synovial fluid". Sometimes greasy, but functional.
Without it, imperfectly-mating (and, perhaps, "irrational") elements are
more likely to grind together. When too much of it is present, swelling,
reduced mobility and discomfort can result.

I sometimes find impoliteness in others disturbing; I am even, on occasion,
polite to myself. I regard rationality as necessary but not sufficient to
my current preferred existence. I believe I've come to this opinion
rationally. :)

Consequently, I find politeness to be practical. I do find myself wishing
things worked smoothly without it, but I wish my car didn't need oil
changes, too.

"Pleasure-maximal structures" - I love that term. I have this vision
of immense fractal megastructures forming entire dyson spheres, all
built for experiencing total bliss (not necessarily by being
passive?). A bit like the "Infinite Fun Space" that the Minds of Iain
Bank's Culture novels spend much time in.

Yes, I tend to regard it as sufficient, but not necessary. 

Recently there have been some debate here in sweden about the rights
of animals (especially after a small scandal where Peter Singer was
not allowed to speak at a conference due to his views on retarded
children (!)), which got me thinking about how we treat other entities
and what rights we give them or not. I would say that there is nothing
wrong with extending rights to other entities that cannot demand these
rights or understand them, but it is *we* who do this, there is no
natural ethics which says that certain structures should have rights
and others should not. This of course means we will draw a more or
less arbitrary line based on our own ethical system, say determined by
awareness, but there is nothing wrong with this. We cannot give every
possible system rights (is it unethical for me to eat a carrot? It is
also alive and weakly information-processing. What about the rights of
flames?), and we shouldn't give just the systems that demand rights
rights.

Of course, this doesn't solve the moustache problem. If it is a
rational moustache, it might be convinced to make a deal with its
host, but I don't know what to do with irrational moustaches.

Some of the most important sources of historical information are personal and
institutional records made public only after the death of the authors.
Effective personal immortality or even significantly lengthened personal
lifespans might well restrict the availability of such resources for
historians.  Given the obvious truth of Santayana's observation that those who
are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it, any restriction on the
availability of important historical resources should be of concern to us.

The reasons for the relationship of personal death and the richness of the
historical record are obvious.  Faced with their own imminent mortality,
historical actors have usually been more candid in their own private writings
than they were earlier in their lives.  (Of course, the self-serving nature of
personal memoirs must always be taken into account, at whatever period of a
person's life they were written.)  Knowing that they will not personally
suffer the consequences of disclosure, people are willing to instruct their
executors to make such private records public after a "decent interval", i.e.
usually after such time has passed that all who were alive during the events
recounted can be expected to have died.  Institutional custodians of records
similarly often lose interest in the secrecy of information once those alive
during a particular period have all died.  (Although the continuity of
institutions past the lifespans of individual humans has tended to offset the
"mortality-candor factor"; thus the significance of counter-examples, such as
the capture and disclosure of essentially the entire corpus of Nazi records at
the end of World War II.)  Finally, even if the author wishes to keep specific
records secret indefinitely, short of destroying them before her death, once
the author ceases to function, she simply can't stop the rummaging of
historians.

Because these factors will be significantly impacted by effective immortality,
such a development seems bound to impoverish the future historical record.  An
offsetting factor may be that posthuman beings will change so much across a
long lifetime that they may lose interest in the secrecy of records from an
earlier period in their life.  However, this factor would likely work on time-
scales much longer than the current human "three score and ten" (or really,
"four score" these days).  Furthermore, the "interpersonal privacy" factor
mentioned above will become much more complex: Since one will be able to
assume that most of the actors from a particular period in one's life are
still alive and will continue to still be alive indefinitely, disclosure of
information potentially embarrassing to one's associates or former associates
will be more difficult.

I wonder what other factors we might look to to offset the negative impact
immortality may have on historiography?  What might the long-term effect of
this restriction on the historical record be?

Maybe a human boy is worth more than a cat.  Maybe light abuse on a
human is worse than severe abuse on a cat.  Maybe the smacks were overly
severe if the boy was still complaining of pain later at school.  Maybe
the marks weren't so temporary if school officials thought the marks
were severe enough to call the police, the police thought the marks were
severe enough to arrest the man, and a judge thought the marks were
severe enough to find him guilty and issue a fine in a court of law.  Do
you have any information concerning this case that would indicate that
all these people misrepresented or misinterpretted the marks on the body
of the 7 year old boy?

And what does any of this have to do with Extropins?

Don't forget photos and witness reports.  Also, the entire thing could
have been done inside two or three days.

I consider it relevant to my long-term survival, because I'd like 
to spread memes that may bear on decreasing the amount of violence
carried forward into my future.  This particular story shows three
steps of a violence-propagation process that may have extended for
any number of steps at both ends.

The exceptional nature of WIRED issue 6.01 has been pointed out
already, I just wanted to point directly to one article of interest
to the list. "Technocracy R.I.P" by Virginia Postrel, who is editor
of REASON magazine (www.reason.com)

Heres a quote:

"Dynamists understand the limits of their own knowledge - and of
everyone else's. They see markets not as conspiracies, but as
discovery processes, coordinating dispersed knowledge. And they
worry about the way technocrats blithely trample individual efforts
and overide local knowledge."

and this one:

"Dynamists on the other hand barely know their "coalition" exists.
They share beliefs in spontaneous order, in evolved solutions, in
the limits of centralized knowledge, in the possibility of
progress."

I was impressed enough to drop her an E-mail, and give myself a
subscription as a gift.

subscription is the sincerest form of flattery.

There's no need to insult the man -- he's certainly living no more in
a world of his own devising than are most of us.  And if you think
he'll "believe anything", I'm not sure you're reading the same posts
of his that I am.

Maybe he doesn't intend to have children of his own.  In any case, 
I imagine that if he does have them, he won't torture them -- at 
least not on purpose.  I consider that my own hyper-rational 
upbringing was a torture of its own kind, that manifests itself 
occasionally in intellectual bludgeoning (I think I temper it with
politeness and other concessions to people's emotional sides, which
Lee seems to eschew -- which explains a lot).

Enough for now.

a problem here is whether the entity truly understands that he is
demanding the rights versus just parroting a demand.  In the case of
a minor child who wishes to be emancipated I believe the judge will
go through a series of questions with the child to try to determine
whether he understands all the ramifications of his request.  Perhaps a
similar thing could be done with a program, or a chimpanzee, demands to
be set free.

The reason why we have had a list rule against debating "the basics" is
so that we could share in a common set of assumptions and spend our time
exploring the ramifications and possible extensions of those assumptions.

It would be useful to consider the basic libertarian assumption of
non-coercive interactions as part of this basic set.  I realize that
this is not perfectly well defined, that people will differ about
what constitutes coercion, and the circumstances in which consent is
legitimate.  There are also classic hard cases like life threatening
situations where even libertarians may disagree about whether coercion
might be justified.

Even with all those problems, there is still a core of an idea which we
can adopt and share.  It is in keeping with extropian ideals of individual
responsibility and maximum personal authority.  To the extent that we can
structure our relationships on a voluntary, non-coercive basis, we are
all that much freer.

As it is, we spend far too much time and effort debating issues where
the real question is whether one group can force another person or group
to stop what they are doing even when it does not harm anyone else.
Sometimes this is not even clearly perceived to be the issue, and the
parties end up talking past each other.  If we could just say, "this
proposal violates the principle of non-coercion and so is best debated
elsewhere", that would allow us to focus our energies on constructive
and cooperative discourse.

I also see that questions are being answered with knee-jerk libertarian
responses which fail to address the real issue.  The issue of infectious
disease arises.  People see it as a threat of coercion, that they may be
prevented from going about their business.  So they respond negatively and
try to avoid the issue.  The issue of social conventions arises.  Again
there is an implicit threat of coercion if you don't fit the social norms.
So people respond with their knee-jerk attitude that there should not be
social conventions.

These responses ignore the real world where the laws of nature are such
that people inevitably interact in unplanned ways.  Externalities surround
us.  My visit to the grocery store causes me to inhale your cigarette
smoke, while you get to listen to my booming car stereo.  Until we have
better control over our environment (such as perfect virtual reality)
these kinds of interations will continue to be an important part of
our life.

Yes, we want to live in a world without coercion.  Let us agree on that.
We can even grant that all property is private and that whatever rules
are in force in a location are those determined by its owner.  Now "the
market will decide" what rules are appropriate in each venue.  This is
all old hat, or it should be.  But it still tells us exactly nothing
about what those rules will be, what we would prefer them to be.

I suggested a mechanism earlier to approach consideration of these
questions without this knee-jerk response of anti-coercion.  Suppose you
have a choice of "worlds" to go to (I suggested space stations, but in
a more realistic context it could be alternative grocery stores with
different policies).  Which would you prefer?  What set of conventions
for unplanned interactions do you think would be most pleasant?

Ideally there will be no point nor any need for knee-jerk libertarianism
on this list.  People can have the libertarian debate elsewhere.  There is
no shortage of places where the fundamental issue of the legitimacy of
coercion can be discussed.  There is even a saying that all debates are
really the libertarian debate: an exaggeration, but still with a germ
of truth.  Certainly most of our "basic" disagreements have revolved
around this issue.

Let's move on and try not to keep getting bogged down on this question.

Exactly, so when are we going to see Extropy break out of this
little group and go more mainstream? It's a shame that that
whole issue of Wired didn't mention us once!

IBM announced yesterday that they now have 10gigbit per square
inch magnetic media. They hope to have it in real products by
2001 (why so long?). This will fit over 6gigabytes of data onto
a single 2.5" platter. Storage costs have fallen in the last
6 years from over $5 per megabyte to 10 cents (at their current
level of around 1gigabit per square inch).

Greg Butler asks:
>"What is it about 'social justice' that requires the distinction from plain
old justice?  And, since plain old justice *wasn't* mentioned, does that
mean 'social justice' is more important than normal justice?"

Mr. Butler has asked a very good question that deserves a very good and
therefore a detailed answer.

The current civil legal system (and/or justice system) is theoretically
based primarily on the perception or goal of individual equity in
jurisprudence and protecting the rights of the individual. NOTE: As with all
political systems, it is understood (apriori) that it is flawed.
An exception -- limited though it is -- are class actions designed to obtain
equity resolutions for groups injured by an individual's wrongs. (In this
regard a corporation is considered an individual for purposes of tort
litigation.)

My concern, in this limited instance, is the hopeful expansion of the
legal -- and social paradigm -- to include the understanding that true
equity resolutions necessary for the creation of an ideal social order are
best focused on relieving (or eliminating) a society of as many of the
inequities that exist among its members as may be possible.

In the broader sense my argumentum philisophicus is that as learning and
understanding increase on a broader and broader scale with a presumed and
accompanied increase in the ability to engage in continuous critical
thinking and reasoning, actions determined by the superficiality of opinion
based on emotion (rather than reason) will decline in equal geometric
proportion.

I trust that this response will produce a serious constructive dialogue on
the improvement of the human condition.

Happy New Year to one and all,

Politeness can be optimistic, as when you assume that a person who is
behaving unreasonably (or even simply disagreeing with you), will behave
more reasonably when treated with patience and dignity.  Politeness can be
pessimistic, as when you assume an irritating situation might devolve into
violence without it.  Politeness is no more an irrational capitulation
than "obeying" gravity is.  Unless you subscribe to the fantastic Randian
assumption that there are no irrational conflicts among people, you will
have to admit the world is peopled with a number of beings at cross
purposes.  There are indefinitely many versions out there of just what
constitutes "plain" "no-bullshit" communication, many of which will
register to others as anything from tedious to outright provocations to
violence.  Civility is a spontaneous order hacked to minimize the
humiliations and discomforts provoked by this plurality of beings and
projects.  I would expect Extropians to champion good manners if only
because in the absence of them people tend to make recourse instead to
litigators and legislators.

Then I suppose I'll have to read it now.  All I was trying
to say is that your earlier description of the book made me want
to run from it.  This one makes me want to read it.  Look at
those two descriptions and you'll see why, and perhaps if you
think some other book is worthy of my time, you'll stick to
descriptions like this one.

If it's a good work, I'll look.  But when I see a label on some herb
that says "Increases energy, boosts the immune system, burns fat,
grows hair, smoothes wrinkles, and makes your children behave",
my reaction is to hold on to my wallet.

No need for the offer.  I just wanted a description that didn't
sound like a snake-oil pitch, and this one was sufficient.

I enjoyed WIRED 6.01 quite a lot, but I found it really annoying in places

juggernaut, crashing across frontiers, enfeebling national powers of
taxation and regulation, undercutting national management of interest
rates and exchange rates, widening disparities of wealth between and
within nations, dragging down labor standards, degrading the environment,
denying nations the shaping of their own economic destiny, creating a
world economy without a world polity."  I don't mean to argue basics here,
to suggest that Schlesinger's specific fears aren't misguided ones, but do
we really want to deny that changes of extraordinary magnitude are going
down and that it may be useful to talk about them and even engineer their

goes on to distinguish what she calls "stasists" from "dynamists", those
who shrink from change as opposed to those who seek change, and drawing
the ideological battle lines here seems to me to encourage a
thoughtlessness in the face of the future that is reckless and hopeless.

Sounds, in some ways, like my ancestors on the
18th-century island of Nantucket, which I was just
reading about last week. Although I have no
information on their child-rearing practices (I
suspect children were forcefully compelled to carry
on traditions, probably in ways that might be
considered 'torturous' today - in the psychological
sense rather than any kind of physical mutilation),
socially they sound similar to these German burghers. 

Nathaniel Philbrick's _Away Off Shore: Nantucket
Island and Its People, 1602-1890_ (1994) notes the
paradox that 18th-century Nantucket whalers and
traders were "some of the deadliest, most conniving
hunters the earth has ever known, [but yet] they were
Quakers, a sect that stood against war and conflict
and anything that might excite undue emotions".

Still IMO, they exhibited many extropian
characteristics for their time: disdain for remote
government and organized religion, strong
individualism, a rational and business-like approach
to most affairs - their treatment of women, Native
and African Americans was also relatively enlightened
compared to other Europeans in America at the time.

Philbrick also relates: "Nantucket had its share of
brutal and inhumane whaling captains ... by 1830 the
whalemen's debaucheries in the Sandwich Islands were
already public knowledge ... for the Nantucketer, the
whale was not so much a living, breathing creature as
it was, according to one commentator, 'a
self-propelled tub of high-income lard' ".

Yet, back on their island, while the Quaker culture
insisted on business-like manners and prohibited
public displays of emotion, at the same time it seems
to have encouraged a kind of pent-up ferocity and
intolerance toward any who did not see things their
own way.

A problem with the original question, which I
paraphrase:

"If we could re-make society from scratch, what rules
would we devise for society?"

is that it implies that there is only one society.
"Societies" are like "sets" in set theory; there are
as many different societies as you care to define.

Thus, I argue that a better question is:

"If we could begin a new society from scratch, what
rules would we devise for the society?"

Stated this way, it seems a more commonplace
question: people are creating new societies all of
the time.

Not that I don't understand the spirit and intention
of the original question, which I think was to spark
a discussion of what sort of rules a new libertarian
society would have. However, I do think that if we
pretend that we could ever truly recreate the
"society of all beings", we would be wasting our time.

!!!---!!!

Libertarians frequently forget that the rules of
existing societies are a product of memetic
evolution; that is, those rules were created for good
reasons. Some of the rules are obsolete, and some of
them were bad from the start, but we should keep in
mind that our ancestors were not idiots; their rules
got us to the brink of a transhuman existence. I
would no sooner throw out all the rules of society
wholesale than I would erase all of my DNA at once.
Life is complicated; deal with it.

Libertarians also frequently forget that people have
the following right:
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORM AND JOIN SOCIETIES IN
WHICH CERTAIN FREEOMS ARE LIMITED, PROVIDED THAT THE
LIMITATIONS ON THEIR FREEDOM DO NOT PREVENT THEM FROM
BEING ABLE TO LEAVE THE SOCIETY AFTER JOINING IT.

When people react negatively to libertarian ideas
about society, they are frequently reacting against
what they perceive to be a threat to this right. Some
people just don't WANT to "live in" a society where
people are free to use crack cocaine, for example. If
libertarian memes are to thrive, this right must be
addressed. The way to address them ultimately
involves a sort of "set theory" of societies. (They
need to define to what extent they would "live in" a
society of crack users if the laws were changed, and
whether it would be worse than the way they already
"live in" a society that includes crack users.)
Unfortunately, it becomes pretty complicated.

Well if we assume infinite (but countable) beings,
there would be Aleph-1 societies--but that's another
discussion :)

I'd like to thank Arjen, Berrie, and the other Transcedo members for the
Amazon gift certificate. I'm delighted that my suggestion of "transcedo"
was chosen, and I'm even more delighted at the resolution of the naming
issue reached with good will and mutual cooperation. Thanks also to the
kind comments posted a little while ago (while I was kept away from email
by 'flu).

I'd like to make use of the $100 Amazon gift certificate from Transcedo in
such a way as to spread the benefit. We are just days away from opening
Extropy Online, including its review section. If there's a book of
Extropian/transhumanist interest that you would like to review, let me
know, and I can use the gift certificate to buy a copy for you to review
for Extropy Online.

Onward!

Brian: Yes, it would have been good if extropians were mentioned in the
issue, but I get the impression that you are unaware of how much we *have*
been mentioned by Wired. The second issue of Wired reviewed Extropy
magazine. Not long after that they published a major article on us that
generated over 500 email messages to Extropy Institute. We have also been
mentioned several times in Wired News and on Wired Digital/HotWired,
including an exceptionally popular (judging by the number of comments)
debate between myself and my opponent (I can't remember her name right now).

Criticize me if I'm missing a key element here, but the 'solution' seems
inherent in the problem.  They're immortal.  They don't need to study
history so much, because they're the ones who lived it.  I think this
continuity of memory, presumably with high fidelity of public and one's
own private recrods, could well offset the loss of other people's
private information.  I think private decision information is much less
important than people not knowing public information.

And an economist might say other people could be offered money for their
perspectives.  First-hand historical consultants.

I have not yet read the issue, but it sounds like Postrel has a point.
Much of the opposition to progress and advancement comes from those who
fear change.  The Rifkins and other neo-Luddites seem to oppose every new
technology that comes along.  It is important to counter the view that
change is something to be feared.

Of course you are right that not all change is good.  Once we get past
the view that change in itself is threatening, we can then stand on
common ground to evaluate various possible options.  Each of us will make
their own decisions about which changes and new technologies to embrace.
Some may seem initially beneficial, like new designer drugs, or full-sense
virtual sex, but in the end may prove to be harmful.

I wrote earlier today about knee-jerk libertarianism.  Let us agree that
people are free to exploit whatever technologies they like in order to
improve their lives.  When we speak of "talking about" changes and
"engineering their flow" it is in the context of mutually voluntary
interactions, of persuasion and reason, not force and coercion.  This
provides an unthreatening context to discuss the opportunities and
dangers which change presents.

I would support a form of "dynamism" which recognizes that change is
inevitable, and that change is not to be opposed per se.  But at the same
time, within the dynamic context we still want to think carefully and
critically about the new possibilities available to us, their implications
and effects.

Yes, talk about them, engineer their flow here and there, but not
as part of a central authority.

I think you have this wrong, Statis refers to a centralized
planning authority, versus a decentralized/local knowledge way of
making decisions. Extropians are by definition dynamists.

Yes, some kind of "responsibility Turing test" might be needed. Maybe
it could consist of several scenarios the requester is confronted
with, and its actions are studied, especially when asked to predict or
extend the scenario. For example, the child might be asked "How will
you pay for food and rent if we make you an adult?". Even better would
be some kind of VR scenario where the requester experiences the
possible situations as if it had these rights, and sees their
consequences.

This is tricky. But I think it might be worthwhile, even in a limited form.

One can understand that there are inequalities of wealth, luck, position,
etc., etc., and that you might want to even those out.  But why call
this a matter of *justice* rather than matter of plain old inequalities
of wealth, luck, position, etc., etc?

Are we to take it that the produce of society as a whole is controlled
(and/or should be controlled) by some central authority - and that we
have social injustice because that entity isn't doing its job (of
distributing the produce of society equally) right?  

In response to this it must be remarked first of all that, as a matter
of plain old justice, the produce of society is already owned by the
individuals who produce it, and not by any central authority.  Secondly,
I don't see how the central authority can escape the charge of
arbitrariness.  

The purpose of law as usually understood is to keep the peace, to
resolve disputes, etc.  This is a *procedure* for which an objective
standard is needed. Why does the law now *also* have to be used as a
tool to do this totally *different* job (which has no objective standard)
of evening out social inequalities?  The one is a formal procedure, the
other is a substantive, utilitarian action: why mix them?

The thing about injustice is that it requires a perpetrator.  In the
case of the inequalities you mention, there is no perpetrator, precisely
because those injustices are *unintended* consequences of (usually) perfectly
just social interactions.

It was nobody's intention that people vary in the degree of power they
have over the world and themselves; so there is nobody to catch, bring
into a legal system, and punish.

Seems to me that the whole purpose of this concept is to justify the
initiation of force to attain one's preferred social distribution.  Only if a
matter is legal is the use of force generally seen as justified, so
social inequalities have to be insinuated to be something like the
result of a kind of "injustice" in order to have the use of force to sort
them out justified.  Quite frankly, this stinks.  In a legally free and
just society, social inequalities, inequalities in power, are *ACCIDENTAL*.
Therefore they require not a legal remedy but concerted remedial action
*within the law*, in the sense of justice as ordinarily understood.

Better simply to say that you see people born with unequal chances, or
whatever, and appeal to peoples' sense of decency to do as much as they
can to even things out voluntarily.  This sense of decency isn't a sense
of injustice except to the wooliest thinkers, but simply a desire to
lend a helping hand.

With regard to government, the best thing the government can do is
catalyse voluntary solutions, and then only in the direst emergency
"fill in the gaps".

Due to legitimate expectations, we couldn't move to a system like this
immediately, but it ought to be the ideal we move towards.

There is actually a tremendous amount of good-will out there in the
world.  All people need are efficient, workable channels for them to
pour their hearts down.  "Social justice" seekers ought, IMHO, to devote
their undoubted passion and good will to creating such channels (with
the *just* help of government, where necessary) rather than worrying the
fabric of the economic system with pseudo-legal solutions to a pseudo-legal
problem.

Social justice is the idea that its wrong for you to have more than me,
so you should either a)feel guilty about it and give me an equal share,
or b) sit peacably by while I or some third party is justified in
forcibly confiscating it from you if you don't feel guilty about keeping
what you obviously don't deserve (cause you're a selfish, insensitive,
abusive, sexist, bigoted, racist creep), and I or some third party
obviously has a much better idea of how to waste it away on my own
needs.

Justice is what happens to you when you forcibly try to prevent me or
some third party from taking from you what I feel I deserve.

I know from experience about manufacturing lead time from breakthrough
to marketplace, but 36 months is still a bit much. If they have a
working prototype now, there really isn't any reason why an organization
like IBM can't have it to market within 12-18 months. This could be an
example where they are holding introduction of technology back to
maintain commodity market value, i.e. the value of a gig of disk space.

I like the idea, but it would have to be modified.  This test
measures whether one should be extended a 'privilege', not whether an
entity should be extended a 'right'.  The two terms tend to get used
interchangeably when in fact they represent two different concepts. 
The conferrence of adult status through artifical means is a
privilege, not a right, although the conferrence of it may have a
basis in some rights, such as the right to self-determination or the
right to free passage.  (Normal growth into adulthood is not 
considered a right, although some activists are pushing for the 
recognition of exercise of reproductive functions as a right.)

The Western concept of 'rights' has never been predicated on a base
of understanding of the consequences or results of having that right,
as the concept includes the quality of inherentness.  In other words,
an entity that has rights is born/created/built with them from
inception.  Later on, as the entity grows, develops and learns,
privileges (such as operating a vehicle, holding a job or
participation in civic structures) are conferred based on that level
of responsibility. 

If this sounds confusing, one method of distinguishing a 'right' from
a 'privilege' is to ask:  is it open-ended or concrete? Privileges
tend toward the concrete and practical;  rights tend toward the
conceptual and developmental.  Another method is to consider the
causal relationship:  privileges often stem from rights, but rights
never stem from privileges.

Put politely, 'rudeness' is treating others how you think they deserve
to be treated. 'politeness' is treating others to a best approximation
of how you think they might like to be treated. Notice that there is a
significant gap in between the two. Just because you can't be polite
because your approximation of how another might like to be treated goes
beyond the limits of your ego, pride, self respect, forebearance,
whatever, does not mean that you therefore MUST be rude. Also note that
I did not mention the precept of treating others as you would like to be
treated.

As to your question about circular logic, I can easily imagine a society
where rudeness is socially acceptable. Its called America in the 90's.

While I can easily see your point that excessive politeness can be a
destructive force, I look at it as an equal and opposite destructive
force as rudeness. Taken to an extreme, either is harmful to a society.

Witness, as juxtapositions, Victorian England and 90's New York City.

WHile nuts like rifkin & company are irrational in their fear of change,
most average people have developed, through the industrial revolution to
today,  a sense that technological change is a threat to their ability
to earn an income doing what they do now, a threat to their jobs.
Remember, most people tend to be SOOO happy when they finish school and
get out into the workforce. Most tend to get into the habit of thinking
of learning something new as a pain in the butt. Just look at how union
members look at new processes, new ways of working, etc. These guys and
gals want to go to work, punch a clock and stop thinking for 8-12 hours,
punch out, go home, and watch the tv, play with the kids, get drunk, and
fornicate all night.

Due to this, anything that will make them change their set ways of being
is therefore a threat to their peace of mind, added stress in an already
stressful world. Following a path of least stress is the easiest way for
them to get through life.

THis is why the computer revolution didn't really get going in the home
market until graphical user interfaces were easy to use and affordable,
why the internet didn't get really going until easy to use graphical
WYSIWYG web interfaces became available.

WHile people want to automate their personal lives as much as possible,
they don't want to automate their workplaces so much that their jobs
will go away.

What is needed is:
a) widespread PR of studies showing that technological progress
INCREASES employment and earning power.
b) further expansion of automation of products and processes in people's
personal lives so that a generation down the road, the kids of today
will be living by the credo that tech is cool (this is already starting
to some extent here in the US). Personal life automation has been the
last area to be automated by computers. Solve this need.

It may not be Official Science, but reading Dr Miller was personally

she describes, and please consider reading it ("For Your Own Good") at
least for entertainment's sake. BTW, it has the only explanation I have

Definitely talk to the Shaman first. Freudians are full of it. And if
you need a Shaman, I happen to be one. A Shaman whose basic POV is
Scientific Materialism.

Excellent Question....

How about declaring (and legally so) that the duration of any
information is limited to a period of say, 50 or 75 years.  When a
person is revived, a backup copy is made, which can be examined by
anyone after this time interval. This includes upload conversion and
complete interviewing of the upload. Also, it might be mandated that all
persons who are immortal must make a backup copy, subject to the same
rules, at intervals of 25 - 50 years.

How to implement this is indeed a thorny problem. One way might to
provide a financial incentive for making such backups and later sell the
information they contain. I consider myself (when revived) a living
antique anyway, and my memories may well be my only salable assets...

The sensible versions I've read use solar mirrors to melt asteroid metals
in situ, then railgun standardised ingots to a relay station at one of the
earth-moon libration points, for redirection to earth (after, perhaps,
reshaping into lifting bodies).  Still pretty scary.

      It's necessary to awaken him from a stupor wheby he sleep-walks into

Yes, the two concepts are often confused, but in this case I think
the test is appropriate, because it is not testing whether or not
the right exists--it either does or doesn't, by virtue of the nature
of the thing exercising it--but whether we, the testers, will extend
the privilege of /recognizing/ that right and engaging in contracts
with the appellant.

The test is for our benefit, not his.  It tells us whether or not we
have been enslaving him, and whether it might be more profitable for
us to recognize him as free, because free men produce more than slaves.

An adjustment in one's thinking and reactions to being "exposed" would
deemphasize the affects of disclosure on one's privacy.  The longer we live,
the less affected we are by the consequences of our behavior -- in part due
to the fading of memory and also, and importantly, due to the gains in
wisdom from life experiences.

Historical recordations might rely on computers rather than author or actor
for information gathering.  Certainly, there could be on/off switches
editing out crucial facts, but will we care to edit events out when we
become more confident about our actions and less embarrassed by our pasts? 

The methodology of  historical research and presentation itself may change.
When time is not categorized by events such as wars or disease, it will be
recorded by other types of events -- the events of merit in our posthuman years.

Time itself will become abstracted. Our minds tend to still frames of our
own historical importance in our memories - one to the next - just as the
news broadcasts leading stories.  Our emotions are tied into these images
very tightly.  As we live longer and longer, we will have less and less need
to be emotionally tied to our own leading stories.  We may begin to enjoy
the pauses inbetween.  These pauses might become years and even centuries of
living with no featured "historical event" occurring.  (Much like working in
the garden, absorbed in the act of life.)  Events such as reaching another
galaxy or designing a new species might be historical events to be recorded,
and perhaps the technology producing the events might be the author also.

I do think that immortality will affect historiography. I don't think that
immortality will necessarily restrict historiography.  I do think that
immortality may change our approach to it.

My attitude is:

(1) treat people with all the respect they deserve

(2) with regard to how much respect they deserve, give people the 
benefit of the doubt

(3) some people behave in such a way as to remove all doubt.

The word Brian means is "statist".  However, the word in the message 
he is responding to is "stasist".  Rather different.

(I'd keep this private but I suspect Brian isn't the only one to

There is a problem here that far to many people fail to understand.
Ethically, we must consider the concerns and fates of our fellows if we are
to reduce if not eliminate social inequities. The issue as I see it is to
transcend our selfishness for the common good.

Can we focus on greater involvement by increasing direct participation in
government and eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome that our so-called
representative government is degenerating into?

Considering all of the millions of adults who already don't have to deal
with this question, I'd say that one is hardly applicable in todays
world. An answer of "I plan on living off welfare" is just as acceptable
as "I plan on making a killing on the stock market".

I think more applicable questions would be like:

What are your rights under the Constitution and what do they mean?
What are your ethical standards?
What do you think about another person's right to exist?
What do you understand about contract theory?

Priviledges are what big government bureaucrats call rights that
individuals demand that are not explicitly stated in the Bill of RIghts,
even though the 9th amendment restricts them from doing so.

As found at: http://www.interlog.com/~bxi/billrigt.htm :

				AMENDMENT IX

	The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall 	not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the 	people. 

THis means that the people have the right to make up any rights they
feel like, so long as the Constitution does not already enumerate them,
while the 10th amendment empowers the states to enact or restrict rights
in their own constitutions, as approved by the people under those
documents. This is why states can outlaw abortion, for example, if the
people in that state so vote.

NOTE: The tenth amendment, as seen below, is used by state officials to
deny people rights guaranteed them under the 9th amendment, even though
those states have passed no state Constitutional Amendments restricting
such rights. THis is probably the biggest source of conflict in the
Constitution.


                                AMENDMENT X

	The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States 
respectively, or to the people.

An example of this, is the concept of a driver's license as a
priviledge. Even though the Constitution guarrantees that the right to
free passage cannot be infringed by the states (interstate commerce,
etc.), the state's will argue that since they built the roads, that they
can dictate who gets to drive on those roads. They refuse to consider
that since the state roads have paved over and across everything else,
it is almost impossible for a person to drive a vehicle anywhere NOT on
state roads, so the state has a monopoly on roads, and therefore on free
passage. refusing to grant a driver's license is refusal of right of
free passage...The same applies to state regulation of aviation and
water travel.

Only to adherents of Natural Law doctrine. For those who go by the force
doctrine, any body politic can exercise whatever rights it is willing to
fight and die for. Those that it fails to express such interest in
protecting typically are atropied by the encroachment of tyrannical big
government bureaucrats on the whole, by corporate masters in the
workplace, and by fellow citizens in the everyday.

Priviledges as stated above, tend to be those rights that not enough
interest can be generated in to guarrantee by Constitutional decree, or
that atrophy over time. Gun ownership, privacy, and voting seem to be
rights that are most noticably atrophying this decade.

Being a cat lover and having W.C. Field's attitude towards most kids, 
I'm on the father's side. It's a good thing there is a statute of

remember my father belting me, and for good reason, on several 
occasions. And guess what? It did not warp me for life. I have very 
little patience with these "new age" type of parents who try to "reason" 
with their little brats while the little darlings are going on 
sociopathic rampages. Sometimes a few swats on the butt are just what is 
required to get the message across that the child's behavior is not 
going to be tolerated. Child abuse, my butt (pun intended).

Now it's getting too complicated for the average parent. What we need is
"punishment processing factories" where children are given punishment by
trained professionals.

These factories could also act as a societal syphon for all the saddists
out there. I think murder and rape rates would drop substantially if
such people could vent their anger on small children.

Incredibly, Abraham Moses Genen wrote this bullshit on the list:

"There is a problem here that far to many people fail to understand. Ethically,
we must consider the concerns and fates of our fellows if we are to reduce if
not eliminate social inequities. The issue as I see it is to transcend our
selfishness for the common good.

"Can we focus on greater involvement by increasing direct participation in
government and eliminating the "them vs. us" syndrome that our so-called
representative government is degenerating into?"

Is this guy for fucking real?

Are you sure there are --?

You know what? What does it take to get a mailing list started? is it demanding
on your hardware? What software is required? We need a fucking dedicated and
moderated extropian and libertarian list to get rid of this bullshit! I don't
find this crap funny at all!

Oh, let me guess: "You need Unix to run a mailing list; can't do it on

You're right, our current "justice" system is based on equality, that's why 
it produces very little justice. A virtue is something that should be 
maximized and that's why equality is not a virtue, unlike knowledge or 
intelligence or happiness or justice you can have too much equality.

Now why would you want to say a silly thing like that? Equal justice for all 
is a terrible idea because then justice would become a public good and nobody 
would get much of it. A public good is something  beneficial that because of 
it's nature must be provided to the entire public or it can't be provided at 
all. Universal clean air and water are 2 examples of a public good and we 
don't have universal clean air or water. A good law is also a public good and 
that is exactly why good laws are as rare as hen's teeth when government 
makes the laws. A true public good is impossible to produce in quantity under 
any system. Justice is no different than anything else, if you want to 
maximize it, make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. A good car 
is not a public good, it's a private good, even if everybody doesn't have one, 
even if I'm the only one on earth who has one, it's still a good car. The way 
society is currently set up, private law is not allowed so a good law is 
always a public good, everybody must obey exactly the same good law. That's 
why there are so many more good cars than good laws. This also explains why 
governments don't legislate themselves out of existence, doing so would be a 
public good.

Although... if I launched parallel threads to write messages, terminating
the threads on completion of each task... years and millions of messages
later, I'b be no better at writing messages. Since none of the writing
experiences would be with my core thread, I might even be progressively
worse over time.

Also, if I (as a a sequential thread) were to consider a given task fun or
interesting I would want to undertake the task myself (no forking),
experiencing and reinforcing the activity, thereby changing my internal
state. Naturally, I would want to fork parallel threads to complete less
interesting tasks, and optionally terminate the threads upon completion.
For a single long-lived thread I think over-specialization could occur as
the "interesting" tasks were pursued, experienced, and reinforced... and
other less interesting tasks were delegated. The problem is that the forked
parallel threads would be progressively specialized as well and would be
increasingly ineffective/inefficient at caring out the less interesting
tasks. Many self-directed threads would come to rely on foreign threads for
those tasks they could no longer perform efficiently (so a market for
services would have to exist... and a currencies).  Many specialized
threads would frequently dead-end in their usefulness and expire. The
catch: the highly specialized threads would be the most efficient at
performing a given task. Ouch. The super-specialized threads might be
narrowly focused enough to be considered non-sentient automatons.

Launching and terminating threads to carry out certain tasks presents some
interesting possibilities. One application of this would be in generating
self-diagnostics. You could submit your forked copies to a battery of
tasks/tests and analyze the outputs to quickly identify areas that require
improvement, for example.

Other things come to mind, but I'm getting way out on a limb here.

Ah.  Yes.  Then the entity has no real incentive to engage in such a
test, because it is fraudulent.  It claims to *confer* rights, when
in fact no one can confer a right.  In fact it actually confers
*recognition* of a right, a status that the entity could claim by
other means, given enough time and resources.

Under a human rights paradigm, if the entity perceives that he has
been enslaved, then it/he/she has probably been living under
conditions of slavery.  If others cannot figure out whether they have 
been oppressing someone, the easiest method of finding that out would 
be to ask the entity, and to actually listen to the response, however 
difficult it may be to listen to.  Setting up a test to do so only 
shows that what the entity thinks and feels has been demoted in favor 
of the standards of a third party.

I didn't think you were confusing the terms stasist and statist myself,
*however*, part of my objection to the Postrel article is that *she* seems
to conflate the two herself.  She implies at the beginning of the essay
that the metaphor of building a bridge to the future contains the implicit
assumptions that there is one right future and that only a Big State is
capable of building it.  I simply don't agree with this.  I think one can
retain the belief in the desirability of the political process of getting
people to work in concert to build a bridge to a better future without a
coercive state to underwrite the project.  In fact, I suspect that without
the foresight and effort of a little conscious bridge-building we won't
arrive in a future we want in the first place.  Postrel's injunction
seemed to me to be too "don't worry, be happy."  In fact, the overall
spirit of the WIRED volume nudged in the same direction, despite its many
delights. I refuse to be tarred with the brush of either statism *or*
stasism just because I think it makes sense to think what we are doing.

I know from experience about manufacturing lead time from breakthrough
to marketplace, but 36 months is still a bit much. If they have a
working prototype now, there really isn't any reason why an organization
like IBM can't have it to market within 12-18 months. This could be an
example where they are holding introduction of technology back to
maintain commodity market value, i.e. the value of a gig of disk space.

   Welcome to the wonderful world of corporate welfare. Even in 1997,
when people think technology is moving as fast as possible, the
incestuous relationship between government and big business is
essentially removing real competition from the marketplace and
slowing technology to an almost painful pace to those who are aware.
   To become "aware" takes a great deal of work and research but
it's so much easier to make fun of "that guy who always brings up
Neo-Tech--you know that new age money making scam"(usually
quoted by people who like to skim over a few pages of a philosophy
hoping to feel a "warm fuzzy" inside.) 
   For those of you that have the fortitude for a philosophy where 
thinking is necessary during *and* after reading it I recommend
http://www.neo-tech.com. Order and read in it's entirety _The
Neo-Tech Discovery_ by Frank Wallace. All the crazy puzzle pieces
of this civilization will then begin to fit together.

Or because the country that built it no longer exists.
Mir presents an interesting oppoertunity for privatization: its 
components will (stupidly!) not be used in the new International 
Space Station, though the Russians did propose and push for this. They
are accustomed to reusing gear; some of Mir's equipment was salvaged
from
Salyut 7 (?), the previous station, and hence is older than Mir itself.
Mir might be abandoned in place, a fully functioning, proven habitat
only
11 years old. It would make a great construction shack.

Yeah, just what we need, another Space Shuttle (paraphrasing a leading
Caltech dept. head).
Ned Seeman is making octohedral, dodecahedral, and other DNA these days,
with
stronger joints and "tabs" of single-strand DNA at the vertices for
connecting units together.
Carbon nanotubes also make transistors, quantum wires,
variable-electronic-
property devices (depending on how much they are bent), "plumbing"
components (elbows, reducers, tees, crosses, etc.).

> Any predictions for 1998? 

We will see hybrids of silicon/molecular machinery this year.
Lithography-
like (and unlike) processes will produce 10nm features across cm^2 dies.
Light wavelength barriers for photolith will be obviated in the process.
Private rockets will reach free orbit (X-Prize claimed).

Hmm, I don't seem to have made myself clear.  I have no objection to
your whipping us up into moral action; what I object to is the
nonsensicality of the concept "social justice" to describe what you are
aiming for as a result of all this social action.

The result you are after - that we all get together and do something
about our less fortunate fellows - that's fine.  However, to describe
this as bringing about a form of "justice" seems to me to be daft: since
the distribution of goods is largely accidental, ie. nobody is to
*blame* for it, how can it be a matter of *justice*?

In fact doing so obscures the morality of helping.  Instead of an act of
charity, we are to call our giving of aid an act of *justice*? 
Puh-leez.

This seems to me exactly right.  It's true that some people fear change on
principle, but as you say, change is inevitable; at any rate, too many
people are too invested in particular changes that benefit them for any
stasist conspiracy to roll back the trajectory of technological
development wholesale.  My impression is that Postrel was actually trying
to repackage libertarianism for the WIRED audience, and that part of the
problem is that libertarianism in its traditional (American) form is
probably inadequate to the future that WIRED and extropian communities are
sensing around the bend...  Postrel writes:  "What dynamists do agree on
is protecting processes rather than trying to engineer outcomes."  This
seems to me dangerous nonsense at best.  Even the project of maintaining a
market order is engineering an outcome as much as protecting a process
(especially considering the highly institutionally and legislatively
mediated things that pass for "markets"  these days).  If it really is the
case that extropian transhumanism aspires to be a kind of movement (as
opposed to just a meeting-place for folks who seem to share certain
idiosyncratic preoccupations), then I hope it hangs its hat on something
with more ideological teeth than the vacuous "change is good."

Well, certainly.  My point is that it isn't only statists who talk about
this kind of engineering, and also that I hope to see extropians talking
more like such engineers than like Postrel does (though I fear we often do
sound a bit like Postrel).  What I'm talking about here is *mimetic*
engineering. You know, *rhetoric*.   Not State injunctions or anything
like that.

This may be.  But change as such is an empty sign.  If extropians aren't
*more* than just dynamists then they aren't defined as anything at all.
There's more to extropian transhumanism than "Change Is Good."  There's
even more to extropianism (I hope) than "God is dead," "Smash the State,"
"Self Reliance," and "TANSTAAFL," but at least that's getting closer.

Maybe we should think of developing a tool of combatting future or now
chock? Some way of getting an overall feeling of what is
happening. History once served that purpose (and still work in many
areas) but when it comes to the technological changes we need
something new.

"Only some DIY refurbishing needed". I think Bruce Sterling wrote a
short story about the last ageing russian cosmonaut on Mir, who eventually
got some new neighbors as people from the stratospheric colonies moved
in.

Not to mention that one can show that there exists an isomorphism
between the different kinds of DNA and the regular languages of
computer science (things like that keeps hacker esthetes like me
happy).

> We will see hybrids of silicon/molecular machinery this year.

Yes, I think this will be the next big thing. The in-your-pocket
pathogen analyser using mini-PCR and DNA-chips I discussed on another
thread seems to be feasible, the biomedical researcher I talked with
tonight didn't see any problem, except that she didn't believe there
was a market for it :-)

What I would like is a molecular film that acts as a cellular
automaton. Maybe we could use the microtubule units?

When my resources are involuntarily contributed to others without
reasonable recourse, this to me is "government". Private enterprise has
to deal with the fact that the customer can always go to the
competition, which is not true with most forms of "government". All
"government"s end up being a "them vs us" situation eventually.

How about eliminating "government" and privatising its functions. Can
you say the word "libertarian"??

"My father hit me, so this is good child rearing" - Exactly the cycle we
must break. I have NEVER had to use any kind of violence to "get the
point across" with my son. How about learning some SKILLS instead of
continuing the violence you have been TRAINED to perpetrate?

It may not be Official Science, but reading Dr Miller was personally

she describes, and please consider reading it ("For Your Own Good") at
least for entertainment's sake. BTW, it has the only explanation I have

Definitely talk to the Shaman first. Freudians are full of it. And if
you need a Shaman, I happen to be one. A Shaman whose basic POV is
Scientific Materialism.

Excellent Question....

How about declaring (and legally so) that the duration of any
information is limited to a period of say, 50 or 75 years.  When a
person is revived, a backup copy is made, which can be examined by
anyone after this time interval. This includes upload conversion and
complete interviewing of the upload. Also, it might be mandated that all
persons who are immortal must make a backup copy, subject to the same
rules, at intervals of 25 - 50 years.

How to implement this is indeed a thorny problem. One way might to
provide a financial incentive for making such backups and later sell the
information they contain. I consider myself (when revived) a living
antique anyway, and my memories may well be my only salable assets...

I've played around with a animated planner, and with a 3D chart
that shows interlinks between various technologies. The animation is
particularly interesting, one can show future projections as 
semi-transparent objects, with surface properties based for instance 
on the degree of likelyhood, importance, field, applications, etc. It 
gives a more "gut' feel for progress than a 2D chart.

What for? How small a unit cell? How many (how few, actually)? 
Is there a market for this that cannot be filled with projected
Si 'von Neumann' chips?
What film thickness would you like?
What good is a microtubule? It has to be in water, no?

Any other ideas for thin-film, nearly nanotech products?

The sensible versions I've read use solar mirrors to melt asteroid metals
in situ, then railgun standardised ingots to a relay station at one of the
earth-moon libration points, for redirection to earth (after, perhaps,
reshaping into lifting bodies).  Still pretty scary.

But there is such a tool: Science Fiction. SF is currently the best
way I know of to explore the social consequences of technological
change. The problem as always is that appreciating SF generally requires
more scientific background than the general public is willing to
acquire. However, even SF for the masses, such as Star Trek, is
a better window on the future than nothing.

Hmm, I wonder.  Since I used it in THE WHITE ABACUS, written before I
joined this list or read any of Forrest's intriguing papers, I guess it
must have been in Bob Forward or Jerry Pournelle or one of their epigones.

I'd rather not.  We need a more nuanced understanding of the social and
political institutions necessary to maintain civilization in the face of
the future (can you say the word singularity?) than libertarianism tends
to provide, imho.  Smash the state, sure, but then what?  While
privatizing and pluralizing functions presently performed (mostly
brutally, always badly) by monolithic governments will definitely
eliminate the State, nothing will eliminate government.  I read David
Friedman's _Machinery of Freedom_ as a sketch of (some of) the kinds of
institutions of rational governance that are likely to survive the
dissolution of the nation-state over the course of the next half-century,
rather than as a recipe for eliminating government altogether.  It is
useful to distinguish the notion of government as a word for the practices
and institutional arrangements that emerge to deal with discord and
articulate the flows of meaning, value, and force among a plurality of
actors, and State as the word for the fiction that some one institution
can be assigned this task by maintaining a monopoly on the "legitimate"
recourse to physical force.

It is useful in chemical engines (rocket, IC engines, fuel cells) when combined 
with free O2,
which of course has to be liberated first. Chemical energy is a fairly compact 
storage system. 
More importantly, HCs are more economical (less energy) for standard (current) 
chemical processes, as well as for a nanotech feedstock.

The *operating cost* of one single Shuttle launch is enough to fund an entire
new generation of cheap boosters.

It's iffy, but still a contender. Lower launch costs and ultra lightweight cells
might tip the scales. Another proposal I like is to simply pave the Moon with cells
made from native material. This would need a powerline running part way around
the Moon, to use the cells on the far side during new Moon. My proposal here is
to use a Mass Drivers (or such) to launch and receive masses. The power is 
transmitted in the form of kinetic energy.

There is a certain similarity, as a large majority of people want at 
least some change -- they want to be more prosperous themselves -- 
and it will take a big government to hold them all down.

If the bridge to the future is a government project, it will fall 
behind schedule and the rest of us will get there first.  Hm... 
sounds like an interesting idea...
