After examining this page, which seems to me like its main market would be porno
site marketers, and discussing the concepts behind it, we (myself and Jason
Dahlstrom) decided that it would be just as easy to create a script that would
allow their customer's competitors to bust the script and snag their 'optimized
HTML file' by the competitor spoofing the IP of a search engine spider when
browsing to the Food Script using website. The Food Script will only be
effective so long as search engines maintain the same IP addresses. If they set
up a system to rotate a large block of IP addresses from which their spiders are
deployted over time, they will beat this script at its own game.

It might be useful for search engine companies to set up cooperative agreements
with web servers all over the web to bounce spiders from as many IPs as
possible. A two pronged approach like this would help limit the garbage
infecting the search engines....

You'd really think that some of the search-engine folks would have
learned to recognize the characteristic repeated pattern of fake
keywords and give the user an option to screen out any site that moronic.

In any case, I've never run into false matches generated by fake
keywords.  If I did, it would be easy enough to exclude them entirely: 
Find a fake keyword you're not looking for and exclude that.

Do people really generate hits that way?  This sounds like an
(admittedly hackworthy) way to prevent competitors from stealing a
stupid Web trick that doesn't work.

Our productivity is directly dependant of our technology. Technology in my
terminology consist of both hardware and methods. If we improve either, we
get a better productivity.

The interresting thing comes when you realise that the methods are not
entirely in the human domain. After a while when you know them, you can
implement them in software/hardware. Thus you have a much improved
technology.

I am a firm believer that The productivity of a person is like this:

the persons skills * the technology he uses = The persons productivity

A carpenter with a hammer might be able to hammer in 10 nails a minute. The
same worker with a nailgun might be able to hammer in 100 nails a minute.

This effect is especially interresting when we notice that for all of us
working with computers there is an exponential growth in the power of our
tools.

At one time or another this will influence every kind of bussines we know
of. Whenever there is some kind of method that can be implemented in
soft/hard-ware it will be done around the time when the computers are
powerfull enough to handle them. Right now this is happening to the music
industry, in a few years it will happen to Television and soon thereafter it
will happen to the moviebussines. The debate about MP3 going on right now
will soon be about movies.

A lot of jobs will dissapear when the technology reaches the right levels.
The bank teller is allready on the way out. A lot of people in the public
sector answer telephones and tells people something they find on their
computer systems. They are in effect hired to read up loud from a computer
screen! This will naturally be automated.

For many jobs it is possible to predict pretty precisely when it will happen
if Moore's law will hold up.

For the rest of us working with computers, the hard part is deciding the
amount of time that we should spend producing things vs. the amount of time
we should use learning new stuff. (If I work hard at my current job I will
get a quick bonus here and now and be considderd productive. But in the
"long" run I will fall behind technological. If instead of working hard I
use my work time learning new stuff, I will be even more productive in the
future and will be worth more in the long run. This way I can get an even
bigger salary when I find a new job because my current company is
unsatisfied with my productivity :-) )

A curious side effect: Anyone claiming that you don't have to learn
computers now because they will soon be much simpler is really missing the
point. It might be easier to do a single task in the future, but you will be
expected to be able to do many more tasks. So actually it will probably be
even harder to use computers in the future as you a required to know and
understand many more fields of labour.

Kind regards

Seems to me that by now the Spammers have reached our shore .... I had
three mails offering various "services" in my inbox this morning. Two
came from this listserver. Perhaps the access to post in this group
should be restricted to registered members of the mailing list. Should
be possible.

Some years ago, when commercialization hit the net, I hoped that this
would pass just like bad weather. Seems I was wrong. Each time I think
that ba now it's enough, some freaks discover a new way of making the
net more annoying. As I seldom use search engines, I did not recognize
by now that they are SPAMmed too. The newsgroups, though, have to be
considered obsolete.

What to do? I recently read that the US government, pushed by the
lobby of SPAMmers, wants to legalize SPAM. SPAM is illegal today, but
things seem to change. Let's hope that this won't happen.

Perhaps it would help if anonymous accounts would be banned from
newsgroup posting. Perhaps it would help it mail services like gmx or
bigfoot would not allow mass mailings AKA SPAM. I recently tested gmx
and found out that it is no problem to make some easy mass mailings
from their system.

The actual plan of the European parliament shows us some more drastic
way to stop the SPAM flood from the US: If the US servers allow SPAM
to be sent over the net, the transatlantic connection can be cut! This
would cut the European net from the rest of the world, but it would
also stop most of the SPAM!

The most efficient way to avoid this junk would be the capitalistic
one: Allow mass mailings, but let the dumb ass who wants to send them
pay all the costs to post and transmit them. That would definitely
help!

Wearables will become popular when they can be bought for less than a
desktop machine, provide web browsing, vr chat, personal organizing,
video conferencing, and personal documentary. Oh, and can play music at
high quality.... replace the walkman.

My understanding is that the phenomenon is real, but it only occurs with
certain types of questions.  It works if the average person's answer is
fairly close to the correct one, because the errors tend to average out.
Otherwise it doesn't work at all - it just gives you a read on what the
conventional wisdom is, which doesn't necessarily have anything to do with
reality.

Sounds great, but isn't it overkill?  If you can replace your walkman, cell
phone and pager with a device that also acts as a personal organizer, you
should have a marketable product.  You can add the fancy multimedia features
later, as hardware prices come down.

This is allready happening. Linux is happening in a big style in embedded
systems right now.

http://wearables.stanford.edu/ The worlds smallest webserver ....

A week ago I was musing to my friends about how expensive streaming media
servers are right now. I figured that soon we would have them at home at our
home networks, so all that we would need to watch any tv channel, or hear
any radio channel or watch any of our DVD/VHS movies anywhere in the house,
would be a flat screen computer. I had no idea that the first place we would
get a Linux media server would be in our cars:

http://www.mpeg.com/main.html car radio and MP3 player. Running on top of
Linux

Besides I have just read about a new device, that would act as MP3 player,
organizer, dictaphone, calendar etc. and it shouldn't cost a lot ($150 i
think was the price)

http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/mpthree/story/17576.html

But anyway ... the wearables are comming ...

     They have got to be the ultimate communications device particularly
if 

     we can get them down to gnat-size.

     

     Bandwidth is the obvious constraint at the moment but somewhere 

     between satellite LEOS (v2.001k), cels G3 and perhaps the next
generation of GSM we must be getting close.

     

     When brainstorming some possible applications I got :-

     

     - great bootleg concert webcasts

     

     - the ultimate "wish you were here" realtime digital postcard

     

     - great personal security & deterrent device

       " Patch me thru to McGarret! ...  Book Him Danno"

      & if your server is down , get a digital mugshot (the Web's Most
Wanted?) 

     

     - we could all be special correspondents for CNN - no thanks !

     

     - & now for the nice stuff

        perhaps share your precious moments ( mountain top sunrises?)
with loved-ones  

        &/or the world

     

     And for those really mega-events (perhaps the dawn of the 

     new-millennium somewhere near the DateLine in a Pacific paradise) a
good proportion of 

     the populace could come close to a feeling of being part of that
often 

     dreamt about,  ultimate good-vibe of universal consciousness.

     

     I'd love to get some dialog going on WWVs and where they may take
us.

What to do?

1.  Join us on spam-l

2.  Lobby your state senators/representatives for strong anti-spam
legislation in your state which includes prison time for
knowingly/intentionally transferring the cost of advertisement from
the sender to intermediate networks and the end users.  Class C felony
would do the trick.

3.  Follow up on and complain to the upstream providers of every spam
you receive.  Do not "just press delete."

4.  Pressure your ISP to use the MAPS Realtime Blackhole List as well
as ORBS, DSSL, ORCA anti-spam listings on their mail server.

For a start...

Seems to me that by now the Spammers have reached our shore .... I had
three mails offering various "services" in my inbox this morning. Two
came from this listserver. Perhaps the access to post in this group
should be restricted to registered members of the mailing list. Should
be possible.

Some years ago, when commercialization hit the net, I hoped that this
would pass just like bad weather. Seems I was wrong. Each time I think
that ba now it's enough, some freaks discover a new way of making the
net more annoying. As I seldom use search engines, I did not recognize
by now that they are SPAMmed too. The newsgroups, though, have to be
considered obsolete.

What to do? I recently read that the US government, pushed by the
lobby of SPAMmers, wants to legalize SPAM. SPAM is illegal today, but
things seem to change. Let's hope that this won't happen.

Perhaps it would help if anonymous accounts would be banned from
newsgroup posting. Perhaps it would help it mail services like gmx or
bigfoot would not allow mass mailings AKA SPAM. I recently tested gmx
and found out that it is no problem to make some easy mass mailings
from their system.

The actual plan of the European parliament shows us some more drastic
way to stop the SPAM flood from the US: If the US servers allow SPAM
to be sent over the net, the transatlantic connection can be cut! This
would cut the European net from the rest of the world, but it would
also stop most of the SPAM!

The most efficient way to avoid this junk would be the capitalistic
one: Allow mass mailings, but let the dumb ass who wants to send them
pay all the costs to post and transmit them. That would definitely
help!

Your argument is a perfect example of my point: why would any pro-anonymity 
site call anonymous posters "cowards"? Otherwise, I can only wonder how 
you've missed the interminable "Let's ban all the anonymous posters now!" 
discussions which come up every few weeks, normally with backing from those 
who run the site. Take a look through their archives sometime.

Regarding the IP Food Script website that Sasha pointed out yesterday, I
was digging into my library here, and I came across a script that I
wrote with the help of a guy on the Experts-Exchange, as follows:

#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Location: ";

# Look for their hostname or IP address. Each if-else query checks the
browser to see if it
# is originating from the site of one of our competitors. You can create
a new entry simply by
# adding a new if-else sequence with the new competitors domain name and
dns address.

}

 {print "http://www.datamann.com/sorry.html\n\n";
}

}
else{

# if the browser does not meet the above criteria, they then are let in
as follows

 print "http://www.datamann.com/welcome.html\n\n";
}

This obviously was designed to prevent our competitors from seeing our
website.... The same commands are probably used in that IP Food Script
that we discussed the other night, as a means of providing the search
engines the desired optimized page....

So essentially, to beat the IP Food Script, a bot has to deploy to
another host server that is not on the Food Script hit list, then query
the page to be indexed. If you are a competitor, just spoof the host IP
of a search engine spider on your own server, then query the 'optimized
HTML page'.

Have you seen my list of mailing lists?
<http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/lists.html>

I tried to create a comprehensive directory of good
lists, hoping that more people cross-subscribe to them
and help carry good memes around faster - an early
memetic engineering effort of mine, can't tell how
well it worked.  But it's a good list.

Let me know if you want me to add, remove, or
annotate any entries there.

The problem is that there is less demand for such a thing than you might
imagine.  The Nokia 9000i is essentially what you've described, yet in
Nokia's After Market Services, we get only about one a day in for repair
or other work.  Of course, this could be taken as a sign that they are
extremely reliable in comparison to other cell phones, but I don't know
whether that is true.

The fact that they have already come up more than once seems to 
favor my point of view. :)  I just noticed them this last time, but as no
action was taken, I didn't think much of it.  Actually, without your 
assertion that those who run the site back the idea of eliminating
anonymity, I would have assumed that "Anonymous Coward" was
self-depreciative humor.

Uh, which law, exactly, makes spam illegal, and in which countries? At the
moment various aspects of spam may or may not be illegal (e.g. fraudulent
forgery of email addresses, denial of service, etc), but not the actual
act of spamming.

Sounds about the level of intelligence of the Eurocrats; if you don't like
spam, cut all Europeans off from the rest of the Net. Geez.

And even if that proposal wasn't totally absurd, much of the spam I've
received in the last couple of months claims to come from Russia and
China...

Boy, I'm glad to see Extropians arguing for free-market solutions to
problems rather than calling in big brother every time someone annoys
them.

Look, as someone who's had to deal with asshole spammers sending out
literally millions of messages with a forged unicorn.com return
address, I have more reasons than most to support the death penalty for
spammers. But these kind of proposals are absurd authoritarian solutions
to a minor problem which will destroy most of our freedom on the Net in
order to potentially save a few minutes deleting garbage from our
mailboxes. 

Frankly, the worst problem the Net faces is not spam or web abuse, it's
the dumbocratic idiots jumping in to sacrifice out freedoms to their big
brother solutions to minor problems; as with the Slashdot folks arguing
to ban anonymity so they don't have to read so many flames.

I'd like a wearable one that I could activate on demand if the

would presuppose an uplink to some service that would monitor and

There is a well known prediction/estimation technique called Delphi
forecasting, which dates back to the 1960s.  It is designed to get an
improved group estimate.  Here is a description, from:
http://horizon.unc.edu/projects/seminars/futuresresearch/stages.asp#forecasting

: First, no participant is told the identity of the other members of the
: group, which is easily accomplished if, as is common, the forecasts are
: obtained by means of questionnaires or individual interviews. When the
: Delphi is conducted in a workshop setting-one of the more productive
: ways to proceed in many cases-this rule cannot be honored, of course.
: 
: Second, no single opinion, forecast, or other key input is attributed
: to the individual who provided it or to anvone else. Delphi
: questionnaires, interviews, and computer conferences all easily
: provide this protection. In the workshop setting, it is more difficult
: to ensure, but it can usually be obtained by using secret ballots or
: various electronic machines that permit anonymous voting with immediate
: display of the distribution of answers from the group as a whole.
: 
: Third, the results from the initial round of forecasting must be collated
: and summarized by an intermediary (the experimenter), who feeds these
: data back to all participants and invites each to rethink his or her
: original answers in light of the responses from the group as a whole. If,
: for example, the participants have individually estimated an event's
: probability by some future year, the intermediary might compute the
: mean or median response, the interquartile range or upper and lower
: envelopes of the estimates, the standard deviation, and so forth, and
: pass these data back to the panelists for their consideration in making
: a new estimate. If the panelists provided qualitative information as
: well-for example, reasons for estimating the probabilities as they did
: or judgments as to the consequences of the event if it were actually to
: occur-the role of the intermediary would be to edit these statements,
: eliminate the redundant ones, and arrange them in some reasonable order
: before returning them for the group's consideration.
: 
: Fourth, the process of eliciting judgments and estimates (deriving
: the group response, feeding it back, and asking for re-estimates in
: light of the results obtained so far) should be continued until either
: of two things happens: The consensus within the group is close enough
: for practical purposes, or the reasons why such a consensus cannot be
: achieved have been documented.
: 
: In sum, the defining characteristics of Delphi are anonymity of the
: estimates, controlled feedback, and iteration. The promise of Delphi
: was that if these characteristics were preserved, consensus within the
: panel would sharpen and the opinions or forecasts derived by the process
: would be closer to the "true" answer than forecasts derived by other
: judgmental approaches.

Is this really a solution in keeping with Extropian philosophy?  Do you
want to throw people into prison because they sent you some information
which you didn't want to receive?

I see serious problems in making unsolicited commercial email illegal.
It sets a number of dangerous precedents.  Email is a protocol which
we voluntarily engage in.  Spammers are using the protocol in a manner
in which we allowed but did not intend.  Throwing people in jail for
this is going to mean that using any information protocol in the future
will be fraught with danger.  There will be gray areas in terms of what
is intended and what is not intended, and it ends up making the laws
capricious and enforced at the whim of judges and prosecutors.

There is also the problem of providing different rules for commercial
and personal email.  Presumably we don't want to throw someone in jail
because he sends a personal, unsolicited email, to someone else.  It is
only "commercial" unsolicited email that we want to criminalize.  But we
can't draw a clean line between the personal and commercial aspects of
our activities.  Especially in the future, I believe we will be able
to have more autonomy and independence in how we structure our lives,
so that what we do personally and commercially may not be so different.

Every posting I make is an advertisement for me.  I have gotten jobs
in the past based solely on people having read my postings on various
topics and deciding that I am knowledgeable and write well.  As we
become more of an information economy this will become much more common.
If spam is criminalized, I might be thrown in jail just for responding
to a question which was widely posted.

The EU has privacy laws which require companies not to remember
certain things about their customers.  I'm not sure how they apply to
individual businessmen.  Do these laws claim to regulate the contents of
people's minds?  Is it only in the commercial sphere that people must
be forgetful?  What will happen when people are able to extend their
own memories with technological aids?  The philosophy of this approach
is completely misguided.

I would prefer to see methods which address the problem directly within
the framework of the protocol, based on technology, rather than threats
of prison.  Filtering and blocking systems are becoming available, and
if unsolicited commercial email continues to grow as a problem, they
should improve in sophistication and capability.

Frankly, I don't think UCE is that bad a problem right now.  I get 200-300
pieces of email a day, and only about 5-10% is spam.  I delete spam
instantly; there is no need to peruse it carefully.  Just the format of
the message on the screen is usually enough to give it away, and if not,
the first line of the message does so.  It is a very small effort compared
to reading and handling the bulk of my email.  (I do have spam filters,
but the benefit from running them is so slight that I don't even bother
any more.)

The fact that filtering software is not a top seller is a strong
indication that most people don't care about spam.  You have a small
group of very vocal complainers who seem to object on philosophical as
much as practical grounds.  They are offended that advertisers are able
to send mail without paying for it, just like everyone else.

Rather than try to change the world by creating a new class of criminal
behavior and throwing yet more people in jail, we should work on
cooperative approaches by which people can solve the problem on their
own.

You don't prohibit things without warning.  You tell people that since
this creates problems, from now on it should be prohibited.
If you poke me in the eye with a fork, which wasn't it's intended use,
you go to jail - and there are no problems with it.
There is a Robot Exclusion Protocol now that is followed by most
spiders, and could be officially legalized.
There can be a similar protocol for automatically collecting email
addresses from the usenet postings and Web pages.
If you tell in your page or posting in a standard way that you don't
want this email to be collected by any program, this desire should
be respected, just as your desire not to list your phone number, or
not to open your door to strangers.
Mass unsolicited mail can be considered everything that is directed
to a large group (> 500?) people that the author had no previous
contact with and/or who directly indicated that they don't want
any unsolicited mail and/or the message is unrelated to the topic
of the group's discussion (e.g., "Visit my porn site" message on
comp.ai.alife) and/or have misleading titles (e.g. "thanks for
last night" with the text "Buy bricks from Smith & Co".)

Such standards would be easily and unambiguously formulated and
enforced in a variety of ways.  I think it will be done at some
point; the lack of interest in filtering software is that it's not
compatible with many clients, doesn't work with many services
(Web, Usenet, guestbooks, etc.) and takes money and effort to
buy and use.

Good news! After some shuffling and negotiating, I have confirmed a booking
of conference space for EXTRO 4. We will hold the conference at U.C.
Berkeley, at the Joseph Wood Crutch Theatre on the Clark Kerr campus.

Rooms are available on campus, and will cost much less than a hotel room.
More details soon. It would help us if we had a better idea of how many
people will want an on-campus room, since we may need to increase our
reservations. If you're already sure you're coming and will want to stay on
campus, please let us know.

I will soon put up a web page with continually updated information on the
conference. For now, a reminder that it will happen on August 7-8 this
year. Those travelling from further away will want to arrive on Friday 6th.
The event will be finished by late afternoon on Sunday the 8th.

My thanks to Natasha Vita More for suggesting that we hold the conference
on a campus. I think this will make a good environment, and will cost less
for travellers than the usual venues.

Onward!

Wrong, wrong, wrong.  This doesn't take any laws at all.  It just takes e-cash.

Any mail from someone I've never heard from before, that doesn't arrive
with a 10-cent stamp, goes straight to the trash.  If I think it's
worthwhile, I don't use the stamp.  If it's SPAM, I trash it and get a
little richer.  I'd happily risk 10 cents the first time I wanted to
personally contact someone.

As for forged origins, use digital signatures.
As for mailing lists, have one person check posts from new listeners.

I've got a great wearable already that works for self defense. Its made
by Sturm, Ruger, & Co. It provides the ultimate in security interaction,
10 rounds of pure 9 mm protection.... he he. Of course, Rodney King is
hardly an example of a law abiding citizen protecting himself... The
problem with relying on wearable computers to protect yourself against
thugs or legal thugs (cops) is that the new emp and taser devices are
pretty effective at wiping your system out. Steel, titanium, and lead
are not nearly as vulnerable....

How can you make a rule which only applies to "automatically" collecting
email addresses?  Why should it be OK for me to do something with my
own mind, but illegal if I amplify my mind's capabilities with a computer?
If we continue to adopt rules based on this distinction, what will happen
when people become able to augment their own minds?

Philosophically, it just doesn't make sense to forbid doing something
automatically which is legal manually (especially if you are going to
throw someone in jail for breaking this law).  It is as bad as the
distinction between doing things commercially versus personally.

This is still going to lead to a lot of gray areas.  If a stranger posts
a message to the extropians list directing them to his for-profit web
site, should he go to prison?  Suppose his site is selling his book
about transcendental meditation.  Will his fate depend on whether this
is sufficiently on-topic?  Do we really want a world where people can
go to prison for this?

Sending people to prison for having misleading titles on their message
strikes me as a perfect example of what is wrong with this whole approach.
You're looking at the spam you got yesterday and today, and saying,
here's a rule which would make this one illegal; here's another rule
which would make that one illegal; and you keep doing this until you've
crossed them all off.  This is a shallow approach to the problem,
looking at the most superficial symptoms instead of the real issue.

If there were really a demand for this kind of software, the market
would supply it in both free and commercial versions.  Your comments
would apply to every piece of software.  Email software takes money
and effort to buy and use.  Yet there is demand for it, and people do
expend effort to install it.  (Actually, some services, like hotmail,
do offer spam filtering as one of their attractions.)

The point is, the whole approach of criminalizing this behavior is
fundamentally wrong.  There are many technical solutions, and once
the problem becomes important enough, these will start to be used.
Throwing people in jail for sending out information is not the way to go.

Using automated systems to mine the net of email addresses of people you do
not know and have never indicated an interest in knowing you or anybody like
you, your company, or your product, nor has indicated any interest in your
customers products is already illegal, it just hasn't been tested yet in
court. All someone has to do is apply the old mail and wire tampering, fraud,
and harassment laws to data miners and spammers.

The only reason these laws have not been applied by existing authorities is
that the computer users who are annoyed by spam are not the types that like to
use government intervention and are generally politically inept... The laws

whole hog to entrap pedophiles on the internet. It shouldn't take much to get

I think its better than a world where we are free to hunt those people down
and blow them away (no matter how much the thought thrills me), don't you
think?

Putting misleading titles on your email is tantamount to mail and wire fraud.
Sending email which claims to promote one kind of website when it actually is
linked to another type is also mail and wire fraud. If you don't know how
serious these crimes are, then you haven't seen or read Grisham's book _The
Firm_. If a spammer can be charged for every one of the thousands or millions
of spam messages they send, then they will be spending a lot of time in prison
(probably more than their entire adult life) and paying whopping fines. Just a
few test cases need to be won to put a stop to this crap.

Sure it is, especially when putting the burden on the victim is so onerous,
especially in the personal liberties department.

Really?  Then I guess I should go to prison.  Recently I saw a reference
to an interesting-sounding crypto paper published earlier this year,
but I couldn't find the paper on the web.  I sent unsolicited email to
the author asking if he would mind sending me a copy.  He did not know
me, he has never indicated any interest in knowing me or anyone like me,
or my company, or my product, or my customer's products.  From what you
say, what I did is illegal and I should go to prison.

No doubt many more people will end up in the same boat if we continue to
criminalize behavior as some people are suggesting.

O brave new world...

Personally I'd choose FN's Five-seveN; 20+1 rounds of Kevlar-
busting ammo. Of course I'd have it customized with a smooth 
trigger, laser sight (touch trigger to activate) and a small 
flashlight (or perhaps a miniature, automtatic camera to capture

Thats a sweet little death ray! I've been thinking about going to something
like that, since I've been hearing about cops that are selling surplus body
armor that the police no longer use because its beyond its use date to gang
bangers in the hood. It would definitely be nice to have some AP capability
for such situations... of course, I'm torn as to whether to get my own armor
too.

> Ps: I suppose you still have that silly law in the US which only

Actually, it bans the manufacture of new magazines of more than 10 rounds.
There are plenty of magazines sold out there that were manufactured before the
law took effect that have more than 10 rounds, and its perfectly legal to own
them and use them. The only magazine limit on use is that you can't have more
than 5 rounds in your magazine when hunting deer or other animals...except
humans...

My next big purchase is a FFL so I can buy the good stuff....

Since you were interested in his product, it is obviously not an offense. Get a

Thanks for letting me know, Mike, But FYI and for anyone else--my site is
down for reformatting. But I'm glad you reminded me. I need to make the
revisions and put it back up again.

So it is OK because I (the sender) was interested in his (the recipient)
product.  Above, you indicated that it was necessary that the recipient
be interested in the sender's product.  You are changing the rules as we
speak.

Spammers are interested in my product - in the money that is in my wallet.
By your new reasoning, their spam is OK.  I don't think this is what you
mean to imply.

The point is, there is unsolicited email which the recipient is happy to
receive, and there is unsolicited email which he is not happy to receive.
People are trying to propose rules by which the sender should know which
of the two categories his email will fall into.

Throwing people in jail because they misjudged the happiness of the
recipient is not a good way to solve this problem.

Foresight Institute is having a meeting described at
http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/99Gathering/index.html to brainstorm
about the next 30 years.  Participants include nanotech gurus like Drexler
and Merkle, our own Max More, other extropian faves like Vernor Vinge,
Ray Walford, Doug Lenat, Marvin Minsky and many other famous names.

The meeting will be organized as a "DesignShop" at knOwhere Palo Alto.
The DesignShop is some sort of collaborative brainstorming methodology,
and knOwhere provides a flexible workspace which can be reconfigured
as needed.  The web materials on this system (linked from the URL above)
are pretty confusing.  There is a book out about DesignShop, Leaping
the Abyss, by two of the authors (not Drexler) of Unbounding the Future.
Has anyone here read it?

The conference is expensive; you have to be a Foresight Senior Associate
which requires a pledge of $250 a year, plus it's then another couple
of hundred to attend the conference.  Still it does sound like it would
be a fascinating and stimulating weekend.

Here's one explaination as to why the overweight have a lower coeficient: Many
anti-oxidants are fat soluble so they build up high levels in their fatty
tissues, while underweight people are low in fatty tissues so they must either
constantly consume anti-oxidants or increase their risks. Check out this link on
the Molecule of the Month website regarding the antioxidant lycopene, which is
found in tomatos:

http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/mom/lycopene/lycopene.htm#

quote:
It helps prevent degenerative diseases by donating its electrons to oxygen free
radicals thus quenching and neutralising them before they can damage cells. Free
radicals are
            molecules that have at least one unpaired electron. By donating an
electron lycopene can stabilise the free molecule. There have been many recent
studies into lycopene so that it
            can be used to its fullest potential in fighting these diseases. A
heart study measuring lycopene in fatty tissue of 1,374 men showed that it could
reduce the risk of a heart attack
            by 50%. Lycopene has though other ailing effects. It has been seen
that lycopene can be used as an anti-carcinogen, greatly reducing the risk of
some cancers. In a six-year study
            of 47,000 male health professionals Harvard Medical School found
that eating tomato products more than twice a week was associated with 21-34%
reduced risk of prostate
            cancer. In 1995 Harvard School of Public Health studied further into
this and found that those men who ate more than 10 servings of tomato foods a
week were 45% less at risk to
            prostate cancer; those with only 4-7 servings were 20% less at risk.
The University of Illinois found that comparing woman with the highest levels of
lycopene and those with the
            lowest showed that the highest levels were five times less likely to

Wow. Good thing my Italian grandmother taught my mom how to cook good italian
food.... not that any of you guys noticed....;)

As for drinkers, I am under the impression that its all a matter of what you
consider moderate drinking as to how the mortality coefficients are rated. 1-3
drinks is moderate consumption, depending on your body mass, but some would say
that anything more than a small glass of wine was drunken slovenliness, and
others would say anything less than a six pack is nearly teetotaling...;)

Moderate drinkers have the lowest mortality, when measured as an absolute amount
of consumption, while heavy drinkers are not as low as total teetotalers only
because there are many large people who are considered heavy drinkers when
measured on an absolute rate, but not when measured by body mass, and
teetotalers obviously do not get the health benefits of the high density
lipoproteins, or anthenolic and pycnogynolic compounds found in many alcolholic
beverages.

Now, I would also say that light weight people also tend to suffer from alcohol
poisoning much more frequently than heavier people, because they don't have the
body mass to store the alcohol in for later processing by the liver. They get
drunk quicker and get much drunker than their heavier peers.

Here are some collected thoughts of mine on the topics listed above... I'm
looking for some discourse to focus my ideas... Seems like some of these
issues would be of interest to Extropian types...

Dance culture is a culture of escapism, a culture of acquiescence, a drug
culture, and foremost -- despite vocal objections to the contrary -- a
culture centered on the individual. What might have been its only redeeming
characteristic, the supposed love, togetherness, and unity of all ravers, as
well as the open, unrestrained affection and freedom of expression (all
captured in the much invoked but largely betrayed "PLUR") is easily reduced
to the fraudulent, the artificial, and the chemically dependent; without "E"
these benefits would surely evaporate.  MDMA deserves some credit for its
short-lived but singular ability to produce "empathogenesis" or that
"loved-up" feeling of compassion or connectedness which is its hallmark.  If
not for the inevitable recreational abuse of MDMA, and all the problems
associated with escapism in general, it might prove a useful substance under
a controlled environment.  Needless to say, the necessary control is not and
wont be present at a rave in the foreseeable future.
Even the music of dance culture -- oft cited by enthusiasts as the scenes
lifeblood -- is just intended to perpetuate these escapist themes, themes
which are of course the real fuel behind the fire, more so than music or
drugs.   As modern dance music has become increasingly good at catering to
dancers, it has simultaneously evolved an uncanny ability to distract and
disassociate the mind.  My contention is that dance music, for reasons I
will elaborate below, has become a genre particularly well suited to
abstracting and refocusing the mind, and thus highly conducive to escapism.
My belief is that music which emphasizes the change in pitch over time (such
as chamber music in the Western tradition, to cite an extreme example) tends
to focus the individual on learned patterns of change, both in pitch from
moment to moment, and in the overall direction of the song, shifts which are
easily anticipated as we come to learn the natural harmonic progressions of
a particular genre.  Learned patterns of melody and accompaniment make the
process of anticipation feel intuitive and the process of hearing and
tracking the predictable change in tone and structure focuses the individual
on the song.  The focus achieved by tracking this combination of
predictability and surprise makes listening to popular music satisfying and
entertaining.  Generally percussion is merely the glue by which a song is
held together and is used to set the mood/pace of a song.  Descended from a
combination of African music, which emphasized beats, and the Western
tradition of religious music, which was highly dependent on tonality,
popular genres such as rock, alternative, and country have struck a
successful balance between the percussive beat oriented, and tonal melody
oriented modalities which had existed independently for so long.
Now for a little whack-ass music theory, inspired by maddeningly complex
drum n bass, a little house and a lot of funky breaks. Listening to
underground dance music, I became aware of my minds inability to wrap the
long tentacles of cognition around each distinct element, to fully encompass
the sum and entirety of a song, always finding myself limited to the
momentary perception of individual components.   Take for existence a
particular drum-loop.  Let your mind latch on to it for a moment and it
repeats; you can focus for just long enough to pick out its recurrence.  But
it is sporadic and unpredictable, and quite often your mind loses it in some
other component, a bass-line or competing drum loop.  Most frustrating, the
patterns of beats and samples, taken individually, are just that, patterns;
clearly, recognizable as structured, layered, and arranged via some stroke
of human intelligence.   But that predictability is limited to the
individual samples, to perceive the song as a whole requires a kind of
detachment, a removal from the deep analytic perceptibility of sound
patterns.  So it follows that electronic music has the peculiar capacity to
dissolve the immediate locus of thought and erect in its place a kind of
detached imperception that is neither analytic nor emotional -- it simply
is.  Historically, this characteristic of beat oriented music was exploited
by aboriginal cultures seeking communion with the spirit world via
provocation of altered states of consciousness, generally through highly
repetitive layered beats and frenzied dancing; a phenomenon commonly
referred to as trance induction.
Drawing parallels between raves and aboriginal spirituality is nothing new,
Terrence McKenna and others have been expounding the connection for years.
In fact, the concept has caught on in the rave scene at large to the point
where the connection seems downright commonsensical.  In certain circles
this new techno-spirituality is seen as a way of justifying the culture,
in essence infusing something inherently meaningless with some kind of
profound (albeit warped) significance.   And as we all know, aboriginal
rituals often combined their hallmark uninhibited, unstructured dancing with
the use of mind-altering substances, the mixture of which further
intensified the perceptual divergence sought by practitioners; this of
course paralleling the widespread use of drugs at rave parties.
What really scares me about this connection, ironically, is exactly what
inspires others.  Were talking about something with a longstanding record
for being used as a spiritual aid, a physical and psychological tool
tailored to subverting the conscious mind and refocusing it entirely on the
spiritual, - which like any religion, is a wholly irrational belief
system.  Spirituality was the dominating characteristic - the focus - of
every primitive aboriginal culture I can call to mind.  What does this
mean for dance culture?  I have a feeling weve hit on something big,
something capable of squelching ones inner voice, drowning it in a barrage
of aural horseshit and inducing cognitive dissonance pretty reliably - in
essence, the perfect form of escapism.
The only thing more dangerous than escapism to society, and accordingly to
the happiness of the individual, is acquiescence.  This is the essence of
passivity, of servility.  It is the lowest form of defeat, one that
facilitates the passing from conscious opposition to unconscious
indifference, which knowingly folds, or relinquishes, in the face of
confrontation, and which is removed from the day to day, minute to minute
evaluative process by which we derive reality from sensation; a process that
is both healthy and productive.

max m, i think you said you are an advertising executive?  i just
finished watching the taped superbowl.  sort of.  i traditionally
tape it, then fast forward thru the actual football in order to
study the commercials.  great stuff this year!  gold goes to the
beer bottle hostage-taking lobster.  silver to the world wide
rassling foundation, for some of the most daring ads i have ever
seen on tv.  bronze to the busch dalmatians.  raspberries to
apple computer for jumping on the y2k bandwagon and further
panicking the countless herds of techno-illiterate sheep.

do you get the same commercials out there in denmark?  do
you study american superbowl ads?  spike

sasha, i mean computer use is another step above ordinary tool
use.  it is a step above even telephone use.  the web is a unique
example of technological development.  whenever i come up with
some question, regardless of how arcane, someone on extropians
knows the answer or where to find the answer on the web.  i
cant think of anything that is really equivalent to that.

ok, but development of the internet is the most dramatic change
i anticipate before nanotech.  implanting devices in our brains
to communicate with computers is the only other development
that compares.

I have HTML skills, space on a server, and a domain awaiting development
(extropian.net).
I don't have a lot of time.
However, I would be more than willing to lend resources to this
project-of-projects, thoughout time if not in time (not immediately, but
consistently).
Maybe if people start throwing some ideas out and organizing them, we could
at least get this thing kick-started and let it develop some momentum.

Why do we die?

Maybe because a steady flow of new people is the only way 
for new social structures, paradigms, and ideas to evolve,
which may in turn maximize the chance of the survival of life.
As Nobel physicist Max Plank said about evolution in science:

"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its
opponents and making them see the light, but rather because
its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows 
up that is familiar with the idea from the beginning."

>max m, i think you said you are an advertising executive?

Yeah you could say that, but my main focus is in "new media", cd-rom,
internet, strategic information design etc.
A large subbranch in my field is 1 to 1 (direct) marketing which the net is
made for (No I don't mean spam :-) ).

>do you get the same commercials out there in denmark?  do
>you study american superbowl ads?  spike

No and yes. American commercials ususally don't work here in Denmark. The
target audience is very different. Some commercials are use here though, but
mostly the total mainstream ones by the multinationals: Lever, Proctor &
Gamble etc. Even though they are most often rerecorded with Danish actors.

We do study the US commercials but we cannot use them for much. A TV
commercial is only a part of a much bigger campaign, and must be specifially
designed for that campaign. They have to enhance a message and that message
is decided by: what we want to tell, why we want to tell it, to whom we want
to tell it and how we want to tell it. Therefore there cannot be much reuse
in commercials crossing different cultures.

There is also legal issues involved in the commercials. Many things that are
legal to use in US commercials are illegal in DK and vice versa.

What we do study vigirously is the american campaigns, the methods and the
ideas behind them. This is interresting and can be used to great effect
everywhere. There are some good books on the subject. At the time I
especially like one called "Coopetition".

American culture do have a strong influence on Danish culture though, but
i'll bet you that American Football will never be popular in Denmark. This
was the first superbowl to be shown live in Denmark, but only because the
Danish kicker Morten Andersen??? was on the side of the Falcons.

It is a strange fragmented game that stops and starts all the time. A bit
like Coitus Interuptus :-)

Soccer is much more fun to watch ;-)

The mail and wire fraud laws are very, very good examples of why spamming
laws are a really bad idea. Just take a look sometime at the numerous cases
where these laws are used for things they were never intended to cover; back
when I kept up with the hacking press, it seemed that practically every US
hacker caught was charged with wire fraud with its high penalties, even 
though the crime was never intended to apply to hacking.

Oh get real. Late time I checked the average murderer spent about eight
years in jail; you want to put spammers in jail for longer than murderers!?
Do you have any idea how much these kind of laws are screwing up the US
legal system? Next time someone's accused of spamming they'll just come

Actually, Italian food might be a starting point for making transhuman
food (the mediterranean diet, antioxidants, a generally hedonistic
approach). Interestingly enough we got three swedish-italian members
in Aleph (likely far above average for an association of our size,
especially earlier when we were smaller). All our first dinners were
italian food.

This is a common answer, but rather non-transhumanistic. Can't we
change without having people die? We want our ideas to die instead of
us.

He was probably (not necessarily completely) joking. There are plenty
of revolutions in science that occur much faster than people die
off. Just look at quantum mechanics, relativity, Gdel's theorem and
so on.

Hmm, that Swedish-Italian mix again. Is there something that makes
Swedish-Italians especially extropic? And can we find the gene/meme
for it so we others can get it too? :-)

To add more data to your survey, I'm 12.5% Swedish and 12.5% Italian.  If
we can assume that extropic tendencies are somehow related to the mix of
the two then the fact that I have extropic tendencies and that I have
small amounts of Swedish and Italian blood could be useful in narrowing
down the possible genetic candidates.  My diverse heritage will not,
unfortunately, help in figuring out any memetic link.

My personal guess is that the link might be weakly memetic. Neophobes
likely do not leave their home culture, and the combination of two
rather different cultures would likely be stimulating for the
children, who might pass on some of the memes and traits. I have noted
that the greater latin extroversion gives a noticeable social
advantage among us comparatively introvert swedes.

Of course, my ideas would suggest similar combinations for other
culture mixes. Might be harder to tell in America due to the
"background noise" of so many people with mixed background, but it
should be noticeable in parts of Europe and Asia. Any data?

> Dan Hook <------The family name is, believe it or not, Swedish.

Is it by any chance derived from "Hk" (Hawk)?

(As for myself, I'm as far as I know 100% pure, boring swede :-)

What counts here is not whether you were interested or not but rather
whether you solicited the information.  If you receive the spam and do
not want to pursue it through the various complaint processes that is
OK for you.

OPT-IN is the only model that will work.  OPT-OUT will guarantee a
never-ending spew of "this is a one time mailing" spam.  And you can
bet that it will NOT be the only time that the spammers send you those
"one time mailings."  They have already demonstrated their lack of
ethics by stealing from you in order to advertise to you.  They will
just claim "that is the only one I sent; someone else must have sent
those other ones."

So it is OK because I (the sender) was interested in his (the
recipient)
product.  Above, you indicated that it was necessary that the
recipient
be interested in the sender's product.  You are changing the rules as
we
speak.

Spammers are interested in my product - in the money that is in my
wallet.
By your new reasoning, their spam is OK.  I don't think this is what
you
mean to imply.

The point is, there is unsolicited email which the recipient is happy
to
receive, and there is unsolicited email which he is not happy to
receive.
People are trying to propose rules by which the sender should know
which
of the two categories his email will fall into.

Throwing people in jail because they misjudged the happiness of the
recipient is not a good way to solve this problem.

Ever hear of Kevin Mitnick?  He's been in jail for three (3) years now
without trial.  

As for authentication solutions etc. this is fine and good but until
IPng it is not likely to fly because it requires every server to
cooperate unless you want to isolate yourself from the net.

The law that makes the most sense is one prohibiting the transfer of
the cost of the mailing from the sender to the intermediate networks
and ultimately the end recipient.  This is why the TCPA junk fax law
has upheld to date.  This type of law (cost transfer) will cover
future types of situations such as people spamming your palm pilot or
spamming your digital pager or even spamming your PCS phone.  This is
the type of law which was just submitted to the Texas Congress.  Even
California is considering additional laws because their original one
just doesn't have enough teeth in it.

The only way you will be able to significantly reduce spam is to make
it no longer profitable and worth the risk.  You will always have some
clueless chicken-boner spammers out there but we will be able to put
it to a quick stop be it by LARTing the spammer or by terminating his
access.

There is no one solution to the problem - it will take a combination
of efforts to rid the net of +90% of this junk.

The mail and wire fraud laws are very, very good examples of why
spamming
laws are a really bad idea. Just take a look sometime at the numerous
cases
where these laws are used for things they were never intended to
cover; back
when I kept up with the hacking press, it seemed that practically
every US
hacker caught was charged with wire fraud with its high penalties,
even 
though the crime was never intended to apply to hacking.

Oh get real. Late time I checked the average murderer spent about
eight
years in jail; you want to put spammers in jail for longer than
murderers!?
Do you have any idea how much these kind of laws are screwing up the
US
legal system? Next time someone's accused of spamming they'll just
come
out shooting, because they'll have nothing to lose...

This list is really going downhill.

The problem with getting law enforcement involved today is that the
laws are not significant enough in their eyes to act.  Unless your
case is over $50,000 or so in damages the FBI is not likely to listen
to you.  Law enforcement also sees this as a civil issue and not a
criminal issue.  Once it is specifically made criminal you should be
able to get your state LEO's involved, as has been done in Washington
state.

A good example is the TCPA.  It references "electronic transmission"
yet the courts have yet to hear a case of it being applied to spam
instead of junk faxes.  That is why the Smith bill was submitted to
congress last year.  That is why the DMA, ACLU and EFF fought the
Smith bill so strongly - they know that the existing law makes it safe
for people to continue doing what they are doing.

Using automated systems to mine the net of email addresses of people
you do
not know and have never indicated an interest in knowing you or
anybody like
you, your company, or your product, nor has indicated any interest in
your
customers products is already illegal, it just hasn't been tested yet
in
court. All someone has to do is apply the old mail and wire tampering,
fraud,
and harassment laws to data miners and spammers.

The only reason these laws have not been applied by existing
authorities is
that the computer users who are annoyed by spam are not the types that
like to
use government intervention and are generally politically inept... The
laws
are already there to protect your privacy. If you want them enforced,
all you
have to do is donate a couple grand to the reelection campaign of  a
state
politician, like a State Senator or State Legislator, and tell them
how much
you want these laws enforced on the spamming industry. They are
already going
whole hog to entrap pedophiles on the internet. It shouldn't take much
to get
them to do something useful like take out the spammers.

You err in thinking that manually tampering with the mail or harassing

in person is legal.

I think its better than a world where we are free to hunt those people
down
and blow them away (no matter how much the thought thrills me), don't
you
think?

Putting misleading titles on your email is tantamount to mail and wire
fraud.
Sending email which claims to promote one kind of website when it
actually is
linked to another type is also mail and wire fraud. If you don't know
how
serious these crimes are, then you haven't seen or read Grisham's book
_The
Firm_. If a spammer can be charged for every one of the thousands or
millions
of spam messages they send, then they will be spending a lot of time
in prison
(probably more than their entire adult life) and paying whopping
fines. Just a
few test cases need to be won to put a stop to this crap.

Sure it is, especially when putting the burden on the victim is so
onerous,
especially in the personal liberties department.

Do you think it is fair for someone who shuts down entire ISP
mailservers effectively causing a denial of service attack to not be
held accountable?  PacBell, for example, had to spend a half a million
dollars to protect their network after their users were unable to get
mail for several days because of spammers.

It is estimated that spammers cost every internet user approx. $2-$3
each month.  Is it fair for these people to effectively steal this
much money from the rest of the net just so they can peddle their
wares without paying the full cost of the advertisement?  We are
talking about millions of dollars every month.  (AOL, for example, has
over 10 million users, and multiplying that by two gives you
$20,000,000 per month passed on to AOL users alone.)

Spamming is network abuse, usually fraud (headers etc), theft of
services, and trespassing.  If someone abuses networks, causes the
blame to be directed to innocent third parties, steals bandwidth as
well as disk space, and uses their wires against their will, shouldn't
they be held accountable?

Is this really a solution in keeping with Extropian philosophy?  Do
you
want to throw people into prison because they sent you some
information
which you didn't want to receive?

I see serious problems in making unsolicited commercial email illegal.
It sets a number of dangerous precedents.  Email is a protocol which
we voluntarily engage in.  Spammers are using the protocol in a manner
in which we allowed but did not intend.  Throwing people in jail for
this is going to mean that using any information protocol in the
future
will be fraught with danger.  There will be gray areas in terms of
what
is intended and what is not intended, and it ends up making the laws
capricious and enforced at the whim of judges and prosecutors.

There is also the problem of providing different rules for commercial
and personal email.  Presumably we don't want to throw someone in jail
because he sends a personal, unsolicited email, to someone else.  It
is
only "commercial" unsolicited email that we want to criminalize.  But
we
can't draw a clean line between the personal and commercial aspects of
our activities.  Especially in the future, I believe we will be able
to have more autonomy and independence in how we structure our lives,
so that what we do personally and commercially may not be so
different.

Every posting I make is an advertisement for me.  I have gotten jobs
in the past based solely on people having read my postings on various
topics and deciding that I am knowledgeable and write well.  As we
become more of an information economy this will become much more
common.
If spam is criminalized, I might be thrown in jail just for responding
to a question which was widely posted.

The EU has privacy laws which require companies not to remember
certain things about their customers.  I'm not sure how they apply to
individual businessmen.  Do these laws claim to regulate the contents
of
people's minds?  Is it only in the commercial sphere that people must
be forgetful?  What will happen when people are able to extend their
own memories with technological aids?  The philosophy of this approach
is completely misguided.

I would prefer to see methods which address the problem directly
within
the framework of the protocol, based on technology, rather than
threats
of prison.  Filtering and blocking systems are becoming available, and
if unsolicited commercial email continues to grow as a problem, they
should improve in sophistication and capability.

Frankly, I don't think UCE is that bad a problem right now.  I get
200-300
pieces of email a day, and only about 5-10% is spam.  I delete spam
instantly; there is no need to peruse it carefully.  Just the format
of
the message on the screen is usually enough to give it away, and if
not,
the first line of the message does so.  It is a very small effort
compared
to reading and handling the bulk of my email.  (I do have spam
filters,
but the benefit from running them is so slight that I don't even
bother
any more.)

The fact that filtering software is not a top seller is a strong
indication that most people don't care about spam.  You have a small
group of very vocal complainers who seem to object on philosophical as
much as practical grounds.  They are offended that advertisers are
able
to send mail without paying for it, just like everyone else.

Rather than try to change the world by creating a new class of
criminal
behavior and throwing yet more people in jail, we should work on
cooperative approaches by which people can solve the problem on their
own.

I dunno. Could be the food!

Getting hopelessly stereotypical here, seeing Swedes as being depressed,
morose, and introspective over their present situation in life, and the
Italians as being romantic idealists who are paradoxically cynical about
government and always figure out ways around it, plus the Scottish
predisposition to tinker with things....

Don't get me started on kilt jokes...

Seriously, I would imagine that a Swede who married an extrovert Italian
must themselves be pretty extroverted for a Swede.

I read Mike's message with the natural expectation that it would be
relevant to the given subject.  I therefore naturally assumed that it
would describe why we die.

But obviously Mike's message did not offer any reasons why we die.
His only contribution was to describe his ethnic background.  This was a
very misleading subject title!  According to Mike his action is tantamount
to mail and wire fraud.  Does anyone think Mike should now go to prison?

As we have discussed here, why should the fact you do it with a computer or with
your own voice make it different, if a computer is just an extension of the self?
Stealing my credit card numbers and bank account numbers by packet sniffing is no
different than conning them out of me by calling in person from some boiler room
operation, or faxing me a fraudulent bill for services not rendered.

Nor is it any different than sending me email with headers that do not represent
the content of the message, or sending content with links to sites which are
misrepresented by the content of the email.

The IP Food Script that Sasha pointed out is an excellent example. It is a means
of seeding the search engines with fraudulent information about your website,
while maintaining a public web page that might be wholly unrelated to the content
fed to the search engines by the script.

A murderer steals all of my life at once. A spammer steals it in little bits and
pieces. Morally they are no different, it is just a matter of degree. If they take
little moments from millions of people without compensation, it still adds up to
several lifetimes of time wasted. Just because they spread it around means that
they are better? Now who is being inconsistent?

Now, what would be interesting would be to form an anti-spam association, and hire
members to kill spammers, since it is all in self defense of the group.... maybe
just strap them into chairs and force them to watch nothing but commercials on
tv....

Did I have any commercial interest in this? No. case closed.... moreover, as a member
of the list, you have agreed to receive the traffic of the list, so not only is it not
commercial, it is also not unsolicited. Stop being so banal.

Yes, I hear they finally called an arraignment for his case a couple
months ago...its funny, people who know a little bit about him either hate
his guts or love him, but when you tell them (the haters) that he has been
sitting in jail without due process as if he were in jail in Mexico or
Turkey for 3 years, they get a bit more sympathetic, and start to get a
minimal idea of who it is that is really playing hardball.

Yes, packet authentication ought to be established with the new Internet2.
I grant that doing so on the present internet would bog it down to
uselessness untill everyone can get high speed connections and the
backbones are increased by a factor of four or more above their capacity
now.

I'm not too happy with the Texas government at the moment, since they just
banned the use of Quicken software in state since it supposedly amounts to
practicing law without a license. (Texas also bans sale of 'cookie cutter'
legal forms in business stores, at the behest of the Texas Bar
Association, on the same grounds). This is a prime example of raw
mercantilism. I wonder what we can do to ban texas on the net....

Up here we have legal precedents that establish that anyone can be an
attorney (common law states this), but to be an "attorney at law", you
need to be a licensed attorney who has passed the bar.

Yes, while extropians are pro-knowledge, they are also for responsible use
of knowledge. We can't just throw our hands up and say c'est la vie! If we
are to rely on the market, then we need to take matters into our own hands
to force the evolutionary curve in terms of responsible use of internet
tools. We rely on the market, but don't forget, 'de market iz us!'

If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem...

Hey. If you were actually following the discussion, rather than trying to find even a
specious reason to be a prick, you would see why it was relevant. Get off your high
horse and stop trying to pick fights. Sounds to me like you are trying to justify
spamming... are you one of them?

I find spam to be a nuisance, but like the mass U.S. Snail mailings of
Publisher's Clearing House, it is free speech. I do not agree that
distinctions should be made between commercial and noncommercial speech.
It just takes me a few seconds of the day to put this stuff in my trash

#1 It is not an issue of "free speach (tm)" - it is an issue of theft of
service, trespassing, fraud and network abuse.  Ever wonder why no spammer
has ever won a case in court over this?  It is because the courts have
affirmed repeatedly that your right to free speech ends at the property
line of private networks, and that is what the Internet is: a an
inter-network of mostly private networks.  In the NSF days you might have
had a free speech issue, but in the NSF days you would be kicked off the
net if you tried to spamvertise because the NSF AUP strictly prohibited
commercial activity on the ARPA/Internet.  Your right to free speech does
not give you the right to come into someones home and force your
presence/speech upon them.  Your right to free speech does not give you
the right to use someones private line to make your calls.

If you are such a fan of free speech, how would you like it if someone
started faxing you 20 page documents every day, eating up your paper, your
toner, and tying up your fax line?

Another example:  shouldn't your definition of the right to free speech
mean that you can submit articles to the New York Times and force them to
print it lest they be infringing on your right to free speech?  Or is the
New York Times a private organization which has the right to decide how
their resources are used?

Again, spam is NOT a free speech issue - it is about transfer of cost of
advertising.  Spam is like having telemarketers call you collect and you
not be able to hang up until the telemarketer is done and you not be able
to refuse the long distance charge.  THAT is what spam does.  It makes
everyone *except* the crook/spammer pay for the advertisement.

Right now less an one percent of the businesses on the net spamvertise,
and you probably see a handful of spam a day or week.  Now imagine that
jumps to 10 percent because of laws passed to *protect* the spammers, like
the Murkowski bill that failed (the spam part.)  That few per week could
easily turn into hundreds or more per week.  And if you use POP/POP3, you
will have to wait for all of that junk to download just so you can read
your favorite listserv traffic.  

The spammers killed usenet and will kill email itself if they are not
stopped.  And if all you do is delete it, you are helping them do so.

"All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing."
Just delete.

Wonder about this: "Your right to swing your arm ends in front of my nose." You
have the right to speak, yes. I have the right to not be forced to listen to
you, or to have my time wasted by your insistent harassment in trying to force
your speech on me.

My privacy rights exceed your speech rights within a given radius of my body and
ears, given that I am on private property in which I have some say in the
activities there (especially if it is my own). Just because I have a mailbox at
the property line does not mean that every Tom, Dick, and Jerk-wad can stuff it
full of tree killing crap.  I have the right to refuse to receive any class of
mail I wish.

The way the USPS regulates this with snail mail is by requiring that all users
of bulk class (2nd class periodicals, 3rd class standard) mail rates MUST submit
CASS certified audits of every mail list they use that certifies that NONE of
the people on the mail list are on the industry standardized refuse list (among
other things). They must do this with EVERY mailing to get these rates. I know
this because this is one of the services that a company I consult with provides
to direct marketers and periodicals publishers.

Since the internet crosses state lines and national borders, the congress,
delegating to the USPS, the Commerce Dept,, what have you...have the right to
regulate (under the Interstate Commerce clause) commercial communications which
cross those borders (i.e. the equivalent of 2nd and 3rd class mail). The
authority is already there to regulate spam, and it is just, constitutional, and
has a decent pedigree of precedent supporting it.  The only reason why it isn't
being enforced is that the populace is so used to getting trod on by the
government, business, etc that they no longer understand that they have the
right to be free of this shit. They've been trained through life by the media
and the government that their right to privacy is less than other people's right
to harass you with their opinions or their wares...when its the exact opposite
that is true.

This may seem weird as I am commenting on a similarity between two
commercials that occured one either before I was born and the one just
recently aired, but doesn't the latest computer commercial remind you
of that old apple commercial where the lady in red shorts with the
hammer goes running up through the whole 1984-type set up and smashes
an (IBM?) movie-hypno-message-projecture with a sledgehammer?  This
may be stretching your memories a bit, but if anyone else remembers
this, did they too note the similarities?  Did anyone think they might
have been sort of quietly stealing the theme of the commercial?  I am
probably just tired. Well, anyway, good night extropians... It's 9:16
pm here.

Ooh. :)  Well, dunno about Hal, but *I'm* not "one of them", 
(unless you consider advertising in one's sig to be spam, 
and I understand that some people do), but I strongly
disagree with the idea of using laws to combat the problem.

But no one can use your private line, nor spam you, without one of two
things: your consent, or a physical breach of your property.  One of these
is properly illegal, the other may not be yet, and *should* not be.

Obviously, it would be my responsibility, if I was concerned, not to
let that person use my fax machine.  I would not push for a law 
regarding what the spammer did with *his* machine.  There are ways
to deal with this problem other than initiating force.

....even if it consists of printing advertising which is offensive?  After
all, you might choose to buy it.  If you do, and find an advertisment 
inside (and this offends you), should you attempt to make it illegal 
for them to print any more ads, or just choose not to buy any more
NY Times?

I dunno about you, but I "hang up" by pressing DEL long before the
ad is done.  What charge?  Are you charged per byte?  I agree that 
the spammer should pay for what he sends, but *everyone* should.

Let me state that I am in favor of no laws to "protect" spam, either.

This is ridiculous.  I read news from usenet every day, and I've
not noticed any "death".  There may be some groups that are
flooded with spam, but this could be solved by the simple 
expedient of charging to *accept* mail or news.  The cost could
be trivial by most standards, yet quite high for spammers (at 
least on a level with junk mail).

Having worked for a mass mailing company in the past, lemme clear
something up.  All of the refuse lists are voluntary.  The only criteria 
that the USPS cares about are whether the addresses are in a standard
format (to lower costs), and whether the addresses are deliverable.
If someone chose to ignore the refuse lists, they might eventually get
sued, but in the short run, the major factor is the non-trivial costs of
mailing the junk.  Why bother spending money on someone who has
essentially notified you that they will toss anything received?

  IAN: Death and birth ensure that a continually new

  increases the chance of mutations, which increases 
  the chance of a new species evolving with just the

  IAN: But consider that every year new professors
  are created, such that the influx of youth is a
  continuous feature, and I suspect that we would
  find that the new paradigms would tend to enter 
  and infiltrate the academic community with the 
  entry and infiltration of youth; and most of 
  the hold outs against change will tend to be 
  the older professors. I suspect that's true
  and if so, then Plank's observation is both 
  rather cynical and scientifically accurate.

Actually we aren't "programmed" for long life because it isn't
necessary. To be successful, a creature has to remain alive
and reasonably fit long enough to produce (and in the case
of humans raise) offspring, then it becomes expendable. 
In fact, our apparent approx. 120 yr limit is already something
of an overkill, as most individuals would be long dead before
reaching such an age due to accidents and disease.

Yes, what good is progress if you're not around to benefit from
it?

Actually, death is a natural result of existing as metastable systems
in a world with thermal fluctuations; sooner or later a large
fluctuation is going to destabilize any system. Of course, this time
might be extremely long, it is only relevant to show that death is
deducible from our kind of physics.

Note that there is no a priori reason why all available matter/energy
flows couldn't be converted into immortal static lifeforms (modulo a
slight turnover due to thermal fluctuations as above; it can be made
as small as desired). However, this state is unlikely due to another
aspect of thermodynamics, namely the increase of entropy. The universe
moves from less probable states towards more probable. 

However, the third law of thermodynamics is also the reason we have
evolved: evolution *demands* some form of selection, and if entropy
didn't increase individuals and species could always un-die and
evolution would be impossible. Complex systems can only appear
randomly (i.e. extremely rarely) in a reversible world, while in an
irreversible world they can flourish.

Note that this doesn't mean "death is good", is just means that
without selection processes we can't have evolution. Intelligent
beings can improve themselves without dying, by letting "their
thoughts die in their stead" - still selection, but this time among
information patterns.

Which? People should be able to breach your property any time they want? Or

No there are not, or there would be products on the market to prevent this. Nor
is the spammer just using 'his' machine. In order for his message to reach me,
he must also use 'my' machine in a manner which I do not wish him to use it.

If you've bought it, then you've paid for the cost of transmission (the price
you pay for a newspaper is usually only 10-15% of the actual cost of the
paper). If you want ad free papers, expect to pay 8-10 times more for them.

Ultimately you ARE charged per byte, since your ISP is charged for his
bandwidth, which breaks down into a specific number of bytes per day. He passes
these costs on to you, so if your bandwidth is being wasted by more spammers,
your internet connect costs are going to go up. This is why it is estimated
that the average internet user pays around $3.00 per month extra because of
spam.

And how would you enforce this rule without government laws which force people
to pay? You are just moving the focus of force from where it belongs, on
spammers, to the users.

<continued from part 3>

OK, here's where I start venturing onto thin ice.  Given what we now know
about intelligence, what can we say about intelligence enhancement?
Obviously we don't really know how to build an intelligent mind yet, so we
can't make any firm predictions.  However, AI has advanced to the point
where it seems plausible that a mind could be build using complex
combinations of the problem-solving methods that are currently known.  If
that is indeed the case, then we can anticipate some of the general
characteristics of IE:

Increased Speed

Assume we have an intelligent entity implemented in software (it could be an
AI, and upload, or some sort of hybrid entity - our only constraint is that
we assume someone knows enough about the entity to make changes to it).
What benefits does it gain if we give it faster hardware to run on?

If we make no changes at all to its software, this will simply make the
entity think the same thoughts faster - from its point of view, the rest of
the world slows down.  However, the task of modifying the entity to take
advantage of the increased speed is simple compared to the task of creating
the entity in the first place.

Modifying decision-tree abilities to take advantage of the extra speed is
trivial - it could even be made automatic for an artificial mind.  Modifying
data-transformation abilities to work better is an engineering problem of
reasonable complexity.  Knowledge bases will not be much affected - they
simply do the same things faster.

What would this mean in terms of intelligence?  Based on current experience,
we would expect geometric increases in processing power to yield at least
linear improvements in ability for both decision-tree and
data-transformation problems.  Some abilities will improve even faster,
while a few (like playing tic-tak-toe) will become 'solved' problems and
stop improving.  Learning speed will enjoy an increase somewhere between
linear and geometric - the knowledge bases and other infrastructure enjoy a
geometric increase in performance, but we would expect real-world
constraints (such as network bandwidth, or the time required to perform
physical actions) to place some limits on the rate of improvement.

As an interesting note, it would appear that the effort required to take
advantage of each speed increase grows relatively slowly - a mind that knows
enough to make the necessary changes should have little trouble taking
advantage of all available processing power.

Optimization

A potentially much more powerful approach to intelligence enhancement is
optimization - using better heuristics, more sophisticated decision-tree
searches, more efficient data-transformation algorithms, and so forth.  This
approach can sometimes yield amazing results - performance improvements of
several orders of magnitude can often be achieved through relatively
straightforward optimizations.

Unfortunately, this sort of improvement also tends to be self-limiting.  In
any given problem domain there comes a time when all of the known methods
for improving performance have been applied, and there are no more obvious
improvements that can be made.  Then you are reduced to inventing new
solutions, which is a process of scientific discovery that requires large
amounts of effort and produces only erratic results.

Temporary Specialization

Another approach to IE would exploit the inherent flexibility of
general-purpose computers by dynamically allocating processing resources.
The idea here is to allocate most of the mind's processing power to whatever
problem it is concentrating on at the time, rather than allocating a fixed
amount of power to each cognitive ability.  The result would be a fairly
substantial increase in effective intelligence, equivalent to the effect of
a substantial speed increase (something like x10 to x100, depending on how
much temporary specialization is actually possible for a problem).

Long Thought

An entity with access to large amounts of data storage space can make
another interesting tradeoff.  As computer scientists have discovered,
allowing more time to solve a problem has exactly the same effects as using
faster hardware.  As long as the entity does not run out of memory, it can
take 10, 100 or even 1,000 times longer than normal to think about a
problem, and reach solutions that would normally require a higher level of
intelligence running on faster hardware.  Of course, many problems are too
time-sensitive for this approach to be feasible.

----

Well, I'm sure there are lots of other ways to approach IE, but I haven't
thought of them yet.  Suggestions are welcome - I would like to include more
possibilities in the list.

Actually, it sounds like these would be two different ways of storing
information in a knowledge base.  As you said, they are schemes for storing,
retrieving and communicating information.

Cognitive abilities, OTOH, are ways of discovering information.  They are
the means I use to discover that this thing in my hand is a doll, that it
resembles you, that I don't like you (but that sticking pins in you would be
inadvisable).  The rules of magic are the sort of thing that might be
discovered by an unsophisticated decision tree system - I want to perform
action X on object Y (but I can't), object Z is similar to Y, so perhaps
doing X to Z will achieve the desired result.  Perhaps the prevalence of
such beliefs indicates a common flaw in the human cognitive architecture?

regarding advertisement, what about those camel ads?  they went from
joe camel (good ads) to the pink poodle lounge lizard (revolting ads).
wonder if there is an online source to see how their sales were effected.

like big tobacco, transhumanism may suffer from an image problem:

seem to have a built in resistance to many of our ideas.  if in the future
we ever wanted to advertise ourselves, i am at a loss on how we would

about 4 years ago when the web was newer, i tried a little experiment.
i found a website for multilevel marketing schemes.  my experiment
was to visit 20 of the sites and let them set all the cookies
they wanted. (i was at the workplace.)  furthermore, i gave them my
email address and indicated my interest..  i wanted to see if i would
get 20 emails or if they would proliferate my address.  they proliferated
it wildly.  i began to get hundreds of messages a day, most of it
unrelated
to what i expressed interest in.  i suspected this might happen.  i
changed my email address. {8^D

now i get spamvertisements that have a line at the bottom saying: "if
you want no further contact, click remove below".  i have been afraid
to touch that link, for fear that my address would end up on a cd
of spammers greatest hits.

does anyone know: when you get a spam with a remove button,
should you reply remove or just play dead and not reply?  spike

The current urban legend is that replying to this link will only get you more
spam.  My experience is that each mail server has its own policy for reporting
and dealing with the stuff.  If yours doesn't, there are now quite a few free
mail servers (i.e., Netscape, Excite) who do.

Ignore it. 90% of the time it's a fake email address, and most of the rest
of the time it's just a way to verify that your email address actually
works before they sell it to other spammers.

Personally, running my own domain I'm amazed by the amount of spam I bounce
for non-existent email addresses, and the number of mailing lists which 
have non-existent unicorn.com addresses subscribed. This annoys me a lot
more than the spam I'm sent, particularly when it ends up in my postmaster
mailbox for no good reason.

It's not a legend, as can be verified by a simple test: create a
unique email address that's never been on any web page, any usenet
posting, or any legitimate email.  Send a single message from that
address to the "remove" address given by a spammer.  You will
start getting spam at that address, since you've conveniently
verified to them that it is a valid address they can give or sell
to other spammers.

Arguments for spammer tolerance--with which I philosophically
have some sympathy--would be better recieved if the reality were
not that spammers have demonstrated at every opportunity that they
are liars, cheats, and thieves.  They continually complain that
"opt-in" systems (where a user must request mail /before/ it is
sent) do not work, despite the fact that many such systems are
working quite profitably.  Technical solutions do make an
impact; things like the MAPS blackhole, tarpits, and user-level
filtering software make a dent, but a lot still gets through.

A spammer is like someone who sees a dish of free mints at the
counter of a coffee shop, so he daily empties the dish into
his pocket until he accumulates enough to sell back to the
restaruant at a profit.  It's hard to define that as "theft",
really, but it's clear that he has violated the intent of the
free service.  As a free speech absolutist (I don't even
believe in copyrights or slander suits) and a dedicated
anarchist, I nonetheless don't see any problem with an implied
contract approach to legislation.  Legally define an open SMTP
server as an offer to send limited, relevant, personally-
directed mail to the people served by it.  Other uses can
then be treated as torts.  It's really not as hard to make
those distinctions as it seems; a jury can handle it easily.

You've got to be kidding.  A physical breach of your property is illegal. 
Really.  This is as it should be.  They should have your consent any time
YOU want.  I am not sure how you got what you said from what I said--
that is, I am sure that you did not.

The reason that there are no (or few) products on the market to prevent
this is that the market was not allowed to solve the problem before laws

He can only choose to use his machine.  If he uses yours, it is because
YOU let him.  Without coming into your house, he can only affect your
fax machine to the precise extent that you are willing to let him do so,
which implies consent on your part.

For instance, my fax machine is not usually turned on.  I turn it on
only when I choose to receive a fax from someone who has notified
me that they are sending one.  *I* control my fax machine, and others
can only use it when I choose.

Lessee.  Most people pay about $20 for a month of internet.  If they are
subscribed to a few lists, and use the web, they will see about 3 spams
a day in email, and download three or four ad banners with every page
the look at on the web.  Those 3 spams a day are less than one percent
of the total bandwidth that such an average person receives, meaning 
that at the most, they cost him 20 cents a month.  This is trivial. 
However, I agree that the spammers should pay the costs of their use
of bandwidth -- I just disagree that they should be criminally penalized
for the lack of "pay as you go" standards on the 'net.

Who forces you to pay your internet provider?  If the internet
were a pay as you go system, you would pay for *sending*,
not receiving.  The problem here is that the recipient bears the
cost of whatever is sent.  If the sender must pay the recipient
to receive data (even the most trivial charge would be 
sufficient), it would hardly affect the costs for most, but would
put the "cost of spam" on the spammer.  I do not think that this
would eliminate spam entirely, but it would allow people who
dislike spam to set a high threshold on incoming mail.  This 
would mean that spammers pay exactly what it is worth to the
recipient to spam them, and can choose to spam only those
who are not bothered much by it, as junk mailers do now.

Sounds all fine and dandy. Yet how do you force ISPs to charge per email? As I
recall, that was how it used to be with most non-institutional email providers. It
quickly devolved to the way it is today. Now here is a market driven solution that I
thought up that only depends on standardized use of micropayments, and enables the
receivers to cause the spammers to pay the cost of communicating with them:

Set the ISP mail servers up with a daemon such that any person with an email account
can establish a list of preferred correspondents, which the email user does not
charge a 1-5 cent fee. Anyone else who is unknown to the email box owner must pay
the entry fee to communicate with the email box owner. If the owner chooses not to
put them on his preferred list, they must either pay the charge or get bounced. The
charges that others pay can go toward the mail box owners monthly ISP fees....

How about that? I'm sure that spammers will either go broke or fade into
obsolescence....

Another anti-spam technology was proposed by Adam Back on the cypherpunks
mailing list.  You would add a new header to your mail which proved that
you had done a large computation that was specific to that message.
For example, take the recipient, the subject, and the date, and then
encrypt them with a random key.  Take the output of that and encrypt
again, and repeat this step 1,000,000 times.  Put the resulting value
and key in the mail header.

The recipient's mail agent can reproduce the calculation and verify that
everything checks out.  Otherwise the mail is rejected as spam (deleted
or at least filtered into a special bin where you can glance at it later
before deleting).

(The full idea is somewhat more complex in terms of dealing with mailing
lists, etc.  But there are ways of handling these extra details.)

The calculation takes only a second or so per piece of email, so it is an
insignificant cost for most users.  But spammers who send out thousands of
emails must now customize each one with separate headers and a separate
computation.  The total computational costs for them are much higher and
it automatically puts a limit on how much spam they can afford to send.

Unlike micropayment schemes, this approach does not require a banking
system or any trusted third parties.  All it takes is agreement on the
specific protocol to use for calculating the special header, and for
the spam problem to grow bad enough that people bother to implement the
needed code.

Uh, someone mentioned that idea about two days ago; it's the most commonly
suggested free-market solution. If spammers are imposing costs on email
users, then make the spammers pay the email users to read the mail.

I'd just like to remind everyone that this is an open issue.  My claim
has always been that, to our knowledge, this applies _only_ to a
constant intelligence - a constant intelligence, repeatedly examining
the same problem, _may_ eventually run out of steam.  Over a wider range
of history, a pattern of breakthroughs and bottlenecks is apparent -
running out of steam is only temporary, until a new stimulus breaks the
deadlock.  Again, this is for constant intelligence.

If the domain is the improving intelligence itself, the problem may
never arise.  Any increment in intelligence, achieved by applying the
current problem-solving methods, may give rise to new problem-solving
methods.  I can't know that for an AI trajectory, of course.  My
knowledge is limited to a short range around current levels of
intelligence, and the behavior exhibited here is that most major
bottlenecks yield to a very slight intelligence enhancement.  I assume,
for lack of a better-supported alternative, that this behavior is
universal along the trajectory.

Few here would care to speculate about ultimate limits that will apply
not merely to our first crude AIs but to the utmost efforts of galactic
civilizations a billion years hence.  What is any temporary bottleneck
on such a scale?  With time, and advancement, such things will crumble -
or so we believe.  But an intelligence enhancement is just as poisonous
to bottlenecks as a million years of plugging away.

Our history has trained us to find eternal bottlenecks absurd. 
Bottlenecks which somehow stand up to enhanced intelligence are just as silly.

The problem should be NP.  Thus my mail software only takes a
millisecond to verify the message, but the spammer still takes a second
to send it.  (Otherwise you've increased their sending costs, but also
my annoyance on the other end.)

I cannot see any possible benefit of legislating netiquette that
outweighs the near-certain disaster.  Information must flow freely or it
will not flow at all.  That includes spam, and adult sites, and abortion
death threats, and child pornography, because outlawing these things
would accomplish nothing; no more than outlawing drugs has decreased the
number of drug users, or outlawing encryption will prevent terrorists
from typing in the source code from "Applied Cryptography".

What it would accomplish is to increase transaction costs and prevent
information from flowing freely.  It would have the same effect as a tax
on downloading Web pages.  It would make every ISP liable for not
keeping up in the technological arms race that is certain to begin.

If spam technology becomes a serious annoyance, users will result to
serious filter technology to keep it out.  Legislation would be futile
and ineffective, except in the "effect" of creating laws or transaction
costs that would cripple legal technological advancement.

This is a classic case of Yudkowsky's Third Threat:
"Attempting to suppress a technology only inflicts more damage."

Yes, you're absolutely right.  I was remembering the idea incorrectly.

The actual idea was more like requiring the sender to find a random
value such that hash (rand, to, subject, date) produces output that
has some specified form, like 21 low bits of zeros, where hash() is a
cryptographic one-way hash function.  This would require on the average
trying one million different random values before you find one that works.
However the recipient can check it instantly.

To be specific:  Instead of sending out one untraceable advertisement
for their product, a spammer will send out ten advertisements for ten
products, nine of which are completely innocent bystanders.  How can you
tell who to prosecute?  The real spammers will go completely unchecked;
meanwhile, Anders Sandburg will get sued into the ground every time he
reviews a nootropic.

You will find that this is not as much legend - remember that these jerks
are in business selling "targeted" lists and promising minimal "dead"
addresses.  The way they make sure the address is good is your sending
them a remove message from a working address.  Voila' and you are now a
confirmed valid email address which can be placed on the "platinum
targeted active-email-address-only list."

The current urban legend is that replying to this link will only get you more
spam.  My experience is that each mail server has its own policy for reporting
and dealing with the stuff.  If yours doesn't, there are now quite a few free
mail servers (i.e., Netscape, Excite) who do.

I like it....do you mind if I forward that idea along to my ISP.  Being that
it is AOL I doubt there will be any action taken but certainly no action will
be taken otherwise.

Not in my experience.

Sometimes I get as many as several hundred spam(s) per hour.

It's really annoying.

There is a big difference between supressing technology and making technology
pay for its externalizations. Spam is specifically designed to be almost total
externalized cost, which is why it is such a threat. Using legal mechanisms or
market pressure to make technologies pay their externalized costs will not
supress the rate of technological advancement in the long term (i.e. more than a
few years), since the bandwidth waste that spam causes is as bad as smog, toxic
waste, or other types of pollution. They are evidence of a technology which
wastes resources, is inefficient. Maximizing technological growth depends on
minimizing the utility costs of productive work in an economic system. Spam is
none of these.--

 Not at all, though others claim to have suggested it as well... it seems rather
obvious.

My big question is why is it that spammers are allowed to email with fraudulent
headers anyways. ..

Apologies if this is not of interest to those on this list.  However,
Rand is a philosopher who has had a big impact -- for better or

This is a follow-up to an earlier announcement; I received many 
inquiries about this book from PNS subscribers.  This follow-up 
includes additional information about the just-published volume:
It is February 2, 1999, the 94th anniversary of Ayn Rand's birth - - 
and the publication day for a landmark anthology that engages Rand's 
system of thought from the diverse perspectives of contemporary 
feminism.
FEMINIST INTERPRETATIONS OF AYN RAND, co-edited by Mimi Reisel 
Gladstein and Chris Matthew Sciabarra, has been published by Penn 
State Press as part of its series, "Re-Reading the Canon." 
 Ultimately, this series will feature more than twenty volumes, each 
devoted to another major philosopher in the Western canon.  Rand takes 
her place alongside such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, 
and Nietzsche.
The Rand volume, printed simultaneously in paperback and clothbound 
editions, features four reprinted articles and fifteen original 
essays.  Contributors are:  Barbara Branden, Nathaniel Branden, Diana 
Mertz Brickell, Susan Love Brown, Susan Brownmiller, Mimi Reisel 
Gladstein, Thomas Gramstad, Melissa Jane Hardie, Barbara Grizzuti 
Harrison, Valerie Loiret-Prunet, Wendy McElroy, Karen Michalson, 
Camille Paglia, Sharon Presley, Robert Sheaffer, Joan Kennedy Taylor, 
Barry Vacker, and Judith Wilt.
To find out more information about the volume and its contributors, 
point your browser to:
http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/femstart.htm
Penetrating reviews of this controversial and provocative book can be 
found on the website.
A structured, moderated discussion of this explosive volume will begin 
on March 1, 1999 on the Randian-Feminism on-line discussion list.  For 
further information on this list, and the discussion, point your

we may be seeing just the tip of the iceberg of the spam problem.

lee daniel crocker used the analogy of the dish of free mints.  the
fate of those mints would be much different, depending on whether
it was located in the dining room of an upscale english country club
or alternately placed on the streetcorner of the poor section of
bombay.  hungry people could scarcely conceive any
logical reason not to devour every mint right on the spot.

altho the internet today is populated by the technosophisticated,
i expect it to go down-market as cheaper and simpler computers
and internet services become available.  this may cause the internet
to become populated by those who cannot imagine any reason
not to spam our brains out in the hope of earning a few ill-gotten
dollars.   dammit.  {8-[   spike

It's also very odd.  I wonder why it is that some people seem to
get enormous amounts like this, and others, like myself, hardly
every see any?

Actually, I think it would be simpler to just charge everybody a
small fee to receive data.  Then it would always be the sender 
paying, except when the receiver is willing to pay in advance
for what the sender would be sending (such as a request to 
send to a browser).

I suppose it depends.

I frequent a chat room on AOL a lot.  Spammers troll AOL chat rooms for email
addresses...

what a horrible thought.

And the commercials are the BEST part of Tv.

Well Mike, in the unlikely event that you're successful with this case, it
will be the end of anonymous remailers in the US... and will just make more
spammers move offshore. Thanks a bunch.

Yeah, the best way to avoid spam is not to have an AOL account; spammers love
AOL for some reason. Almost all the millions of spam messages sent out with
forged unicorn.com email addresses in the past were sent to AOL.

I guess you can't easily switch to another ISP when you're moving around so
much.

             Up in the Sky!
             It's a Bird,
             It's a Plane, 
             It's Znamya!

             By J. Kelly Beatty

             Six years ago Russian space officials conducted an
orbital test of a 20-meter-wide (65-ft) reflector called Znamya, the
Russian word for banner.  The spinning space mirror directed a
4-km-wide (2=-mile) spot of reflected sunlight along a swath of
Europe that lay in predawn darkness. Although much of the target area
was blanketed by clouds, a few observers reported seeing a
1-second-long flash nearly as bright as the full Moon.

             Buoyed by this success, the Russians will attempt to
deploy another giant reflector, dubbed Znamya 2.5, on February
4th. With a diameter of 25 meters, this version incoporates design
improvements that should spread the aluminized 5-micron-thick plastic
sheet more evenly when it is spun out at 1= revolutions per
second. Furthermore, Mir cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev
will orient the reflector by remote control, keeping it trained on
ground targets for one or two minutes at a time.

             If all this works as planned, during the 16-hour test
several cities in North America and Europe could find themselves
briefly bathed in artificial light 5-10 times brighter than the full
Moon in the hours after sundown. Observers far outside Znamya 2.5's
directed beam will see the spacecraft outshining virtually every star
as it coasts across the sky in an orbit 360 km (225 miles) high. The
spacecraft should be separated by a few hundred meters, which means
they should look like a dazzling "double star? when viewed through
binoculars.

             The following timetable was supplied by the Space Regatta
Consortium in Moscow on January 31st. However, since then the orbit of
the Mir space station has been adjusted three times. Consequently, Sky
& Telescope believes these times may be in error by as much as 10
minutes. For example, our predictions show that Mir will pass over
Calgary from 6:21 to 6:23 p.m. local time. Therefore, we suggest that
you check our predictions for the passages of Mir and Znamya over your
location. (Click here if you are in North America and here if you are
elsewhere worldwide.) If those predictions show that the spacecraft
are passing nearly overhead any time on the evening of February 4th,
you could potentially see the flash of Znamya?s reflected light.

                                   released 



             This cosmic klieg light is the brainchild of the Space
Regatta Consortium (SRC), a partnership involving seven Russian
aerospace management and engineering organizations. Vladimir
Syromyatnikov, SRC's general director, hopes the Znamya test will lead
to whole constellations of space mirrors orbiting 1,500 to 4,500 km
(1,000 to 3,000 mi) up. With a diameter of 200 meters (650 feet), each
satellite could beam down a disk of light as wide as a city and 100
times the Moon's brightness. Syromyatnikov imagines such spacecraft
being used to illuminate high-latitude regions of Earth in the hours
after sunset or before sunrise, ostensibly to improve the spirits and
productivity of those forced to endure long, dark winters. The
orbiting beacons might also provide emergency lighting for cities
during disasters.  Syromyatnikov even envisions using SRC's solar-sail
technology to propel interplanetary spacecraft using sunlight alone or
to power orbiting observatories.

             However, the prospect of an armada of giant space mirrors
hardly comes as a delight to astronomers. "We're having enough trouble
battling light sources on the ground," contends Daniel W. E. Green
(Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). "To have to deal with
sources from the sky is very disheartening." Some preemptive action
has already been taken by radio astronomer Woodruff T. Sullivan
(University of Washington). In his role as General Secretary of the
International Astronomical Union (IAU), Johannes Andersen (Univ. of
Copenhagen) is trying to persuade the United Nations to recognize the
night sky as an important part of Earth's environment and to protect
it from encroachment by artificial satellites. An international
symposium on the subject will be held in July.

             All this negative reaction is not lost on SRC
officials. According to Chris Faranetta, a spokesman for SRC partner
Energia Ltd., the consortium has pledged to conduct a full
environmental-impact assessment prior to full-scale
development. Faranetta also points out that few observatories exist in
the far-northern regions that the SRC hopes to illuminate. An open
letter to astronomers on SRC's Web site (http://src.space.ru) offers
the hope that these "extremist experiments" will someday provide
scientists with "unique tools for real exploration of the farthest
corners of the universe."

Not necessarily. It would not be hard at all for anonymous remailers to put a
cap on the number of emails that can be sent in a given time period, or that
have identical byte counts or identical subject lines or a limit on the number
of 'cc:' addresses allowed on a message. If they were truly interested in
contributing to a solution they would institute policies like this. Since they
are not, they are colluding.

At least if they move offshore, there can definitely be some limits put on the
traffic. Note the limits the telcos have put on phone traffic to the Dominican
Republic and other Carribean nations (as well as some African countries)
because of the amount of wire fraud that originates from those countries. I
recall a few years ago that I had to establish a special connection with one of
my manufacturers in St Kitts because AT&T had blocked all calling card calls to
and from that island.

Well, yes.  My comments in the previous post really only apply to
human-level intelligence - I was trying to stick with claims we can actually

Well, if we're going to speculate I'd suggest a slightly more complex
picture.  For an entity with a fixed intelligence, working to improve
problem-solving techniques in a fixed domain, the effort required seems to
follow an exponential curve.  You get lots of big wins very easily in the
beginning, then the going starts to get tough, and eventually you reach a
point where any further improvement seems impossible.

However, this simply means that a particular approach has been exhausted.
If you have a whole population of entities with that same fixed intelligence
level, one of them will eventually find a way to reformulate the problem in
completely different terms.  Then you start another exponential improvement
curve.  This is where Robin Hanson's idea of IE's 'low-hanging fruit' breaks
down - it ignores the fact that breakthroughs are not simply a matter of
throwing more effort at the problem.  Finding a better way to approach the
problem is a matter of insight, not of number-crunching.

For an entity capable of improving its own cognitive abilities, this effect
might or might not yield fast open-ended progress.  IMO, the key variable is
the entity's initial set of abilities.  For a human it would still be a
hopeless task - I could spend decades optimizing a single ability, and have
little to show for the effort.  For an algorithmic AI the problem should be
much more tractable, for reasons you've already outlined.

True enough - the only real question is whether the first sentient AIs have
to wait for superhuman hardware speeds before they can Transcend.  However,
I don't really expect anyone who hasn't done AI programming to see that
without a lot of argument.  The human mind just doesn't seem to deal well
with this kind of claim - any functional memetic filter tends to reject it
out of hand.  That's why I went back to the basics on this thread, in hopes
of laying out enough of the underlying assumptions to show that the scenario
isn't just a 'Hollywood meme'.

 I've read it. They put together a lot of little psychological cues to
create the right moods for groups of people to solve problems that have
been bothering them. It's primarily oriented towards helping large companies
make important policy decisions. It isn't obvious why it works, but the
testimonials sound impressive.
 It isn't obvious that Foresight senior associates will come with enough
agreement about what problems they are trying to solve for these techniques
to be effective. How to build an assembler or how to prevent gray goo are
overly ambitious for that kind of meeting. How to change the focus of
CritSuite to make it more popular would be the kind of problem that would
be more appropriate, but there will be lots of people there who aren't
interested in that subject.

How strange. I read Usenet almost every day, so I can't quite understand
how the spammers have killed it; in fact I rarely see any spam ad in there
these days. One reason for that is that rather than arguing for pointless
laws, people went out and started cancelling the spams. Technical solutions

Indeed. That's why us good men are so concerned about you evil anti-spam
freaks who don't seem to have a clue as to the effects of your proposed
laws on non-spammers. You want to sacrifice our freedom and privacy for
your supposed safety. We don't want that.

You cannot stop spam with laws unless those laws are globally enforced
and all traces of Internet privacy is eliminated. That means no
anonymity, no encryption, and ID checks before anyone is allowed on the
Net. That is evil, and you and Mike and the other anti-spam freaks are
the worst threat to freedom on the Net today.

I can only assume that aliens have kidnapped Mike and replaced him with
a government-loving fascist clone, because he's usually far more sensible
than he has been recently.

Yes, it's a fun little hike.;) I went up there in the summer of 1997 with
about ten paleontologists as part of the Second International Trilobite
Conference for which I wrote the field guide.

Here is a QuickTime VR panorama taken on the day I went up there:

http://www.ualberta.ca/~spencer/jason/Burgess_Shale_Panorama.mov
(Credit for the shot goes to Jay Holmes of the Museum of Natural History.
Extra points for lugging the tripod up there.)

I also put together a bibliography of papers relating to the shale:

http://www.ualberta.ca/~spencer/jason/biblio.html

and here's me in a very awkward Gouldian pose. This shot (as well as
Gould's in _Wonderful_Life_ is actually taken at Raymond's Quarry, just
above Walcott's -- the shale itself:

Gould brings some things (back) into the public eye now and then. I
wouldn't really say anything else nice about him. IMO he tends to be more
misleading than not. (Some of his older work on heterochrony was good,
however). Also, for people like me who can't stand baseball, his
_Full_House_ is a tiresome read since he uses endless baseball analogies to
illustrate a fairly simple statistical point.

The Burgess Shale IMO has limited importance in explaining the patterns of
past life as a whole, as there is little material for comparison. Some of
the attention given to the shale may be a distraction from more useful
research. Overall the attention is of course beneficial as it increases the
public interest in Paleontology necessary for work to continue.

I have found that the spam content on usenet is more a matter of the time of
day, and how well administrators/moderators control their group's content.
Active administratiors will run frequent cancelbots on spammers. Less
experienced or less involved administrators tend to let things run amok. Since
bulk emailers tend to mail late at night or early in the morning, they usually
mail at least 10-16 hours before the typical casual admin logs on and cleans
house. Admins who keep it up on their screens all day tend to run frequent
cancelbots.

That is a load of crap. There is a big difference between mandating that From
and Reply-To addresses are real addresses from which the mail actually
originated (even if the mailer is an anonymous one), and using fraudulent
header information, which is the typical spammer tactic to avoid retribution.

More crap. Nobody is more pro-freedom than I. I, however, am mature enough,
unlike others, to recognize that with power and freedom comes responsibility
and accountability. Freedom cannot exist for long without personal integrity.

If you've read my posts, I do not want government mandates if the market can
develop mechanisms to cause spammers to pay their way.

If the market (you, me, and everyone) refuses to acknowledge that there is a
problem, or refuses to do something about it in a self regulatory manner, then
it is eventually gonna piss off enough powerful people that something is gonna
be done at a political level whether you like it or not.

Government has always loved to use abuses in systems as excuses to regulate and
take over markets. This only occurs when the parties in the market refuse to do
something about a problem.

I want to keep the internet a tax free, free speech, free encryption, and
generally do as you please zone. The only way it is going to stay that way is
if people start taking personal responsibility and taking action to prevent the
sort of abuses of the system which will invite the jack booted storm troopers
in the door.

I was talking with a high school buddy the other day, who happens to own
a gun shop. I asked him how the new Brady Bill II requirements for
insta-checks on all gun buyers was working. He said the following
interesting things:

a) the ATF and FBI refuse to acknowledge the actual number of people who
have been rejected by the insta-check system, or of the number of these
people who have been or will be arrested, prosecuted or convicted for
the felony act of attempting to purchase a firearm by a previously
convicted felon. The 'actual' numbers are supposedly around 13,000
felons who have been 'prevented' from purchasing guns, according to
Handgun Control, Inc., Sarah Brady's little fascist movement. They
acknowledge that NOT ONE person has been arrested, charged, tried, or
convicted yet for these felonious acts, but they claim that (apparently
they, unlike anyone on the pro-gun side, can get inside information, in
violation of federal regulations) "investigations, which take time, are
pending", which obviously could mean anything. Pending in the round
file...

b) the methodology of the Handgun Control Inc's numbers are as follows:
    i) if the application is instantly refused for any reason, count it
as a 'prevented gun purchase by a felon', even if it is not a felony,
even if the offense that is in the database is not qualified to prevent
a gun purchase.
    ii) if the application is not refused within 3 days, and the person
is legally allowed to buy the gun, as per the regs, but something later
comes up (it apparently does not have to be a felony to make a hiccough
in the system), then that is also counted as a 'prevented gun purchase
by a felon', even though the person has actually been allowed to buy the
gun and may have it in his or her posession for as much as 6 months
before the feds catch up with the paperwork.
   iii) if the application is not refused within 3 days, and the person
is allowed to take the gun home 3 days after the purchase, and the ATF
actually does not have any problem with the person, it is still counted
as a 'prevented gun purchase by a felon'.
   iv) if the application is not refused within 3 days, but the person
is a former felon (it is possible to get a felony conviction expunged
from your record if its not a violent felony and if you jump through
certain hoops) but the ATF does not come through with the approval code
for the purchase within 3 months (even though the purchaser has been
allowed to take the gun home), it is still counted as a 'prevented gun
purchase by a felon'.

So it seems like the HCI propaganda is most probably a complete
smokescreen to justify their lobbying. Unfortunately the Clinton's and
the Gore's are touting the stats right out of the HCI press releases as
if they are fact, and the public is eating it up like gospel. Even
congressional Republicans are repeating the anti-gun spin.

What is the Harm? you might ask. Well, for starters, people are being
prevented from being able to arm themselves against imminent danger,
which has already caused several deaths, mostly of women who were killed
by their husbands with illegally obtained firearms. Not only that, but
the system is adding around $10 to the cost of every gun purchase or
repair (note: if you take your gun in for service, you have to go thru
the insta-check system to get your gun back, and you may not get it back
for several extra days while they hold it pending the check). Gun shops
have to pay for the cost of extra phone lines to use for the instacheck
modems/thin-clients, and for the long distance charges (it apparently
does not function yet over the internet). Moreover, the feds are holding
onto the records of your gun purchases for at least 6 months, and they
want to hold onto the information for as much as 18 months, all of which
is in violation of the law requiring that the information be destroyed
immediately after approval is granted.

There is now a fairly effective way to block most SPAM.
There are two web-based organizations that maintain
lists of IP addresses that are SPAM-friendly or SPAM-neutral,
and there are mail helper client that can use these lists
automatically to delete anything from these IP addresses.

One service is ORBS, and the other is MAPS.

ORBS is a list of "open relays" that have been used by SPAMMERs.
an open relay is an SMTP server that will forward SMTP incoming
to SMTP outgouing without any checking whatsoever. Nearly all
open relays are simply sites whose sysadmins are clueless, not
places that are actually trying to help SPAMers. SPAMers probe
the net to find the sites. when a site is found, the SPAMer sends
a single e-mail to the site with thouhands of addresses, and the
site obligingly sends out thousands of individual e-mails. By
cutting off teh site and sending reject messages back to the postmaster
at that site whenever a SPAM is received, the anti-SPAM client
software eventually gets the sysadmin's attention, and the sysadmin
then reconfigs the mailer. ORBS isn't terribly choosy about
who gets on the list: anyone can send a candidate IP address, and
ORBS then does an automated test to see if it is an open realy.
If so, it goes on the list. ORBS periodically checks to see if the
site is still an open realy, if not, it comes off the list.

MAPS lists open relays and also lists other sites. Getting
listed and de-listed requires human intervention, so the lsit is
more accurate. It's run by a volunteers who are sysadmins, and it
looks very good.

The MAPS site did an experiment to check out the "remove" scheme.
they set up an e-mail address, and then wuse it for absolutely
nothing whatwoever but making a single "remove" request from
a single SPAM. Then the wait. sure enough, they start getting
SPAM from many sources. This is ome of their most effective
ways of identifying new SPAM-friendly sites.

The philosopy and tactics for the sites make fascenating reading.
Check them out.

First off laws which allow for the prosecution of businesses which
advertise via spam has absolutely *nothing* to do with encryption or
anonymity with the exception that the use of falsified headers IN SPAM is
treated as the fraud it is.  If you do not plan on marketing your wares on
the net via spamvertizing you have nothing to fear from this.

Are you familiar with the law against junk faxes?  When it was first
proposed there were people crying out "it is the end of civilization and
free speach (tm) etc. etc."  Well the law has been in place for a number
of years, and has upheld on appeals, and you are still able to practice
your freedom of speech (except by sending unsolicited faxes to people) and
you still have anonymity and the country has not turned into a police
state which makes you implant a tracking chip in your arm.

Legislation is one part of the solution to ending unsolicited
commercial/bulk email.  Actions by honest ISP's who remove spammers from
their network after fining them $200-$1000 on their credit cards is
another part of it.  Making it unprofitable and to risky to spam and use
of the RBL, ORCA, ORBS, DSSL are another tool as is filtering during the
SMTP session.  

This is simply anti-theft and anti-netabuse legislation.  If you are not
stealing from people and hijacking other peoples mail servers and network
feeds you have nothing to fear.  Talk to the owners of the ISP's who have
had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to protect their
networks from the criminals and ask them what they think of spamming and
about laws to curb it.  You can start with nick@pbi.net - they had to
spend $500,000 to protect PacBellInternet from the spammers.

As for the ad hominem attack I won't reply with the same.  I prefer
arguments of logic rather than insulting the people I'm carrying on a
dialogue with - its much more effective.

How strange. I read Usenet almost every day, so I can't quite understand
how the spammers have killed it; in fact I rarely see any spam ad in there
these days. One reason for that is that rather than arguing for pointless
laws, people went out and started cancelling the spams. Technical solutions
to technical problems.

>"All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing."

Indeed. That's why us good men are so concerned about you evil anti-spam
freaks who don't seem to have a clue as to the effects of your proposed
laws on non-spammers. You want to sacrifice our freedom and privacy for
your supposed safety. We don't want that.

You cannot stop spam with laws unless those laws are globally enforced
and all traces of Internet privacy is eliminated. That means no
anonymity, no encryption, and ID checks before anyone is allowed on the
Net. That is evil, and you and Mike and the other anti-spam freaks are
the worst threat to freedom on the Net today.

I can only assume that aliens have kidnapped Mike and replaced him with
a government-loving fascist clone, because he's usually far more sensible
than he has been recently.

Duh, as someone has already pointed out, you bounce any mail message which
comes from an unexpected email address and doesn't include fifty cents of
'postage' for you. You can still subscribe to lists, your friends can still
mail you, and you make money from spam. This is a free market solution to
spam; make the spammers pay for it.

Boy, isn't it amazing how so many free-market advocates become rabid
authoritarian fascist government-loving scum when one of their hot buttons
is pressed? Michael, how are you going to enforce this rule without a
global government? How would you enforce this rule in a PPL society? I
can only assume that like so many others you haven't actually sat down
and considered the implications of the policies you espouse in other
messages to the list. I have, and I've decided that I'm willing to live
with the problems of free markets in order to gain the benefits. Spam is
one of those problems.

>I have the right to refuse to receive any class of

Indeed. Just as you can install a filter to delete spam. Just as you can
get an email account with an ISP who will filter spam for you.

Of course the interstate commerce clause was never intended to be used as
a general power for enforcing these kind of laws; would you argue that
the government has the power to ban commercial interstate sale of firearms?

But more to the point: why would a Russian spammer care about US laws? If
these laws are passed, why won't US spammers just move overseas to countries
with better things to worry about than junk email? Why will US laws do
*anything* to stop spammers, rather than being used to persecute people
like you who post mislabelled messages to email lists?

Ironically, most of the "anti-spam" legislation being
currently debated in state houses is in fact decidedly
/pro/-spam, much of it lobbied for by the DMA (the
Deceitful--er, Direct--Marketing Association, who has
a much bigger lobby than the ISP industry.  Most of it
outlaws things like forged headers or mandates use of
remove lists while explicitly allowing the act itself,
which might otherwise be prosecuted as a tort (either
harassment of the recipient or usurpation of thousands
of dollars worth of badwidth and disk space for a
large ISP).

Let us not make the mistake of thinking that the
definitions of trespass in cyberspace are easy to define
by analogy to old-world technologies like gates, locks,
signs, and such.  ALL definitions of tortious acts--
from assault to theft and many more--are matters of
degree with lines drawn by consensus, no matter how
much we would like there to exist objective definitions
for them.  Legislation is an appropriate way to codify
consensus in matters like this (for example, "no hunting"
signs must be a certain size and frequency around a
property to have legal effect; certain advertisements
are considered a binding offer of contract; noises and
smells have to reach a certain level to be considered
a nuisance to neighbors; etc.)  Without such ways to
codify nebulous boundaries, we reach the absurd and
well-known "breathing is a trespass" problem of rigid
libertarian doctrine.

AOL Lobbies for High-Speed Cable

 AOL Lobbies for High-Speed Cable
 	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America Online is part of a lobbying coalition
 formed Wednesday with the aim of getting access to high-speed
 Internet and data lines controlled by cable TV companies.
 	   The announcement of the OpenNet coalition comes almost a week
 after the Federal Communications Commission decided not to open a
 proceeding that would force cable companies to share high-speed
 lines with their competitors.
 	   Still, the FCC said it would keep an eye on the matter to ensure
 that consumers' options for Internet service are not restricted.
 	   Access to the technology has pitted the cable industry against
 AOL and consumer and interest groups and has produced an intense
 lobbying battle over what the FCC and Congress should do.
 	   The coalition's ``scheme would surely slow broadband
 deployment,'' said National Cable Television Association President
 Decker Anstrom.
 	   In addition to AOL, others involved in the coalition are:
 MindSpring Enterprises, Prodigy Communications Corp., Netscape, US
 West, MCI WorldCom, Cable & Wireless USA, Washington Association of
 Internet Service Providers, CyberRamp Internet Services,
 Bertelsmann Internet Services, ConnectNet and the Texas Internet
 Service Providers Association.
 	   US West President Sol Trujillo, attending a conference here,
 told reporters that his company will press lawmakers for
 legislation giving companies access to cable's high-speed lines. He
 also said US West will seek legislation permitting it and the
 nation's four other Bell companies to move data across local
 calling boundaries, something they aren't allowed to do now.
 	   AOL and MindSpring also were among groups urging the FCC to
 force cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. to provide rivals access
 to its high-speed lines as a condition of merging with AT&T.
 Analysts are saying the FCC is not expected to impose that
 condition on the merger.

It most certainly was. It was meant to give the congress the power to a) tax
interstate commerce to pay for externalized costs which a primitive colonial market
does not manage well, b) regulate what commercial exchanges go on between the
states. Remember that most state legislators and governors saw themselves as their
own sovereign nations, and the act of confederation, and later the act of
federation was merely a matter of establishing standards of human rights,
interstate relations and trade, and relations and trade with nations not part of
the federal compact. They looked at the federal government much as many people are
starting to look at the UN and other international bodies, which is why the
Senators in the federal Senate were appointed by the state governor and confirmed
by the state legislature, instead of directly elected by the people.

Why the banning of the interstate sale of firearms is pointedly illegal and
unconstitutional is because it directly conflicts with the 2nd Amendment, with no
conflicts with other rights that are reserved. Spam, on the other hand, while on
the part of the spammer is a 1st Amendment issue, on the part of the spammee it is
an 9th and 10th Amendment issue of state and individual rights to privacy and to
the setting of community standards (i.e.: what 'disturbing the peace' means), so
such a conflict imposes a quandary which must be defined by the courts. The courts
have stated that spam is a form of illegal cost transfer, harassment, and can
amount to theft of electronic services.

Because the Constitution explicitly states that the feds do have authority to
regulate international commerce and communications, and to negotiate and ratify
treaties, the feds can easily put up outright blocks or merely  tariffs on foreign
spammers, on foreign servers, on foreign software companies, etc. to make them pay
the cost of their externalizations. Foreign spammers are actually the easiest ones
to deal with when it comes to the government. Because the internet has defense
related capacities, the feds can also easily cancelbot foreign spammers on the
grounds of national security, which falls under the 'guarding the coast'  and
'managing and regulating the waterways' clauses of the Constitution. They do not
need any new laws to do any of this, they already have the authority.

So spam sent through anonymous remailers will be totally legal because
the remailer puts a 'real' email address on the message? Spam from 'real'
email addresses will be totally legal? Gee, that will really reduce the
amount of spam I get.

Duh, that law requires every fax to include a valid telephone number that
it was sent from. It *bans* fax anonymity. Get a clue sometime.

Bullshit. Anyone who wants anonymity and privacy on the Net has everything
to fear from fanatics like you and Mike. If spam is legal when sent through
anonymous remailers then spammers will just use them. If it's not, then
anonymous remailers will be shut down completely and utterly, and there
will be no more anonymity on the Net.

As far as I'm aware, I'm the only person on this list who's had to waste
days dealing with spammer attacks on his domain. And I'm the one who's
arguing against rabid, abusive anti-spam laws. You just don't seem to 
have a clue as to what you're asking for.

Then give us some logic. Answer some questions. Stop making assertions
which have no basis in reality. And stop claiming that you're the good
guys and we're supporting the "evil" spammers, when you're trying to
enforce a police state on the Net. Erase the anti-spam fanatic memes
from your head and start dealing with reality.

The vast number of groups (probably 99.9%) have no moderator, and most of 
those groups contain far more posts from idiots than spam. Since those posts
from idiots waste my time, being mis-labeled to make me think that they
may actually have something to say, I'm going to be charging each idiot
$500 per message in future. It's the only way to get the idiots off Usenet
before they destroy it.

Which has no effect on Usenet because of propagation delays; a message sent
through a mail-to-news gateway early in the morning may not get to you until
that evening. In any case, someone somewhere is reading Usenet at any time
of day, so the spams can be spotted and cancelled.

And the difference is? I don't see any difference at all, so I think
you're going to have to explain it to me. And as with Netsurfer you're
going to have to explain how you can retain anonymous remailers if they're
going to be hit with thousand dollar fines every time they allow a spam
through. Answer: you can't. You and your friends will kill anonymity on
the Net. Thanks.

>to avoid

Note: "retribution". Is that how you see yourself Mike? The wrath of God
descending from heaven to smite the evil spammers? With no concern about
a few collateral casualties? This kind of nonsense is what's destroying
any pretence at civilization today.

>More crap. Nobody is more pro-freedom than I.

So why are you pushing to destroy anonymity and privacy on the Net? How
can you have "retribution" against spammers if they're anonymous?

>Freedom cannot exist for long without personal integrity.

Indeed. When people rush out at the slightest provocation calling for
Big Mummy to save them from the evil XYZ (XYZ == spammers, terrorists,
drug dealers, whatever the evil-of-the-day may be) freedom cannot last.

>If you've read my posts, I do not want government mandates if the market

Yet almost everything you've talked about involves the use of the government
legal system against spammers.

>Government has always loved to use abuses in systems as excuses to regulate

>refuse to do something about a problem.

No, it occurs when people like you rush around claiming there's a big
problem when there isn't. It occurs when people like you ask Big Mummy
to make laws to protect them rather than protect themselves. I rarely
see spam because I have filters to delete it automatically. Why don't
you?

>I want to keep the internet a tax free, free speech, free encryption, and
>generally do as you please zone.

Then why are you pushing to ban anonymity? And encryption will follow
soon after so that ISPs can guarantee that their users aren't sending
encrypted spam out.

The way to keep the Internet a free zone is to stop pushing for laws to
regulate it. You don't make it more free by passing laws.

The government is going to cut Russia, China and the Third World off the
Net to stop spammers?!!?!? Get real.

And even if they do, that's a horrendous precedent to set. Once we accept
that the government should stop things passing over the Net that we
dislike, they'll immediately start blocking remailers, political web
sites, and anything else that is a threat to the government. I can't
believe that the Mike Lorrey of old would support government censorship
of the Net. Will the aliens please give us back the real one?

Well, as I've said before, I think it's an interesting example of people who
profess free-market ideas suddenly changing their minds when they are the
one who are suffering; it's easy to believe in freedom and the free-market 
when you're one of those who benefit, but it's a lot harder when you're 
losing because of it.

And this is an issue we're going to see more of. Even many people here who 
talk about the delights of nanotech and SIs are going to change their minds 
when the nanotech and SIs are actually here and threatening them. In my
experience most people are far more willing to accept ideas in the abstract
than to actually follow through in reality.

I don't know if you are purposely being ignorant or not. Any business with a
PBX and/or bundled quantities of phone lines gets montly traffic statements
tracking every incoming and outgoing call, where it came from, etc. Caller ID
is a wonderful thing. We may no know the name of the owner due to unpublished
phone numbers, but we can easily report the phone number to the phone company.
The fact that the user has violated the terms of use by acting illegally with
the phone number is sufficient to pierce the veil of anonymity the user has and
allows the victim or the phone company to pursure prosecution in either
criminal or civil venues.

Your error in logic is to assume that anonymous mailers might be financially
dependent upon the spammer customer base. If this is true, and they see nothing
wrong with that, then they are colluders, so screw them. If it is not true,
then they have nothing to fear from spammers getting shut down, and if it
really were true, then they would be doing something themselves to prevent spam
abuses thru their systems. I think shutting down spammers will force anonymous
remailers to evolve into a form that is much more responsible to the end
recipient than those at present, which in my mind is a good thing. If they
can't adapt, then let the market kill them off.

I haven't argued for laws. I have repeatedly said that I would prefer that the
members of the market show some responsibility and start self regulating to
limit the abuse. Stop revising my position to suit your argument. Its a bad
debate tactic that just makes you look dishonest, kinda like a spammer.

I can still be pro market and pro freedom while being anti-spammer. Its your
stuborn refusal to promote market base solutions or to even acknowledge that
spam is a problem that is preventing you from dealing with reality. So you gave
up on spam, too bad. I could be as rude as you are and start calling you a
quitter, but I won't.....

Yes, it is rather sad with some participants are so set in their ways and would

See why I'm so amused by your comments? You guys bring up laws when you
don't even know what the laws say. The law was passed well before 
widespread caller ID, and the law forced everyone to put a phone number 
on a fax. The law which Netsurfer said had nothing to do with anonymity 
*banned anonymous faxes*. And you call me ignorant.

>Your error in logic is to assume that anonymous mailers might be

See, you don't even have a clue about what anonymous remailers are or how
they work. Anonymous remailers take an incoming message, decrypt it, and
send it on. They don't charge -- though at some point, if you anti-spam
folks don't get them banned -- they probably will do. They have no way of
telling whether a message is spam, and they don't care. They don't censor
because it's not their job to do so.

>If this is true, and they see nothing
>wrong with that, then they are colluders,

THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE AS TO WHAT THE MESSAGES PASSING THROUGH THEM ARE,
OK, MIKE? Do you get it now? They get an encrypted message, they decrypt
it, and pass it on. The outgoing message may well be encrypted, the
incoming message may well have come from another remailer. The only
way they can stop spam is to read every outgoing message, decide whether
it may be spam according to the recipients subjective perception, and then
decide whether to pass it on. If the message is encrypted, they're screwed.

So any such law will kill the anonymity that some of us have fought so
hard to create. It will kill secure encryption, because no ISP will want
to let users send out messages which might be spam and with which they
might be considered to be 'colluding'.

And all for the sake of 'protecting' you from having to press the delete
key.

You can... but only by arguing for free-market solutions rather than
arguing for the government's right to censor the Net. 

>Its your

The free-market solutions are so obvious and widespread that I hardly
consider it a point worth discussing. You filter, you charge for email
from unknown email addresses, you bounce email which isn't signed by
a known sender, etc, etc. There are a thousand solutions for individual
users, that's the glory of the free market.

What's the problem? Ignore spam and people will come up with technical
solutions to it. Impose some supposed solution with laws and we'll be 
stuck with it for decades, and with the loss of freedom.

Meanwhile, as Lee pointed out, the spammers are working to get pro-spam
laws passed... and they have a lot more money than you do.

Spam sent through anonymous remailers will not be totally legal; while
spam sent through anonymous remailers will not violate sections of
antispam laws which mandate authentic headers, that same spam will
still violate cost transfer clauses or trespassing clauses or theft of
service clauses of those same laws.

Ad hominem again. No, what I was trying to say is that the "domino
effect" or "slippery slope" argument that passing the junk fax law
would end privacy and anonymity and collapse commercial use of
electronic communications simply did not happen.  And yes, there were
people making the same argument against the junk fax law as you make
against junk email law i.e. the end of anonymity, creation of a police
state, violation of my "free speach (tm)" etc.

Ad hominem again. See paragraph 1 above; these laws do not ban the use
of anonymous remailers.  They usually have clauses that state that
there are additional fines/punishments for falsifying headers in
UCE/UBE.  It does not state that UCE/UBE with valid headers is legal. 
For example, in the Texas bill under consideration there are one level
of penalties for simply sending UCE/UBE.  If you send UCE/UBE *and*
falsify headers, for example, by making it look like AOL or Juno or
Hotmail were the senders, it adds additional penalties on top of the
simple UCE/UBE penalties.  This is like the difference between robbery
and armed robbery.  Armed robbery usually carries stronger penalties
than simple robbery.  UCE/UBE with false headers will carry higher
penalties than UCE/UBE with valid headers.  Remember that when the
spammers try and make the spam look like it was sent by a non-involved
third party, it damages the reputation of that third party business. 
In fact one of the tactics the spammers use for retribution against
anti-'s is to send out glaringly abusive fake UCE/UBE which looks like
it was sent by the anti- (includes the anti-'s email address, ISP,
phone #, street address, etc) so that the anti- will get
grief/threats/etc. from the spammed recipients.  On NANAE or FREE or
SPAM-L this is known as being "Joed."

Ad hominem again. Every person on this list has already been the
victim of spamming as spam seems to make it through to the list
periodically.  Furthermore I have had to deal with spammer attacks on
my domains - that's why I started doing something about it instead of
just deleting it or ignoring it.  I responded by (1) customizing smap
and smapd from the fwtk (2) implementing tcpd (3) utilizing ORBS,
ORCA, the RBL, DSSL, (4) by joining anti-spam lists and (5) by
lobbying for stronger laws against UCE/UBE.

Ad hominem again.  I have given you logic.  I have answered your one
question above and replied to your many statements as well.  

An anti-spam law does not result in a police state on the net any more
than the junk fax law resulted in a police state on the telephone
network.

Hello Folks,

I'm looking for references to web sites/books/etc that discuss using
popular word processing systems (MS Word 97 in particular) to create
'intelligent documents', perhaps using template construction, etc to
make an organization's word processed output readily convertible to HTML
and/or other formats. Something that goes beyond 'looks good when
printed' to 'becomes a permanent and re-purposeable part of the
enterprise's knowledge base'.

Any references would be appreciated.

Thanks,
    -Mike

No, you continue to deny things which are blatantly true. You continue to
claim that the 'junk fax' law didn't end anonymity of faxes when it required
everyone to put a telephone number on their fax. Black is white. Freedom
is slavery. Identification is anonymity.

It will end anonymity (as both you and Mike have admitted), end secure
encryption, and give the governments yet another excuse to censor the
Net. What more could a police state want?

Sit back from your anti-spam crusade for a moment and think about the
consequences of your actions.

Maybe it is time to see about creating an Internet Standard for ways
of expressing "postage" or other distinguishing features of non-spam
email.

I could envision a new class of email, "high-value" or "high-priority"
email.  Eventually, virtually all non-spam email would migrate to
this category.  Sending high-value email would impose some costs on the
creator.  This could be in the form of "postage" as we discussed, or
it could be the result of a high-cost calculation like the cryptographic
hash collisions proposed by Adam Back, which I described earlier.

(I believe the latter has a number of advantages, as it does not require
an electronic payment infrastructure, and there is no danger of the
wrong person stealing the "postage", hence no need to encrypt the message,
and no requirement for an elaborate public key infrastructure.)

There could be multiple classes of this email, with each one taking
an order of magnitude more cost to produce.  As technology advances,
people could ratchet up their mail filters to require higher value mail.

The standardization effort would define algorithms for creating these
high-cost fields, and mail headers and formats to represent them.  Then
it would be a matter of publicizing them and getting software authors
to implement them.  It would be best if one or more email vendors were
involved with the effort from the beginning.

Internet Standards are the responsibility of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).  I looked over their working groups and didn't see
any existing and active ones which looked appropriate for this kind
of effort.  There is a group on "responsible use of the internet",
but their charter is just to produce advisory documents about
spam, not to define new mail formats.  You can read about them at
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/run-charter.html.

I am a co-author of an Internet Standard, RFC 2440, which is about PGP,
the security software I work on.  Most of my input was technical and I
didn't get too involved in the political/adminstrative work.  Probably
the next step will be to put out feelers to various interested parties.

If anyone knows of any existing efforts along these lines, please let
me know.

My main concern with Adam Back's scheme (the only one I've seen mentioned)
is that it's purely a cost to the sender, there's no benefit to the
recipient. Ideally it should be a transfer of value, but I can't think of
too many calculations that the average person would care much about.

But I think the idea of some kind of IETF standard is a good one, as it's
a lever for getting such systems incorporated into email software.

It made posting fraudulent numbers in the header an act of wire fraud, which it
should have obviously been prior to that.

Could you please stop LYING????
I never admitted that. I have specifically said that email can be anonymous AND
verified as coming from the source specified, just a anonymous digicash is.

Letting spam run amok is far more likely to trigger a police state type reaction
than the use of and enforcement of existing laws on these acts. We don't need
new laws, the ones we have are fine, they need to be enforced!

Adam's hashcash scheme is described at http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/hashcash/.
An academic paper with a similar (but more complex) idea is available
from: http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/Papers/CSreports/reps95/95-20.ps.Z.
That paper concludes with a comment like yours:

: Finally, the evaluation of the pricing function serves no useful purpose,
: except serving as a deterrent. It would be exciting to come up with a
: scheme in which evaluating the pricing function serves some additional
: purpose.

There is a problem, though, if the costly function evaluation actually
produces something valuable.  If it would be valuable to anyone (say,
some kind of useful simulation program output) then the spammers could
sell the output to make up for the cost of the computers to produce it,
and the bulk mail would no longer be costly to them.

If it were some kind of digital cash, then it requires encryption of
the data, which means that everyone has to know everyone else's keys.
This requires a large public key infrastructure and an electronic payment
infrastructure, and so it becomes much more complicated.

Performing a wasteful calculation may seem unaesthetic, but there
is actually considerable precedent.  Robin Hanson recommened a book
last summer called "The Handicap Principle, A Missing Piece of Darwin's
Puzzle", by Amotz Zahavi and Avishag Zahavi.  This describes applications
in biology of this same phenomenon, costly and wasteful expenditures of
effort in order to send a signal of quality and fitness.  Apparently the
same phenomenon has been observed in many areas of economics as well.
It may seem counter-intuitive, but sometimes being intentionally wasteful
is the best way to communicate.

Yes, placing a phone number in the header of the fax message was required, and
that it be the originating phone number. Putting a false number is wire fraud.
Now we get to issues of enforcement. It doesn't matter if its market based or
government based. How to find the guy who actually sent it? Unless the
individual was in your local calling area before the 1960's or 70's (depending
on where you are in the country), it was a long distance call. Since faxes did
not become cheap and affordable peices of equipment till the 80's we can pretty
much rule out that there aren't some records as to where the call came from, so
even though caller ID technology was not available to consumers until the early
90's, the data acquisition and extraction technologies, and the system
databases they interface with which Caller ID is based on have been in the
system for decades, and precede the anti-fax-spam legal history.

Some do, some don't. If they are doing it for fun and don't care about the
content, then they are colluders as much as Nazi party members were during the
Holocaust. You can legally be an accessory to a crime without knowledge that a
crime is being perpetrated. This is accepted legal doctrine, because so much
political and corporate espionage, as well as subversive and terrorist activity
takes place in systems organized as cell systems.

Yes I get it, and I was aware of it. However, as I pointed out above, ignorance
of criminal activity which you willfully enable does not absolve you of guilt
if your actions contributed to a crime. Ignorance is a mitigating circumstance,
granted, but it is not absolution. You can still be nailed on conspiracy as
well as negligence charges. If you knew you were operating in a state of
negligence then the ante can be upped...

Not necessarily. A mailer only needs to check that the incoming mail has header
information which is authentic, then decrypt the message, and ensure that the
decrypted message header has authentic header information in it. It can all
still be anonymous AND authenticated at the same time. You can deny it all you
want, but if this were not possible, then anonymous digital cash should not be
possible either. Since it is, then this scheme is.

You haven't read a damn thing I have said, have you!!????? I have repeatedly

If there are a thousand solutions, why have I, who spends a majority of my day
on the web, only heard of a few? If there are so many solutions, why have the
major browser/mail software makers not incorporated a single one in their
applications (outside of preventing me from changing my reply-to and from info
so that my email address cannot be so easily stripped)? If there are so many
solutions, why are there none integrated into the most widely used mail server
software programs? It is because most of the solutions are either not
consistent, too easy to get around, take too much work on the part of the user
to administer, rely on technology not currently available, or are too difficult
for the average garage ISP startup guy to set up to function reliably on his
servers.

Now, I do not advocate in any way the use of the government to pass new laws to
give enforcement agencies the ability to go after them (especially when most if
not all of the necessary laws already exist). I myself am pursuing a civil
action, which is consistent with libertarian PPL theory.

BTW, the DMA's lobbying on spam laws is almost entirely a matter of the battle
over 'opt-in' versus 'opt-out' systems. The current state of enforcement is as
if it were an 'opt-out' system, where you have to go and tell the DMA or others
that you want to be on the remove list (and the DMA is pretty good about
enforcing the proper use of their REMOVE list). Like any tool, when used
improperly, it is dangerous. The majority of spam abuse is not commited by DMA
members (and they don't remain members long if they do), but they do not give
their remove list out to non-members. Members that abuse their remove list wind
up with stiff penalties and can be nailed on intellectual property violations
for using the list outside the boundaries of the license agreement.

So on the matter of removes, do NOT hit a remove link on a spam message, but do
sign up on as many of the reputable remove list brokers as possible. They guard
their lists closely and prosecute abuses as a matter of guarding their
reputation. As I said, I have used several of these and now only receive spam
from sources that also spam the extropians list. I would prefer that the
extropians list archive not display the email addresses of the people who
posted to the list, as this is a major source of data for the data miners that
supply raw lists to fly-by-night spammers.

The anti-spam lobbyists are trying to make it an 'opt-in' system, where a
person has to specifically agree to receive commercial solicitations via email,
everything else being illegal.

I have tried to change my reply-to and from entries in my email browser so that
dataminers cannot strip a correct email address off of them, but it will not
let me make it a "mike-at-lorrey-dot-com", or any variation thereof (ostensibly
to prevent me from sending fraudulent header information, ha!). So unless I
adopt the kind of email tools that spammers use, I cannot protect my address
from the fly-by-nighters.

Solutions do not occur in a free market unless the market has indicated that it
has a need to be solved. Ignoring spam prevents that need signal from being
sufficiently broadcast across the market.

They would not need to pass new laws to protect themselves if it were not
already within the letter of the law to prosecute them now for what they are
doing. The laws exist, and imply that 'opt-in' should be the standard according
to the letter of the law, so we do not need new ones. Its like all the new
anti-gun proposals: how can we expect new gun laws to work if the old ones are
not being enforced?

You talk grandly about maintaining 1st Amendment rights, and the privacy rights
of emailers, etc. However, you ignore the fact that when someone violates a law
or another person's rights, they are signaling that because they do not value
their vicitms rights, their own rights are forfeit. Spammer lose their speech
and privacy rights when they violate the property and privacy rights of others.
You can speak all you want. I can't be forced to listen, and you will pay for
wasting my time....

Yes. Please. However, why can't mail servers that the recipient belongs to
merely check the validity of the emails header addresses and origins of every
message, bouncing the ones that look specious? I almost want to write a perl
script that does just that....I wish I weren't so busy with my own ISP
startup.

If the Electronic Freedom Foundation is what its cracked up to be, they could
easily launch a campaign to get unverified message bouncers installed on any
ISP mail server on which a customer requests it, and give the customer the
ability to turn it on or off...

Mike, *either* a message is anonymous, *or* we can determine from where it

  IAN: Also firearm ownership is a hedge against 
  totalitarianism and the atrocities associated
  with it. The majority who assume that the Govt
  is too kind to perpetrate atrocities are woefully
  uninformed and naive! My brief research into the 
  issue of the government exposing U.S. civilian 
  populations to harmful chemicals and biological
  agents has turned up very disturbing facts. The
  U.S. Govt has sprayed contagious pathogens over
  HUNDREDS of populated ares in the U.S., according
  to Dr. Leonard A. Cole of Rutgers University, an 
  expert on biological and chemical warfare issues.

  Read Dr. Cole's testimony before the U.S. Senate:
  http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/openair.htm 
  many cases of poisoning are cited in a Senate report:
  http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/contents.htm 
  which has errant information about a key U.S. Code.

  Using entire civil populations as massive guinea-
  pig farms is an atrocity that our government has
  perpetrated on it's own people hundreds of times!
  Who in their right mind would ever trust these 
  people? Yet those who do not trust the mass-
  poisoners are condemned as "paranoid kooks."
  It has to make you wonder who's really doing 
  the thinking for the masses? Their poisoners!
  When the Govt owns the people's minds, it owns
  the people, who serve the will of their poisoners.

  Perhaps the widespread poisonings act as a low-level
  cull of the old to minimize Social-Security payments.

As described, the anonymous remailer server checks the incoming message header for
being an authentic source. The server then decrypts the contents of the message,
which is the outgoing message. The server examines the header information embeded in
the outgoing message to ensure that it mirrors the remailer's server information,
then the server mails the message with this new, proper header information (the
header of the remailer). Thus the server forgets who sent the message which it
decrypts after the fact, but ensures that the message did in fact come from a real
place and the real place is mirrored in the incoming header information. Thus you
have authentication AND anonymity. Anonymity is a product of the process, not a
preceding requirement. Get it?

Exactly. Witness the outpouring of lawsuits being filed by Democratic Party
controlled city and county governments against the gun manufacturers for the
'costs' imposed by the use of guns in their cities where guns are already
illegal (and have the highest crime rates). It looks like the final push is
on, folks. The gun manufacturers are not deep pockets boys like the tobacco
industry (note: $230 million in annual sales versus $30 billion for
tobacco), and despite the fact that guns are perfectly safe when used
legally, according to the accepted standards (i.e. don't point it at
anything you don't intend to shoot, etc) but cigarettes cannot be used
safely in any manner. The cities and the law organizations doing work on
their behalf are out to make guns illegal everywhere.

On a minor hopeful note, the Bridgeport lawsuit saw the dealers and
distributor companies named in the suit released from the case by a judge.
Now only the manufacturers are going to trial.

Countersuits are being filed against the cities by citizens groups for the
reckless endangerment imposed by the local restrictions against law abiding
citizens carrying guns as is their right under the 2nd amendment, saying
that their private health care costs are higher because of the unsafe
environment of Democratic controlled cities that ban guns, and that their
human rights are being violated when they visit those cities by not being
permitted to practice their 2nd amendment rights.

Proponents of the lawsuits claim that user authentication technologies exist
that the manufacturers should be required to incorporate in their designs,
ignoring the fact that those that exist are unreliable and easy to get
around, while others are merely pipe dreams which are not available except
in the laboratory. All of the technolgies will at the very least double the
cost of a firearm, if not triple or quadruple.

They ignore the fact that this will make it impossible for the poor and
working class folks to afford to protect themselves, while the rich can
easily afford firearms even at such inflated prices. Thus the Democrats are
favoring the rich and penalizing the poor, an interesting turnaround. The
dems want this especially because they need a new lever to keep the poor
imprisoned in the grips of the Democratic Party political machine, which
still controls most big cities, now that welfare reform is allowing the poor
and minorities to escape the bounds of the ghetto.

Fortunately, there is plenty of statistical evidence to prove the gun
manufacturers innocent, and the manufacturers might want to countersue to
recover rewards for the REDUCED fatalities thanks to private gun posession
deterring crime.

I can guarrantee that if the cities win, then there will definitely be civil
war across America. I know that the 900 employees of the Newport NH plant
owned by Sturm, Ruger & Co. will not sit idly by, nor will the employees of
SIG Arms, aslo based here in NH.

Actually, this used to be more commonplace in many e-mailers.  The
problem is that to have this work, you have to allow outside people to
query your machine and see if the username sending the e-mail is a real
username on your machine.  Most large ISPs, such as AT&T, specifically
block queries into their domain from the outside.  Thus, you can't do
the lookups anymore.  When this started happening, people started
complaining that valid e-mail from certain domains was being blocked by
the e-mail servers.  So they took out the features.

A compromise used in some mail servers was to produce a warning header
that shows a warning if the user could not be verified, or a warning if
the sending machine is not the same as the "From:" field machine.  Most
products don't do this, because the warnings sounded scary and were
often applied to legitimate mail.

Today, I think most people have given up trying to autodetect spam or
false mail.  Many ISPs offer filtering programs that leave the spam
filtering up to their users, so that the ISP is never blamed for doing
the wrong thing.  There are pros and cons to every scheme of spam
blocking, and I don't know any that are worth it to me to use.  The
side-effects of the spam-blocking usually are worse for me than handling
the spam after I get it.

This is an interesting question. How do you advertise a set of ideas,
a lifestyle, a philosophy? How do you exploit and avoid the
psychological triggers people have? And for what purpose?

As I see it, what we want is 

1. Get transhumanism accepted as a valid point of view (and not just
escapism, wishful thinking or part of another movement). Without this,
nobody will listen.

2. Get transhumanist ideas debated in society. Not necessarily
accepted, but made part of the overall discourse.

3. Help make implementations of these ideas legal, desirable and done. 

Where would advertising be useful? It is more about spreading a view,
a simple good/bad meme than presenting a rational argument. I think it
can be used to "initiate" these points: an advertisement promoting
transhumanism in general to make people aware there is something out
there; an advertisement forcing the viewers to ask a question; an
advertisement for a transhuman project. But they are/should not be the
end of it, just an attention-grabber to make people think and look up
the hypertexted debating site or something similar - we don't need
people who become transhumanists because it is cool or is PC, we want
people who reason.

Has anyone ever heard of this new product that is supposed
to stimulate the production and release of human growth
hormone in the body?  Its marketed as a natural and finally
much cheaper alternative to injectable human growth hormone.

Has anyone heard of this and know more about it?

Have you tried it?

Have you gotten any results?

They ignore the fact that this will make it impossible for
the poor and working class folks to afford to protect

at such inflated prices. Thus the Democrats are favoring the
rich and penalizing the poor, an interesting turnaround. The

keep the poor imprisoned in the grips of the Democratic

At the risk of oversimplifying things, I'd like to add to
your sentiments by saying that ultimately all laws,

feeling that has continued to grow for me, is that the
entire legal system (at least in the US) is increasingly
becoming a complete joke perpetrated on the rest of us as a
smokescreen to benefit the corporate interests of the rich
at the expense of everyone else.  The gun control issue is
the latest to magnify this effect.  I'm therefore not
surprised that the Democratic party is behind this.
Although they have operated on the pretense that they are
the common person's party, their actions have spoken
otherwise:

A Republican run CIA overthrows third world dictators and
institutes their own pupppet-dictators and righ-wing
governments.

A Democratic run CIA floods the country in question with
'free' grain and foodstuffs, thereby putting all of the
local farmers out of business.

The end result is the same - the US federal government
controls the country.

This is the Life Extension Foundation's web site.  (All Extropians should
be aware of it and visit it at least once per month.:)  They sell it and

Yes, I have used it for several months but found that RenewTrient (or other
2(3H)Furanone di-hydro products) worked much better for me. I actually
regrew most of my hair and lost much of my grey hair as well as feeling a
lot better and was able to get a good night sleep. BUT apparently the FDA
wants all of these products off the market. I rather doubt that the US
government wants a healthy older population.

I know this is only anecdotal, but how long did it take for this to happen?
How long was it before you noticed any results?  I'm just curious.

Hard to say if the government types think like that.  I believe they just
don't want anything on the market which they haven't approved of or
can control.  I believe that is just their mentality -- not that they think
in terms of plots or long range stuff like a "healthy older population."

I'd appreciate it if a few of you could take a look at

made some changes a few days ago. It looks fine on my screen, using

looking at it on Natasha's computer, using Explorer 4, the right column is
squeezed way over to the right.

I think this simply requires training your hearing.  I was raised on
baroque music (the structural predecessor of many genres of electronica)
and took piano lessons from the age of five years.  I've been involved with
producing music in the dance/techno/trance/etc. genre for many years.  I
find that I have little trouble deconstructing complex compositions in my
head; indeed, it is practically automatic.

The important factor, particularly with dance music, is that the number of
useable structure permutations per unit time is relatively small.  Rather
than viewing a rhythmic note progression as a function of time, I tend to
view it as a single discrete object (think an arpeggiation function) which
takes far less brain power than remembering the progression itself.  This
is augmented by the fact that dance music progressions are in base 2 time
and I deal with base 2 numbers frequently as a software engineer.  

Therefore, your average 4 to 8 bar dance sequences typically never contain
more than 4-6 progression "objects" across all tracks, which makes it easy
for a trained ear to dissect.  It is essentially removing the entropy from
the data stream.

One of the most interesting features of rhythm-centric music is the strong
tendency of the mind to sync to it.  Some genres, such as trance, are so
compelling that it is almost involuntary.  The unfortunate side effect of
this is that it makes it difficult to think deep, complex thoughts while
listening to it.  When I am working I tend to listen to more
texture-oriented forms of electronica because I find it has less impact on
my cognitive abilities.

There is actually a field of study that revolves around the psychological
impact of sound.  It turns out that sound, even at the most fundamental
levels, has a significant impact on our mental and emotional states.
Musicians often characterize the sounds of different instruments by their
emotional characteristics.  For example, analog synthesizers (a favorite of
the techno/rave crowd) are prized for the "warmth" of their sound, while a
digital synthesizer generating the same type of sound is often described as
"cold" or "edgy".  The difference in this case can be attributed to the
amplifiers: analog amps emphasize odd harmonics, while digital amps often
emphasize a particular subset of the even harmonics.  The sound may be
virtually identical, but the feeling is different.  Similarly, slightly
modulating the pitch of sound (below the threshold of detection in some
cases) tends to cause people to feel "uneasy".

Movie soundtracks often take advantage of many of these emotional cues to
enhance the emotional state of the audience.  The subtle and subliminal
emotions are purposely written into the movie soundtrack with the intent of
inducing a certain mental state at specific times.  Musicians often use
these cues to give a particular "feeling" to a piece of music (although I
suspect many musicians are not aware of the specific cues, only the results).

This would seem to indicate a lack of creativity on the part of most people
more than anything else.

However, with respect to the poor, I have frequently seen poor people
spending their very limited resources on things that are clearly not
necessary.  Escapism seems to be an easy sell to many poor people.  And the
poor people who don't get caught up in that cycle do not stay poor for long.

The State of Alaska is a very special case.  Alaska has so much money, they
couldn't possibly spend it, even if they wanted to (and they do try).  Most
state funded facilities in Alaska are  outstanding.  The school systems
always have enough money to do pretty much whatever they want and many of
the government buildings are lavish.  The Alaskan government will pay for
college at any university in the United States (yep, college is free).

Unfortunately, Alaska has serious social problems.  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
is the norm.  Most teenage girls have at least one child before (if)
graduating high school.  In some communities, HIV infection rates exceed
70% of the population.  Much of the population makes in excess of $100,000
annually, yet by all appearances, most live a lower-middle class life (they
waste *inordinate* amounts of money on absolutely nothing).

As for the oil money running out, it won't be anytime soon.  Alaska's
largest oil fields (among the largest in the world) have not even been
tapped yet, since the Feds have kept them locked up for many years.
Fortunately, many of their politicians have a fair amount of foresight.
Last time I was up there the government was planning on installing a fiber
optic telecom backbone throughout the state in the hopes that cheap,
state-of-the-art broadband network access would attract new business.  In
many cases it appears that the State of Alaska has pretty much given up on
much of its local population ever amounting to much.

I think the gulf states have cultural issues that have prevented them from
doing this.

There is a correlation between cold climates and small populations.  The
small population aspect is important, since a large population would make
it too expensive to consider.

I don't have a large number of examples.  I do know that many Indians
tribes in the US have attempted this, but most fail eventually due to
greed.  There have also been some intentional communities set up on this
basis, but I don't know of any that were a resounding success.

In my experience, the majority of individuals who live in minimum income
societies stop working if the majority of their needs are met by the
minimum income.  As you mentioned above, most people do not really know
what to do with money beyond purchasing their basic needs anyway.  The
problem with this is that it makes those individuals net consumers.
Investment income is generated by other people using your assets to
generate income (i.e. working) for you.  I think it is therefore pretty
obvious that at least part of the population needs to be a net producer.
Everyone can't be a freeloader.

Thanks for posting this.  Two of the contributing authors are extropians
(McElroy and Presley). I haven't read it yet, but it looks good.

Although it is not currently PC to be a feminist, it is important to
recognize the feminist movement. Most of the press comes from a few schools
of feminism (such as National Organization of Women and Religious Right
Feminists) that are reactionary rather than progressive.  

There are many contemporary closet feminists who are very extropic in their
thinking but do not embrace transhumanism as a social enticement.

In the new culture of Hip-Hop feminism, a sense of balance can be heard in
female rap sounds. These females are progressive by using their voices for
storytelling, and using  their platform for making their own deals and/or
owning music business, studio, record co., talent agency.

Rand would not have been a good candidate for some of the feminist profiles
(moralistic religious, dyke man-beating, female affirmative action,
grrls-support-system, or lesbian media-monger), but would have gained much
credence as one who fought for individuality, success, and big emphasis on
merit. 

Looking back over the centuries of feminism, it has failed in part.  It
seems to lack kindness and compassion, affection and gentility -- qualities
that are lovable in a person and people.

Max More said
the right hand column is also squeezed on my Explorer 4.5 Mac

It looks OK in most html editors, but the Explorer 4.x parser gets 
confused because the first row is split in two ways (it is one cell on 
the left, a full lenght column int he middle and then a bunch of cells on 
the right.

If you make the right hand column a table in its own right inside a 
simple three column table then it works fine.

(also,  the curl icon has a dangling file link to "html:///".


the top logo looks nice

My IE 3 also squeezes the right column all the way to the right.  (I
usually use Netscape, so I'd never noticed it before.)

Max,

The page looks OK on my IE 4.0 and my Netscape 3.0.

I see in the mail that some others have already emailed about the
problem you mentioned so maybe you have already corrected it and that is
why I am seeing it OK at this time.

=============================

The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace
By Margaret Wertheim, Doubleday, 322pp, $A29.95

Reviewed by Damien Broderick



Remember the Space Age?  Thirty years ago, humans stepped onto the airless
shores of the Moon's Sea of Tranquillity.  By then the adventure had
already moved elsewhere.  J. G. Ballard's cool, ironic gaze was fixed on
inner space.  Now the action has shifted again, to cyberspace, the current
final frontier.

Space is a versatile metaphor.  New Agers daily voyage amid shifting
psychic spaces: `I'm in a really bad space, man'.  Naturalists like Stephen
Gould track evolving species across abstract mathematical landscapes.  We
lose ourselves in the imaginary and symbolic spaces of film and television,
borne by the powerful vehicle of a gaze.  So `space' loses its value,
appropriated on every side.  Are the computer-mediated realms of cyberspace
safe from erosion?  Or were they always bogus to begin with?

Australian Margaret Wertheim, trained in physics and computing, is a
well-known interpreter of science to a public baffled by its mysteries and
eager for palatable explanations.  By a kind of public relations paradox,
being an attractive woman competent in areas regarded as Boys' Town gives
her a special allure.  

Her angle is, indeed, a quizzical glance at the ways science grew up
lop-sided, bent by its gender bias.  In *Pythagoras' Trousers* (a title
*nobody* can pronounce), she got stuck into `Mathematical Man' and his
warped way with cold equations.  Now she has her doubts about the Internet.
 As with physics, she spies a secret religious yearning within the bits and
gigabytes.  Cyberspace, for Wertheim, is a return to medieval
Christianity's dualistic space, spirit above, us below - but mostly without
its redemptive, community-steeped values.

In two strikingly successful 14th century images, she walks us through
Dante's medieval hell, purgatory and paradise, and around Giotto's Arena
Chapel in Padua.  Giotto's Annunciation is an early triumph of perspectival
rendering, complete with *trompe-l'oeil* effects lending a third dimension,
the depth of scientific space.  Yet facing the chapel's altar is a Giotto
masterpiece in the older style, enlarged Christ at centre, angels against
blue spiritual space, damned and saved humans crowding below.  Wertheim
wishes to reclaim that power of sacred representation which one-note
science, or so she asserts, has abolished.  

She speaks for `those who wish to see reality as more than a purely
physical phenomena [sic]'.  Between Dante's world and our own, what
changed?  Her clever allegory explains how we use, construct, travel
through and transcend space itself.  The medieval world was doubled, its
earthly landscape a projection of timeless sacred space.  The Renaissance
shifted from spirit to flesh, the Enlightenment from divine authority to
space and time as Absolutes.  Our own century dethrones both with
relativity, placing each observer within an idiosyncratic but valid frame
of reference.  

As a parable, this catches the post-industrial disintegration of community.
 Will cyberspace, with its instant connectivity across the globe, reinstate
links between atomised, lonely people>  Or will it make matters worse by
splitting mind from body in a malign perversion of sacred dualities?  Aloft
in cyberspace's window onto endless imaginary worlds, will we forget the
real pain and joys of fleshy life?  Revolted, Wertheim cites `Mike Kelly, a
PhD in computer science and founder of the Extropian movement', who argues
for uploading our minds into machines while we await physical immortality
from the labs.

This is a small slip, but a typical and telling one.  As it happens, the
Extropians were founded by a PhD philosopher, Max More, who (via the Net)
tells me he's never heard of Mike Kelly.  Despite the instantaneous
world-bridging power of the Net, Wertheim's research is often sloppy or
unsound. She has a gift for just the wrong word: repeatedly, she calls
space or mathematics `ephemeral' (transitory) where plainly she means
`ethereal' (immaterial).  Robotics expert Dr Hans Moravec - whose important
new book *Robot* she ignores, although it's been available via the Net for
several years - is alleged to `write breathlessly', a good trick. (In fact
he writes very calmly indeed on topics that can leave you breathless).  

Her arguments aren't much better.  Science simply doesn't make the simple,
stupid errors she deplores.  Far from `denying' the reality of mental
spaces, cognitive science multiplies them.  Hilbert space, crucial to
quantum theory, is a mathematic realm of literally infinite dimensions.
Nor does any sane physicist think everything is `just atoms' (or warped
space in 10 dimensions) and *nothing more*: evolution has generated a vast
array of complex higher levels, from stars to beating hearts to brains
stocked with information.  Nor is information `immaterial' - it is
perfectly real, can be copied, and physical errors (mutations, say) can
turn it into nonsense.  For all her good motives, that is what has
happened, alas, in Ms Wertheim's tut-tutting thesis.

I'm using Netscape 4.5, and my screen is 17" with a resolution of 1280x1024 and 24
bit color. I usually have netscape open in a window that is not maximized, so I
don't use the whole screen to view pages. Here's my input on a screen by screen
basis. I'll report bugs as well as my own aesthetic critique:

Main Page:
Well organized. No overt layout bugs.
I'd recommend the following:
a) lose the table borders. One word: Yuk.
b) a distinct lack of color makes it look cold and sparse. The white background
and the use of small bold type can be annoying to the eyes. Thats a lot of blank
real estate.
If you are seeing the right column being squeezed to the right, then you need to
set specific width information on all of the cells for that column, and for the
left column. I have started to use a three column layout, even when I only use the
first two, with a width ratio of 2:4:1 or 2:5:1 when I plan on using the entire
width of anyone's page. Because I've gotten to not like how pages display so
differently at different screen resolutions, I tend to use distinct pixel widths,
rather than percentiles, when I specify table width, usually at 620 pixels.

Extro4 pages:
I used the link in the left column and wound up getting the pages come up in a new
navigation window. This indicates to me that you have left some <frame> related
tags in the documents and they are being targeted toward a frame that is not
there, so the browser is opening them in a new window. When I selected the EXTRO4
Home link at the bottom of these pages, the server could not find the page. Error
404.

membership page:
very well laid out, good colors and good use of width control.

Extropy FAQ List:
On the page for 'What does BEST DO IT SO stand for?, the page style of header,
margin and footer is repeated again at the bottom of the page.
The page for question #10: Do extropians live differently or is it all theory?
does not have the same layout as any of the other pages. It simply has a yellow
background.

Site Index:
The link to the criticism of Barlow's Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace is
slightly broken. As the text breaks into two lines, the link for the second line
works, but the link for the first does not.

Exponent and the EXTRO4 pages all use a neon blue background with minimal
formatting or layout and little to no graphical content. Suggest that the blue
header and magin style used on much of the rest of the site be applied to these
pages as well.

The rest of the site is great. I'd suggest that there be a site search engine,
since the site is getting rather huge. If you do, you might want to also include
the websites of other extropians to help expand the knowledge base

Funny, I used their search engine using the keywords "growth" and "hormone" and
got a list of links, which included the following:

 For an article on human growth hormone:

For info on the Prolongevity Growth Hormone they sell, bottled in capsules:

I don't see how you can describe a legal jihad against the gun manufacturing
industry as some sort of smokescreen to perpetutate corporate interests...If the
gun industry goes out of business, the certainly don't gain anything. If their
products are taxed at several hundred percent rates, this will not only reduce
market demand, but their ability to make a profit, which also goes against
corporate interests.

What corporations make money off of less guns?

Uh, I don't see how you can say this about anything in the last 30 years.
Lessee, Ferdinand Marcos got tossed out and Cory Aquino became president, who is
hardly right wing. The autocratic government of South Korea lost an election to
a former political prisoner and is now themselves in prison on corruption and
human rights charges. The new democratic government of Nicaragua is hardly
right-wing, nor is the government of Panama. Pinochet is out and Fujimoro is
in.  Afghanistan is about the only one I can think of which might fit your
description....

Uh, you mean pre-revolutionary Iran? Actually, it was Nixon and Ford who were
the big freinds of the Shah and instituted the free grain program..Carter just
inheritied the mess.

Lets see now. We got tossed out of the Phillipines, out of Vietnam, out of Iran,
out of Afghanistan, and we are leaving Panama..... Yeah, we are really in
control, aren't we?

Regarding your comments on some other pages: Many pages are overdue for a

now is getting up as much information on the EXTRO 4 conference as possible
and keeping it up to date. The pages have the info but are spartan for now.
I'm hoping to pull Natasha away from her projects to apply her creative
genius to the conference pages.

As time allows, we will be thoroughly altering other areas of the site and
adding new content. Specifically--the FAQ seriously needs updating with
revised answers and some entirely new ones.

Along with Brent Allsop, Creative Director Natasha Vita More, and some web
volunteers, we want t do all of that. It's just a matter of everyone
finding the time... A search engine would be good. I want to put up the
materials from all the Extropy back issues, add many links, and greatly
developp other sections.

Thanks again for your feedback and constructive suggestions.

Perhaps I wasn't clear.  I meant to say that the legal system generally is set up to
benefit the rich and *their* corporate interests.  Eliminating guns disables a
population that is becoming increasingly less tolerant of *their* system.  A
disarmed society is an obedient society.  A society where only the rich can carry,
is a society benefiting the rich.  I think that is pretty obvious don't you?

Tell me Michael, why haven't the gun manufacturers gotten together to create their
own boycott organization?  I mean common, why haven't Ruger and Smith & Wesson and
the other gun manufacturers put aside their competitive instincts long enough to
realize that if they cooperate they can survive as an industry rather than watch
themselves be run out of business through increasing regulation?  If Cleveland
decides they'll no longer allow guns in their city, then the gun manufacturers can
retaliate by refusing to sell any guns to their law enforcement as well.  Such
retaliation would quickly turn the table back in their favor.  If it *is* in their
corporate interest, why haven't they done this Michael? Such a tactic is so obvious,
why have they ignored it?  Is continuing their business as usual into oblivion in
their corporate interest?

In regards to the Democrat vs Republican run CIA, I was attempting to be
tongue-and-cheek by pointing out that both the Democrats and Republicans have their
rhetoric and methods, but the end result is the same under either - a lessening of
liberty for those under their rule.  Sorry if you took it as an in depth analysis of
20th century intelligence community activities - something I'm won't pretend I'm
knowledgeable enough to do.  :-)

Ah, so in general its pro-corporate pro-wealth, but not specifically toward the gun
industry. That may be their intention, but I rather thank that they are likely to get
civil war if they succeed. I know plenty of peaceful law abiding people up here who will
become revolutionary guerrillas if the city slickers win. I don't think that this area
is any different from any other rural area in the country.

That is a good idea, and I'll make sure I pass it along to the Ruger execs that I know
personally. They definitely aren't above that, as they recently banned the use of
Microsoft applications in their offices in retaliation for Bill Gates donating $80,000
to the gun control referendum campaign that recently lost in Washtington State.

Thats OK. I tend to beleive that the corporate interests/patrons of the two parties are
much more domestically focused, with dems supported by industries dependent on plenty of
easily pliable, economically distressed or marginal  individuals, both as a customer
base, and as a source of cheap labor. (i.e. K-Mart, Coca Cola, Reebok, Nike, Ben &
Gerrys, Target, Monsanto, Archer Daniels Midland, Beatrice) Repubs are supported by
industries that have much more upscale customer and employee bases, though that has been
eroding the past 6 years. There sure must be some industries that patronize the parties
for favors overseas (Dole and Chiquita Bananas in central america, of course, the oil
companies in the middle east...etc) Its not like we fought the gulf war over
principle...

The original core of feminism is VERY extropic and was one of the most
valuable fruits of the 18th Century Enlightenment.  I'm always struck by the
irony that the mother of modern feminism, Mary Wollstonecraft, was Mary
Shelley's mom, and was as much an exemplar of Enlightenment rationalism as
Franklin or Jefferson.  These days, I find Camille Paglia to be a pretty good
source of brain food, if for no other reason than that she levels devastating
criticisms at Foucalt and the other compost-modernists with wit and style.

"Women are told from their infancy, and taught by the example of their

softness of temper, outward obedience and a scrupulous attention to a
puerile kind of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of man."
Mary Wollstonecraft (175997), English feminist writer. _A Vindication of
the Rights of Women_

A remarkably profound public statement for those times!  I wonder what
types of conversations she had with her daughter that provoked the
_Frankenstein_ or _Modern Prometheus_ insights.  (... to have been a fly ...)

These names, and many others, are forgotten in the midst of burning bras!
Well-known feminist Betty Friedan (who sought to educate people about false
values that encourages females to find personal fulfillment through their
husbands and children) does not reflect such an exemplar spokesperson as
earlier feminist icons.  Having lunch with her was sub-enlightened as her
manner was rude and belittling of most females.  Contrary to this type of
feminism, there is great fulfillment in lovers and children for both
genders!  There is also great fulfillment in expanding one's knowledge and
experience.

The other types of feminists who want females to cover our bodies and
boycott makeup is just as extreme.

As you, Paglia not only nourishes my belly, but also tickles my toes with
her crisp wit.  Just this morning I was musing lunch with her and Susan
Sontag -- what brain fuel this would be!

Alas, although I respect the plight of feminists in the early stages and am
horrified by stories about witch hunts and the slavery of marriage, I find
that the greatest rewards today come from not carrying the torch, but by
thinking beyond gender stereotypes.

  High protection by grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPC) of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids against UV-C induced peroxidation.

  321(1):31-8, 1998 Jan.
Abstract
  The antioxidative effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPC) were studied
  in three in-vitro models in which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in
  aqueous solution and mice liver or brain microsomes were used as oxidative
  substrates, and UV-C irradiation as the pro-oxidant system. Analysis of UV-C
  induced lipid peroxidation was carried out by two methods: gas liquid
  chromatography of residual PUFAs and release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive
  substances (TBARs) measured by TBA reaction. Results indicate that PUFAs are
  more radiosensitive when incorporated in single component micelles than in
  mixed component micelles or microsomes. In every case, PUFA peroxidation was
  inhibited by low concentrations of GSPC (2 mg/L) while epigallocatecin (EGC)
  and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) monomers, at an equivalent level of
  epicatechin, exhibited no efficacy in our experimental conditions. This
  latter effect might be explained by a synergistic action of flavan-3-ol
  monomers, dimers and oligomers contained in the grape seed extract.

  Hypoglycemic effect of guava juice in mice and human

Abstract
  Guava is a plentiful fruit in Taiwan and it was taken from
  the plants of Psidium guajava Linn. (Myrtaceae). According to the folklore in
  Chinese Medicine, gauva was useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In
  the present study, acute i.p. treatment with 1 g/kg guava
  juice produced a marked hypoglycemic action in normal and alloxan-treated
  diabetic mice. Although effective duration of guava is more
  transient and it is less potent than chlorpropamide and metformin, blood
  glucose lowering effect of guava also can be obtained by
  oral administration in maturity-onset diabetic and healthy volunteers. Thus,
  it is suggested that guava may be employed to improve and/or
  prevent the disease of diabetes mellitus.

Abstract
  The alterations of hepatic peroxisomes and their enzymes
  during aging were investigated in male rats.
  Peroxisomes in the livers of young (2 months) and old (39
  months) male Wistar rats were analyzed by morphometry and quantitative
  immunocytochemistry, as well as by immunoblotting of highly purified
  peroxisomal fractions. Immunoblots showed that catalase and acyl-CoA oxidase
  were decreased in peroxisomes of old animals but the
  trifunctional enzyme, thiolase, and urate oxidase were increased. The
  morphometrical analysis revealed a heterogeneous distribution of
  peroxisomes in the liver lobule of the old animals, with a
  significant elevation of peroxisomal volume density in pericentral over
  periportal hepatocytes, in contrast to the uniform pattern in the young rats.
  Furthermore, age-related lobular gradients were also observed by quantitative
  immunocytochemistry in the peroxisomal concentrations of trifunctional enzyme
  (central > portal) and, inversely, for catalase (portal > central). Whereas
  acyl-CoA oxidase was diminished across the liver lobule, the enzyme
  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase was elevated. These observations show that
  peroxisomes are significantly altered in aged animals and
  suggest that these alterations may contribute to the disturbance of lipid
  metabolism in aged animals. Moreover, the diminution in catalase and the
  elevation of urate oxidase could contribute to the oxidative stress which is
  considered to be of fundamental importance in the aging
  process.

After reading _Frankenstein_ a number of years ago, and
seeing lots of the movie adaptations (which are mostly not
close to the book), I came to the conclusion that she was
very antiscience and antitechnology.

Ultimately, this may well be true, but I think the wole story is a little more
complex than simply saying that she and "Frankenstein" are antiscinece and
antitechnology. Note that she says in the intoroduction to the book that the
ideas expressed there are not necessarily hers, but rather are the characters'
-- a fine distinction, but one which may be important when you consider the
second point, which is that the ultimate horror of the nameless monster is not
the monster himself, who actually becomes a refined, eloquent and sympathetic
fellow, but instead is Victor's inhumane treatment of his creation.  More than
anything else, the book may be about the responsibility that creators have to
their creations, rather than being a polemic against science, technology and
"playing god", as is often expressed.

That said, there's no doubt that Shelley is at least ambivalent about the
subject matter of the book; a position that befits her position among the
leading figures of Romantic literature and original creators of the Gothic
style.  Perhaps there's more than irony in the relationship of Shelley to her
mother: As Damien correctly pointed out, Mary Wollstonecraft died giving birth
to Mary Shelley, a victim of the primitive science of her day. She was unable
to pass on her own Enlightenment values to her daughter, who was left to
navigate without that guidance the turbulent times of the Napoleonic wars that
marked the end of the first Enlightenment.  That missing guadance is perhaps
the ultimate source of the main theme of "Frankenstein", an absent parent.

Word 2000 (currently in beta) supports HTML as an alternative file format -
you can move documents back and forth between Word's native format and HTML
at will (the new version of Excel also has this feature).  I suppose you
could do macro programming to do the same thing, but it would take months to
get it all working reliably - waiting for the upgrade is probably the
fastest solution.

I'm using Word97 right now and I can set the text styles to that of an HTML
page, and I can save and edit it as HTML. As for intelligent documents, setting
up a layout masterpage, then creating a template that uses a dialog form based
input macro is quite possible in any recent version of Word. The only thin I'm
not sure about is setting Word up to save as HTML as the default format.

I read a review of Office 2000 a while ago. They implied that it's not
actually HTML they produce, but HTML with all kinds of kludgy Microsoft
extensions and ActiveX controls which may work if you're running Windows
but will be pretty much useless elsewhere. Given Microsoft's recent 
comments about eliminating open standards, this is not surprising.

IMO, one of the most disturbing and least-recognized truths about American
politics is the fact that *no one* is in charge.  Not Congress, not the
President, not the Right or the Left, not the Rich or the Poor, not Unions
or Evil Corporations.  The system has fragmented to the point where no group
can have the kind of influence you look for.

Instead, we have politicians who stand for nothing, selling their votes to
whichever interest group can shout the loudest today.  We have government
agencies accountable (for all practical purposes) to no one, whose only real
purpose is their own empire-building schemes.  Looking for a center of power
on this landscape is a mistake, because there isn't one.

The anti-gun crusade's success is a natural result of the fact that its
supporters have more votes than the NRA.  Academic liberals and journalists
tend to be afraid of guns, afraid of trusting individuals with anything, and
in favor of government control over everything.  Government agencies are
always in favor of obtaining a complete monopoly on force, and politicians
think they can get votes by promising to 'do something' every time someone
goes postal with an automatic weapon.

Can you imagine what a public relations disaster this would be?  "Evil gun
runners conspire to disarm our hard working police - details at 6".
Remember - most journalists are in favor of gun control.  A move like this
would simply give the industry's opponents an easy way to make them look
like villains, which in turn would seriously weaken their position.

It all comes down to a popularity contest in the end.  If the gun
manufacturers let themselves look like the bad guys, we'll end up with a
system where they are legally required to sell to the government and no one
else.  If they can make themselves look good, they might be able to beat off
the attack - but that means looking good to Joe Six-pack, not to you and me.

IMO, they will probably hold out in the short run.  In the long run,
however, the only way to stop the steady erosion of our right to bear arms
is to convince the general population that they should support us.  We can
only hope that the effects of decades of government propaganda can be
reversed before it is too late.

Hmm, I had forgotten about that.  For simple documents it might be good
enough.

Yes, but if you want to let people who don't know anything about HTML create
anything at all complex, that form is going to require a lot of coding.
Consider the problems with creating hyperlinks if the users don't know
enough to figure out the URL on their own, for instance.  In most cases it
would make more sense to buy a GUI HTML editor, wait for the new version of
Word, or find some other way of avoiding the problem.

With a little VBA programming you can replace the 'Save' toolbar icon and
menu option with a custom version that actually does a 'Save As HTML'.

Numerous sites do this, and it's annoying as hell because they bounce a huge
number of perfectly legitimate messages... while letting most spam straight
through. Many virtual domains (e.g. unicorn.com) fail their overzealous
tests, and there are various people out there who can't subscribe to the
mailing lists I run because their ISPs bounce my mail.

But even if it could work, there are numerous problems:

1. It might be spam anyway, why do you think that making spammers put a
   verified email address on their message will stop them?
2. It might be spam sent through a remailer.
3. It might be spam sent from a throwaway dialup account.
4. It might be spam sent with a perfectly legitimate but fake email
   address.

Number 4 is possible the worst problem. Most of the patches just check 
that the email address is a valid one; so it just encourages spammers to 
send out email with fake headers containing real addresses that they've 
found on Usenet and the Web rather than totally false headers. 

In summary, address verification of this kind is pointless, counterproductive
and will never stop spam; I really wish people would stop pushing for it.
Digital signature verification at the individual user level for people you 
regularly communicate with is certainly a good idea... system-level blocking
of people you might want to hear from is not.

Sort of.  Word 2000 makes real HTML files, and they usually display OK in
both Netscape and Explorer.  However, it also records all of the information
it needs to convert the HTML back into a Word document, so you end up with a
lot of extra meta tags, HTML comments, and XML tags.  I certainly wouldn't
recommend editing the result by hand!  I don't think it resorts to ActiveX
controls unless you start putting in content that can't be duplicated in
HTML - stuff like spreadsheets, macros, certain types of data entry form,
and maybe the automatic index and TOC features (which most people don't use
anyway).

If you just want text documents with relatively normal formatting, and you
don't expect to do much hand-editing of the HTML,  I don't think you'll have
a problem.  If you need more than that you'll probably want to look
elsewhere.  I've attached a typical sample of what a converted document
looks like, just in case you're curious.

Thanks for this information, Damien.

"A 'Frankenstein' is any creation that ultimately destroys its creator."
I'm very interested in psychology, but I'd rather not attempt to
psycho-babble whether or not the death of her mother caused her to feel as
if she was such a creation.

It is interesting that  _Frankenstein_, was published when she was 20 years
old.  I haven't read _The Last Man_ (1826), which reveals her liberal
social outlook; and perhaps her autobiography, _Lodore_,  might shed some
light on how her mother's death affected her.

(A biography of Shelley by Muriel Spark (_A Child of Light_) approaches
Shelley's life as a "divided existence." )

I remember the first day I joined the NRA, The local propagandist
paper the "Chicago Suntimes" had a full page add by Sarah Brady
saying "Help me fight the NRA".

Five minutes later, I called and became a member of the NRA then
NRA/ILA, and gave seven of my friends guest memberships for a year.

I've been an off again on again member ever since. I went out and
made some new purchases a few weeks ago, (Remmington 870 12 GA
Marine Magnum and HK USP 9mm) just in case. I may have to send the
NRA a check too, and maybe the ILA as well (and get my beeper back
;) ).

I don't think the cities will win these cases, tobacco isn't
protected by the constitution, and there are enough of us to stop
any jury.

Batten down the hatches and gear up.

They don't have more votes, that's why the Senate and Congress are
currently Republician. Over 35% of those who voted in that election
said they identified with the NRA. That total would be much higher
if the fight was over a total ban. Besides, thanks to the anti-
handgunners we now have the militia's. (sarcasm) Think I'm kidding
folks? The whole militia movement took off after the anti-gun folks
tried to claim the second amendment only applied to "militia's".

The NRA's whole problem is that they don't make themselves clear to
non-members. The NRA is about FREEDOM. I remember when I used to
vote for so called "Pro-choice" candidates, then I found out they
were pro-choice on only one issue. I was supposed to support their
rights while they took mine away...... No more, I vote based on how
a candidate feels about the 2nd Amendment. let the "Pro-choicers"
fight for their own rights, it'll keep them from taking away mine.

I quit the NRA/ILA a few years ago when they refused to see what
was comming, and how we could have prevented it by timely action on
our part. There were a number of influential members who wanted me
to run for president back then.

You are right here, we need to point out the inconsistencies, guns
are legal in New York, murder is low, guns are illegal in Chicago,

Although I have always been "pro-gun", it wasn't until the rabid anti-gun
movement took off that I actually started purchasing them.  In fact, I have
a lot of friends who purchased their first gun *because* of the gun control
movement.

And of course, it is a short step between purchasing your first gun and
becoming a collector.  While I have no specific evidence to back it up, I
believe that gun control activism may have actually increased the
penetration of gun ownership in several segments of society by motivating
many individuals who otherwise would not have purchased them.

Nice choices (says I, owner of three HK USPs among other things).  :^)

Despite the "powerful gun lobby" image promoted in the press, I always
thought the NRA was a fairly impotent organization.  The JPFO and GOA,
while smaller, are fiery groups and seem to focus more on principles than
politics.  Politicians in particular seem to be very uncomfortable saying
anything negative about the JPFO.

(I am going to relabel this as OT for the sake of the list)

Well, no one has objected to the last post on this thread yet, so I guess
its time for the next step.  Given the previously outlined assumptions, what
would a human-level AI be capable of in the way of IE?

Slow AI

Let us say this AI goes online around 2020, and it runs on a minicomputer
with roughly human-equivalent processing power.  It can probably use
Temporary Specialization and Long Thought without any special effort - these
sorts of abilities come very easily to a software entity.  The
specialization ability is particularly powerful, because the AI can actually
devote nearly 100% of its hardware speed to a single abstract
problem-solving ability if it so desires (humans, in contrast, appear to
devote most of their processing power to sensory processing, motor control,
and other non-cognitive functions).  The AI also has what Eliezer Yudkowsky
calls the AI advantage - see
http://www.pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html for a good outline of
what this means.

As a result, the AI should be significantly better than even the best humans
at any task it can do.  Note that this does not necessarily mean it can do
anything  a human can - an engineering AI might not have any social
abilities at all, for example.  If the AI is designed to write AI programs
it should be able to enhance itself, but creating cognitive abilities in
unfamiliar domains would still require real-world experimentation.

So, how far can this code-writing AI get?  It can start by optimizing each
of its cognitive abilities individually.  Since it is effectively smarter
than all but the most brilliant of humans, it should be able to get
substantial improvements before it runs out of ideas.  It can also improve
'horizontally', learning new skills by interacting with the real world (or
the WWW) and creating efficient ways to solve new problems as it encounters
them.

Now, if the whole process stops there we have a moderately superhuman
entity, with an IQ in 200 - 300 territory.  However, there is a catch.  It
is now substantially smarter than when it did its first round of
optimization - shouldn't it now be able to see better ways of writing AI
software, which it could then apply to writing further optimizations?  The
obvious answer is yes.

Now, at present there is no way to tell if this self-enhancement process
would be open-ended or not.  If each round of improvements increases the
AI's intelligence by enough to make the next round possible, it will
eventually become an SI.  If not, it will eventually reach a 'bottleneck',
where it has tried everything it can think of and it has to wait for faster
hardware before it can make further improvements.  Either way, however, this
process is likely to take quite some time.  It starts out running at roughly
human speed, after all - so the whole self-enhancement process could easily
end up taking years, or even decades.

Fast AI

OK, now let's try a different starting point.  Say it turns out to be
difficult to make a human-equivalent AI, so the first one ends up being
implemented a decade or two later on hardware 1,000 times as fast.  Does
this scenario look any different?

Well, suppose we start of with the same program as above.  Its initial round
of enhancements only takes das instead of decades, because of the hardware
difference.  It may still hit a bottleneck, but it will reach it much faster
and peak at a much higher effective IQ.

It can learn from the outside world a lot faster, too (especially from the
Net, if it has access to it).  With 1,000 times normal human hardware (=
about 100,000 times what we use for abstract thought) it should be able to
master a very large set of skills.  If it then draws on that knowledge to
further its IE effort, you have a good case for claiming it should achieve
open-ended enhancement.

Even if the AI reaches a bottleneck, it is worth reflecting on the result.
The difference between a complete idiot and an absolute genius is only about
100 IQ points.  The difference between the human genius and this AI (after
its initial round of enhancements) is going to be at least that big.  If its
IE reaches a point of diminishing returns after repeated cycles of
improvement, it will still peak well above that point.  IMO, that is a big
enough difference that we should be wary of making predictions about what it
can or can't do.

Very Fast AI

Suppose AI is a really, really hard problem, as some of its detractors
claim.  Then it might take even longer to get our example entity - maybe
2050-2060, with hardware 10^6 times faster than ours.

That means our trusty AI can do its initial round of self-enhancement in a
few minutes.  It can devote the equivalent of a few hundred thousand human
minds to learning new skills (on the Net, in VR, and through interacting
with humans), while still reserving most of its CPU time for the enhancement
cycle.  It is hard to imagine it reaching a bottleneck - its mind can easily
grow to encompass a small civilization, after all.

You're right, it isn't just numbers of voters.  It comes down to convincing
the politicians that you can reach them at the polls, which is a combination
of public relations, lobbying, actual voting, etc.  I'm not sure we would
actually win at the polls, however.  An outright ban would probably fail,
but the public seems pretty willing to allow any kind of reasonable-sounding
restrictions.  A background check here, a waiting period there, a few extra
fees, maybe a few "reasonable" restrictions on weapon ownership - we aren't
that many laws away from legislating the 2nd amendment out of existence.

Its easier for me to track down who their provider is and demand that their
service get cancelled and that they be indentified to me so that I can bill them
for the spam. If their provider refuses, then I can just refuse all traffic from
that providers routers.

remailers that support spam will get their services cut by their own providers,
or will get embargoed by ISP's that won't tolerate such crap.

If its from a throwaway, then there is a dialup ISP that I can pester for ID info
on the spammers, and likewise embargo them if they don't cooperate.

What is legitimate but fake? Oh, you mean impersonated? Like how I have the
address of my dialup on the From here, but my reply to is my mike@lorrey.com
address. Someone might put my email address in their header. Gotcha. If the mail
didn't come from there, then it really should get bounced because of a conflict
between the header info and the routing info.

There needs to be some capability to track it, if not then we need to create a
hunting season on spammers to keep the population in check...

This is accurate. My sources at Ruger say that the company's sales went up by
30% after the assault weapons ban was enacted, and another bump occured just
after the Brady law was signed and ended when it went into force. I think that
gun sales will be an interesting indicator to test whether the media is giving
accurate poll data as these trials progress (or whether people are giving
pollers accurate data as to what they really think).

Of course, if these lawsuits impose stiff penalties on gun manufacturers, you
will see most of the small ones go out of business or into the muzzle loading
business, and the large manufacturers will have to raise prices by several
hundred percent at the very least.

A freind who is a retired intelligence officer, who I shoot with occasionally,
has this little black poodle who is, shall we say, a little too amorous toward
most moving objects, is now according to my freind, one of the biggest
contributors to the ILA and Heston's campaign.

You've got to admit that Heston's quote that Janet Reno is the "Hanoi Jane of
the 2nd Amendment" was a good hit. GOA is pretty good, but I've noticed that
many gun owners that I know are kinda leery of them, or at least the GO-NH
chapter.

I concur with your analysis, and would add that antiscience remains an
element of the literati. Thank you for pointing out this facet of literary
intellectuals. It seems as if those who have nothing commendatory to say
about science enjoy the most popularity in saying it.

Scientists who play god have no more responsibility to their creations than
do the genetic algorithms, molecular physics, and biological evolution that
created the scientists.

A bold and challenging statement!

I wonder, though, if the reasoning really works.  If you are saying
that *because* algorithms, physics, and evolution have no responsibility
to their creations, *then* scientists don't either, that doesn't work.
Algorithms, physics and evolution have no responsibility, because by their
nature they aren't the sort of entities that can have responsibility.
They are simple, blind forces, natural laws, regular patterns in nature.

If we accept that there are things which can have responsibility and
things which can't, if we are to attempt to make that a meaningful
distinction, then the fact that some things fall on one side of that
line doesn't mean that everything will.

People can and do have responsibility for their actions.  Natural laws
do not.

I've been thinking recently about Clifford Simak's novel, "City".
Although written many decades ago, in some ways the setting is compatible
with our ideas.

The human race is gone, having emigrated to improved bodies and minds
on the planet Jupiter.  (Today we might have them uploaded, vanished,
Singularitied away.)  Dogs are the dominant species on Earth, uplifted
dogs gifted with human-level intelligence.  (Actually, intelligent ants
dominate our Earth, but the dogs are able to travel to parallel worlds
and they run most of them.)

The dogs have attempted to apply their ethical system, which they have
inherited from humans, to the jungle.  Animals are no longer to live by
tooth and claw; carnivores are made to understand the ethical implications
of their actions, and are expected to refrain from their carnivorous acts.

Today, we set the bar pretty high for holding people responsible.
Besides laws of nature, we don't normally hold animals responsible for
their actions.  There are exceptions: our pets are expected to learn
some simple household rules, and wild animals will be killed if they
attack humans.  But most of the time we accept that it is their nature,
and don't expect them to have the human ability to make reasoned
decisions.

Even human beings, in many cases, are allowed to escape responsibility.
There are a number of arguments based on diminished capacity which people
can use to avoid responsibility for bad behaviors.

It is possible that in the future we will change the world to one where
there are wider expectations of responsible behavior.  We might even see
Simak's conception of animal responsibility come into being.  It would
be a logical outcome and extension of today's animal rights movement.
With rights come responsibilities.

It sounds comical today to imagine patiently teaching wild animals
to behave ethically, but the greater wealth of the future may make
it possible.

One warning about this.  No one should ever use Microsoft Word to edit
HTML unless you restrict all your development to that single product.
The problem with Word on projects, which I have personally seen, is that
Word doesn't really edit HTML.  It translates your HTML page to Word
format.  Then you edit the Word document.  Then it writes a brand new
page based on your Word document.  The resulting page looks like your
original, but the HTML source is totally rewritten and has no similarity
to how you originally coded it in HTML.

You will lose all formatting from your original HTML document.  The
methods you use to write HTML will be totally rewritten.  Indented
paragraphs can become seperate lines with nonbreaking spaces in the
front of each line.  It will stick font sizes and styles on everything,
even if you were just leaving it to the default font.  Proper forms
layouts can be rewritten with input button tags instead of submit
buttons.

The worst part, is if you use an HTML construct that is not recognized
by Microsoft, such as pure Java (not Microsoft Java), or JavaScript (not
Microsoft J++ script), or Netscape Extensions (not Microsoft
extensions), these will be broken or removed from your HTML because the
Microsoft programming doesn't understand them.

Another bad thing is that Microsoft products, and all other products for
that matter, like to stick a header in the top saying that the page was
made with their fine product.  If you use more than one product to edit
the page, each will each keep inserting their headers in front of the
competitions headers, until you get hundreds of alternating spam tags
built right into your HTML code!

Anyway, the bottom line is that Word HTML building is only good if you
are only use Microsoft products.  You can't write your own HTML and then
use word on it.  You can't use Word and other HTML products.  My
favorite HTML editor is a flat text editor.

Amazon.com, Jerry Kaplan and Bill Gross - in that order - have just
kicked the support struts out from under the entire U.S. economy.

Amazon.com has been selling books at a loss for quite some time,
supported by their stock prices (i.e. market capital), in order to build
market share.

Then there's Jerry Kaplan's plan to sell computers at wholesale prices
and make money off of ads (http://www.onsale.com).  I told my friends
that this might (but only "might") signify the Impending Collapse And/Or
Transformation of the U.S. Economy, caused by the elimination of the
entire retail and mark-up-supported sector.  This wouldn't be quite as
thorough a transformation as my projection that collaborative filtering
will eliminate the entire marketing sector, or that complex barter will
eliminate the entire financial sector, but it would be a good start.

Now, Bill Gross (yes, the idealab! guy) is going to give computers away
and make money by selling ads.  Really.   http://www.free-pc.com.  We
ain't talkin' some wimpy network computer; we're talkin' 333 Mhz,
monitor and free internet access included...

So.  It looks like I may have severely underestimated the transformation
of the U.S. economy.  Not only are most of the major middleman sectors
going to be eliminated, but whatever's left will be given away for free.
 The question now is:  Is this kind of economy stable?  How can you sell
ads when there's nothing left to buy?  And how can you sell stock when
all the companies are operating at a loss?

We have three basic business models here:

Amazon.com is financed by stock prices, which are dependent on market
share.  The incentive is therefore to operate at a loss, because the
resulting increase in market share brings more stock-based revenue than
they would get from selling at normal prices.

Onsale's atCost distributes items at cost (not at a loss), and is
planning to make a profit (not operate at a loss) by selling lots of
cheap ads.

Free-PC is distributing items for free, on the theory that they can get
more ad revenue by assembling very thorough marketing profiles and
charging a percentage of sales.

== The Free Economy

The basic transformation may be summarized as follows:

1.  The primordial source of money shifts from sales to the equity market.
2.  Revenue derives from selling ads, rather than sales margins.

Forget, for a moment, the question of whether the Free Economy is
stable.  First, is it theoretically possible?

There are still two reasons to sell ads:  One, to build market share;
two, to convince people to buy stocks.

There is still reason to buy stocks:  No companies will actually be
issuing dividends, but as long as everyone is still buying stocks, it
makes gambler's sense to buy the ones you think will go up.

==

I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is a bad thing, mostly because
when CF and complex barter eliminate the ad market and the equity
market, that's the whole economy down the toilet.  Also, it seems very
probable that the Free Economy will be unstable - it seems far more
grounded in psychology (rather than a deep ontology) than our current market.

>From the Person On The Street's perspective, however, it might be a very
good thing.  The Free Economy may make it substantially harder to build
wealth by working rather than shuffling wealth - a trend already grown
too strong in the modern economy.  But against this abstract, we must
weigh all the free goodies.

My intuition says that it would still be a very bad thing from the POTS
perspective.  Suppose everyone wakes up one morning and decides that
poor people's ad-viewing "eyeballs" are worth less.  Then they get fewer
free products, and have even less purchasing power, and the whole thing
spirals.  Since it's all supported by stock prices, one suspects that
the stock-owners will be the most valued eyeballs.  One suspects that
Free-PC will be giving PCs away to high-income customers, not the
homeless.  I could be wrong, however.

On the whole, the Free Economy may be more stable than the current one. 
High productivity does not destabilize the Free Economy.  Whereas with
this economy, once 10 million people can do the work of 100, the other
90 million starve; only productivity-reducing innovations such as
lawyers, paperwork, the stock market, and Welfare have kept us afloat so far.

However, the Free Economy would be substantially less efficient than a
complex barter network.  Furthermore, the difficulty of transitioning to
a complex barter network would be greater from the Free Economy than a
modern one.

Finally, the Free Economy is inherently unstable (being based entirely
on market psychology and circular logic), and any crashes that occur
will be much worse.

Recommendations:
1.  Simplify the tax laws to allow for complex barter.
2.  I may not deliberately attempt to block the Free Economy, but I
won't help it, either - the same rule I use for nanotech)
3.  Try to create a psychology in which the poor are still valued
eyeballs, or in which their increased need for Free Stuff makes them a
more valued, targeted market segment.  Discourage the use of
income-based customer profiles as a part of stock valuations.
4.  Brace for massive unemployment, perhaps via the creation of
charity-run arcologies.  Encourage the use of company-sponsored or
industry-sponsored apprenticeships in computer programming.
5.  Somehow get everyone, including welfare children and the homeless,
at least a small equity stake - perhaps one that doesn't "vest" (but
whose investment s/he can still control) until, say, age 65.  (As
distinguished from Clinton's suicidal Social Security "investment" plan,
which would be controlled by the government.)

Counterarguments:
1.  So far, stock-priced-based companies seem to have substantially
increased the pace of technological development.
2.  If the Free Economy does _not_ create an underclass, we should
replace the modern, unstable economy as fast as possible.  How can we
know that unless we try it and see?
3.  My inability to perceive a deep logic for the Free Economy does not
mean it's all "market psychology and circular logic".
4.  I don't understand what's going on and I shouldn't try to intervene.

Doesn't that depend on what kind of makeup it is? I would guess some
kinds would actually protect it instead.

(Otherwise, I foresee a great market for transhumanist makeup that not
only makes you look like you want, but also makes your skin healthier
- hmm, sounds like today's advertisments)

Yes, I prefer the same for my fine tuning, tho I use Netscape Composer for
quick construction work. The discussion though was for an app that could
develop automatable documents for use as templates by mundame office pukes.

I think you overestimate what is happening here.  Amazon.com has simply
pioneered a new form of borrowing - they are spending equity to build market
share now, but they will have to start making a profit within a few years.
Otherwise investors will decide they aren't such a hot buy after all,
causing both the stock price and the company to crash and burn.  Other
companies may emulate them, but they will face the same limitation - stock
prices are ultimately based on expectations of future profitability, after
all.

Jerry Kaplan and Bill Gross seem to be pioneering a new economic niche -
companies that make a profit by rapidly building a high-value customer base,
then selling their information.  This is really just a variation on what
newspapers, magazines and television have been doing for decades.  First you
figure out a way to attract lots of eyeballs, then you charge advertisers
for the attention.

I can see how successful CF could make most advertising useless (although I
would expect press releases, paid product comparisons, and other modest
remnants to survive).  However, I don't see how any sort of 'complex barter'
system could even be competitive with a modern financial system.

The problem here is the same as that of translating between a large number
of data formats.  Barter is equivalent to directly translating between each
possible pair of formats, which is a O(N^2) problem.  Using money is
equivalent to translating between each format and a universal meta-format,
which is only a O(N) problem.  Using computers to facilitate more complex
transactions simply amplifies this difference by making N a larger number.
Besides, what possible advantage would there be?

How does high productivity destabilize capitalism?  Very rapid change can do
it, by requiring people to shift jobs faster than they can re-train
themselves.  High productivity just encourages people to do something about
desires they never had time to bother with before.  Maybe there would be a
problem if we were so rich that everyone could live like a rock star without
bothering to work, but that's still a good way down the road.

IMO, the real problem will come when automation becomes good enough, and
cheap and flexible enough, that it is easier to automate a new job than to
hire a human to do it.  Then the connection between economic growth and
human employment will be severed, and the system is likely to start
producing unexpected results.

giving product away for free obviously means they are dumping product on the
market to gain market share. Its so obviously illegal that I'm surprised that the
feds aren't knocking on his door right now.

Selling  products at 'wholesale' is the biggest scam in the game. Whose wholesale
level are we talking about? I'm guessing that his 'wholesale' prices are cost of
product plus overhead, possibly even a little below that maybe.

you wonder, how can anyone possibly have a company that investors are willing to
valuate highly on the market?

1) the losses are not really that big. A lot of what the SEC disclosure
accounting rules call 'losses' are merely what a company can do to finance very
high growth. A lot of what high tech companies call re-investment is not called
that by the SEC. So long as their sales are growing at near or over a hundred
percent a year, they can pull this trick off. Its when sales flatten out that the
fun hits the fan. By then the key players will have grabbed their golden
parachutes and late entry investors are left holding the bag. Deft management
might get the company through that sort of crisis. Amazon.com is not really
losing that much money, they are building new warehouses, investing in more
bandwidth, more servers, more programming, etc. I would venture that their loss
picture may flatten out in a year or two.

2) yes, ad revenues are really that big. I recently did a business plan for a
start up auction website. Based on the number of pages at various levels and the
standard industry ad rates, 99% of corporate revenues will come from ad sales.
This isn't new. Treat a website like a magazine. Some magazines get by on totally
ad paid costs, with minimal or no subscription cost (i.e. Little Nickel, Auto
Trader, The Robb Report, any publication that provides little content besides
advertising). Now to generate traffic to the site (which supports the ad rates)
you need to advertise on other sites, so ultimately where you make your money is
in getting more money for your ad space than it costs you to put ads on other
people's sites.

This does not mean the end of the marketplace. There is still a fullfillment
center that the website outsources to handle order stocking, packing, and
shipment. They are still charging normal overhead and making a profit with no ad
sales. The manufacturer is still making his buck.

Look at a e-commerce website like a shopping catalog that has completely
outsourced its other departments. Amazon is pulling incredible losses because it
is building all of that itself, so it is creating assets to support its market
share demand. This is what is driving its stock prices (based on future earnings)
upward (which is also helping to finance further growth....they've got a nice
little positive sum cycle going there.

The ad market is not the equity market. Magazines have done it for a long time
now.

No, those are reasons why you place ads on other people's sites....

Microsoft still does not issue dividends. There are plenty of established
companies which do the same. Their stocks are in the Growth equity market, while
the dividend payers are in the Income equity market. You buy growth stocks when
you are young, and income stocks when you are retiring...

There is no doubt in most people's minds (those that are on the inside) that a
large chunk of the perceived value is a)pure hype b) its a land rush, and c)
everyone is desperate get in while the iron is hot, but don't know enough about
the online economy to make fair estimates of value. This is because its such a
new economy, there are no textbooks that are worth referring to. Its all brand
new, and yes, most of the value is purely fictional, in the eyes of the buyer.

Positive feedback loops are only bad when they stop feeding back, or when the
feedback starts varying. I'm not too afraid of this at this point, because the
new economy is really just an additional layer on the old economy, like an
interpreted programming language. If it were like we were completely starting
from scratch and nobody made any money outside it, then I could see your point,
but the money that is driving this at this point is supplied by working people in
the real world.

Word 2000 should be able to do this via XML support. There is still no easy
and good way to do it. Probably a combo of XML and Relational databases is
the best way to go today, but there are no end user tools that will handle
the job easily.

I spend much of my time handcoding these solutions, but it is still to
difficult and to expensive.

It is probably not an option for smaller companies though.

I expect that at some time soon there will be high quality XML editors, that
can really do the job. They are just not here yet. At leat I havn't found
them. I know some good tools probably exists today but they come at a
pricetag of several thousand dollars, so I havn't bought one to try out.

Another problem is how to handle mediatypes other than text. If you program
all of your info structure in xml or use a relational DB what format should
the pictures be? For print you need a lot higher resolution than for the
web. So some kind of media DB should also be part of the equation if you
want a completely automated info system.

The same applies if you redesign the site and other media changes format.

After examining the site, I've changed my mind. The advertising is installed as part
of the explorer interface on win98, so the user is exposed to the ads the entire time
they use the computer. I wouldn't doubt that this is highly valuable advertising
space. I think he might do well by this. Being bombarded by the ads every minuteyou
use the computer has got to be worth a LOT, especially since people are stuck in
front of these things for so long. Its like locking someone in the bathroom with ONE
magazine that has the same ads on every page.......gotta have a significant impact on
their buying habits.

You made some good points, and I'm no longer regarding Amazon as such a 
'tulip bulb' bubble, but I disagree with this one. From all the economic
statistics I've seen in the last few months the high value mostly seems to
be coming from all the money the Fed is pushing into the economy to keep 
people happy so Clinton doesn't get kicked out of office. 

People aren't making this money by working, they're borrowing it; as soon 
as interest rates go up and people stop borrowing, the bubble will burst.
But by then the Senate trial will be over and Clinton will be laughing.

Unless they turn a profit it's just a pyramid scheme, and those will stop
when the market is saturated. Big bang could follow.

It does seem though that amazon are serious. What they are trying to do is
just brand marketing as usual: Get a realtionship with the customer to make
him loyal, thereby building a brand. As long as the "lifetime" value of a
loyal customer is higher than what you spend to aquire that customer, then
you have a healthy bussinesplan.

Usually you use the profits from your existing customer base to get new
customers, Amazon just borrows from their shareholders. This isn't unusual
either. Perhaps they are spending to much money on their new customer base.
I would think so, but only time can tell.

Don't buy stocks in this venture right now. They are probably to expensive
compared to the kind of income they will generate. Beside. Books will
probably cease to exist in any serious form within a decade. The flat
monitors are getting better FAST, and wireless technology will be in the
homes within 5 years.

All the ISP's will probably be giving away "hardware browser" in a few years
time to gain subscribers (that there lifetime value again). Allready You can
buy a mobile phone or a modem for less than a dollar here in Denmark!!

>Onsale's atCost distributes items at cost (not at a loss), and is

They will probably fail at this bussines model. Due to the extreme
competivnes in the PC retail bussines profits are often as low as 10% on a
PC system. Giving away the stuff for free will thus not save a lot of money.
And then what about support, warranty etc?

Don't buy stocks in this venture :-)

>Free-PC is distributing items for free, on the theory that they can get

Those marketing profiles will be VERY expensive to buy if they are to
sponsor PC's! I know that we started a direct marketing campaign for a toy
chain. It was a huge succes. 200.000 kids became members of the club in a
few months. The problem is that it costs $150.000 every time you send a mail
to the kids. This is pretty serious marketing money that would probably be
better spend on TV adds, or something else.

Thus when the contact price becomes high enough, there are other ways to get
your message thru.

Don't buy stocks in this venture :-)

The problem is that all of these "new" bussines models are being hyped, and
ignorant stock buyers are jumping the gun. The above mentioned bussineses
are not succesfull yet, and they are not any large part of the economy. It's
hype pure and simple. The day when one of these models starts to be
succesfull then we should take them seriously. We got to keep a little
rational sceptiscism.

I am a bit worried that this might turn into a speculative bubble, for sure. I
don't see it as one yet. Compared to the bubble in Japan a decade ago, we are
still  at a small fraction of the level of speculation seen there.

Keep in mind that even by the most rosy estimates, there was only $30 billion
in business done over the web last year. What is that? 0.3% of the entire
economy? I'd be worried if we had this level of speculation with more than
5-10% of the economy on line, but not at this point... All of the internet
stocks that are part of this 'bubble' are still less than $500-700 billion in
total capitalization, I would guess off hand. Certainly less than one or two
trillion. The entire capital market is what? $40-60 trillion now?

People think Bill Gates is so rich, but if you go as a percentage of the total
economy, he still pales compared to the old robber barons.

I do wonder as to how much the Fed is trying to sustain the economy, like the
did in the late 80s with steadily decreasing reserve percentages, etc. but the
economic numbers keep coming out ahead of what the experts thought, both in
the areas of employment, productivity, pay, etc. I'm starting to think that
the capitalist economy is finally coming out of the feedback loop its been in
for so long, mostly cause its got so damn many pistons in it that it acts like
a turbine now....

Say what you want about the overseas money crisis. That wasn't capitalism,
that was pure looting and fraud.

Thank you all for the responses.

It seems a good idea to wait for Office 2000 but I am wondering how fast
companies are going to replace their Office 97 setups with this upcoming
release. (I'm also wondering what will happen if I try to run both
Office 97 and Office 2000 on my PC).

It seems to me that whatever office suite people use, though, it will
still be a case of gigo if the presentation of the documents (how they
look on paper or on the web) is more important than
how it is constructed.

While browsing at Borders recently I found 'Word 97 for Law Firms'
(ISBN: 0761513167)
which seems more in line with what I was looking for. (I might go back
for that one, at the time I could only afford the new Kurzweil book :)

Thanks again,
    -Mike

I agree with Anders. I see many ads for makeup that mention UV protection.

this month's issue of scientific american has a couple articles
which may be of interest to extropians.  there is one on
nanomotors with a good explanation of why feynman
suggested such a thing could not extract heat from a
medium without violating the laws of thermodynamics.

another article is a sober summary of our future rides
into orbit including an old fave on this list the roton.

on the subject of rotons:  i notice they are still concentrating
on the helicopter reentry systems.  what if they skipped that
part, used the weight delta to lift the entire craft into an
orbit that will be stable for 20 years, then use the empty
vehicles for raw materials in orbit?  seems like that would
be much more valuable up there than bringing it all back
each time.  if they accomplish true single stage to orbit,
even if it is expendable, we can manufacture the things by
the zillions and still get payload to orbit for less than 5k$/kg.  spike

It might be more valuable once there is an industry that can
use the raw materials, but right now I think that the roton is more
valuable as a vehicle than as raw materials.  

Notice, as well, that the target price for the roton is 2.2k$/kg, 
less than half of the price you mention.  Cost is the major factor
for many industries...

That's true. I think the average P/E ratio for Japanese stocks at the
height was about three times our current level. And, I would argue, their
economy was fundamentally far less sound that that of the U.S.

The fed is not trying to sustain the economy or the stock market.
Greenspan's goal is very clear -- maintain price stability. Because of the
enormous international role of the US economy, his policy moves now cannot
entirely ignore effects on other countries. He has said several times that
the Fed sets its policies only in relation to the US, yet recently it's
clear that moves towards interest rises have been blunted by the
implications for the world economy. (Of course he can justify that by the
possible feedback effects of less buying of US exports.)

The latest productivity figures, revised upward for 4Q 98 show that the US
economy is still well above the average productivity gains of the last two
decades. The information economy really is making a difference. I am fairly
confident that we will see another ten years of strong growth in the US.
Europe is a few years behind in the information economy revolution, but
should soon feel the gains, so long as the statist governments there don't
stifle change.

Onward!

to expand on my earlier post, we could perhaps build an
on orbit materials processing facility which would (somehow)
collect the spent rotons, cut them up, separate the carbon
fiber from the aluminum and lithium, store the raw materials
in a more compact form than the original empty tanks.  this
could raise the ballistic coefficient sufficiently that something
like a 400 km circular orbit could be stable for a couple decades,
long enough to build something useful out of it.  spike

Yes, I see what you mean. So, I'd better _not_ go back and insert the word
"because" in the bold and challenging statement. Best leave it alone.

That sounds like a manageable "If" to me. But who gets to decide what
constitutes responsibility? As for Dr. Frankenstein's monster, one might
remember that the story resides in the fiction department of literature. As
for actual creations, one might consider that scientists actually do science
(discover, theorize, experiment, observe, record, repeat) more than they do
creations, Hollywood notwithstanding. Nevertheless, your logic holds, and
the ethicists may send in the invading Centaurs.

>People can and do have responsibility for their actions.  Natural laws
>do not.

Right, someone may use the scientific method to do something irresponsible
like create something that suffers as a result of its own creation or the
subsequent negligence of the scientist. We can find such suffering in
nature, which obeys none but natural law, as creatures great and small
suffer terribly. Ought humans to intervene in nature to arrest the misery
there? Surely some have done so. Yet tides of agony sweep through the
biosphere still, as every animal meets its inevitable death. Measured
against so vast a plain of natural torment, for what does a single
(fictional, so far) Frankenstein's monster count? I only ask that one put
things in perspective. Without perspective, who can define responsibility?

But to no avail I rail... you've got me in that ol' Existentialist corner.
Looks like Check...

<snippity-snip>

>Even human beings, in many cases, are allowed to escape responsibility.
>There are a number of arguments based on diminished capacity which people
>can use to avoid responsibility for bad behaviors.

This could develop into a slippery slope where people actually try to
incapacitate themselves so that they can escape responsibility (which we
haven't defined, but never mind, everyone knows what responsibility means,
more or less).

"Responsibility, n. A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of
God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor. In the days of astrology it was
customary to unload it upon a star.

"Alas, things ain't what we should see
If Eve had let that apple be;
And many a feller which had ought
To set with monarchses of thought,
Or play some rosy little game
With battle-chaps on fields of fame,
Is downed by his unlucky star
And hollers: 'Peanuts! -- here you are!'"
"'_The Sturdy Beggar._'" --A. Bierce

Please excuse the diversion. You say natural law does not enter into
responsibility? If it does not, i.e., if genetic algorithms, biological
evolution, and molecular physics do not favor responsible behavior, then how
did we ever get here? It seems to me, and I think E. O. Wilson might agree,
that evolution does exert some pressure to establish organic systems of
ethics. Animal populations that do the right thing, obey certain
(animal-ethical) patterns of behavior, stand a better chance of survival.
Or, if not, they self-destruct. So, if by responsibility you mean
accountability to the ancient and inexhaustible law of nature, then I must
reverse my position on this matter. But if you maintain that natural law
does not contain the elements of responsibility then I differ with you on
this.


>It is possible that in the future we will change the world to one where

>With rights come responsibilities.

Yes, rights and responsibilities seem to go together like a horse and a...
well they do seem linked.
Of course most wars come about as a result of rights, responsibilities and
the definitions and interpretations thereof. Without rights and
responsibilities humans could probably slay one another only serially rather
than en masse on the battlefield.

>It sounds comical today to imagine patiently teaching wild animals

Hmmm... something bothers me about this. Not just that one can't safely walk
the streets of responsible cities late at night (even though one might have
the "right" to do so).

Aha! It just occurred to me that we've forgotten the words "no more" in the
bold and challenging statement. It went:
> Scientists who play god have no more responsibility to their creations
than
> do the genetic algorithms, molecular physics, and biological evolution
that
> created the scientists.

Therefore, I'd like to add to this statement, and make it:
"Scientists who play god have no more responsibility to their creations than
do the genetic algorithms, molecular physics, and biological evolution that
created the scientists, because up to this point, humanity has shown no more
responsibility than the genetic algorithms, molecular physics, and
biological evolution that created humans." For evidence of this last clause,
I offer the book by the possible next president of the US, Al Gore, namely
_Earth In The Balance_.

In short, it seems to me that natural law does contain the seeds, and does
consequently direct the course of healthy, prosperous, beautiful, practical,
excellent, competent, bountiful, and who knows, perhaps even responsible
action. The fact that humans (and their close cousins, the scientists) do
not (yet?) fully comprehend the complexities of natural law, need not imply
that the principles of right and wrong do not emerge naturally and lawfully
from genetics, biology, and existence itself.

This then becomes the "meaningful distinction" to which you have referred.
The line marking the boundary of natural law defines the extent to which
scientists may play god while keeping proper account of their creations.
Another bold and challenging statement: Humans did not create
responsibilities. They emerge as a consequence of the same natural laws that
formed humanity.

Congratulations if you've read this far. Now let's go out and create
something marvelous... a great honking wonder to carry us on an endlessly
enchanting adventure of discovery. Compassionate extropians would have it no
other way, would we?

Love, --J. R.

randall, i saw on their site the target price and i hope they
can make something like that happen, but...  i fear the roton
folks are taking a promising technology and overpromising
it.  {8-[  i see the scientific american article has all the elements:
true single stage to orbit with reentry system and full reusability.
by promising all that, they cause investors to be disappointed
if it falls short, even tho it is quite an impressive achievement
just to make true single stage to orbit.

for those who are interested in our future in space, please
check out that article and comment on which system looks
the most promising.  that outfit in kirkland washington with
the k1 two stage to orbit and full reusability looks like the
best bet to me.

the article mentions using bucky tubes to make a geosynchronous
cable to the deck, but no mention is made of the biggest
show stopper with that scheme, even if we manage the materials
problem: every satellite crosses the equatorial plane twice
each orbit.  several years ago i calculated the probability of a
collision at 45% per year.  {8-[  i suspect that estimate is
low.  such a thing might be possible on mars however, as
it turns a bit faster and has less mass than the earth, and
fewer artificial satellites.  spike

Not to mention optimism and positive memes. Have you noted the quite
transhuman ads for big corporations on CNN and Discovery? Slogans like
"Let's make things better", celebrations of technology and human
ingenuity (often done in a very characteristic surreal style), and my
favorite:

We move because we hate the idea of standing still.
We create because we want something new in our life.
We take the next step because we want to rise above.
This is our mission, this is our passion.

Ack!  I *hate* these kinds of ads.  This kind of content-free verbiage
is becoming the new double-speak, along with "integrity" and "quality"
programs.  The are the new buzz words that can't be measured, and make
the customer feel good without really saying anything or offering
anything.

Take the above example, for example.  I still don't know what they're
selling.  I just feel like it must be good whatever it is.  The boils
down to "Trust us, we're doing the right thing for *you*!"  This is
psychological persuasion without product competition.  This is asking me
to choose their company without the information to do so.  What do they
create?  What can we rise above?  What is their mission?

The reason that these memes sound so positive is because your
subconscious fills in the lack of details and you think it totally
agrees with your extropian position.  A white supremacist Klu Klux Klan
member would probably thing that those words apply to him.  The words
mean nothing.

Natasha,

It's been storming for days up here, but last night it cleared, leaving six

the top one to three feet is *powder*!

One area to discuss transhumanism (more?) might be in the science fiction 
community. This certainly should not be the only avenue, but it might be 
productive. Can you think of any sf writers who've attempted to portray 
transhumans? How about Heinlein?

I am very new to this list and transhumanism, but I think it's fascinating 
and inspiring.

This is an interesting question. How do you advertise a set of ideas,
a lifestyle, a philosophy? How do you exploit and avoid the
psychological triggers people have? And for what purpose?

As I see it, what we want is

1. Get transhumanism accepted as a valid point of view (and not just
escapism, wishful thinking or part of another movement). Without this,
nobody will listen.

2. Get transhumanist ideas debated in society. Not necessarily
accepted, but made part of the overall discourse.

3. Help make implementations of these ideas legal, desirable and done.

Where would advertising be useful? It is more about spreading a view,
a simple good/bad meme than presenting a rational argument. I think it
can be used to "initiate" these points: an advertisement promoting
transhumanism in general to make people aware there is something out
there; an advertisement forcing the viewers to ask a question; an
advertisement for a transhuman project. But they are/should not be the
end of it, just an attention-grabber to make people think and look up
the hypertexted debating site or something similar - we don't need
people who become transhumanists because it is cool or is PC, we want
people who reason.

(Sorry, I didn't see this, Spike.)

Makeup is less a hinderance to hygiene than lack of daily cleaning of the
skin.  I support the use of makeup and I think it actually protects most
skin types.  Boycott makeup?  No!  I love it.

Some makeup is full of toxic goo, but the quality brands are harmless.

I'm for makeup that not only smooths the epidermis or cutical layer of
skin; aids the collagen and elastic fibers; covers the benign, localized
brownish pigment; filters the ultraviolet rays; and protects the inner
corium or dermis.

The Myth of Ubiquitous Freeness

The extrapolation that the advent of FreePC and other innovative
business models harks to an emerging era where everything is free is
misguided.  FreePC's business model depends on the value of the information
it gathers about its customers.  If the people who purchase that
information can't sell something of value for a profit to these people
then the information FreePC gathers has no value.  Even in Drexler's
wildest dreams, value will exist in the form of nanobot software techniques,
creativity, algorithms, and protection from the nanonightmare scenarios.
Regarding FreePC, one problem I see with their model is that the
people most likely to take advantage of their offer are the ones with
minimal disposable income.  A mailing list of every household with 
gross income of $20,000 or less is of minimal value to someone trying
to sell exotic vacations, new cars, or high-priced clothing.

Net Worth

The idea that Amazon's gravy is in driving up sales with no regards to
whether it is in the red or the black is a serious misunderstanding of
what drives market valuations in the long-term.  Amazon and other "Net"
stock valuations are a product of two converging phenomena: (1) the belief
that the Internet is the next great profitable commercial frontier, and
(2) a very small offering of visible securities attuned exclusively to
this new frontier.  Big demand driven by most unsophisticated investors
matched with a paltry demand equals rocketing prices.  Why is the eBay
CEO salivating for the date when he can cash out?  Why is Compaq ready
to spin off Altavista?  Why did Books-A-Million jump on the news it was
opening an internet commerce portal (though rationality settled in there
and the stock retreated)? I don't mind saying I shorted Amazon and Yahoo
in January and made a bundle.  I hate that I made money off the ignorance
of the unsophisticated investor.

These instances have occurred before.  The railroad
stocks of the 19th century, the airline stocks of the early 20th century
(as an amusing aside, when the airline stocks were forcing the railroad
stocks into the abyss one railroad company decided to IPO with the word
"airlines" in its name and its IPO was a huge success), the biotech stocks
of the early 90s all mirror whats happening with net stocks and tech stocks
on a larger scale.  Just as the word "Bio" or "Pharmaceuticals" or "-tech"
seemed to carry some inherent cash flow with it in the early 90s, a firm
that has a novel idea, maybe an interesting business model, and a majority
of its business related to electronic commerce, is assumed to have some
huge cash flow in the distant future just waiting to be had.

Unfortunately, no one has produced a model for justifying why Amazon has a
market value higher than that most of the other booksellers combined.  No
one knows where Yahoo's market value is coming from.  The common method of
valuing securites is discounted future cash flows.  Even once all its
aggressive expansion costs are eliminated, Amazon's future cash flow
predictions hardy warrant a $1 billion market cap.

The Information Economy

Much has been written about the new information economy of late, e.g.,
Shapiro's "Information Rules", et. al.  I concede information will be
more of a commodity in the future as its capture and transfer become
less costly.  However, if there is nothing of value to sell by leveraging
this information then the information itself is useless.  An information
economy may exist one day but only in the realm of uploaded minds, competing
superintelligences and robust MNT.

Ok,

I know I've brought this issue up once before.  At that time
only two people responded.  Hopefully this will generate
more responses this time:

On a daily basis I do my best to maintain a practical
optimism.  Beyond this however, I can't help but play out
what I see are likely U.S. scenarios *if* certain things
happen:

Here's the scenario:

1) Y2K problems in embedded chips cause a certain critical
minimum of power stations around the US to shut down.
Because it's the middle of the winter, the other stations
along the grid are already taxed to the limit.  These
critical minimum failures start a cascade or domino effect
by draining power from other stations, thereby shutting them
down.  This taxes the remaining operational infrastructure
even further and finally shuts the entire grid down.  A
nationwide, if not global wide power outage occurs.

2)  What does the US government always do in these
situations:  Declares a State of Emergency.

3) Meanwhile the power outage hinders the entire economic
infrastructure - with the most critical being food and
water.  Since most people do not have stashes of food for
such occasions, they will grow *very* desperate and begin
roaming and perhaps robbing other people for food and
water.  This in turn precipitates widespread rioting,
looting and general mayhem.

4) What does the US government always do in these
situations:  Send in the troops!  Or in this case declare
Martial Law.

5) What exactly does this mean?  According the ex-military
people I know, they say the first most likely action on part
of the military will be to conduct door-to-door searches to
confiscate everyone's firearms.  They all will use airborne
ground penetrating radar to locate via GPS exactly where
people have *hidden* their firearms.  Obviously they will
not confiscate everyone's firearms, but will probably be
successful in getting most of them.

6) Shortly following arms confiscation, they will set a
curfew.  Martial Law curfew is typically enforced strictly,
with the use of deadly force if necessary.  "Anyone found
out after 9pm without proper 'paperwork' or work permits
will be detained or even shot on sight".

7) Once this all sweeping Martial Law is instituted, why
would they reverse it?  Since they now have the control they
have long sought, they will not give it up without a fight.
Since the majority of the population will now be under their
control, such an organized "revolution" will *not* likely
materialize in any reasonable period of time - we may be
stuck in a totalitarian hell for decades or longer.


Ok, this is *not* an optimistic scenario.  I more than most
people I know Want an optimistic scenario.  Yet I can't help
but feel the above scenario is a likely one.

I'm posting this on the extropian list, because you guys are
the most intelligent and informed people I know, who also
share my transhumanist aspirations.  I look forward to your
comments, critiques and dissections.  I hope there is
something I'm missing in this "big picture".  I more than
anyone want to be wrong about this.  Should I be paranoid,
or are optimistic times more likely?

Salt Lake City, Utah. A Salt Lake City company announced
today the production of the worlds first supercomputer
capable of performing 12.84 trillion calculations per second,
or 12.84 TeraOPs. Star Bridge Systems, Inc. ("SBS"), the
world leader in reconfigurable computing, said its
HAL-4rW1 Hypercomputer system (nicknamed "Hal")
began operating January 29.

The company said Hal is capable of operating at up to 60,000
times the speed of a 350-megahertz personal computer.
SBSs President, Alfred J. DiMora, stated: "Hal may be
thousands of times faster than a PC, but it is still about the
size of a PC (less than 4 cubic feet), sits on a desktop,
weighs less than 150 pounds and plugs into a 110-volt wall
outlet. There is nothing in the world like it."

Mr. DiMora continued, "This puts the world on notice that
another breakthrough has come out of the garage to turn
the computer world upside down."

According to SBS, Hal is the fastest supercomputer in the
world for the majority of tasks performed by
supercomputers. Hal is also more versatile than other
supercomputers. With new, higher-order software
developed by SBS Hal is portable across incompatible
hardware platforms and supports most other operating
systems. 

In addition to all of the tasks traditionally performed by
supercomputers, SBSs Hypercomputer systems can
perform the full range of functions requiring ultra-fast
scaler processing, such as low-latency switching and routing
(example: telecommunications switching) and digital
broadband signal processing (examples: digital radio and
satellite communications). All of this in the same piece of
production-line hardware.

SBS says its Hypercomputer systems are just the tip of the
iceberg. They are only one example of a fundamental
breakthrough achieved by SBSs Chief Technology Officer,
Kent L. Gilson, the pioneer of reconfigurable computing.
Gilson said, "Reconfigurable computing is the next
generation computing environment and represents a
full-fledged paradigm shift in computers and electronics." 

Gilson continued, "Our high-performance supercomputers
are just the first application we chose for our
reconfigurable technology. Eventually, everything with a
chip in it, from toasters to 3-D video to automobiles to
personal computers, will operate with programmable chips
using SBSs new order of programmability. Our
reconfigurable computing technology will span the entire
domain of information technology and electronics."

SBS is in the process of securing numerous patents covering
its Hypercomputer hardware and Viva software system,
which is a combination programming language/tool
set/operating system/graphic user interface enabling
object-oriented programming of Hypercomputers much
faster and easier than conventional programming.

Brent Ward, SBSs Executive Vice President, noted,
"HAL-4rW1 was fifteen years in the making. It uses 280
programmable chips from Xilinx Corporation, called
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) on thirty-six
proprietary integrated circuit boards. These boards form a
unique design yielding a degree of fault-recoverability (and
hence reliability) unheard of in the world of
supercomputers."

Ward added, "With our Viva software loaded into these
chips, Hal operates in many ways like the human brain. The
chips are reconfigured on-the-fly to do multiple
computationally-intensive tasks in real time. This is truly
computer architecture on demand."

Licenses for the HAL-4rW1 Hypercomputer system cost a
minimum of $26 million. Because this technology is
scaleable, a full range of systems which will be marketed
starting with the HAL-.25rW1 Hypercomputer system which
licences for $2 million.

SBS is both selling licenses outright and partnering with
licensees to expand its Hypercomputer technology to a
variety of applications. Initial applications being explored
by potential licensees include terrestrial
telecommunications, satellite telecommunications, Internet
search engine, voice over IP and video compression for the
broadcast media.

Below is a comparison between HAL-4rW1 and IBMs Blue
Pacific, previously the worlds fastest supercomputer.

 

 

                  COMPUTER COMPARISON

SBSs HAL-4rW1 Hypercomputer System. These
systems are massively-parallel, reconfigurable,
third-order programmable, ultra-tightly-coupled, fully
linearly-scaleable, evolvable, asymmetrical
multi-processors. They are plug-compatible
supercomputers that surpass conventional supercomputers
in features and performance, at a far more attractive price.
Unlike any other supercomputer available, they perform a
wide range of computationally-intensive tasks in real time
in an extraordinarily small amount of hardware. Target
market: All supercomputer applications and many
applications beyond the capacity of conventional
supercomputers.

IBMs Blue Pacific Supercomputer. According to press
releases from IBM and the U.S. Department of Energy, Blue
Pacific was delivered to the Energy Departments Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in October, 1998. IBM
announced at the time that Blue Pacific was the worlds
fastest computer. It is a one-of-a-kind machine assembled
for Livermore, a nuclear weapons lab, for simulations that
determine, without detonation, whether aging nuclear
weapons are still operable. Target market: Some scientific
applications.

The performance specs are bogus (Score:1)
by substrate on Wednesday February 10, @09:38AM 
(User Info) 
Look carefully (and subjectively, how rarely that happens) at the
performance specifications. The IBM Pacific Blue did 1.2 TeraOps
sustained peak running the actual ASCI codes (albeit in their own labs,
SGI beat those numbers and did it on site). The SBS HAL-4rW1 did 12.8
TeraOPs doing a sequence of 4 bit additions, or 3.8 TeraOPs on a 16 bit
adder. 

This means that the memory and I/O subsystems aren't even exercised.
Nobody uses a 4 bit addition as a performance spec, not even Intel. 

The actual product description is unbelievable as well. The largest
Xilinx FPGA's might be capable of being configured to fully emulate a 16
bit microprocessor. I haven't worked with them in a long time but when I
worked with the 4000 series I figured I could shoehorn a rudimentary 8
bit processor into the largest devices.  (which would mean that a
rudimentary 8 bit microprocessor was produced for over one thousand
dollars incidently. It's a bit cheaper to buy a PIC from MicroChip) 

They said that they reached these performace levels with 280 of the
largest Xilinx FPGA's. My take on what they've done is cram as many 4
bit adders onto a single FPGA and replicate it 280 times. They then had
them all execute in parallel and pretended that this made up a
supercomputer. 

Keep in mind that performance on an FPGA isn't stunning. We're talking
on the order of 10 nanoseconds to do the 4 bit addition. 

So... if they've even designed and built this thing (which I doubt) the
specifications are a complete fabrication. 

I haven't checked yet, but browse through Xilinx's web site. If they
don't mention this wonder of reconfigurable computing then it doesn't exist.

I don't think it's paranoid to at least wonder about it all. I don't think
there will be any disasters or "chaos," but I still think most stories that
debunk the "there will be problems" line tend to dance around the part
where they convincingly explain why there won't be.

Why would the military go along with it?

These aren't conscripted 16-year-old kids waving firearms around,
prevented from running by an elite guard.  These are highly educated,
electronics-savvy, *volunteer* forces who know what the Constitution is.

Furthermore, they aren't personally loyal to the Commander-In-Chief. 
Generally speaking, the military hates Clinton's draft-dodging guts.

If Clinton tried to take over the country in a military coup, the
military would just laugh at him.  If the higher-level officers went
along with it, the lower-level officers would frag them.

SF has so far been one of the few literary genres where transhumanist
ideas are dealt with in any way, so there are plenty of examples.

The classic is IMHO Stapledon (_The First and Last Men_,
_Starmaker_). H.G. Wells had a few (like in _Food of the Gods_) but
IMHO not as good. Arthur C. Clarke had a bit of transhumans in
_Childhood's End_ and the 2000-series.  Stanislaw Lem has touched on
many transhumanist issues.  Among modern writers: Bruce Sterling
(_Schismatrix_), Vernor Vinge (rereading _A Fire Upon the Deep_ again,
great book), David Zindell, Linda Nagata, Greg Egan, Charles Sheffield
and many more.

My guess is that they haven't actually constructed the full sized
$26 million system, but a smaller version with fewer chips.  That's
one nice thing about parallel processing systems; you can build the
size to suit the client's budget.

I worked in parallel processing back in the 80s and we always announced
the biggest possible configuration of our systems, but we couldn't
afford to build them until we had orders for them.

The reconfigurable architecture sounds good in theory but in practice the
question is how difficult it will be to program the machine for practical
problems.  That was the big problem with the Connection Machine; you had
to use special programming languages to use it efficiently.

OK. I see your point too. These ads are not trying to sell you a
certain product, they are trying to sell you a corporation (or rather,
make it look nice and worth cooperating with). And plenty of ads are
indeed content-free verbiage. The best ads in the category I refer to
are however not content-free, but the images and text clearly suggests
a pro-tech, optimistic and transhumanist view (such as the recent BNFL
ads, which show various applications of "modern magic").

(Daewoo makes heavy industry, ships, construction, motor vehicles,
electronics, hotels, well, it is a typical Korean megacorp)

However, note that the slogan is not entirely content free. It clearly
is anti-entropic and anti-conservative (whether the corporation is, is
of course another question). It is extremely general, but what else
could it be when dealing with such a diversified company?

Hmm, somehow I have a hard time seeing a conservative agreeing with
it, at least not without serious doublethink. Your point about filling
in is however interesting. 

So, when doing transhumanist advertising, should we go for the general
"feel good about our philosophy" (lots of dynamic optimism,
self-transformation and dynamic memes) or specialize at certain points
("Legalize germline modifications", "Upload rights!")?

I've got bad news for you.  As a former member of those "highly-educated"

Not my fault, but I like Machiavelli.  At least he's a clear thinker
most of the time.  His advice with respect to flattery is a particularly
good example of practicality untouched by moral extremes:  {When anyone
can tell the truth about you, you lose their respect; but when nobody
can tell the truth, you can't get any advice:  Therefore, get just a few
advisers who can tell the truth about you but continue to punish anyone
else.}  This is not advice I intend to follow, but it clearly admits the
existence of the problem and proposes a practical solution.  I respect that.

"Nor let him ever believe that a state can always make safe choices; on
the contrary, let him think that he must make only doubtful ones;
because this is in the order of things, that one never tries to avoid
one inconvenience without incurring another; but prudence consists of
knowing how to recognize the kinds of inconveniences, and to take the
least sad for good."

True. A lot of clever observations and witty understatements.

He is also a good example of how one's work can get misunderstood; his
real views were apparently fairly democratic, but the advice expressed
in The Prince (intended to remove the French from Italy) was taken to
be his own view, so he ended up regarded as a villain by many people
(who haven't read or understood him). 

Maybe some of us will end up as adverbs too one day?

	How could anyone miss this?  Of course "compatibility with
human thinking renders an electronic computer more efficient and more
responsive"!  I wonder why no one has thought of this before now! ;)
Can someone tell us what it feels like to have one's mind "absorb and

like interacting with God himself! ;)

By doing the work: holding conferences, writing articles, teaching courses,
producing projects, talking to people for the purpose of spreading ideas
and educating.

The act of exploiting and avoiding psychological triggers is an art, and
you can check the archives for threads on memetic engineering.

This is a key area that we have been working on over the years, and can
certainly continue with great magnitude.  I think that Extropy Institute's
participation in world-class issues and debates is necessary and important.

>Where would advertising be useful? 

We do advertise as often and as prolifically as has been possible given
monetary constraints.  There has been no prime-time ad on TV, but this
isn't to say that I wouldn't want to create one.  The cost is out of control. 

Each and every time an extropian writes a book, article, makes an
appearance in the media or print, teaches a course, etc., we are spreading
memes.  The conferences are brilliant ways to advertise our transhumanity.

On a large scale, advertising would be a perfect way to attract the masses
and something that we shall continue doing.  If you know of anyone, Jane,
who has money to contribute to an advertising campaign, please contact my
agency studio.

The problem is unlikely to start with, because most embedded chips don't use
date information for anything especially critical - your reports might come
out looking strange, but the machinery will probably keep running.  Also,
the electric companies (like all other private organizations) are working to
make sure it doesn't happen - they stand to loose a lot of money if it does.
If a problem does occur, it can't spread in this fashion for several
reasons:

1) Winter is a slack period for most electric utilities, so they will have
some excess capacity (remember, A/C pulls far more current than a heater
unless you live in Alaska).  Thus, loosing a small number of plants will not
be a serious problem.

2) Modern grids are designed to survive localized outages, because they
happen all the time.  At worst, you just get a blackout around the plant
that failed.

It is not uncommon for a hurricane, earthquake or other natural disaster to
knock out an area's power for days or even weeks.  The response is nothing
like what you predict - people just band together to cope as best they can.
Americans aren't going to start looting and pillaging unless people start
starving to death, which would require a complete paralysis of all
transportation lasting at least 4-6 weeks.  IMO you could vaporize every
computer in the world and still not get a result that extreme - you
certainly won't get it from temporary computer glitches.

The traditional response is curfews backed up by national guard patrols.  If
the military (which is far less Y2K ready than the private sector) is in
good enough shape to do more than that, there won't be a problem in the
first place.

You can only do that in foreign countries - attempting it in America would
be political suicide for the President.  Besides, they can't possibly
conduct such a search in any reasonable amount of time, and I doubt that the
troops would comply with such an order anyway (at least, most of the service
personnel I know say they would refuse).  It violates too many
Constitutional provisions for even today's politicians to stomach.

Nor does the military have any magical way of locating all of the guns.
Finding buried objects is still difficult at best (that's why mines work so
well, and why there are so many abandoned minefields all over the world).
Finding something in your closet is impossible - the only way to know
whether you have a rifle or a golf club in there is to open the door and
look.

Not shot on sight.  Remember, these orders are mostly enforced by the
National Guard, which is composed of people who are only soldiers part-time.
Unless they are afraid of getting shot, they aren't going to be especially
violent about enforcing their orders.

Besides, you couldn't even begin to enforce a national curfew.  The
worst-case scenario would be curfews in a few of the hardest-hit areas for a
period of a few weeks.  By then any Y2K-related service outages would be
over, and the reason for the intervention would no longer exist.

Even if everything you outlined happened, 'They' still don't have control -
because there is no 'They'.  The military isn't going to establish a
totalitarian government because its members don't want to.  The President
can't seize power because the armed forces won't follow such orders.  Who
does that leave?

IMHO, the most likely scenario:

Most private organizations suffer only minor Y2K glitches - many will have
no problems at all, because they are already compliant.  Most of the rest
will suffer problems of varying severity, but very few of them will be
unable to function.  For these 'worst offenders', the time needed to resume
normal operations will vary from a few hours to as much as a week or two.
The only companies that go out of business will be those that are already in
serious financial trouble AND that have no serious compliance effort
underway (which is a vanishingly small number).

Most government agencies will not be ready.  They will suffer widespread
system failures that will severely curtail their operations for at least
several weeks.  (Un)fortunately, the government doesn't have to be
functional to survive.  The first half of 2000 will see lots of squabbling,
political grandstanding, and finger-pointing, and lots of records will
become hopelessly muddled.  However, they can always hire enough people to
do the most essential tasks by hand while they fix things.  The social
security checks will still go out, the IRS will still demand your money, and
production of Congressional hot air will continue to exceed quota.

Now, a lot of 'less essential' systems will be down for the count - things
like FBI fingerprint searches, Brady-bill background checks, and the
government's internal accounting systems.  The IRS may not know how much you
really owe, and OSHA will probably have no idea what they told you to do
last month.  However, these sorts of problems hardly spell the end of
civilization.  I'm sure the government will spend a staggering amount of
money on new computer systems in 2000/2001, but eventually they'll get
things sorted out.  By the end of 2000 their systems will probably be in
better shape than they are now, due to the urgent effort to throw out and
replace anything that doesn't work.

So, there's no need to bury your guns and lay in a year's supply of food.
Just make sure you aren't relying on the Feds for anything essential, and
you're in good shape.

I've still got the Porterian message with the term "Yudkowskian
Singularitarian" in it.  I think I've used "John-K-Clarkian" on at least
one occasion.  I wanted to use "Crockerian" once, but it just didn't
adverb properly.  Likewise, I'm afraid that "Morian" is impossible and
"Sandbergian" sounds like a Jack Vance city.  Alas for some of the Great
Ones, "Moravecian" and "Lenatian" just don't sound right.  Yet,
"Vingean" and "Hofstadterian" are common.  I wonder how much success in
life is determined by such considerations?

Maybe we could use other endings:

"Sandbergic"
"John-K-Clarkish"
"Moravecoid"
"Lenat-like"

Alas, More and Crocker are probably doomed.

Actually, our military code of justice would *require* them to refuse to
obey such an order.  You could plausibly face a court martial for complying
with it.  The idea is that a soldier takes his oath to the Constitution, and
this oath takes precedence over the orders of his superior officers.

The only way you can get a scheme like this through the system is to have
such a desperate situation (mass chaos, the imminent collapse of
civilization) that the officers conducting the trial believe the measures
are necessary for their own survival.  Then they might turn a blind eye -
but how could such a crisis possibly occur?  You need something much worse
than a few power outages to get that kind of panic.

We don't share much power with other countries, only Canada and Mexico.
Other countries may have their own problems along the same lines, but
not due to any interconnectedness. Oddly enough, the least developed
countries will probably have the least problems, cause they are used to
their power grids going out on a fequent basis. Generator sales are
moving along at a good clip.

I very much doubt this unless it goes on a for a good while. If you
recall during the gas crunches in the 70's people were, outside of a few
small incidents, very calm and organized about handling things. They
patiently waited for hours in line for gasoline ( I remember sitting in
my parents car waiting in line in Massachusetts), and what day of the
week you could get gas depended on the numbers on your license plate...
As those experiences gave rise to the efficiency and conservation
movements of the 80's, I expect that anything that happens with y2k will
instill in people a sense of self reliance. If the government gets heavy
handed over this, I expect they'll be klutzy and ham handed enough to
get more people exasperated with relying on government. As you may
recall, government 'control' of the situation made the gas shortage
worse, cause Carter decided the Navy needed to keep twice as much fuel
in reserve, which put an additional demand on the market, pushing prices
up even higher, and the retail controls they imposed panicked people
into hoarding cans of gas at home as well.

I also doubt that they will do this as part of y2k panics. They may do
this as part of a general anti-gun sweep once they've killed off the gun
manufacturers, but I doubt very much that much of the military will
agree to go along with such a stupid idea. It will fall to the FBI,
BATF, etc. who won't have the manpower, and will try to deputize local
law enforcement. They probably will get cooperation in the cities, but
none at all in the rural areas.

While there may be rioting and general mayhem in urban centers, and
state Governors may declare states of emergency and bring in the Guard,
the area Clinton should be worried about is D.C. I think that if
anyplace is likely to go into anarchy first it will be the capital
(followed by LA), and I think the gov't knows this and will have plenty
of extra security there. Besides rioters, there will probably be a few
right wing extremists and Kazynski types trying to do their part to
usher in the new age...

Nah, I don't see this, unless something really bad happens like some
Chinese or Russian nuke missiles get launched in the panic....

Now, many people on this list may think that I myself have some paranoid
leanings, but I don't think that it will get too bad beyond a
combination of a really bad nationwide blizzard and a government
shutdown. I'm prepared and am preparing more for possibilities, and I
plan on being out in the wilderness for several months this coming
winter, remote and inaccessible. I plan on making it a fun
expedition/survival test, as I've never been winter camping for anything
more than a couple nights. I do have a few bunks available for anyone on
the list interested in testing their mettle for a couple weeks or
months... I've got some great cliffs up behind my place that ought to be
real fun for ice climbing. I really couldn't give a rats a__ if the rest
of society collapsed while I was gone, either. I wouldn't call that
paranoia, more like utter disinterest...I know I'm gonna do fine.

  IAN: Scientific American (Jan 1999, p. 92) states
  that there are an estimated 32 to 40 billion embedded 
  chips, and, as you note, most are not date sensitive.
  However, we're not out of the woods just yet. It says:

"...most of the systems [ embedded-chip dependant ] do not 
depend on any knowledge of dates and will therefore not 
be affected by Y2K. Of those that area date-sensitive, 
only a very tiny fraction will suffer anomalous processing. 
Nevertheless, even that minute percentage is still cause 
for concern. Although nobody knows for sure the exact 
number, Gartner [ Group, in Stamford, Conn. ] estimates 
that millions of those embedded systems are vulnerable."

  The author of Scientific American's Y2k article (page 93) 
  concludes: "I believe that severe disruptions will occur 
  and that they will last perhaps about a month." Wow! A
  month or so without water, electricity, or telephone, 
  or all of the above, might even thin out the population.

I was in the armed forces too. The troops know that the civilian government is
a crock of sh-- by now. Morale is currently lower than it was after Vietnam.
The National Guard may be activated on peacekeeping orders, but the MINUTE
they are ordered to fire live rounds on anything but outright
rioting/looting/raping and pillaging, they will say "WHAT Th' F!" They will
most certainly not support any power grabbing by Clowntin.

Alright!   Why be an adverb "modifying something else" (verb, an adjective,
or another adverb), when you can be a suffix "of, relating to, or being."

  IAN: But the facts speak clearly: if military 
  personnel are told to go and dump chemical or 
  biological agent X on a whole community, they 
  will do it, because they have done it, and 
  I've never heard about a single military 
  personnel complaining or coming forward 
  to blow the cover-up. The facts simply

Thanks for the comments thus far:

They already go along with calls for "State of Emergency" during natural
disasters, and "Martial Law" during the LA Riots.

Perhaps, yet the ex-military personnel I know are the ones who are the most
paranoid about it!  It is *they* who are telling me to worry about our own
military following blind orders.  Already, the evidence is pretty strong
that we gassed our own troops during the Persian Gulf.  Most infantry do
what they are told, especially if their perception is molded properly by
their superior officers to entice them to do things otherwise repugnant.
After all, they are trained to kill from their first day in boot camp.

Irrelevant, as much of the military leadership has their *own* agenda
already.  It's them more than Clinton or the politicians that we need to
worry about.

Accoring to the ex-officers I know, the military would love for Clinton to
issue such an order, because it would finally give them the control they
have long sought.  Once they establish a military coup, they'll probably
tell Clinton and the rest of the civilian government to go f__k themselves.

To recap, there may very well be a nationwide power outage and the military will
do everything your saying.  So the real issue in yours and my debate is over the
extent of power outages.  Will it be nationwide or localized?  That is our final
jeopardy question!  :-)

That is a very important point, and I hope your right.  Because the central
point of my entire scenario is a us wide power outage.  If one does not occur,
then my scenario becomes much less likely.  I think the truth on this point
needs to be found.  Does anyone know a very knowledgeable person in the power
industry?

Without further information, I still doubt your assessment.  It is my
understanding that they use embedded chips for maintenance and shut down
cycles.  In otherwords, if a particular power station has not received a checkup
after a certain period of time it *shuts down*.  So if it read 1/1/1900, the
station will think it hasn't had a checkup in 100 years, and it will shut down.
If this is true, then if a critical minimum of them shut down they should take
the rest of the grid down with it.

Please correct me if I am wrong about this.  :-)

If a US wide power outage does occur, transportation *will* stop, and people
will starve.  So I think are only point of disagreement is over weather a
nationwide power outage is likely.

A military coup is a military coup, and Clinton and the rest of the politicians
become totally irrelevant.  Its quite possible, they may be the first to bite
the bullet from Martial Law.

According to the military people I know, their saying its the military their
most afraid of.  The military is a totalitarian government all to itself already
and therfore not a big  stretch to enforce their way on everyone else. The
military is not a democracy , it's chain-of-command, and its leaders could give
a rats ass whether its members want to or not.  Most infantry do what their told
or face the threat of court martial or even death if they don't.

Although these are the points we differ,  I hope I'm wrong and your right about
this.  I look forward to your next response.

In that case, yes, you're paranoid.  First, who's "they"?  Who's "the
military"?  The officers?  The generals and admirals?  The privates? 
High-level bureaucrats in the DoD?  Second, "the military" is not a
political force in this country.  The Department of Defense has so
little clout, in a nation where budgets are determined by nothing else,
that the army is deteriorating.

This isn't a banana republic.  Nobody has to keep the military happy. 
They don't have any Senators in their pocket.  Nobody in the military
structure has any political clout; thus, the kind of people who are
looking for power become politicians, not generals.  The various
elements in the military don't have a cohesive interest group strong
enough to have its own agenda.

"The military" hasn't "long sought" _anything_.  It simply isn't a power
bloc; it doesn't have the power, and it isn't a bloc.

Most people are sheep--vide Milgram--with one difference: I doubt that
sheep rationalize. While I'm no anthropologist, I'd wager that
worldwide, "default" childrearing produces a large fraction of adults with
compliance to the acceptable ersatz father figure, whoever it might be:
headman or top kick.

Especially if the big lie and other pack-cementing elements are present in
adequate amounts.

Yes, but the difference here is possible widespread power outages or even a
total power outage.  Since this could lead to a lot of mayhem, it may make
it very difficult for the skilled people to coordinate long enough to get
the whole thing up and running again.  So if a power outage does last more
than 4-6 weeks, most of us could be in serious trouble.  We shouldn't forget
that last year, Auckland, New Zealand's power grid was down for six weeks!
Lucky for them, the rest of their country and the world was doing fine, so
they were able to coordinate safely in order to get it back up again - and
it still took them six weeks to do it!  That scenario has made me really
wonder about all this.

I hope your right about this.  But why is it that the ex-military boys I
know are the ones saying the military *will* do this?  Perhaps the
ex-military people I know are skewed from the norm in their assessment of
this?

Are you saying they won't or they can't?  And for their purposes, why not?
Can't they just manufacture their own artificial panic by detonating one of
their nukes in the US?  But of course, now I am getting off topic!  :-)

Yes, I was specifically referring to the high-level bureaucrats in the DoD and
higher ranking officers and their immediate underlings.  Obviously, the middle
ranking officers would have to go along with the program in order for Martial Law
to remain effective.   The infantry are irrelevant - for the most part they will
do what they're told.  If there *is* dissension within the middle ranks, then
Martial Law has an increased chance of disintegrating.

I have to disagree with you here on the simple grounds that power is only real at
the end of a gun.  You can write as many laws as you want, but they are useless
unless backed by the barrel of a gun.  Which in our current state of affairs, is
the firepower of police, BATF, FBI, DEA, and local SWAT.  Eliminate those groups
and are laws become silly scribblings on paper in some far way fantasy land
called Washington D.C.

The President, Congress, CIA, NSA and what have you may dictate policy and
courses of action to the Joint Chiefs, yet it is military force itself that
actually makes a particular policy fatal to those unfortunate enough to be
declared "enemy".  Martial Law by its very definition changes the roles of power
drastically -  usually interpreted as a suspension of the constitution and all
its guarantees - that includes representational democracy (i.e. Congresspeople
are declared irrelevant).  Besides, if the situation becomes as chaotic as I have
portrayed, what does it matter who gives the orders - the CIA, NSA, joint chiefs,
president Clinton, VP GORE or some other high ranking set of officials?  The end
result is the same - Martial Law - suspension of the constitution enforced by the
superior firepower of US military weaponry.

Sounds good to me.  For the last year or so during the Clinton Impeachment the
government has been (I'm told) at a "standstill".  Those oh so pious (not to
mention truthful and honorable)  political officials have not been able to "do
the peoples business". (so they so often tell us).

The result has been unprecidented economic growth.

Perhaps  the Y2K government shut down will lead to more of the same?

According to this story, which I found (credited to Ian) at
http://www.sightings.com/ufo2/biotesting.htm, the government claimed
that the agents it was using were not harmful.  It seems that when a
substance was found to be dangerous, the government stopped using it.
Whether the government truly believed that the biochem agents were
harmless or not, we don't know; but undoubtedly the soldiers involved
were told that they were safe.

Dumping chemicals they believed to be harmless on civilian populations
is a different matter from shooting them.

It is surely difficult to understand the actions of so many people under
the Nazi regime.  However, it seems not to have been a matter of people
harming their fellow men.  Anti-semitism was widespread, and many of the
people involved in carrying out the Holocaust seemed to truly believe
that the Jews were subhuman and undeserving of compassion.  An essential
element was this demonizing of the victims, so that they were not seen as
human.

It would probably be more difficult to induce this kind of differentiation
in our increasingly homogeneous society.  The armed services represent
one of the greatest successes of racial integration.  The racial and
cultural makeup of the National Guard is probably not too different from
that of the civilian population they are protecting.  Things will have
to get very, very bad before the military is willing to fire on average
American civilians.

That *is* the idea.  It just isn't the real life. :(  While I don't think
that the emergency will be widespread enough for the military to 
be plausibly called out, I have no trouble believing that the 
people I was in with (when I was in the US Army) would follow 
these sorts of orders.  The problem is that most soldiers believe 
that their superior officers won't *give* unConstitutional orders,
so if they get an order, it must be Constitutional.  Nor do they
habitually weigh each and every order, or even the unusual
ones, against the Constitution.  Most soldiers do not have even
a good idea of what the Constitution *says*!

thanks for the site eliezer.  the university of mannheim claims
to be the worlds benchmark center for supercomputers.  it
evidently has some means of fairly comparing the performance
of both scalar and vector machines.  i want to see how they
rate the star bridge system.

this is of special interest to me as i am part of a distrbuted

of 13 cray supercomputers.  it is really cool.  {8-]  spike

Well, I don't know about this "informed discussion" business, but I can
tell you he's wrong.  Nothing in there explains "Why does anything exist
at all?"  I don't know where people got the idea this wasn't a
legitimate question of physics, but nobody will ever get the complete
laws written down, much less justified, without knowing the answer. 
Furthermore, this guy doesn't make any experimental predictions, and
from what I understood, I doubt he ever will.

  IAN: You didn't fully read Dr. Cole's testimoney. 
  Read this part (emphasis added to part you missed):

    "In fact, during 45 years of open air testing, 
    from time to time the army has stopped using 
    certain simulants for reasons of safety. In 
    each instance the army belatedly recognized 
    they could be causing disease and death, 
    ALTHOUGH SUCH INFORMATION HAD LONG BEEN   <----
    AVAILABLE IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE."   <-----

  If the harmful effects were in the literature 
  about chemical X, then X was KNOWN to be harmful,
  and thus they sprayed known-to-be-hazardous agents.
  If you read more about the military testing programs, 
  you'll see blatant B.S. is SOP. Dr. Cole also states:

    "Since tests involve spraying simulants outdoors, 
    it is important to understand how much risk they 
    pose to humans who are exposed. Official statements 
    have not always been dear on this matter. A July 1993 
    news release by the Dugway Public Affairs Office 
    indicates that "no specific safety controls or 
    protection are required for testing with simulants." 
    The statement implies, erroneously, that the 
    simulants are harmless." 


>Whether the government truly believed that the biochem agents were
>harmless or not, we don't know; but undoubtedly the soldiers involved
>were told that they were safe.
>
>Dumping chemicals they believed to be harmless on civilian populations
>is a different matter from shooting them.


  IAN: The chem-test ops are scientific operations run
  by dozens of people with PhD's who know or can easily 
  know what the effects of the agents they chose to spray. 
  I would be surprised if safety measures were not in effect 
  for the handling by service men and woman of the agents that
  were sprayed, they probably knew you should avoid breathing 
  it (that had to be the case is releases of lethal bacteria
  in the San Francisco bay), such that even those who delivered 
  the so-called "safe" chemicals had to have a clue or the minds
  of children. I'm sure they knew they better not breath it in.

  IAN: The US government was able, overnight, to turn
  David Koresh and his entire community into evil monsters,
  and then to proceed to gas, burn, and machine gun (proven 
  with the FLIR video) some 80 people right in from of our 
  face, and most people thought they had it coming. After 
  the OKC bombing there was an over-night deep change that 
  saw anti-government ideologies as bad. GovtMedia dis-
  information and shock-trauma events can quickly 
  model public opinion to demonize targets.

  IAN: Consider the context. A massive terrorist event has
  occurred, the nation wiped into terror and shock, the Govt
  then defines a brought group of "terrorists" and then the
  soldiers are not shooting at "civilians." David Koresh 
  and his followers were not "civilians," they were cult 
  members. They did not live in a community but a compound.
  They got a fair number of military and FBI people gunning 
  down citizens in Waco Tx, and that is a fact, and so the 
  worse case we're talking about, it's already happened.

This is a sophist argument.  If nothing existed we wouldnt be here to

That kind of question can only be answered in a religious or

Sadly, not true. Fortunately many of these systems will only fail during
the rollover and will probably start working again if restarted. There
are various reasons why embedded systems use non-compliant clocks, for
example for maintenance schedules or because they have the clock built
into the chip so they use it for event timing, etc.

If this wasn't true, corporations wouldn't be spending billions of dollars
replacing all the broken embedded systems...

That said, I don't see a long-term power shutdown as likely. Short-term
failures in small areas, certainly, but not the entire grid going down
for months.

I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Clinton is aiming to use the Y2K
chaos to stay in power, even to the extent of martial law; but I would
be surprised if the military obey him beyond a rational response to the
situation. Of all the groups who hate Clinton, the military seem to come
top, for obvious reasons. I'd be more concerned if Clinton was kicked
out of office and Gore took over.

I mean, as far as I can see Clinton is a true Orwellian villain who cares
for nothing but power, and he's not going to turn down a chance like this.

Interesting. The article seems severely dumbed down in places and I'm
not familiar with Fisher information, but the idea sounds neat (and
quite similar to what happens in the Bayesian Confidence Propagation
Neural Networks I'm working with; there the network tries to minimize
an "energy" based on the mutual information and entropy of the
data). I'm not sure it will work out in the end, but it is a fresh way
of looking at things.

Shades of Egan's _Distress_? :-)

Fisher's arrow of `time' in cosmological coherent phase space

Authors: B. Roy Frieden, H.C. Rosu
Comments: 10 pages, LaTex, Honorable Mention at GRF-1997
Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A13 (1998) 39-46

Fisher's arrow of `time' in a cosmological phase space defined as in
quantum optics (i.e., whose points are coherent states) is introduced
as follows. Assuming that the phase space evolution of the universe
starts from an initial squeezed cosmological state towards a final
thermal one, a Fokker-Planck equation for the time-dependent,
cosmological Q phase space probability distribution can be written
down. Next, using some recent results in the literature, we derive an
information arrow of time for the Fisher phase space cosmological
entropy based on the Q function. We also mention the application of
Fisher's arrow of time to stochastic inflation models


Here is something from the Optical Sciences Center own pages
(http://www.optics.arizona.edu/News/Oscillations.asp/July.htm):


Fisher Information. A New Concept for Physics

In early April, the Center hosted the first international meeting of
scientists who work with Fisher information in application to
physics. Professor B. Roy Frieden, who founded the group, said the
goal of the meeting was to promote research on the connection between
Fisher information and basic physics.

The charter members of the Fisher Information Interest Group are
(standing) Optical Sciences Center Professors Arvind Marathay and
B. Roy Frieden with Bernard Soffer of Hughes, Malibu and (seated) Roy
Hughes of DoD, Australia. Many members of the group believe that all
of thermodynamics can be derived from the standpoint of minimum Fisher
information.  Roy and his colleagues will be seriously attacking this
problem in the fall when another group member, Professor Angelo
Plastino of the Department of Physics of the University of La Plata in
Argentina, visits the Center. He will also work with Roy on Fisher
temperature-and time concepts.

Fisher information is an old concept. It has been used since about
1922 to judge the quality of statistical estimates. Now it is the
central concept in a new theory of measurement. This predicts that
each physical phenomenon arises in response to a request for data
about it. Roy explained, "The probe particle that initiates a
measurement perturbs the measured particle's wave function. This
perturbs the particle's Fisher information level, and initiates a
variational principle whose solution and output is the probability law
that produces the requested measurement. For example, the Schroedinger
wave equation arises out of a request for the position of a
particle. In this way, the phenomenon that is to be measured is
produced `on the spot.' The result is a kind of local creation of
reality. This appears to be an effect that is new to both physics and
metaphysics, resembling the 'participatory universe' of Professor
J.A. Wheeler."

Roy continued, "Virtually all of known physics, from relativistic
quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics to quantum gravity, has
been derived by this measurement approach. The local creation of
reality is a microscopic effect. It arises in measuring and
interacting with single elementary particles. It's reminiscent of the
microscopic reversibility to time of the laws of physics. As with the
latter, we don't yet know how and if `reality on demand' translates
into a macroscopic effect."

A traditional measure of disorder, entropy, has provided the usual
definitions of time and temperature. Said Roy, "Fisher information
provides us with new definitions. They arise out of a newly discovered
`H-theorem' for the information: It can only decrease with time. This
makes Fisher information a measure of disorder and means that Fisher
information must provide its own definitions of time and
temperature. Time is defined to increase when Fisher information
decreases.  Intriguingly, we find that Fisher time and entropy time do
not agree about 1% `of the time.' Temperature is defined as the
resistance to a change in energy of the Fisher information of a
system. The relationship of the Fisher temperature scale to the
entropic, or conventional, temperature scale is currently not known."


B. Roy Frieden's fall 1998 course offering, Opti 529, crosslisted as
Phys 529, is titled "Physics from Fisher Information, a Unification."
It will show that Fisher information provides a basis for nearly all
physical laws, including quantum mechanics, classical e&m theory,
special and general relativity, diffraction optics, the statistical
gas laws, quantum gravity, and the ubiquitous 1/f-noise power law. The
textbook for the course, Physics from Fisher Information, a
Unification by B. Roy Frieden will be published in December 1998 by
Cambridge University Press.

B. Roy Frieden has been with the Center since 1966 and has worked with
Fisher information since 1987. His research interests include digital
methods of enhancing or restoring images, blind deconvolution, and the
synthesis of physics using Fisher information.

Since we're back on the subject, here are my predictions of what we're up
against:

1. Government systems failure: A large fraction of these systems are not
going to work, and they will not be able to just hire people to replace
computers as others have suggested. If they were to admit defeat and
switch back to a paper system now, that might work. But not on Jan 1st
2000.

2. Riots: these are pretty much inevitable around the millenium anyway,
and the bugs will just make them worse. Lack of government handouts due
to broken computer systems will make them doubly worse. I won't be 
surprised to see troops patrolling the streets by the end of the year.

3. Bank runs: these are pretty much inevitable late this year. The
government can shut down the banks to stop them, but that will make
matters worse. They're already printing out more money and that's
not going to solve the problem. Fractional reserve banking is in deep
doodoo, and people's faith in it will drop even further when the Euro
conversion problems become more widely known (e.g. a Dutch bank just
admitted that it's failing to process about 10% of all Euro transactions,
and claim that most other banks are the same). If they can't get that
right, they're unlikely to get their Y2K fixes right either.

4. Stock market collapse: this is pretty much inevitable late this
year. How low it will go is another question, but I don't think the
bottom will completely drop out of the market because many will take
advantage of the situation to buy up shares at low, low prices.

5. Foreign problems: most of this message is about the US, Canada and
Europe; outside of those areas, well, Russia is doomed, Japan is
doomed, China is in big trouble, and so are many other Asian countries.
That's a big problem for the rest of us, because we rely on a lot of
imports from Asia: see Sun's recent comments on Asian Y2K problems and
their implications for computer manufacture. The semiconductor industry
itself is extremely reliant on Asian suppliers.

I won't even mention oil; the Middle East is almost as doomed as Asia.
Luckily Canada and Europe have plenty of oil and the US could bring
new wells on-line if it has time to do so.

6. War: with many US military systems out of action and most of the US
armed forces trying to keep 'order' at home, North Korea, Iraq and other
coutries will take advantage of it to settle old scores. 

7. Civil war: given the general level of chaos, various groups
are going to take advantage of it to settle old scores; I wouldn't want
to be in DC in Jan 2000. If martial law lasts too long it will turn into 
a civil war in the US and possibly the more extreme European states.

8. Big business collapse: at least a few big organisations are going to
collapse, either because they're just broken or they're no longer able
to make enough money producing non-essential items to survive. Hundreds
of thousands or millions of new unemployed will just add to the general
problems.

So even if 90% of Western computer systems are actually fixed -- and I 
expect they will be in the private sector -- we're still in for a hell
of a time. I'd be surprised if we're back to anything close to 'normal'
life before the middle of next year.

While small operations may behave thus (they recruit their members from the run
of the mill active duty rosters by culling according to physchological ratings,
selecting those with marked lack of moral/ethical concern). I doubt that they
could get the general military to go along with such things. Even in the
situation of these minor projects, the personnel need to be convinced either that
what they are doing is not harmful or that there is a greater threat...

Go read 'Hitler's Willing Executioners' sometime; the author makes a fairly
convincing case that there was no inherent difference between the killers
and the rest of the German population, and that the population in general
believed that the Jews must be killed, regardless of how hard a task that
would be. It wasn't that there were just a few 'bad apples' in the German
population, but that the entire country was crazy.

I think assuming that other people in other places and other times thought 
the same way as us is a major fallacy of historical analysis.

Why did their grid go down? How did the fact that Australia had power make any
difference to the fact that New Zealand did not? I think that emergency
management agencies have plenty of generator capacity to maintain C3I during
such emergencies. Anyone who does not buy a generator even for minimal houshold
tasks deserves what they get, considering the amount of advanced wanring. Its
not like this is an earthquake or something. We know its coming.

Most of the ex-military I know feel that the government is shafting them somehow
(some actually) The persecution complexes that are generated by vets not getting
the benefits they were promised can lead to all sorts of BS. Keep in mind that
barracks rumormongering is the only known form of faster than light
communication, and it is just as inaccurate and incomprehensible as any other
theoretical kind of FTL communication. Vets are used to making up situtational
assessments based on absolutely no data.

Well, the seismic and other signatures of any nuke blast are fingerprints as to

It was only the Auckland grid, and it failed because some of the main power
lines into the city went down. There was still some power available through
the other lines, but not much.

Because anything that the Aucklanders needed could be shipped in from the
rest of New Zealand, which had power, or Australia, which had power. If
power goes down in most of the world (unlikely, but possible), or if power
goes down in some places and airports and rail go down and highways are
blocked with cars and trucks, you can't do that. I don't think Y2K will
get that bad in most places, but probably will in some.

Only one problem with that... many of the military's biggest Y2K problems
are in the command and information systems. This is one reason why the
National Guard are going to be testing callout with good old low-tech
shortwave radios later this year.

Problem: business-sized generators are in short supply, and most people
can't store enough gas at home to run a smaller generator for long. Not 
to mention that if we do get into a roving hordes situation people would 
be fools to run generators and attract them. I'm thinking about buying
one, but it would be primarily as a useful gadget for film-making, not
for Y2K alone.

Depends on how the program is written.  Just as likely, it will say "this
year is 00, my last checkup was in 99, so its been (99 - 00) = -99 years
since my last checkup - that's less than my 5-year checkup interval, so
everything is OK!"

More to the point, the power companies have known about this problem since
at least early '98.  Since they don't want all their equipment to fail, most
of them have serious compliance efforts underway, and have already fixed a
lot of the problems.  Replacing embedded chips can be a lot of work, but
there is no good reason why they shouldn't be able to finish the job in
time.

Now, obviously, there will probably be a few companies that don't.
Likewise, there will probably be a few chips here and there that don't get
replaced.  However, that sort of problem isn't going to lead to anything
worse than localized power outages.

A side note - Jan 2000 looks to be a very busy month for FedEx!

A national power outage would disrupt our nice computerized distribution
systems, and make transport significantly more expensive, but it won't stop
it.  Getting power to gas stations without any computer control wouldn't
take more than a day or two, so the trucks will keep rolling.  Train systems
wouldn't be able to run as many trains on manual control, but they would
still have more than enough capacity for food shipments.  Sea and air travel
would be pretty much unaffected - although a breakdown of the FAA system is
likely, which would greatly reduce the number of flights each airport can
handle.

A critical point to remember in all this is that people aren't just going to
sit around and watch civilization collapse.  If a particular system stops
working, everyone who depends on it will immediately start looking for a way
around the problem.  To get a complete disaster scenario you need to
completely knock out a critical service, keep it knocked out for months, and
somehow prevent any work-arounds from being implemented.

This is a universal problem with standing armies, of course.  However,
America has some interesting legal theory that addresses the point.

Back during the war crimes trials after WWII, a lot of German military
personnel tried to claim they were not responsible for their actions because
they were 'just following orders'.  The Allies didn't want them to get off
that easily, and thus they created a new legal doctrine of personal
responsibility that still applies today.  As interpreted in America, it goes
like this:

A soldier takes his oath to the constitution, not to a superior officer.
His first duty is to defend that Constitution.  If he is given orders that
clearly violate the Constitution he is required to refuse them.  If he
doesn't, and the matter later comes under investigation, he can face court
martial - in the worst cases this can even be considered treason, which
carries a death penalty.

Now, the average grunt isn't necessarily up to speed on this sort of legal
arcana.  However, most officers and senior NCOs are.  If a general orders
his unit conduct a warrantless search of Dallas, TX, and confiscate any
firearms they find, his entire chain of command is going to start worrying
about their careers.  If he adds "and shoot anyone who tries to stop you"
they aren't going to waste time worrying - they will lock him up and call
upstairs for a sane replacement.

To get around this problem you need a situation so desperate that people are
worried about survival, and legal considerations seems remote and unlikely
to matter.  That takes a lot more than just rioting and food shortages.  You
need a situation where it looks like there aren't going to be any more court
martials - a disintegrating government, mass chaos, rioting, people starving
and shooting each other in droves, etc.  You also have to be giving orders
that make sense to the people in the middle levels of the chain of command -
and remember, they don't especially want a totalitarian government.

I've never seen a plausible Y2K scenario that even comes close to this.  You
could instantly vaporize every computer in the world and not get it.  You
need something more like a nuclear war, or a large asteroid impact.

I know.  :(

The important people in this equation are the mid-level officers.
Battallion and division-level COs are a lot more prone to independent
thinking than individual riflemen, and a lot more likely to worry about this
kind of consideration.  Even then they'll probably let a lot of things
slide - but if you tell them to lock up the local government and disarm the
police, they aren't going to do it.

As a vet of a Regular Army combat arms unit (1/11th ACR) I would have to
agree with this.  Most of the military would comply with just about any
order given, particulary if the situation escalated slowly enough for them
to rationalize each step.  No one would have any problem with stopping
looting, enforcing a temporary curfew, feeding people, even the occasional
Kent State style dustup.  However, once it got to house to house searches,
weapons confiscation (and remember, a large fraction of the military are
gun owners themselves), concentration camps,and full scale massacres, a
significant minority would begin exercising the time honored methods of
protest in the American military:  sudden, uncharacteristic incompetence; 
"misunderstanding" orders; radios and other equipment conveniently
malfunctioning; and in the extreme "fragging" and desertion.  Any real
grab for power would, as I see it, result in enough individual soldiers
deserting, and mid level officers deserting with their units, to lead not
to totalitarian dictatorship but full scale civil war.  

However, I consider it unlikely in the extreme at this time.  Give us 10
or 15 years of depression, inflation, a lost war, civil unrest like
Germany of the 20's and 30's and it could happen, though.

Just as likely it's either an unsigned variable, or the negative value is
flagged as an error. This is known to be a problem with certain pieces of
medical equipment, for liability reasons.

However, that's just an assertion, and not a fact. The reports I've seen
on power generation seems to show that some companies are doing well, and
others have barely started. I still don't expect a big power problem 
because what resources are available will be thrown at them, and because
of workarounds (e.g. the Swedes turning their nuclear plants back to 1990).
But otherwise the power industry seems about as screwed up as the rest.

aren't blocked, etc...

As far as I'm aware most gas stations have generators, so this shouldn't
be a problem. However, the gas still has to be shipped into the country,
refined, shipped around along potentially blocked and lawless highways.
That might be a problem, might not.

Last I heard there was a lot of grain rotting in the US because there 
wasn't enough capacity today to ship it all out. There are two big problems
with this, "Hell, we'll just go back to manual", answer. Firstly all the
people who know how to do this were laid off years ago; we don't have much
time to learn how to run it again from scratch. Secondly, in a lot of cases
it's simply impossible; on the East coast, all the big train switching yards
were eliminated years ago in favor of computer-controlled switches which
cannot be operated manually. Either the software works or we have to rip
them out and install manual switches; far from a simple job when people
are starving around you.

Not to mention non-compliant airports ('Sorry Sir, we think your baggage
went to the Ukraine'), lack of insurance, etc, and Lloyds say that modern 
ships are full of non-compliant embedded systems as well.

That's half the problem. People who rely on government handouts to survive
won't just sit around when they stop coming; they'll go out looting and
rioting instead. How many people will go into a riot zone to fix broken
computers?

Could also be because the 'following orders' arguments were just plain old
self-serving bullshit. There's almost no evidence of anyone ever being
forced to kill Jews, and plenty of evidence that many killers were given a choice. Few ever chose not to do so. Hell, some of them continued killing
Jews even after the German commanders explicitly ordered them to stop.

I suppose it would, but that prediction doesn't follow from the data.
According to their numbers, maybe 0.1% of all embedded systems are likely to
fail.  Of those, probably 90%+ of the ones used by critical services will
have been replaced in time.  Most of the failures will therefore be in toys,
consumer electronics, and other non-critical items.  The net effect on
critical services will be very small - enough to cause temporary localized
outages, at most.

We can only hope.  :-)

It could actually be a good thing if enough agencies decide to let
enforcement slide while they fix their systems.  If course, they are just as
likely to demand 'voluntary compliance' and make everyone wait on them.  I
guess we'll see when the time comes.

I think 'incomplete' would be more accurate.  The ability to deduce most of
modern physics based on nothing but a knowledge of mathematics and
information theory may not be the ultimate answer, but it would be a huge
step forward.

It looks to me like he's used his approach to derive at least one new law
already (that turbulent-flow equation), and more should follow.  You should
be able to test the approach by generating such equations for phenomena
where they do not currently exist, and then testing them.

IMHO this is pretty exiting stuff.  I hope we see more predictions, and some
experimental results, in the near future.

Look, obviously I can't offer personal evidence about every company in the
world.  I can say that my own company, which is one of the most incompetent,
dysfunctional, directionless organizations I have ever seen, has
nevertheless managed to tackle the problem successfully.  I was in charge of
the Unix side of our compliance program, and I can testify that all of our
mission-critical systems were ready by September of 1998.  We're currently
at the level of doing BIOS fixes on older PCs and date-testing some
low-priority embedded systems.  The way things are going now, we won't even
notice the date change.

Everyone else is doing exactly the same thing.  I remember talk about the
embedded-systems problem in the power industry back in '97, and I wasn't
even an insider.  The same is true of other critical industries.  Most of
the 'woeful unpreparedness' talk I've heard comes from people who are simply
trying to work up a panic to sell their pet solution.

The only people with real problems are those that fall into one of these
groups:

1) Organizations that are totally reliant on huge, byzantine, totally
antiquated software systems that no one really understands.  A lot of these
orgs migrated to newer systems over the last few years, and a few of them
fixed the programs they have.  The late starters don't have time now for
either solution.  Fortunately there are very few such organizations - the
average corporate database system doesn't even come close to fitting the
bill.

2) Organizations that dismissed the whole problem as a fantasy until it was
too late.  The Doomsayers talk a lot about this, but I can't think of a
single private organization I know anything about that has done it.  Y2K
readiness became a big issue for most people by early '98, which left plenty
of time to fix everything.

You are creating a problem by assuming it already exists.  Before you can
conjure up a landscape filled with abandoned cars and roving packs of
looters, you need to show that there are severe enough problems to actually
create such conditions.

What I'm trying to point out is that modern civilization simply is not that
fragile.  There is no way to create the kind of total paralysis that the Y2K
Doomsayers like to conjure up, and that means you can never get to the Mad
Max situation in the first place.

I remember talking about Y2K bugs back in the late 80s. Doesn't mean that
any of them were fixed. The Swedes didn't discover until late last year
that their nuclear stations would all fail in 1999; luckily they could
just switch the date back 'til 1990 and it all continued to work.

Stop the food supply to the major cities for three days and the world will 
be a very different place. 

The basic point is that at some level of failure it becomes impossible to
fix, because of lack of supplies and because those who could fix it will
bug out rather than stay and work on the problem. The question is, will we
get to that level? I don't think we will in the West on a national or global 
level, but probably will on a small scale in various areas.

I think we're getting a bit silly with this Y2K thing.

I work for a RBOC (Ameritech) and many of our Y2K teams are already
disbanding, every piece of hardware in my data center has a sticker
saying whether or not it is in compliance. all non-compliant items
will be gone by June 1st. The major C.O switches have been tested
as have all the links, so you will (at least here ;) ) have phone
service. The power companies were required to pass compliance on
this as well, and all C.O's have generators and big storage tanks.

The number of x-military personnel outnumbers current levels by
many dozens to one. When I was a Marine we used to have a saying,
the Russians don't fear the army, the navy, or even the air force,
they fear the NRA (this was before I was a member) 4 million plus
of the best equipped, most dedicated in the world. The last time
anybody counted the registered handguns in the Chicago area could
equip 40 or so divisions. That was the registered ones..... Chance
of the military taking over...... 0% 

Besides in many area's it will be winter, not prime time for
looting.....  ;) Besides riot's are illegal in Chicago, we haven't
had one since '68.


Have a couple of hundred cash on hand and a few weeks groceries,
and a box or two of ammo (at least a shotgun) maybe a portable
generator (or two, make a buck) and relax and enjoy the fun.

Why would the power outage make highways get blocked? Traffic lights being out
would definitely be a problem on regular streets, but highways should be fine.
Gas stations would need generators to run their pumps, for sure. I'm thinking
that it might be very profitable to just go get my electricians license
again... everyone will need to be taken off the grid so they can run their
buildings off of generators... then put back on when the power is back. I can
easily see emergency electric service fees exceeding 100-200 dollars an hour.

Of all the departments of the gov't, the military is apparently doing the best
job on y2k. They also have all of the old procedures documented, and plenty of
outmoded equipment stockpiled in reserve centers. I'm not too worried about
them.

I don't know where you are shopping, but my Northern Supply Catalog rep has
given me a three-to-four week delivery time on a 20kw generator. Generators
10kw or less are in stock. For a business of more than that, just buy a bunch
of small ones and string them together....I got a 3kw generator for my cabin
last year for $125, used, after the ice storm winter of last year. People were
dumping generators on the used market like crazy, stupidly. They are gonna buy
them again this year...

Most medium to large industrial installations have co-generation plants on
premises, which means that they have their own sources available. Reboot their
controllers after Jan 1 and they should be ok.

The thought translation device: a neurophysiological approach to
communication in total motor paralysis.

[Medline record in process]


A thought translation device (TTD) for brain-computer communication is
described. Three patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), with total motor paralysis, were trained for several months. In order
to enable such patients to communicate without any motor activity, a
technique was developed where subjects learn to control their slow cortical
potentials (SCP) in a 2-s rhythm, producing either cortical negativity or
positivity according to the task requirement. SCP differences between a
baseline interval and an active control interval are transformed into
vertical or horizontal cursor movements on a computer screen. Learning SCP
self regulation followed an operant-conditioning paradigm with
individualized shaping procedures. After prolonged training over more than
100 sessions, all patients achieved self-control, leading to a 70-80%
accuracy for two patients. The learned cortical skill enabled the patients
to select letters or words in a language-supporting program (LSP) developed
for inter-personal communication. The results demonstrate that the fast and
stable SCP self-control can be achieved with operant training and without
mediation of any muscle activity. The acquired skill allows communication
even in total locked-in states.

I'm going on record as saying that the Y2K doomsayers are going to look
silly a year from now, at least in regard to the USA. Some countries will
have bigger problems. Your point about lack of government handouts is off
the mark (unfortunately!). The government systems that give away our money
are the *most* advanced in terms of being fixed.

Why isn't it going to solve the problem? It's possible that if irrational
hysteria builds, then far more money than expected will be withdrawn. But
the Fed can handle even that, so long as it doesn't all happen in a day. If
people draw out extra cash over weeks or months towards the end of the
year, there will no real problem. Banks will be fine.

Again, this seems to be a general assumption. The belief may be
self-fulfilling, producing a short-term dip. If so, I look forward to
buying great companies at sale prices. However, again in regard to the USA
(and perhaps Europe to a lesser extent), the *opposite* may happen. If
you're in a country that has done almost nothing to address the Y2K
problem, where would you want to put your money. It seems possible that the
US stock market or money market funds will see an increased influx from
overseas. This might either damp any dip caused by US investors, or
actually cause a rise. Either way, I think it's impossible to time market
drops and rises. If you're a long-term investor it makes sense to ride it
through.

I agree that the Y2K threat is much more of an issue for Asian countries
and South America. Venezuela only officially started action a couple of
months ago. But then I'm not clear how many of these countries systems are
old enough to have the problem.

>I won't even mention oil; the Middle East is almost as doomed as Asia.

Any information to back up this claim? I would think they could afford to
update their systems, though that doesn't mean they have.

Out of action? What evidence do you have for that? I'm not saying you're
wrong, but I haven't seen much reason to agree. I only recall tests that
show important systems will work. Since I don't see major problems in the
US, the military will not be busy here. 

If we can agree on some specific claim about unrest in the US and some of
these other points, I'm willing to bet money against the doomsayer view.

Please, please, please, make me a specific enough claim about civil way in
the US, and I'll take a bet against!

I'll also take a bet against your view that millions will become
unemployed. We would need to agree on a number of increased unemployed and
over what period. I think there will be little or no effect on unemployment.

  IAN: The Germans were not born with any inherent

  heavy GovtMedia propaganda campaigns on the War on 
  Drugs and we could see what happened to Jews happen
  to drug users, or to militia groups, or to Waco Tx.

  IAN: Or "greater good." Right I agree with your

  suggests that Special Forces in the U.S. have SS-

  the types that are used in help regimes in

  The rank-and-file National Guard will be a different

  likely. SS-type groups are designed to weed out 
  "trouble makers" (ethical people) in the military.

The date-related embedded chip problem is greatly overblown.  There is no
reason why a date-sensitive maintenance monitoring system would be
knowingly designed to catastrophically shut down the power supply system
because of a date discrepancy.  The design goal is to increase
reliability, not sabotage it.  A false warning might be issued, meaning a
red light would go on on a panel somewhere, or a printout would be
produced.  Not a real big deal.  Or, a date-based maintenance
notification which should be issued might not be issued.  Also not a real
big deal, since extra caution will be used in interpreting maintenance
warnings or lack thereof around Y2K.



>Because it's the middle of the winter, the other stations
>along the grid are already taxed to the limit. 



Max power demand (typical USA) is in the summer, not the winter, although
this is starting to change as more heating systems are now built using
electrically powered heat pumps.


Power demand fluctuates widely, and almost never reaches capacity. 
Historic summer peaks are usually about 20% below capacity.  That is
because they have to have excess capacity anyway so units can be taken
down for routine maintenance, and to allow for a prudent reserve
capacity.  That has the effect of providing a very comfortable reserve
margin most of the time.


In the unlikely event that power demand significantly exceeds capacity,
there are a number of remedies available, and they are only inconvenient,
not catastrophic.  Voltage reduction (brownout) can cut load by 5% or
more, and controlled rolling blackouts can curtail load by any amount
desired.  During the January 1994 Washington DC area power crisis, local
governments ordered businesses to cut power demand.  That worked well,
and no brownouts or rolling blackouts were necessary.  In my area, the
Maryland suburbs of Washington DC, the power company has installed radio
controlled cutoff switches on many residential air conditioners and water
heaters so the power company can cut them off by remote control when
needed.  Customers who accept installation of those switches receive a
discount on their electric bill.


 These
>critical minimum failures start a cascade or domino effect
>by draining power from other stations, thereby shutting them
>down.  


As mentioned above, maintenance monitors should not pose much danger of
catastrophic supply failure.  But there are plenty of monitors of system
condition which are designed to quickly shut off the power when certain
faults occur, for reasons of safety and protection of equipment from
unnecessary damage.  That's why we sometimes get widespread cascading
power failures, like the great Northeast Blackout of 1965.  But those
monitor systems are not likely to be date-senstive; there is no reason
for them to be.  Instead they look for over-current or over-voltage
faults, and things like a sudden drop in current which may be due to a
break in the transmission line.  



This taxes the remaining operational infrastructure
>even further and finally shuts the entire grid down.  A
>nationwide, if not global wide power outage occurs.


The USA is too big geographically to be considered to have a single
monolithic national grid per se.  In practice the regional power sharing
pools are on the order of 200 to 300 miles wide in densely populated
areas like the northeast, and somewhat bigger in less dense areas as in
the western states.  Yes, the regional grids are themselves generally
connected to adjacent grids for added flexibility, but transmission
losses mount with longer distances, so typically the generating point
where most of a given user's power originates is only a few miles away
from that user.


Reportedly the Netherlands has threatened to cut loose from their
European regional power connections when Y2K arrives, unless other nearby
countries make better progress on Y2K fixes.  Normally the existence of a
grid improves reliability and economy.  But if a grid experiences a
cascade failure, or if such a failure is feared, the grid can be easily
and quickly broken up into smaller independent parts by throwing
switches.  So if a widespread domino effect failure occurs, recovery for
most areas should be rapid, as in the 1965 Northeast Blackout.  And power
companies are already aware that there may be Y2K problems and so
presumably will be extra careful as Y2K arrives.  It may happen that many
electric utilities will opt to disconnect from the grid as a precaution
shortly before Y2K arrives, then cautiously restore connectivity
thereafter.

In a country the size of the USA, governors declare states of emergency
so frequently, that sometimes it seems to be almost a monthly occurrence.
 Likewise with Presidential Disaster Area Declarations.  These
declarations are usually due to weather related problems, and sometimes
flood, earthquake or riot.

Large grocery stores (at least in my area) have on-site diesel generators
and continue to operate during power failures.  During the 1965 New York
blackout and in the aftermath of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake there
was virtually no looting.  Millions of people are already planning to
stockpile food and other provisions in preparation for Y2K, which should
help mitigate a food shortage.  If the electricity goes off there will
soon be no water, as most water supply systems do not have backup
generators for the pumps.  But a typical house has a water heater with a
40 gallon tank.  There is a valve near the bottom of the tank which can
be used as a source of water in an emergency.  (Any gas or electric
supply to a water heater should be turned off before draining the tank.)

Reportedly contingency plans are being made to activate National Guard
units if needed when Y2K hits.  Such a precaution is not unreasonable. 
The same thing is done when a hurricane approaches.

It seems unlikely based on the fact that the police and military have not
done that when called out for emergencies in the past 100 years.

It does not seem technically feasible to use radar from aircraft to
locate small arms.  But assuming such things could be detected from
aircraft, how much different would an upright vacuum cleaner or a mop
with a metal handle look than a rifle or shotgun?



  Obviously they will

It takes a lot of man hours to thoroughly search a house for small arms. 
If there were widespread Y2K disruption, one would think the authorities
would have more important things to do than search houses.  And if there
were little or no Y2K disruptions, there would no unusual excuse for such
searches.  And a general search of houses would seem to raise big
political and legal questions.

Curfews have been used before to discourage looting, and afterwards
people complain about the looting, not the curfew.

There is a certain impulse in humans to want to control others. 
Traditionally this impulse has been relatively restrained in American
society, especially since the abolition of slavery.  That impulse shows
up today in government imposed bans on smoking in restaurants and
offices, motorcycle and bicycle helmet laws, drug laws, medical
regulation by the FDA, mandatory recycling programs, and many other
instances.  But since these laws are all theoretically able to be
repealed through a democratic political process, and since certain basic
rights are still mostly respected, we do not have a totalitarian system
at this time.  


In Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia a small, determined, cohesive,
opportunistic minority was able to seize control and impose a
totalitarian regime.  But to be successful the majority had to at least
tolerate them.  In the US today there is no readily identifiable,
cohesive, and clearly totalitarian minority itching to seize power.  We
have people like the two Clintons, Giuliani, Falwell, Buchanan, Shumer,
Jesse Jackson, and Louis Farrakhan.  Each of those public figures is
despised by some and loved by others.  And each could be accused, rightly
or wrongly, of being a would-be dictator.  But can you picture those
people getting together and trying to organize a coup?  I can't.

Is this the whole thing?  Where'd you find it, or recommend I could go to

Although I think that Y2K will be a major catastrophe, I'd still be
willing to bet money against riots and civil disorder.  How can you lose
a bet like that?  I mean, I'm willing to bet any amount of money you
care to name that there won't be a Singularity by the year 2050, even
though I place it at 2025 or earlier...

My prediction: everything will fail, things will look really grim for a day,
and then we'll all decide it's 1990 again and reset all the clocks.  The only
people permanently affected will be calendar printers, who'll have a bonanza
of reselling.

Further prediction: rather than fixing things we re-live the 1990s over and
over.  Ken Starr keeps on investigating Clinton, even after he leaves office.
Tech stocks keep going up.  And the Apocalypse will always be 10 years away.

I recently tried reading Sterling's novel "Holy Fire", but only got halfway
through before getting bored and quitting. A somewhat promising beginning,
where a newly rejuvenated older woman "runs away from home" is then marred by
the fact that this woman doesn't seem to be facing any real danger or any
great stress even -- highly suspenseful, yawn!

Politically speaking, the novel seems to emphasize a sort of almost
anti-capitalist response to high tech, or maybe it's more a kind of government
paternalism, where even rich folks are continually guided by government
appointed mentors or advisors of some kind. The world "polity" has everything
figured out. Personally I consider myself fairly middle-of-the-road, but I'm
not sure exactly where this socialist approach to high tech is coming from,
maybe from the people who'd be socialists just the same, if prospects were
*low* tech? On the technology side, nanotechnology seems to be implied,
although if there are any molecular factories in the story, I missed it.

On a more positive note, I just read _The Bones of Time_, by Kathleen Anne
Goonan. In some ways this is more about time travel and esoteric theories of
consciousness than it is about technology. However, in this book, both the
nanotechology and the "capitalism gone awry" theme seem fresh and convincing,
as the characters meet with real dangers, surprises, tough choices, etc. The
ending is quite traditional sf, in a way, solving some mysteries, leaving
others sort of hanging, I thought it was quite good on the whole.

We've all seen the ludriciously

and the only slightly better

of Star Trek. 

What do you people think would
be "realistic" space-based weaponry, i.e. weaponry that obeys the laws of physics that might reasonably be deployed from an interplanetary spacecraft with the goal of
 disabling/destroying another
interplanetary spacecraft?

Any ideas? (including but certainly

kinetic kill devices, lasers, 
mines and the dreaded

darin, i hope the right answer is "none".  space travel is hard enough

I tried to point this out earlier on this list, writing: "Because if nothing
existed, no one could ask the question." But the list called that a
"circular argument" and apparently deems the question as worthy of ongoing
consideration. Technically, I think this fits in the category of teleology,
a branch of philosophy (so perhaps philosophers on the list can help out?).
Personally, I don't think the universe (or existence) has a purpose, and
consequently, asking "why" the universe (or existence) exists doesn't
compute. I mean, for the question to have rational validity, one has to
presume that reason precedes existence, so that existence can have a
"why" -- does that make sense? But didn't the Existentialists put things in
order by declaring that "existence precedes essence" so now we have to
decide what it all means, since meaning did not exist before intention?

If we ask "HOW does anything exist at all?" we might get a better handle on
it. The way I see it, human (transhuman, posthuman, suprahuman, metahuman,
whatever) consciousness has only just begun.

So do I. If you think I'm a doomsayer, you obviously haven't spent much
time reading the Y2K groups on Usenet lately. I'm expecting big problems
for six months to a year, not a return to the stone age.

As far as I'm aware, the systems that give out money are the most advanced.
The systems that collect taxes, and the systems which actually get that
money to the people who are supposed to have it are well behind.

>Why isn't it going to solve the problem?

Because after they've printed out all that extra cash, there will be
less than a thousand dollars per person in circulation in the US. That's 
a tiny percentage of the amount deposited in banks.

>It's possible that if irrational

It's more than possible; you only need to look at a few of the surveys
conducted in the last few months and do the math. The last survey I saw
showed that 'only' about 25% of people planned to take most of their
money out. If 'only' that number of people take their money out the
banks will run out of cash very, very quickly. When you consider that
the people most likely to withdraw cash are those with larger amounts in
the banks, the situation becomes even worse.

>Again, this seems to be a general assumption. The belief may be

The reason I think it's inevitable is that it is self-fulfilling, just as
with the banks. It's simple game theory: we're in a Prisoner's Dilemna here,
and the rational response is to default, so people will.

That's a good point, but I still think that most of those people would
rather have a wad of cash or a pile of gold under their bed than stocks 
which may well lose 90% of their value in a few weeks. I still haven't 
decided whether to sell mine or keep most of them for the long term.

Various news reports about Arab countries just starting to think about
Y2K.

Oh, most of them can afford it. But at this point you can throw all the
money you like at a big programming project and it still won't be
finished in time. Time is what they need, and time is what we no longer
have.

>Out of action? What evidence do you have for that?

The way the military keep missing deadlines, and mostly meet those they
meet by redefining critical systems as no longer critical. Doesn't bode
well for such a high-tech military.

>Please, please, please, make me a specific enough claim about civil way in

That all comes down to how the government and military handles it; that's 
impossible to tell at this point.

After the IRS, the military are the most likely to lie about compliance. The
last report I saw on their progress said they'd made great progress in only
a couple of months. However, reading the fine print you discovered that
they had made that progress primarily by redefining hundreds of mission
critical systems as no longer mission critical, and claiming other systems
were compliant without testing. Not good.

I still like the IBM research lab where a friend used to work; they have
or had a Concorde jet engine in the basement which could generate megawatts
if the power went out.

This question is almost constantly debated on rec.arts.sf.science

The short answer seems to be: depends a lot on what kind of propulsion
you have, and if it is possible to detect other spacecraft well.

The trick isn't to do enough damage, at the speeds interplanetary
spacecraft moves even some nails coming in the opposite direction can
be enough to disable or destroy it, it is to hit it - space is large
and spaceships are small.

Tell that to the Swedes; their software essentially said:

main ()
{
 if (year == '99')
    shut_down_reactor();
 else
    produce_power ();
}

Luckily that was in their main control system rather than the embedded
systems, so they could just reset the date and keep running. 

But the biggest problem with this argument is the idea that software is
'knowingly designed' to act in this way. Software wasn't 'knowingly designed'
to fail in ten months from now, that's just an unexpected side-effect of
other design choices; few people expected it to still be running today.

Most of the bugs I see are not 'knowingly designed' into the system,
they're the consequence of plugging together software which has been
designed to do one thing and also does others that no-one considered when 
they dropped it into their system; for example, I was reading an article a
while ago decrying the increasing use of C++ as people drop more and more
reusable objects into their Windows programs without understanding what 
the objects actually do, and add many new bugs due to unexpected 
interactions. 

These controllers are knowingly designed to fail in certain ways when
certain things happen. Whether anyone actually knows what those failure
modes are or considered them when they built their system around those
controllers is another question entirely.

Of course not.  I was just pointing out that even if a chip has date-related
processing, and it isn't compliant, and it generates false results, you
still don't necessarily cause the whole device to fail.  Most of the time
you just confuse its reporting functions - a warning light goes on, or fails
to go on, or you get odd-looking numbers on your maintenance report, or
whatever.  Since everyone knows about the Y2K issue, that isn't a big deal.

I think you both misunderstand the question.  We aren't talking about some
philosophical argument about the ultimate meaning of life.  When a physicist
asks "Why does something exist?", what he means is "What process is
responsible for the existance of observable reality?"  In some ways this is
equivalent to asking "Why do we have these particular laws of physics, and
not some other set of laws?"

A lot of scientists have backed away from this kind of questioning, either
because they think it is unanswerable or because it sounds too much like
religion.  However, it is merely the logical end result of the ongoing quest
for a real theory of cosmology.  If it seems meaningless now, that simply
indicates that we don't yet know enough to properly address the issue.

Its been estimated that if they were to go back to a paper bureaucracy, they
would need to draft about 35-40% of the population to do the paperwork, or
recind at least 75% of all federal regulations....

This will most likely get overturned on appeal. The judge obviously
instructed the jury to disregard the concept of 'jury nullification'.
The logic is specious, and the manufacturers may get the NRA to support
a suit against the city for unconstitutionally restricting the rights of
the victims to carry firearms, thus not being able to protect
themselves.

Moreover, there is a problem with jurisdiction. If the manufacturers
committed the acts in southern states, as alleged, then the trials
should be there. If the acts were in the boardrooms of the manufacturers
then the trials should have been in Conneticutt or New Hampshire or
Arizona, etc. Since there are no gun manufacturers based in New York,
the court there has no jurisdiction, even though residents of the state
may have standing. There is also the fact that since they are convicting
the manufacturers on the basis of interstate trade, they are imfringing
on the power of congress, which is also an avenue they can get the
ruling knocked out on.

I know plenty about carriers, I've been on four. I know the
equipment, I was in avionics (ECM) working on A6-E TRAMS and EA6B
Prowlers.

I'm not impressed.

Carriers are very good at some things, but have limited range, and
a host of other weaknesses. Besides, I live in Chicago, you'd never
get one near me.

As Vietnam proved, an aircraft carrier is of absolutely no use against a
rural, grassroots insurgency force. The proper equipment for the job. The only
way they will be able to control things if they are stupid enough to try to
take over is to use chemical and biological weapons...

It all depends on your assumptions.  As Anders pointed out, there is lots of
speculation about applications of mundane technology in usenet, and they
also get a lot of unlikely suggestions from guys who think they've invented
perpetual motion machines and force fields.  However, I haven't seen much
written about the kind of future most of us expect (with nanotech, advanced
biotech, AI/massive automation, and very rapid change).

The way things are going now we will probably have primitive nanotech and
rather advanced biotech before anyone puts weapons on an interplanetary
spacecraft.  If we get real advances in AI in the same time frame the
situation is going to be far to chaotic for meaningful predictions - IE and
nanotech would both advance so fast that our prediction horizon would be
reached within a few years.  If AI and nanotech both advance at a slower
rate, we might get a brief era in which space warships could be built.

That means we should assume cheap diamondoid construction, a high level of
automation, amazingly good sensors and computers, and at least limited sorts
of self-replication.  I'm also going to assume free use of nuclear weapons
and power systems, mainly because people who are squeamish about such things
aren't likely to build combat spacecraft in the first place.  That leaves me
with the following ideas:

A warship's missile-defense lasers should be completely effect out to a
range of a few thousand miles.  Lasers should have an effective range of 10
to 100 times that far against other ships, depending on how fast they can
dodge.  That suggests ships armed with heavy lasers for close range combat,
and missiles mounting bomb-pumped lasers for long-range combat.  Ordinary
nuclear missiles could be useful for killing kinetic energy weapons, other
missiles, nanobot swarms, and other target's that don't have much missile
defense.

Plasma weapons and charged particle beams probably aren't viable weapons,
because they can't match the range of the lasers.  Neutron beams could be
very effective, if someone can figure out how to get a decent beam intensity
without building a particle accelerator the size of Nebraska.  If stealth
technology is good you could do interesting things with mass drivers and
stealthy payloads (nuclear bombs are still more effective than nanobots for
anything except planetary bombardment).

For more exotic possibilities, try particle beams that use anti-matter
particles.  They would have a slightly shorter range than lasers, but would
do far more damage to large targets.  Of course, you have to carry a supply
of antimatter around to use as ammo, which makes your ship a bit more
vulnerable.

Overall, I would expect a trend of very rapid growth in ship size (large
ships using even primitive nanotech would be very difficult to disable).

Personally I tend towards a stealthy control ship with remotely-controlled 
or semi-intelligent drones to do the fighting. As someone else said, the
big problem in space battles will be finding the target, and any action you
take is likely to give away your position. Better to send out a few drones
with active sensors followed by more with passive sensors and large warheads
to kill any targets they spot.

I certainly believe it is valuable to investigate the tolerance limits
of the so called laws of nature.
For example playing with different values of universal constants to see
which ones can support a viable universe and which cant - this helps us
to understand the relationships between them.  However this does not,
nor will it ever explain WHY the universe exists - it only tells us HOW.

Science is about measuring things, finding out how they work -
philosophy deals with the why.

The English word "why" has at least four different meanings:
physical causation, logical implication, agentive justification,
and agentive motive ("telos").  The teleological "why" may be
a waste of time to investigate, but the others might not be.
In particular, an interesting and useful question is "Is there
a relatively simple set of initial conditions from which the
complex Universe we see could have evolved?"

ObLojbanPlug: Lojban, of course, has distinct words for all of
these, making it difficult to pose the question as ambiguously
as it is posed in English.

I can't resist putting in a plug for the Foresight Exchange, an online
implementation of Robin Hanson's Idea Futures concept. The exchange has a
number of claims related to the consequences of Y2K; thus, interested
parties can bet (trade) based on what they think those consequences are
going to be. The exchange doesn't use real money, but it's possible to
track who has traded on which claim at what price, for reputation purposes.

Some of the Y2K claims:

Claim  bid/ask/lst Short description               URL
-------------------------------------------------------
Y2Kdth 56/ 60/ 60  >=200 deaths caused by Y2K bug

Y2Kstk 51/ 64/ 60  Y2K closes US Stock trading

Y2Knuc 75/ 88/ 85  Y2K % Nuke Plants operational
http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Y2Knuc

Of course, the prices may be somewhat biased: someone who really expects
dire Y2K consequences will figure that the exchange is unlikely to be
operational next year, meaning that they wouldn't be able to collect on
their winning predictions.

Okay, so the question becomes, "What process is responsible for the
existence of anything at all?"
Doesn't it? (The orginal question: "Why does anything exist at all?")
But that presupposes a "process" can exist before "anything at all."
Doesn't it?

circular nature of existence, and to refute the idea of an open

The question has meaning. It just doesn't compute. Like the question, "What
exists ten miles north of the North Pole?" doesn't compute, because you
can't go ten miles north of the North Pole. Or, "What happened before the
Big Bang?" doesn't compute because according to that theory, time didn't
exist before the Big Bang, so you can't go back in time before then.

As already stated, the question "Why does anything exist at all?" doesn't
compute because the word "why" implies reason, intent, and so forth. If you
change it from a "why" question to a "what" question ("What process is
responsible for the existance of observable reality?") you've changed the
question entirely, and made it an altogether different query. Which doesn't
bother me... let's go with it.

First, it seems to me that innumerable processes have resulted in observable
reality, not just one process. So, what "process" started it all? Sounds
like a very special process indeed. How did such a "process" come to exist?
Has it always existed? Should we call it a "force" as some have done? Does
that "force" drive us to discover it before the universe dies entropically?

Speaking of entropy, have you heard? Clinton will remain in office.

Cheers,

J. R.

Not really, but his response (the Anthropic Principle) is specious. 
What the Anthropic Principle states is that, _given_ the existence of,
say, 10^10 planets, then probabilities of 10^10:1 (or, preferably,
lower) can be invoked to explain the evolution of intelligent life. 
Likewise, given 10^50 Universes, there's no need to explain why certain
fundamental constants are accurate to within one part in a million for
generating planets - even though other theories, such as evolving
families of Universes, may be even more plausible.

The Anthropic Principle says nothing whatsover about how that huge
population, all those planets or Universes, got there in the first place.

Molloy's answer logically applies just the same here:  "Why is the sky
blue?  Well, if it wasn't blue, we wouldn't be asking that question."

I think there are a number of things that *could*  happen, 
however I have yet to see anyone suggest any practical solutions to this 
issue. In my opinion, I think there should be less emphasis what could 
happen, and more emphasis on solutions. 

This should be a grass-roots, geographically-oriented mobilizaiton of

Likewise, "physical causation" has at least the following meanings: 
Thermodynamic causality, or using Occam's Razor to deduce that the
direction of time is from smaller to larger probability volumes;
relativistic causality, or the direction of time as determined by
gravitation; mathematical causality, which you call "logical
implication", but which also explains the verifiable fact that one
planet plus one planet equals two planets; static logical causality,
which refers to deductions operating on an instantaneous data-set using
non-temporal rules; temporal logical causality, which refers to
deductions predicting future states of a data set which evolves
continuously or discretely according to process rules.

Let's see Lojban distinguish between _that_.  Incidentally, this isn't a
complete list.

Anyway, of all these forms of causality, the only one that I believe is
objectively real is relativistic causality; all the others are
simplifications therefrom.  No, let me strike that:  The only one which
_might possibly_ be real is relativistic causality.

I don't believe in any form of logical or mathematical justification. 
Anything real is an experimentally detectable physical process.  That
also goes for the reason why anything exists at all.  The reason why
physical processes exist will itself be a physical process, not a
logical argument or a mathematical equation.  Nor will physics ever be
able to explain all presently observable processes until this reason is known.

I don't believe in things that aren't experimentally detectable; there
is a reason why anything exists at all; ergo that reason is
experimentally detectable; QED.

Eganic, yes, but there's a reason why "Greg Egan" is the superlative
conjugation of "SF author".

In terms of solutions, there really isn't anything we can do on a group
basis. Some people here are obviously in the front-line of fixing their
companies, but most of us are only able to evaluate our personal 
circumstances and plan accordingly for the level of disruption we expect.

Getting back to what I was saying about bank runs, I was amused to read
another 'Y2K is no big deal' article today. After telling people that the
biggest problem was panic, they then went on to say that everyone should
take out two weeks' pay before Christmas just in case... a recommendation 
which would by itself cause the collapse or near-collapse of the banking 
system if everyone followed it. Idiots.

I think your right Mike.  But also consider that there are plenty of very bright
chemists capable of making something really nasty themselves - like Sarin Gas -
the stuff used in the Tokyo subway incident.  One cc. of pure Sarin in aerosol
form could easily kill a medium sized city.  If one of these chemists or his
associates call's up the big-bad-boys-of-martial-law and tells them that they
either return the power back to the people or face continued and random sarin gas
attacks in vital areas, you'd quickly get a stalemate situation.

When you have large amounts of military personnel wandering the streets never
knowing whether a Sarin gas attack could happen anytime, it will do much to
disrupt morale and the cohesiveness of a martial law regime.

  Hi Ron,

  Check this out, I ran into a quick and dirty 
  explanation of why 0^0 = 1 from a math whiz:

"In a similar manner I used to believe 0^0 was undefined.  I mean if there
is disagreement over it's value, shouldn't it be undefined?  Again by
reading the axiomatic development of set theory, I now believe that 0^0
should be 1, because there is indeed 1 function from the empty set to the
empty set, namely the empty function."

  Strange, so I guess the number 1 is then a measure
 of the number of functions that occur. ?

  BTW, saw and gave a quick initial read of your 
 Article 23 reply, I hope your right! but will 
 see if I can sustain my stated reading. A law 
 is only as good as whatever can be logically 
 read into it, well, obviously.

	Now we're talking.  What is everyone actually doing?

	I have an old dormant bank account in a state we moved away
from several years ago.  I recently wrote a check for $1000 and put it
in there as a back up source for drawing checks in case my local
active credit union checking account has problems.

	I plan on having a few hundred bucks of cache sitting around
the house.  (Some of my family is saying you should have, and they
each do have, 3 months salary of cache laying around.  That's too much
for me.)

	I recently refinanced our house and pulled out an extra $10K
to put in the stock market when it supposedly has this crash.  I
thought the drop several months ago was the start, but now with the
market back being so strong this year, I'm sure I've long since missed
whatever crash/bargain opportunities might have occurred.

	This January 99 saw a lot of new money going into the stock
market due to the typical "January effect".  I'd bet the "January
effect" after the new millennium next year when everyone realizes the
y2k problems isn't, the market will go hog willed with everyone trying
to get their saved up cache back into the market.  I'm going to try to
have most of my cache back in the market long before then.

	Could this really cause such a collapse?  As I indicated
before many of my more fundamentalistic family and friends are getting
more cache than this in their house right now.  Isn't this a big
reason the Fed came up with the new currency to handle all this extra
demand?  There was a huge drain of cache during the stock market fall
back in 87, something that would have surely caused major problems 100
years ago.  But the Fed was ready and flooded the system with whatever
it needed.  Some banks had to pay high interest to get access to it
for the short time required but what was required was made available
and they didn't have to pay interest on all the money people had
withdrawn from their accounts.  With the power the fed has today to
print money, monitor supplies, and respond rapidly, I think there is
much more flexibility in the system today than people think.

	If you you want to take extra cache out go ahead and do it.
It'll simply cost you some lost interest, but that's about it as far
as I can see.

If you are going to cache some cash, it's much better for the system as
a whole to do it now, rather than waiting until next Christmas.  You do
forego more interest, but 4% of even three months' salary is only 1%
of your yearly income.

If cash withdrawals start increasing early in the year, there is more time
for the banking system to react.  Banks can reduce their loan portfolios,
the Fed could start printing larger bills if necessary, and/or special
acccounting provisions can allow banks to give out more cash than they
normally could.

If the big crunch hits all at once, there is less time to react, and
the banks could run out of cash.  In that case they would have to start
limiting cash withdrawals.  I think there is some precedent for this
during the S&L failures in the 1980s.  The S&Ls were able to continue
operating in some form but depositors could only get their money out a
little bit at a time.

Getting your money out early both benefits the system and also increases
the chance that you won't find yourself limited in what you can get.

The main problem is safely storing the money.  There is some concern
that if this practice becomes widespread, home invasion robberies may
become more common.  (Of course, if you do get robbed in this way, maybe
you would rather that the robbers happily find thousands of dollars in
cash than angrily discover that you don't have anything.)

One possibility is to put some part of the money in a safe deposit box
at the bank, but if the bank completely shuts down you may not be able
to get to that for a while.  However if the "soft landing" with limited
withdrawals scenario occurs, you should be able to get to it.

The ironic thing is that banks appear to be in relatively good shape as
far as Y2K software.  They have been working aggressively on the problem
for the last year or so, the Fed is cracking down on banks and has said
that problem banks will be merged out of existence.  The chance that
a bank will actually lose your money due to its broken software looks
pretty remote.  (Of course power failures would temporarily cripple
banks along with most other businesses.)

Banks plan a big PR campaign later this year about how well prepared
they are.  But it may not matter if people want to withdraw cash not
because they are afraid of bank Y2K failures, but because they are
afraid of Y2K-fear-driven bank runs.  We may see a return to WWII civic
propaganda, casting aspersions on people who fearfully withdraw money,
making them look like selfish hoarders.  By protecting themselves they
are injuring the banking system and hurting their neighbors.  I don't
know if such a message would sell today, but they might try it.

If "Why is the sky blue?" has the same logical applicability as "Why does
anything at all exist?", then just as Aristotle and his contemporaries had
insufficient data to accurately (and completely) answer both questions, so
we have an inadequate information base to answer the second question. The
bottom line of this information gap: We haven't yet got enough information
at our disposal to reliably answer the (second) question -- which comes
close to restating what you've already mentioned in this regard.
IOW, in all honesty, we don't know the answer, yet.

Can we absolutely deny that nothing at all exists in the absence of
principles which explain why anything at all exists? If so, then those
principles exist as essential, rather than existential facts. This implies
the existence of something which presently remains an undetectable mystery.
Even if someone or something could tell me the answer, with my present
capabilities I could not verify it. This explains part of the urge some of
us have to figure things out for ourselves -- even if it means figuring out
that we can't know just yet.

I suspect that if I knew why anything exists at all, I'd know better than
try to communicate this science via email. Anyway, do we all agree that no
one (presently) knows why anything exists at all?

The problem isn't so much that, but that the gummint would stage such an attack on a
rioting population i.e. south central LA or The DC ghetto/welfare island, then blame
it on right wing 'terrorists' as an excuse to come down on the rest of the country
with 'justification'.

Thanks for pointing out that software which is patched and updated
haphazardly over time, especially by programmers who may not have a
comprehensive understanding of the software being modified and the
application, is likely to have bugs.


The programs in embedded controller devices tend to be short and simple
in comparison to high level control application software, and designed
for a very limited function, such as condition and fault monitoring.  It
seems that the power generation and distribution system as a whole would
grant very limited independent authority to embedded controllers, since
the power companies would want maximum oversight and control to reside in
generating plant control rooms and grid and switchyard control rooms.  I
concede that it's an open question as to just how much trouble will
result from date-related problems in embedded controller devices.

Well, since you asked. :)  In addition to having the necessary root
vocabulary, Lojban also has well-defined ways to combine existing
concepts into new words.  These are strict enough that even someone
hearing such a coinage for the first time can generally decipher
the intended meaning.  Your "thermodynamic causality", for example,
I would render as "nenmalnicri'a", which can be reduced by rules to
roughly "(energy-disorder)-cause", and would by default be a predicate
with the same arguments and general meaning as the root word for
physical cause, and perhaps other arguments if needed (probably none
in this case).

[For the gory details, go to www.lojban.org]

Math results are neither real nor unreal; they are merely tautologies.
That some map the symbols used in those tautologies onto physical
phenomena and then interpret those tautologies as predictions or
explanations of those phenomena is not the fault of mathematics, but
of those doing the interpreting (not that this isn't a useful exercise).

A cure for death 

As science unlocks the secrets of human aging, immortality may soon
be within our reach writes DAMIEN BRODERICK. 

MEDICAL science still can't even banish the common cold. While it is beating
HIV/AIDS to a standstill in the rich countries, using expensive cocktails of
designer drugs, there isn't yet a cure or vaccine. Is it preposterous,
then, to
suggest that science may soon halt and even reverse the aging process? That it
may conquer death itself? Not at all.

In vitro evolution of horse heart myoglobin to increase peroxidase activity
L. Wan, M. B. Twitchett, L. D. Eltis, A. G. Mauk and M. Smith
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 95:22 12825--31 Oct 27 1998

Myoglobin, just like hemoglobin, is able to break down hydrogen
peroxide. In this experiment they made a gene for the protein,
subjected it to mutations, implanted it in bacteria, screened for
peroxidase activity, took the best version and continued the
process. The result was a protein 25 times as active as the
original. Nice to see that it is possible to improve on nature using
so few iterations.



Penile erection produced by microstimulation of the sacral spinal cord
of the cat
C. Tai and A. M. Booth and W. C. de Groat and J. R. Roppolo
IEEE Trans Rehabil Eng, 6:4 374--81, Dec 1998

The neural pathways of erection are rather messy, but this paper
studies how microstimulation in the spinal cord can cause it. The
obvious application is of course for helping people with spinal cord
injury, but I think there might be transhumanist potential for hedonic
engineering here.


Phlorizin, a competitive inhibitor of glucose transport, facilitates
memory storage in mice
M. M. Boccia, S. R. Kopf and C. M. Baratti
Neurobiol Learn Mem, 71:1 104-12, Jan 1999

And the obligatory new memory enhancer :-) It is known that glucose
enhances memory encoding, so it would appear that an inhibitor like
phlorizin would make encoding worse, but the opposite is true. When
injected after training it made mice quicker at avoiding an electric
shock they had learned before, but there was no effect if given just
before the testing, so it just enhances encoding, not retrieval. It
shows the usual inverted U-curve, and counteracted the memory decrease
caused by insulin. So it seems that it is enough that a substance is
glucose-like to affect memory, very odd.




No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization
David H Wolpert and Wiliam G Macready
IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 1:1 67--82 1997

It might look like some ways of optimizing are better than others
(like genetic algorithms being better than hillclimbing which is
better than random search), but surprisingly it is wrong. If an
algorithm for finding an optimim performs better than another
algorithm on a certain set of optimization problems, then the reverse
must be true for all other optimization problems! This means that
there is no best method, and in fact they are all just as bad as
random search. This might look very strange or even depressing, but it
is really fairly trivial: the set of all optimization problems include
a vast majority of completely intractable problems (like finding the
optimum of a pseudorandom function), the set of "reasonable" problems
we are used to is vanishingly small. Over a certain set of problems,
there are certainly functions that are better than others. This is
just another demonstration that prior knowledge is essential for
problem solving. 


Information Rich Glyphs for Software Management Data
Mei C Chuah and Stephen G Eick
IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 24--29 July/August 1998

Just some more visualization tricks, this time glyphs representing
things such as added lines, errors, number of changes, people etc in a
database of software releases. They use a wheel-like or bug-like
glyphs and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Maybe useful
for analyzing mailing list archives?


The Information Mural: A Technique for Displaying and Navigating Large
Information Spaces
Dean F Jerding and John T. Stasko IEEE Transactions on Visualization
and Computer Graphics, 4:3 257--271, July-September 1998

Another nice way of visualizing data: have a shrunken "mural"
depicting the whole document/database at the side of the magnified
view you watch. Makes it possible to both get an overview, notice
patterns and search.


StartleCam: a cybernetic wearable camera
Healey, J.; Picard, R.W.
Wearable Computers, 1998. Digest of Papers. Second International Symposium on

A fun system, now actually implemented in reality. The wearer has
sensors measuring galvanic skin response, and a wearable video
camera. If the skin response rises, the system stores the pictures
leading up to that point. Seems to be able to trigger not just to
surprises or stress, but also attention. Very interesting, and
suggests that affective computing can become quite useful.



Characterization and control of small-world networks
S. A. Pandit, R. E. Amritkar
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/chao-dyn/9901017

Small-world networks (the kind of networks where some long-range
connections makes almost every node close to every other node, despite
having mostly local connections; examples include collaboration
graphs, neural networks and power grids) appears to be useful for a
lot of things. This paper studies how the sensitive dependence on the
long-range connections makes it possible to control the spread of an
epidemic by first immunizing the long-range connections. It also turns
the problem around, and sufggests that the best way of spreading
advertisements (or memes) would be to target the long-range links.




Quantum Strategies
David A. Meyer Physical Review Letters  82:5 1052--1055 1999

Since computation can be generalized to quantum computation, why not
generalize game theory? This paper deals with the odd things that can
happen if you allow players to choose quantum superpositions of
strategies. As an example Meyer describes a game between captain
Picard of Star Trek and the superbeing Q, where they take turns of
either flipping a hidden coin or not. Classically, this is a fair
zero-sum game with an equilibrium of mixed strategies. But if Q makes
quantum moves, then he can win against the classical Picard! There is
no equilibrium if both players play deterministic quantum strategies,
but Meyer shows that there is an equilibrium if both plays mixed
quantum strategies (i.e. they select randomly between a number of
quantum strategies). A fun generalization, and it ties in with quantum
error correction (where nature is one of the players).

May we have the least difficult version of the question posed in Lojban,

BTW, how would Lojban handle the following statement?

No one knows how existence came to exist, because no one has the information

Friends, extropians, fellow seekers,
	While taking another stab at disentangling the Gordian knot of ideas related to "quantum entanglements" (Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky, Bell's inequality, the Aspect experiment, non-locality, Bohm's hyperspatial neorealism), I ran into this little item from New Scientist:

		http:\\www.newscientist.com\ns\19990130\iisthelaw.html

	It's their cover story for the Jan 30th issue.  Check it out.

	Just before posting this, I tried to access the above URL and couln't get through.  If this proves to be the common experience, I can post the whole article.
			Best, Jeff Davis

nope. never. Unless you have evidence that time is something other than 
the motion of matter, you must accept that just as it cannot be 
destroyed, it cannot be created.

Accepting this sort of possibility (like accepting that ESP "might" 
underlie much of what happens around us) travels under the guise of 
openness and sophistication, as in 

"oh haven't you read Popper, aren't aware of Kuhn's work ...we must not 
be dogmatic"

However, it requires that we not be objectivists. It requires that we be 
willing to believe nothing and/or everything, because anything  "might" 
be true. 

ZhuangZi: Look how happy those fish are!
HuiZi:       You're not a fish; how can you know they are happy?
ZhuangZi: You're not me; how do you know I don't know?

Now, HuiZi cannot deny this. What is he to do? 

He cannot claim access to any objective knowledge, and so, in guiding his 
life he must either become dice-man, acting as a degenerate whimsy, or 
else simply follow the majority, or Stalin, or whoever claims to be in 
possession of the zeitgeist. That is the consequence of accepting that 
there is only zeitgeist. That was pretty much Kuhn's position: sucessive 
theories fit more data but they nevertheless are in no sense superior. He 
stated plainly in SSR that  Einstein's theory is not objectively superior 
to Newtons, which in turn is not objectively superior to Aristotle's. The 
political counterpoint is the argument that there is no such thing as 
progress.

It requires us to think that Einstein's superior fit to the world is just 
a bit of good luck really, and that adding accessory hypotheses could 
make Newton everybit as good-a-fit-to-the-world (it could) and every bit 
as good. this latter i, and Lakatos, (and presumably most Objectivists) 
dispute. 

Everyone should read Lakatos. Go and buy a copy now: it is a perfect 
reduction of the insights of Popper and Kuhn and tells you how honest 
science is done. 

It  has the strength of being written, as Rand's works do, by someone who 
has direct experience of what abandoning objectivity causes (i.e., 
slavery, poverty, and death).

Religion (creation) is a philosophy of human subjugation to "truths" 
which are immune to test. Transhumanism is a philosophy of boundless 
growth, premised on our objective knowledge of a world which has a nature.

much love  ;-),

tim

A Postscript on Free Will

by Francis Crick, physicist and biochemist who collaborated with James D.
Watson in the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA, for which they
received the Nobel Prize in 1962.

Free Will is, in many ways, a somewhat old-fashioned subject. Most people
take it for granted, since they feel that usually they are free to act as
they please. While lawyers and theologians may have to confront it,
philosophers, by and large, have ceased to take much interest in the topic.
And it is almost never referred to by psychologists and neuroscientists. A
few physicists and other scientists who worry about quantum indeterminacy
sometimes wonder whether the uncertainty principle lies at the bottom of
Free Will.

I myself had paid little attention to Free Will until 1986, when I received
a letter from an old friend, Luis Rinaldini, an Argentinean cell biologist
whom I had first known in Cambridge in the late forties. Luis and his wife
now live in Mendoza, a provincial city in Argentina, near the Andes. He was
coming to the United States on a visit and wanted to meet and talk over some
of his ideas. When we got together in New York he told me that he and a
group of friends had formed a discussion group in Mensoza, and that he had
become interested in the topic of Free Will. he subsequently wrote to me on
the subject in more detail.

Up to that point I was not aware I had a theory of Free Will, but from what
he wrote about it I could see that my ideas differed somewhat from his. I
there and then wrote out, very briefly, what I discovered I believed and
sent it to him. The text occupied less than thirty lines. I showed it to the
philosopher Patricia Chruchland, partly for some reassurance that I wasn't
being totally silly. she helpfully clarified the wording and added an extra
point, telling me that my ideas seemed plausible to her. What follows is a
slightly expanded version of what I wrote to Luis.

My first assumption was that part of one's brain is concerned with making
plans for future actions, without necessarily carrying them out. I also
assumed that one can be conscious of such plans -- that is, that they are
subject at least to immediate recall.

My second assumption was that one is not conscious of the "computations"
done by this part of the brain but only of the "decisions" it makes -- that
is, its plans. Of course, these computations will depend on the structure of
that part of the brain (derived partly epigenetically and partly from past
experience) and on its current inputs from other parts of the brain.

My third assumption was that the decision to act on one plan or another is
also subject to the same limitations. In other words, one has immediate
recall of what is decided but not of the computations that went into the
decision, even though one may be aware of  a plan to move. (Professor
Piergiorgio Odifreddi has pointed out to me that one should also assume that
there is agreement between decisions and the resulting behavior.)

Then, such a machine (this was the word I used in my letter) will appear to
itself to have Free Will, provided it can personify it behavior -- that is,
it has an image of "itself."

The actual cause of the decision may be clear cut (Pat's addition), or it
may be deterministic but chaotic -- that is, a very small perturbation may
make a big difference to the end result. this would give the appearance of
the Will being "free" since it would make the outcome essentially
unpredictable. Of course, conscious activities may also influence the
decision mechanism (Pat's addition).

Such a machine can attempt to explain to itself why it made a certain choice
(by using introspection). Sometimes it may reach the correct conclusion. At
other times it will either not know or, more likely, will confabulate,
because it has no conscious knowledge of the "reason" for the choice. This
implies that there must be a mechanism for confabulation, meaning that given
a certain amount of evidence, which may or may not be misleading, part of
the brain will jump to the simplest conclusion. as we have seen, this can
happen all too easily.

This concluded my Theory of Free Will. It obviously depends upon
understanding what consciousness is about (the main topic of this book), how
the brain plans (and carries out) actions, how we confabulate, and so on. I
doubt if there is anything really novel in all this, although some of the
details may not have been included in previous explanations.

          **             **           **
And there I was content to let the matter rest. I met Luis in New York, and
subsequently he came to La Jolla, California, on a visit. he as also able to
discuss the problem with Paul Churchland (husband of Patrica Churchland). I
had not intended to ponder more on the topic but once my interest had been
aroused I found myself thinking about it from time to time.

Where, I wondered, might Free Will be located in the brain? Obviously it
involves interactions between several parts of the brain but it was not
unreasonable to think that one part of the cortex might be especially
concerned. One might expect that this received output from the higher levels
of the sensory systems and involved, or fed into, the higher, planning
levels of the motor system.

At this point I happened to stumble across an account by Antonio Damasio and
his colleagues of a woman with certain brain damage. After the damage, she
appeared very unresponsive. She lay quietly in bed with an alert expression.
She could follow people with her eyes but did not speak spontaneously. She
gave no verbal reply to any questions put to her even though it appeared she
understood them because of the way she nodded in reply. She could repeat
words and sentences but only very slowly. In short, her few reactions were
very limited and rather stereotyped.

after a month she had largely recovered. She said she had not been upset
because she had previously been unable to communicate. she had been able to
follow conversations but she had not talked because she had "nothing to
say." Her mind had been "empty." I immediately thought "she'd lost her
Will" -- where was the damage? It turned out to be somewhere in or near
(There was also damage to the adjacent supplementary motor area.) a region
called the "anterior cingulate sulcus," next to Brodmann's area 24. This is
on the inside surface -- the one you'd see if the brain were cut in half --
toward the front (hence anterior) and near the top. I was delighted to learn
that this was indeed a region that received many inputs from the higher
sensory regions and was at or near the higher levels of the motor system.

Terry Seznowski's group at the Salk Institute has an informal tea on most
afternoons of the week. These teas are ideal occasions to discuss the latest
experimental results, throw out new ideas, or just gossip about science,
politics, or the news in general. I went over to tea one day and announced
to Pat Churchland and terry Sejnowski that the seat of the Will had been
discovered! It was at or near the anterior cingulate. When I discussed the
matter with Antonio Damasio, I found that he also had arrived at the same
idea. he filled me in on some of the anatomical connections of that region
of the brain. It has strong connections with the corresponding area on the
other side of the brain -- you normally have only a single Will at any one
moment, although, as we have seen, split brains can have two (se Chapter
12). Moreover, that region on one side projects strongly to the corpus
striatum (an important part of the motor system) on _both_ sides of the
brain, which is what you might expect from a single Will. It certainly
looked rather promising.

Some time later I was reading a paper by Michael Posner in which he
mentioned a curious condition, produced by a particular kind of brain
damage, known as the "alien hand" syndrome. A patient's left hand, for
example, may make movements -- usually rather simple and stereotyped
movements -- that the patient denies he himself is responsible for. For
example, the hand may spontaneously grasp some object put near it. In some
cases the patient is unable to get the hand to let go and has to use his
right hand to detach the left hand from the object. One patient found that
he could not make his "alien" hand let go by his own willpower, but could
make it release its grasp by saying "let go" in a loud voice!

And where was the damage? Again, in or near the anterior cingulate sulcus
(on the right side, for and alien left hand) but _also_ in that part of the
corpus callosum, so that the region on the left could not give the
instructions to the left hand that the damaged region on the right was
unable to give. Moreover, as mentioned in Chapter 8, the anterior cingulate
is active in certain selection processes, as shown by the increased blood
flow there.

So perhaps this aspect of the idea is novel. (Sir john Eccles has previously
suggested that an area near area 24, the supplementary motor area, might be
the seat of Free Will.) Free Will is located in or near the anterior
cingulate sulcus. In practice, things are likely to be more complicated.
Other areas in the front of the brain may also be involved. What is needed
are more experiments on animals, the careful examination of more cases of
the "alien hand" and related conditions, and, above all, a detailed
neurobiological understanding of visual awareness and, from that, of other
forms of consciousness. And that is why this suggestion is appended to this
book.

To accept any limit simply because we don't know of a way around it, entirely
circumvents the tranhumanist spirit of inquiry and exploration.  I will
acknowledge at this time I know of no way to destroy matter other than its
transformation into energy (E=mc^2).  But to say I currently don't *know* of a
way to create matter, is a long way from stating it cannot be done.  Since you
haven't experimented an infinite number of times and tried an infinite number
of variations of experiments in an attempt to create matter, you really can't
say it cannot be done.  You have no clue whether it can be done or not.
Saying otherwise puts you into the same class of absolute TRUTH contingents as
any religious fundamentalist.

Defending the spirit of J. Eric Mortensen's post - saying something *may*
happen is a far cry from saying something *will* happen.  I think anyone who
has seriously delved into artificial life experiments, quantum cosmology,
black holes, bubbling and basement universes created via traversible
wormholes, in a spirit of whimsy perhaps, has entertained the notion that our
universe may have been created by entities from a previous ancestral
universe.  However, I think it's more fun to entertain the notion of myself
creating new universes.  I don't know about you, but I do planning on being a
'god' myself,  not to be worshipped, but to have fun creating new things -
even new universes if such a thing were to ever become possible.

I am sensitive to some elements of the spirit behind this claim. But I 
disagree with it. It is simply not up to us what limits there are. They 
either are or are not. And that was really my point.

What i responded to in Eric's initial mail was the idea that not only is 
everything we "know" wrong (I am confident that it is), but that it could 
be wrong in a way which invalidated all of our efforts to understand the 
universe. 

That it could be wrong in a Cartesian fashion: with the whole universe in 
fact put into play by a creator who has left no trace of himself. 
Accepting this, to me, makes a mockery of being human. Frankly, if for 
one moment I conceived that this was possible, I would exercise the only 
free choice left to me: I would excuse myself from this joke at my 
expense.

cheerio chaps,
tim

If you interpreted me as arguing that everything we know could be wrong
in a way that makes it impossible for us to understand the universe, then
you misunderstood me. You also misunderstood me if you thought I was
a creationist. I am an atheist (more precisely, I'm anti-religious).

What I meant was that, if we have the capacity to discover how the universe
came into being, then we should be able to discover whether it was created
by
something for some purpose (e.g., simulation, fun, whatever, or perhaps by
accident)
or whether it came into being spontanously, with no creator. We should even
be able to
discover whether we in fact exist physically, or whether we exist as a
simulation
inside a big computer.

Considering the possibility that our universe exists as a computer
simulation, the fact that we haven't seen any trace of an outside
environment indicates that 1) such an environment doesn't exist,
or 2) if it does, its existence is currently irrelevant for our
understanding
of this universe, i.e.,  all our scientific predictions are still correct,
so an
outside environment will not help us scientifically explain any new
phenomena.

I don't see why you should excuse yourself. In fact, why should you even
care?

What difference does it make, scientifically,
whether we are all part in some big computer lab simulation,
or whether we exist physically as matter. If it turns out that we are all
advanced
processes living inside a computer, should we discard any of our scientific
knowledge,
knowledge that we have discovered do a remarkable job at explaining our
reality?

I suggest that the plausibility of any statement about our reality being
true is
independent of in what form we exist. The laws of motion, the laws of
evolution,
the laws of supply and demand etc. are no more or less true whether we are
products of a systems engineer's imagination, or whether we are physical
products of chance.

Hi Eric - sorry for making assumptions.

>We should even be able to discover whether we in fact exist physically, or 
>whether we exist as a simulation inside a big computer.

Yes. How can we tell. What does Tippler say? What does he predict 
"people" will do when they find out their "real" state? More 
interestingly, what will the programmers do if they find their virtual 
subjects go on strike?

Just for a laugh  - what happens if you terminate yourself and you are a 
simulation? Can you? Do they Reboot you? Do you know?

Does this remind you of a recent very funny and deeply anarchic movie 
named after a recent US president?

very best,
tim

Any Houston-area cryonicists/wannabes out there want to take a look at
the videotapes of the Nov 98 21st Century Medicine seminar? If so, I
will  be at Borders bookstore on west Westheimer Sunday 2-20-99 with
my videotapes and copies (which you may borrow or view) and copies of
the latest CryoCare Report. 
Here is the blurb from the email newsletter Texas Atheist:

"HOUSTON - DARWIN DAY CELEBRATION:  The Secular Humanists of Houston
will have a Darwin Day Celebration' February 20th, 12:00 - 6:00 PM at
the BORDER's Books & Music, 9633A Westheimer, Houston, TX 77063.
Contact  Keith Irish keith.irish@lmco.com "

For those unfamiliar with the 21CM seminar, the speakers -- cryonics
researchers Greg Fahy, PhD (world-class cryobiologist), Brian Wowk,
PhD, Mike Darwin, and Stever Harris, MD -- discussed in considerable
detail (slides, pre-videotaped analyses,  panel discussion, etc.) the
advances and prospects regarding cryonics research, and related
cryobiological and emergency medicine products and services which may
lead to revenue streams which can be directed to cryonics research.

Let me know if you can't make it, but still want to view or borrow one
or more of my videotapes (also available from the Life Entension
Foundation).

Tim Bates has asked,
>Just for a laugh  - what happens if you terminate yourself and you are a
>simulation? Can you? Do they Reboot you? Do you know?

A simulation that terminates itself (assuming it does so autonomously)
requires a Free Will mechanism. (See last post in the Free Will thread).
Obviously, having terminated itself, the simulation can _not_ then discover
anything further concerning the nature of its own simulated status.

People can terminate themselves, not because they rise above the complexity
level of simulations (simulations may also self-terminate, depending on
whether their programs allow this feature), but because they have planning
agents in the brain which allow them to carry out such a plan.

If humans exist as simulations projected by the intricate complexities
inherent in genetic algorithms, quantum physics, and biological evolution (a
holographic paradigm), then certainly these complexities might Reboot them.
The probability that existence Reboots or resurrects an adult consciousness
depends on the complexity of the consciousness in question, and on whether
sufficient resources exist for this project.

If, in contrast to resurrecting a personalized consciousness (i.e., a
specific identifiable personality), the project involves reconstituting a
pure consciousness, meaning a consciousness without content, or a so-called
Buddha consciousness, then of course existence (by "existence" I mean all
and everything that exists -- which Frieden's information-based methods
might find contains information too great to specify in a differential
equation) can produce them by the billions.

The unique and individualized personality generated by the body and brain
exists as a simulation, as you have conjectured, and as some others have
posited. If it terminates itself (and people do commit suicide sometimes),
"they" (genetic algorithms, biological evolution, etc.) may Reboot it, but
this would involve rebooting the entire holographic universe from which it
derived, which seems like an awful lot of trouble just to recapture a single
personality.

Consequently, the only eternally recurring consciousness that populates
existence in significant numbers has no content, no individualized
personality, no unique identity. It rather resembles a general purpose
computer. I predict that the selfish notion of extending one's own identity
eternally will succumb to the more powerful realization that pure
consciousness has its own reasons for emerging.

But just for a laugh,

A zenji was asked by the Emperor of Japan, "What is hell and what is
heaven?"
The zenji looked at the Emperor and said, "You son-of-a-bitch! Have you
looked at your face in the mirror lately? I have never seen such a
dirty-looking fellow before!"
The Emperor became enraged! He had not expected such a thing from such a
saint.
The Emperor pulled his sword out of its sheath. He was going to cut off the
head of the zenji. As the sword came close to the zenji's neck, he said,
"Wait! You are entering hell. This is the gate to hell."
Catching himself in the middle of his sword-thrust, the emperor
understood -- "True!" He threw the sword away, fell at the feet of the
zenji, and the zenji laughed and said, "This is the way to heaven! You have
already experienced both within a single moment. The distance between the
two is not much."
========
Why don't Communists believe in reincarnation?
Well, look at it this way: Who would want to come back to life as a
Communist?

Surmano explains to the rabbi the theory of reincarnation: "Let's say, your
holiness, that you die tomorrow. A flower blooms on your grave after a few
days. A cow comes and eats the flower. The next morning the cow has a good
shit. I go for a walk, see the shit and say, 'Ah, your holiness, you haven't
changed a bit?'"

I would think that the term extropian meaning someone or thing
operating in an extrophic manner has been used extensively enough
to  be a generic public domain term like libertarian, lutheran, 
egallitarian etc.

What does everyone else think?

I think that while promulgation of the use of these terms over as wide an area as
possible is beneficial to extropy as a whole, there is the risk of dilution of its
meaning, as well as the possible development of negative public opinion of it  if
its use, especially for commercial purposes, if it is not overseen and licensed by
someone at ExI. While common use of the word obviously is not restricted under the
'fair use' clauses of copyright laws (in the US or Canada), use by a corporate
entity which ExI does not have interest in or some measure of oversight or control
over is a definite infringement on the copyright and trademark.

Just this past year, there was a debate over a group of european list members
calling their local chapter 'Excedo'. They eventually settled on 'Transcedo' to
maintain friendly relations and good will with everyone.

Also available on the web at
http://math.ucsd.edu/~dmeyer/research/publications/qstrat/abs.html. But
unfortunately it is not as interesting as it first seem to me. The
distinction between quantum and classical strategies is arbitrary (Picard
is restricted to a choice of two quantum operations that are called
classical even though there is really nothing classical about them,
whereas Q is allowed the whole range of possible pure quantum operations).

The PQ Penny Flip game is isomorphic to a game where two players
manipulate a point on a plane that starts at (0,1) without being able to
see where it is. Each round Q is allowed to rotate the point by an
arbitrary amount around the origin, but Picard is only allowed to reflect
the point about the line that passes through (0,0) and (1,1). This makes
it easy to see why Picard keeps losing. I think all quantum games where no
decoherence is possible until the end can similarly be analyzed as
equivalent classical games.

I am unable to think of real world applications of these ideas,
except perhaps in literal games. Quantum chess anyone?

No, zero is an answer. No answer means that it is indeterminate. You are
applying the wrong answer to the questions.

  IAN: "No x" means "zero x." 
  If there's zero x, then x = 0.

  Thus, "no answer" means "zero answer." 
  If there's zero answer, then answer = 0.

  "Indeterminate" is different than "zero."
  The statement I commented on gives a fixed,
  not an indeterminate, answer. However, like
  infinity, zero seems to have an affinity for 
  indeterminancies, such as 0/0 or n/0, or 0^0.

The answer is that there is no answer.  There are zero (number of) answers.

Title
  H2O2 production of heart
  mitochondria and aging rate are slower in canaries and
  parakeets than in mice: sites of free radical generation and mechanisms
  involved.
Source
  Mechanisms of Ageing & Development.  103(2):133-46, 1998 Jun 15.
Abstract
  Birds have a maximum longevity (MLSP) much higher than mammals of similar
  body size in spite of their high metabolic rates. In this study, State 4 and
  State 3 rates of H2O2 production were lower
  in canary (MLSP = 24 years) and parakeet (MLSP = 21 years) than in mouse
  (MLSP = 3.5 years) heart mitochondria.
  Studies using specific inhibitors of the respiratory chain indicate that free
  radical generation sites at Complexes I and III are responsible for these
  differences. Main mechanisms lowering H2O2
  production in these birds are a low rate of
  mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the parakeet and a low
  mitochondrial free radical leak in the canary. Strong
  increases in H2O2 production during active
  respiration (State 3) released by addition of ADP to
  pyruvate/malate-supplemented mitochondria are avoided in
  three species because the free radical leak decreases during the transition
  from State 4 to State 3 respiration. These results, together with those
  previously obtained in pigeons and in various mammalian species, suggest that
  the rate of mitochondrial free radical
  production correlates better with the rate of aging and the
  MLSP than the metabolic rate. They also suggest that a low rate of
  mitochondrial H2O2
  production is a general characteristic of birds, animals
  showing very slow aging rates.

Title
  A decrease of free radical
  production near critical targets as a cause of maximum longevity in animals.
Source
  Comparative Biochemistry & Physiology. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. 
  108(4):501-12, 1994 Aug.
Abstract
  A comprehensive study was performed on the brains of various vertebrate
  species showing different life energy potentials in order to find out if
  free radicals are important determinants of
  species-specific maximum life span. Brain superoxide dismutase, catalase,
  Se-dependent and independent GSH-peroxidases, GSH-reductase, and ascorbic
  acid showed significant inverse correlations with maximum longevity, whereas
  GSH, uric acid, GSSG/GSH, in vitro peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid test),
  and malondialdehyde (measured by HPLC), did not correlate with maximum life
  span. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH-peroxidase, GSH and ascorbate
  results agree with those previously reported in various independent works
  using different animal species. GSSG/GSH, and true malondialdehyde (HPLC)
  results are reported for the first time in relation to maximum longevity. The
  results suggest that longevous species simultaneously show low antioxidant
  concentrations and low levels of in vivo free
  radical production (a low free
  radical turnover) in their tissues. The
  "free radical production hypothesis of
  aging" is proposed: a decrease in oxygen
  radical production per unit of O2 consumption near critical
  DNA targets (mitochondria or nucleus) increases the maximum life span of
  extraordinarily long-lived species like birds, primates, and man.
  Free radical production near these DNA
  sites would be a main factor responsible for aging in all the species, in
  those following Pearl's (Rubner's) metabolic rule as well as in those not
  following it.

I'd like to take a moment to express appreciation to Doug Skrecky and Anders
Sandberg, whose postings to the list of items of interest that they find
enriches this community.  Doug's mining of medical abstracts on aging and
longevity research and Anders' more general harvest of research items both
bring to us one of the key values we find on the Extropians List: News about
milestones on the road to transhumanism. And of course, let's also take a
moment to appreciate Anders' website, which continues to be a resource and
cyberspace landmark for the transhumanist community Thanks Doug and Anders!

[snip]

Here is where I get a bit confused.

Didn't Crick just get done explaining that we are aware
of the decisions to act but not aware of the computations
which lead to the decisions to act?  And consequently
we confabulate to make meaning out of it all and reassure
ourselves of our self-determination?  There is only process
and outcome.  We observe the outcome and convince
ourselves it is the product of our will.

Why then would he suddenly start talking about where in the
brain Free Will is located?  Doesn't he mean "where the
computations are?"

Anyway, it's long been disconcerting to me that so much
of my behavior is not actually under my control.  This is one
of the reasons I'm a transhumanist.  Transhumanism to me
is all about attaining Free Will and potentiating our intelligence.
It may be the most important human limitation to overcome.

Odd, they make the first error of futurism by actually naming names, places,
dates...

Here's the start of a page for my new art show, "SPACE 1999, The Promise"

http://homepages.together.net/~retroman/march1999.htm

I hope you guys enjoy it. I'll be adding more works to it in the next couple
weeks. There are two pieces up there right now....

We can't do this unless we want to do it. Our wanting to do it (or anything
else, for that matter) requires that the region called the "anterior
cingulate sulcus," next to Brodmann's area 24, functions well.

To prove this, Crick relates the story of what happens to someone whose
anterior cingulate sulcus (the seat of Free Will) has become inoperable due
to damage to that area of the brain.

The computations constitute Free Will.

Many people find this information disconcerting, as Crick points out in _The
Astonishing Hypothesis_.
Many people found the discovery of DNA disconcerting.
Many people found the theory of heliocentricity disconcerting (especially
the Pope).
Many people may find an autonomous synthetic intelligence disconcerting.

Perhaps further research and experimentation along the lines suggested by
Crick (he describes several experimental approaches in his book), will
discover the area of the brain which relates to feelings of
disconcertedness.

  IAN: Ya. To use an analogy, if you give me 
  a basket and you say that in this basket is

  "No answer" means the answer is the same as zero.

I fail to comprehend how you (or Crick) equate
unconscious computations with Free Will.  Wanting
to do something (anything) may require a healthy
"anterior cingulate sulcus," but Crick seems to be
suggesting that this area is an enigmatic black box
which serves to covertly puppeteer our behaviors.
That doesn't sound like any kind of Free Will I've
heard of.

The great experiment we are a part of addresses the question,
"Can deluded entities without free will discover and/or transcend
their true nature?"

Y-to-K Date Change Project Status

"Our staff has completed the 18 months of work on time and on budget.

We have gone through every line of code in every program in every
system.

We have analyzed all databases, all data files, including backups and
historic archives, and modified all data to reflect the change.

We are proud to report that we have completed the "Y-to-K" date change
mission, and have now implemented all changes to all programs and all
data to reflect your new standards:

Januark, Februark, March, April, Mak, June, Julk, August, September,
October, November, December

As well as:

Sundak, Mondak, Tuesdak, Wednesdak, Thursdak, Fridak, Saturdak

I trust that this is satisfactory, because to be honest, none of this Y
to K problem has made any sense to me. But I understand it is a global
problem, and our team is glad to help in any way possible.

And what does the year 2000 have to do with it?  Speaking of which,
what do you think we ought to do next year when the two digit year rolls
over from 99 to 00?  We'll await your direction."

As Francis Crick has pointed out, and as I previously posted:

"My first assumption was that part of one's brain is concerned with making
plans for future actions, without necessarily carrying them out. I also
assumed that one can be conscious of such plans -- that is, that they are
subject at least to immediate recall."

The part of the brain "concerned with making plans," as Crick clearly
stated, "is located in or near the anterior cingulate sulcus."

I read no suggestion into Crick's article of any "black box" doing any
"covert puppeteering" and I fail to see your point. I get the feeling you
object to Crick's discovery out of anti-scientific bias. Not very extropian,
that.

>The great experiment we are a part of addresses the question,
>"Can deluded entities without free will discover and/or transcend
>their true nature?"

To what "great experiment" do you allude? I'd answer your last question with
a definite "no" not that it makes any difference to any rational discussion
of Free Will. As far as it concerns me, extropy (which, in this context
means self-organizing life) coincides perfectly with my "true nature."

  IAN: My calculator says it has a solution called 
  "error." Are you saying that the answer = error? :)

  But of course 1/0 is generally considered to be
  infinity, yet, like answers for 0/0, it runs into 
  problems that render it undefined or indeterminate. 
  So I think rather than it having "no solution" it
  is more exactly stated that divide by zero does 
  have solutions, but they lead to contradictions,
  and thus all /0 solutions are defined as errors.

  So, does the "no" in "There is no answer" mean 
  "error" or "nothing" as in "void"? I see it to 
  mean that the answer is void, it doesn't exist.

Although I often helped ExI head off possible infringements of its trademarks
and service marks back when I was still on the board of directors, please note
that I no longer speak for the organization.  My comments here merely reflect
my continuing abstract interest in trademark law.

Does the use of "Extropian" in "Extropian Agroforestry Ventures, Ltd." (EAV)
infringe on ExI's rights?  Here, as generally, the question is whether
consumers of ExI's services would likely be confused by this new use of
"Extropian."  Notably, "Extropian" appears here only in connection with
"Agroforestry"--a term that helps to distinguish this use of "Extropian" from
ExI's use.  Compare an on-line magazine called "Extropic Journal."  Then, too,
the apparent for-profit status of EAV makes its use look less likely to
confuse than, say, a think tank called "Extropian Studies Institute." 

I set aside the separate question of the possible dilution of ExI's marks.
Inquiring minds might want consider the applicability of section 43(c) of the
Lanham Act.

That remains a question of fact, resolution of which would rely in part on
evidence of ExI's past efforts to prevent others from using its marks in ways
that were likely to confuse consumers.  I doubt that casual observers would
have all the evidence that they need to resolve that question.

Mike Lorrey nicely summarizes some of the considerations of tax-exempt
organizations thinking about policing their marks:

and

I think that Mike speaks a little too broadly, however, in saying that,

>While common use of the word obviously is not restricted under the

corporate

>or control over is a definite infringement on the copyright and trademark.

Again, the question as regards infringement (though not dilution) is whether
or not the use is likely to confuse consumers as to the source, origin, or
affiliation of ExI.  Some uses of "Extropian"--even by huge, for-profit
corporations--may not go that far.  Consider, for example, "Not Extropian
Cremation, Inc."

None of this is to say, of course, that ExI should passively decline to object
to such uses of "Extropian."  Game theory, corporate culture, litigation
resources, public relations, and so forth might play a role in resolving that
difficult question.

Ian, not only do i have an empty basket containing the answer (I am 
willing to sell as many of these a you can find a market for), but i have 
an empty hand holding the empty basket. Clearly the answer to the 
universe is in all our hands so long as we keep them empty...

Poor, poor, humanity to be prey to such outrageous charlatanry.

You are confusing the following situations:

- answer is indeterminate
- answer is to be determined
- answer is the number zero
- answer is blank text
- answer is the empty set
- answer is random/anything
- answer is everything
- answer is another question
- question is ambiguous
- question is invalid
- question has not been answered
- question is not understood

IAN: I only see two of those applying to 
what John said, but I think he's indicated 
that he sees the answer as more like 1/0 
than zero, and if so, his statement should 
be clarified as "The answer is indeterminate."

This is meant to be half humorous; half serious.  Please read as such.

I hate to be a nuisance, but maybe the basket isn't empty.  Instead, one 
finds the contence by viewing from a different perspective.

Just a thought.

Well, I'm back from Capricon XIX, and it's now definite:  Sleep
deprivation produces transhumanist music.  This is the second time in a
row I've written a song during a con.

This is to the tune of "Santa's Gonna Kick Your Ass" from "Christmas
Turkey" by "The Arrogant Worms".  (Part of it, anyway - in mine, each
chorus sounds like the first one.)  It is no coincidence that this song
is rattled off in one of the fastest voices I've ever heard.  If you
don't know the tune, you're missing half the fun.  Sadly, I haven't
found any MIDI or MP3 of it... not that I'm suggesting anyone should
violate copyrights.

The original lyrics may be found at:
http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/harrison/375/xtlyrics.html

CHORUS:

	Future's comin' and it's gonna
	Kick your ass
	It's gonna
	Kick your ass
	It's gonna
	Kick your ass
	Future's comin' and it's gonna
	Kick your ass
	You think you know what's comin' but you're wrong

Nanotech is comin' and it's gonna
Grant you longevity
Bring you prosperity
Build you a brewery
Nanotech is comin' and it's gonna
Create your paradise
And then it's gonna turn it into goo

CHORUS:

Neurohackers comin' gonna
Pump your mentality
Choose your specialty
Cure gullibility
Neurohackers comin' gonna
Light up the pleasure center
At least we know that this part will be fun

CHORUS:

AIs comin' and they're gonna
Replace humanity
Outlaw biology
No organic chemistry
AIs comin' and they're gonna
Take over Terra
Until the Y2K bug shuts 'em down

CHORUS:

Transhumans comin' and they're gonna
Advance technology
Avert catastrophe
Do a Singularity
Transhumans comin' and they're gonna
Be inscrutable
'Cause you can't understand their point of view

CHORUS:

Powers comin' and they're gonna
Make like a deity
Transcend mortality
Control the galaxy
Powers comin' and they're gonna
Be real powerful
But please don't ask me what they do or why

CHORUS:

Omega Point is comin' gonna
Rewrite reality
Outshine divinity
Count to infinity
Omega Point is comin' gonna
Resurrect your in-laws
And then our saga and my song is done

Obviously, the problem is humorless nano-optimists.

I present the case of Network Solutions, owner of the internic.net domain name,
who are the US Gov't contracted domain name registry. An Australian company,
calling itself internic.com, has set its own registration site up which is very
similar to the Network Solutions internic site. The internic.com site will
register sites with internic.net, for a fee of $220.00, far in excess of the
$70.00 which Network Solutions charges for the same service, but this is not
mentioned by internic.com until the last clause of the registration agreement.

Network Solutions has succeeded in court to force internic.com to put a disclaimer
on every one of its pages that Network Associates, internic.net, and the US Gov't
are not affiliated with internic.com.

Now, I guess I was a little broad, but only a bit. It tends to be a matter of who
has the most money. MacDonalds, for example, has succeeded in forcing most all
producers from naming products using the MacDonalds name, or in paying them
license fees. There are a few notable exceptions. In general though, it is the
intent to which the name is used which decides the acceptability of its use. Using
a name for a purpose which overlaps that of the original trade name owner is
definitely treading on thin ice. Likewise, French champagne producers have
succeeded restricting the general use of the name 'champagne' for any sparkling
wine produced by the method champagnois. Such wines must come from a specific
region of France to use that label. Naming your record company "Champagne Records"
would obviously have no problems with the trade name property for the wine
producers.

The problem with the terms extropy as well as extropian, is that they are general
terms which can apply to any sort of futurist, personal freedom oriented products.
If I named my gun company Extropy Arms, and produced a gun which only shot stupid
narrow minded people,  I would not only run the risk of giving people in general a
bad impression of extropy in general, but because I was producing a product which
is in fact extropic (even in a rough and brutish sort of way), I would be
trespassing on the property of ExI.

Now, back to the money question. Given that ExI is, shall we say, not the most
well endowed think tank, someone could probably start a company called Extropian
Holistic Nose Pickers, Inc. and not give a fig about what ExI thinks or says about
it, since it seems like they probably can't afford to contest it in court.
However, if they did in fact consider themselves extropians, and wanted to remain
in contact and good terms with ExI and its members, they would be smart to seek
the blessing of and try to accomodate the trustees of ExI.

Yes. I don't know what the average salary is these days, but as I said
before, *after* they've printed all that extra cash, assuming none of it
goes offshore as most dollars have in the past, there will be about $800
per person available. That's it. Either they can start printing even 
larger amounts of money and risk hyperinflation, or they have to stop
people taking out large amounts of money.

The biggest problem is that a lot of people who have a lot more than $800
in their bank accounts are discovering this.

This leaves us with a choice:

1. Take out the money, have it all at home where it may be useful.
2. Don't take it out, potentially lose access to it for a long time,
   potentially have the banks collapse and lose it all, if other people
   take theirs out.

As I said, this is a prisoners' dilemna situation, and the rational solution
is to take the money out. And since we've recently seen similar situations
in Russia where those who took their money out did well and those who
didn't lost out, we have even more encouragement to be rational.

Yes, my bank, Citizen's Bank, is starting to tighten up its policies. They used
to cash any check brought in by a long time account holder, no matter what you
account balance is. Now they are getting strict about there being at least as
much money in your account as the check is for before they will cash it.
Otherwise, you have to deposit it and they are taking the full 24 hours to
activate the funds in your account, and they want to violate the covenant they
had with First NH Bank when the bought it and stretch it out to two days like
they have with the rest of their customers. Not only that, but when you deposit
an amount larger than your current balance, they freeze your entire account till
the check clears, which can cause your own checks and account linked credit card
charges to bounce.

I'm just going to deposit every other paycheck now, and cash the others. My own
living expenses are actually less than half my income now anyways, so I can make
my monthly payments on the deposited sums. If the bank goes under, I most likely
won't have more than a week or two's pay in the bank....

The biggest cause of economic turmoil at y2k will be caused by people panicking.
Fear is the most palpable economic force.

Looks like a rip-off scheme of some sort to me.  Their 'explanations' are
the sort of pseudoscientific gobbledygook that someone with a minimal degree
of scientific literacy would come up with to convince people who don't know
any better.

You're right, it isn't anywhere near that effective.  The lethal dose is
extremely small (a few micrograms, I think), but there are big practical
problems in actually delivering it.  Under ideal conditions an artillery
shell carrying several pounds of nerve gas might create a lethal cloud a few
hundred yards across lasting several hours.  In the real world you would
normally need hundreds of tons of nerve gas, delivered by thousands of
widely spaced bombs, to kill even the majority of the population of a major
city.

Any kind of radar guided machine gun would probably be a good guess. There
is not much reason to use explosives at space velocities.

>Now we're talking.  What is everyone actually doing?

Personally I aim to have everything I need to survive a month in reasonable
comfort without spending much on items which won't be useful if life 
continues as normal on Jan 1st. That covers pretty much everything except 
power generation, and I can manage for some time with just my car battery, 
an invertor and a full tank of gas. By doing that I'm relatively safe for a 
while if things go bad, and lose little if they don't. If food supplies
are disrupted for a month or more, then the world will be a completely
different place anyway.

Also if things are looking bad I'll have my rent paid up three months
in advance (so my landlord won't kick me out and will have cash on hand to
stock up on food too, rather than come looking for mine), and then just have 
to decide what to do about money and investments. I'll certainly have 
enough cash, etc, stored away to cover a month's expenses, and I'll see 
about the rest later this year.

I'm guessing that will cost me about $1000 in lost interest, buying
non-essential items, etc, but I'll end up with about $800 of gadgets
which will be useful in the future, whatever happens. That seems a small 
price to pay to ensure some degree of security; since I already live in a 
rural area I don't have to do anything really expensive like move house.

Right now that would be an effective weapon, but by the time we can build an
interplanetary warship that will have changed.  Your missile defense lasers
will pick off those bullets at whatever range you can detect them at
(probably at least a few thousand miles).  Also, even at 10-20km/sec they
won't penetrate diamondoid armor very well.

That's why I tend to expect directed energy weapons of some sort to
dominate - they are difficult to defend against, and most types don't run
out of ammunition.

By way, I suppose, of counterexample, Mike Lorrey wrote:

But, of course, those two parties were in exactly the same line of business.
Consumer confusion really did look likely.  The MacDonald's examples to which
Mike later alluded better prove his point, I think, that aggressive trademark
holders can push the fuzzy boundaries of consumer confusion a long way.  As
Mike says,

>It tends to be a matter of who has the most money.

Mike adds an important but not dispositive element to the analysis:

>In general though, it is the intent to which the name is used which

>definitely treading on thin ice. 

I'd massage that point to say that intent *can* prove very important but that
it does not alone resolve the question of infringement.  Courts use a mult-
factor test, only one element of which considers intent.  Innocent parties can
be held liable for duplicating non-distinctive marks.  Contrarywise, even
parties who intentionally duplicate an existing mark can be found to have put
it to a non-infringing use.  (Again, I caution that I am not here addressing
dilution.)

In theory, a contigency-fee attorney might take ExI's case.  A party suffering
infringement can recover damages, the defendant's unjust profits, costs of the
action, and, in extreme cases, treble damages and attorney's fees.

HI,

If I read the following correctly, it seems to indicate that gross =
oxidative stress (free radical damage?) leads to 5 1/2 times the rate of =
telomeric shortening than normal cell doubling would. If true, doesn't =
this suggest a direct causal connection between the free radical theory =
of aging, and the telomeric/proliferative senesence apoptosis model? I =
had been thinking that the rate of telomeric shortening was a constant, =
and that the NUMBER of doublings was the only thing which invoked the =
Hayflick limit. Now, if I interpret the below correctly, there is a =
quintuple whammy when cell doubling occurs under free radical oxidative =
stress such as in crush injuries etc. Am I getting this right?

thx

Mild hyperoxia shortens telomeres and inhibits proliferation of =

von Zglinicki T, Saretzki G, Docke W, Lotze C
Institute of Pathology, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.=20

Mild oxidative stress as exerted by culture of human WI-38 fibroblasts =
under 40% oxygen partial pressure blocks proliferation irreversibly =
after one to three population doublings. Hyperoxically blocked cells are =
similar to senescent ones in terms of general morphology and lipofuscin =
accumulation. Moreover, they, like senescent fibroblasts, are blocked =
preferentially in G1 as evident from DNA content measurements by flow =
cytometry. Southern blotting of AluI- and HinfI-restricted genomic DNA =
shows an increase of the rate of telomere shortening from 90 bp per =
population doubling under normoxia to more than 500 bp per population =
doubling under hyperoxia. In every case, proliferation is blocked if a =
telomere cutoff length of about 4 kb is arrived at. The fact that =
telomere length correlates with the final inhibition of proliferation =
under conditions of varied oxidative stress, while the population =
doubling level does not, suggests that telomere shortening provides the =
signal for cell cycle exit in senescence. In postmitotic cells, no =
further telomere shortening occurs. However, the sensitivity of terminal =
restriction fragments to S1 nuclease increases, indicating the =
accumulation of single-strand breaks in telomeres of nondividing =
fibroblasts. This effect is found both under normoxic and hyperoxic =
culture, although it is more pronounced under conditions of higher =
oxidative stress. It might be speculated that accumulation of =
single-strand breaks and the resultant loss of distal single-stranded =
fragments during replication could be a major cause of telomere =
shortening, possibly more important than incomplete replication per se

I saved a news posting a few months ago which has a rather detailed
analysis of the money stock, cash reserves, cash in circulation,
bank accounts, etc.  I also found it on a web site but I can't
find the URL now.  The posting was based on information at
http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases/ if you want to verify the details.

Cash reserves are about $160 billion.  This the amount of cash held in
bank vaults to "back up" the bank accounts.  The Fed has indicated that
they will try to print an extra $50 billion or so, bringing the total up
to around $200 billion.  I believe this is the source of the $800/person
figure Mark quotes.

However, this is not the total cash in existence.  The total cash stock is
about $613 billion, or about $2300 per person.  (Some considerable part
of this is overseas, however, and the analysis doesn't try to account
for that.)  About $450 billion ($1600 per person) circulates as cash
with $160 billion in bank vaults.

The $160 billion (or perhaps $200 billion next year) serves as a reserve
against bank deposits.  The total value of those deposits depends on
what you count, but basically checking+savings accounts add to a bit
over $2000 billion, or about $8000 per person.  (Adding time deposits,
CDs, and other long-term instruments increases this amount considerably.)

So, per person, there is about $8000 in U.S. demand-deposit bank accounts,
$1600 in circulating cash (part of it overseas), and $600-$800 in cash
sitting in bank vaults to back up the $8000 in bank accounts.

Of course, all this money is not uniformly distributed.  Some part of
it is in business accounts, and some for personal use.  Rich people
have a larger share of the wealth than poor people.  I'm not sure of
the disproportionality, but typically we will see that 20% of the people
control 80% of the wealth, or perhaps it is concentrated as much as 10%
controlling 90%.

It is not very informative to know that the average person plans to
withdraw X % of his savings.  Average income earners, on aggregate,
control only a small percentage of the wealth.  The average family of
four probably doesn't have much more than the $3200 that the bank reserves
would cover even if they withdrew everything.

The real question is what the rich will do.  If they're going into the
banks and withdrawing $20000, $50000, $100000 in cash, lugging it in
wheelbarrows and suitcases back to their mansions, then the system will
get into trouble very quickly.  Likewise if the Fortune 500 decide they
need to keep a few million in cash on hand to stuff into envelopes to
make payroll.

We don't know what will happen, and whether people will panic going into
late 1999.  Personally, I have hope that the rich will resist switching
to a pure-cash mode, in which case the banking system should be able to
tolerate the strains on it.  But worse scenarios are certainly possible.

I need an explanation from someone(s) on the lists of superstring theory;
why 11 dimensions rather than 12, and also membrane theory.

Hello from the suburbs of beautiful downtown Beaubier, Sask:

I, personally have been a list member for  a bit more than 2 years.

I will give you all a very short summary about what our venture is
all about.  We are a small cap venture with about 1 million $ can.
of fixed production assets located in a sparse close knit farming 
community pretty near to the junction of the north-south Montana/North
Dakota state line junction and the international boundary between
Canada and the USA.

Our aim is to revitalize a marginalized local agriculture product
base into a knowlege based product line of leading edge research
based products which we feel will become known world-wide.

Nutraceutical products to combat AIDS, optimize immune function, 
normalize and resore cardivascular health, provide alternatives to
conventional immunization.  We have aspirations to commercialize
novel functional foods, and medical treatment methods.  Our agricultural
base utilizes a combination of crop production areas to harvest
permaculture crop products and selected tree materials.  The system
also creates wildlife habitat and allows commercial ecotourism and
conventional game hunting.  We also incorporate mycological products
into our product line.  We are still several months from having
a product to market but the science is good and our ambition level
is high.  If the list members are show interest we'll provide a 
more detailed overview.

I don't know, last I heard 10 dimensions were sufficient but things are changing
so fast it's hard to keep up. The gravitational field at a point can not be expressed
with a  single number, you need 10 numbers (dimensions) for each point.
For this reason the gravitational field must be a tensor field. The number 10 comes up
because there are 10  and only 10 ways time and the three dimensions of space can
be expressed in pairs. I don't know why you'd need 11 dimensions.

Please do. Anytime someone talks about cures for seemingly intractable diseases,
using 'nutritional supplements', despite the positive results of natural
anti-oxidants, etc., my bogosity meter gets extra twitchy. While the potential
benefits of useful products are huge, as in the case of drugs like tamoxifen, etc
from natural sources, I'm sure I can speak for most everyone here in saying it is
extremely important that any health-cap startup using the term extropian in its name
not be a fly by night operation long on hype and short on science. If I so much as
hear the word multi-level.....

I think you understand where I am coming from. Despite what I know about both
naturally originating substances, as well as proactive marketing plans, the negative
connotations in the eyes of the public due to the indiscretions of others carry an
extra risk factor. Please be as forthcoming as possible.... I personally love the
fact that you are trying to naturally recusitate a moribumd local economy.

John, please explain this. I count the following:
for dimensions x,y,z, and t:
x,t
x,y
x,z
y,t
y,z
z,t
so unless you count x,x y,y z,z and t,t, then you only have six pairs. Am I missing
something? If you count double pairs like that, why not reverse pairs as well? I must be
thinking too literally....

A good day to contemplate the overturning of old paradigms. (To be fair, it

Hello All, I just completed a two week Alheimer's disease clinic
elective.  After speaking to several neuropathologists who feel that
Alzheimers disease is an inevitable fate for all that live long enough I
have some somber conclusions.  Since 10% of people age 70 have dementia
(>50% due to Alzheimer's), and that number climbs to 40% of people by
age 85, by my calculations, nearly 100% of people who reach 115 will be
demented (aymptotically speaking of course, as we know nothing is 100%).
 My point is just that any chemical which radically extends human life,
but is not lipophilic enough to cross the blood brain barrier, will be
far worse than no treatment at all. Murray

  IAN: Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) defined the rate at 
  which falling bodies accelerate near the Earth, which 
  has more recently been determined to be 9.8 meters per 
  second squared in a vacuum. 357 years after his death, 
  the physical truths Galileo helped to define are still 
  being denied and desecrated by the ruling authorities.

  The distance any object near the Earth will fall from 
  rest in a vacuum in 29 seconds is 13,500 feet. However, 
  the CIA proclaims that FLT800 fell from the apex of a
  dramatic climb (and thus from rest) 17,000 feet in only
  29 seconds, and that's NOT in a vacuum! The CIA scenario
  violates Galileoian physical law by a very wide margin.

  PROOF: The distance an object will fall from rest in a 
  given time (t) in a vacuum is found with the equation 
  (.5 * g * t^2), where "g" the gravitational acceleration 
  near the Earth. So all we need to plug in is the 29 
  seconds and we will know how far any object will fall
  near the Earth in vacco, which reveals to one and all: 

  Fall distance = (.5 * 9.8 * 29^2) = 4,120 m = 13,500 feet 

  The U.S. Government claims that an object would fall about 
  25% faster than the physical law defined by Galileo allows,
  and if we add in the slowing effect of atmospheric drag, the
  violation of Galileoian law is even more horrendous. Our 
  Govt and Galileo cannot both be right at the same time,
  therefore, either the physics books or the official 
  FLT800 scenario must be rewritten. Logic dictates.

  So the facts Galileo set out to define are still working 
  centuries later to topple the claims of tyrannical author-
  itarian structures, unfortunately, like in Galileo's day, 
  those who question the authorities are often so assaulted
  by the authoritarian establishment, that they are compelled 
  to recant their views, just like Galileo was centuries ago.

Take a look at the tale as told by one of the founders, Prof. John H.
Schwarz, California Institute of Technology


http://theory.caltech.edu/people/jhs/strings/index.htm

Superstrings looked good in 10 dimensions, but some calculations were
intractably difficult.  Lately, Ed Witten's M-theory showed an additional
symmetry, duality, which yields nonperturbative solutions previously
inaccessible.  Because this version is formulated in 11 dimensions, it
allows fundamental or elementary membranes or sheets rather than just
strings.  More recently still, F-theory proposes a yet-higher unification
in 12-dimensions.  Check the web.  Of course the real action is heinously
obscure.

However, the plane was not a ballistic object and was not operating
in a vacuum.  Air can accelerate a plane downward as well as upward.
Anyone who has flow in rough weather has felt the flutter in the stomach
as the plane is occasionally blown downward, and it is not unusual
to hear of meals and flight attendants being thrown to the ceiling.
A plane which noses over will also accelerate downward.  So there is no
inherent contradiction in saying that a crashing plane descended faster
than would an object released from rest in a vacuum.

If the report actually has the plane falling 17,000 feet in 29 seconds,
that is 400 MPH straight down, which would be pretty hard to do.  Most of
an airplane is relatively lightweight metal, so it would not have a high
terminal velocity if it falls without power.  You'd almost need to fly
at high throttle straight towards the ground to maintain a descent of
400 MPH, I'd think.

I don't know to what extent this 400 MPH speed is an accurate description
of the CIA's scenario for the Flight 800 crash.

I hope you imbibed at the clinic.

A study published in March 1997 by France's National Institute of Health
and scientific research suggest that moderate drinkers who consumed 2-4
glasses of red wine a day were 80% less likely than tea drinkers to
develop senile dementia and 75% less likely to develop Alzheimer's
disease.

Well, no one forces you to extend your life.:)

As for me, I'll take the risk that Alzheimer's and other diseases will be cured
or prevented sooner or later.  The task will be to live long enough and in
good enough shape to take advantage of that.  I find it highly unlikely that
it would not be cured.  It's merely an engineering problem -- as is most if not
all aging and disease.

Vivamus!

  IAN: But your talking about (1) an aerodynamically- 
  stable airframe and (2) an aircraft slipping through
  the atmosphere at high speed. The scenario to which I 
  refer is the opposite, for the plane at its apex is
  demolished, wing(s) off, forward section gone... 
  a junk yard at 17,000 ft that is not subject to 
  the favorable aerodynamics you describe, and at 
  the peak of its apex where it stalled, it is 
  at rest, and thus has no velocity to trade. 
  Those facts exactly counter the counter,
  which was very logical to have raised.

  The fastest-falling part of PAN AM 103, the wing,
  fell at great velocity, since it was, as you note, 
  subject to favorable aerodynamics, even as the rest
  of the aircraft was not, and yet it still fell 
  slower than the fall rate from rest in a vacuum.

  are exact. I've been over the video a dozen times.

Iceland: Parliament Sells Rights to Genetic Code

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

    By John Schwartz
    Washington Post Staff Writer
    January 12, 1999=20

    Iceland has decided to become the first country in the world to sell =
the rights to the entire population's genetic code to a biotechnology =
company -- a move that is highlighting the promise and risks of the =
genetic information age.=20

    The strikingly uniform DNA of Iceland's largely blue-eyed, =
blond-haired populace is expected to provide an invaluable resource for =
studying human genetics, leading to fundamental insights into many =
diseases, proponents say.=20

    "It really is a complete paradigm shift in medicine," said Jonathan =
Knowles, who heads research at Roche Holding Ltd., which has signed a =
$200 million, five-year deal to develop new drugs and tests from the =
data.=20

    But the plan is highly controversial because it will pool richly =
detailed genetic, medical and genealogical information about Iceland's =
270,000 residents into a set of linked databases that companies will =
search for clues into the nature of disease. Although a majority of =
Iceland's citizens support the plan, a vocal minority of scientists and =
doctors -- with support from a worldwide network of like-minded privacy =
advocates -- have stoked the controversy.=20

    "Most doctors and scientists here in Iceland are in favor of the =
basic purpose of this project -- but find the proposed solution quite =
unethical and unrealistic," said Jon Erlendsson, a Reykjavik-based =
engineer and writer who believes the database network will eventually =
fail because doctors and patients will refuse to cooperate once its =
nature is better understood.=20

    Opponents fear the database could make the most private details of =
individuals' lives public. People with mental illness or other health =
problems could be stigmatized, perhaps suffering job discrimination. =
Patients may become less willing to divulge personal information to =
their doctors. And in a country where some estimates say that about 10 =
percent of the population may have been born out of wedlock, long-held =
family secrets could leak out.=20

    The fight in Iceland is focusing attention on the potential risks of =
efforts to mine and refine personal data -- efforts that are also =
increasingly common in the United States and around the world.=20

    "Turning the population into electronic guinea pigs" should serve as =
a warning to Americans, said David Banisar of the Washington-based =
Electronic Privacy Information Center.=20

    Despite the objections, Iceland could begin collecting blood to =
obtain the DNA samples within six months, after a period in which =
citizens may decline to participate. Precisely how the blood will be =
collected has not been determined.=20

    The plan was proposed by Kari Stefansson, a Harvard-educated =
Icelandic scientist, in part as a way to develop a new natural resource =
for a country where unemployment is a chronic problem. Iceland's =
parliament, the Althing, approved the plan last month, passing a law =
authorizing the database and creating the framework that will enable a =
local company, deCODE Genetics, to hold an unusual 12-year monopoly on =
data marketing rights.=20

    Iceland's population presents a tantalizing opportunity for those =
who study genetics because all of that blond hair and blue eyes reflects =
one of the most remarkably homogeneous populations in the world. The =
original blend of 9th century Norse stock and Celtic seamen has been =
largely unchanged, and that gene pool was further restricted by bouts of =
plague, famine and volcanic eruption.=20

    This comparatively simple set of genes makes genetic prospecting far =
less daunting than attempting to track down faulty genes among the =
millions of chemical components arrayed along the human chromosomes in =
heterogeneous populations like that of the United States.=20

    (It's a little like trying to detect a single flat note sung by one =
person while wandering through a public park in which everyone is =
singing his own favorite tune: The distractions of the merengue, the =
klezmer, the classical and the sea chanteys make it even harder to find =
the errant note. A homogeneous population such as Iceland's, however, is =
more like a chorus, with most people singing from the same page -- so =
it's much easier to discern when one of the singers is off.)=20

    Because Iceland has a strong health care system with extensive =
record-keeping, as well as genealogical records that go back hundreds of =
years, it offers tremendous potential for ferreting out the relationship =
between the genetic and environmental origins of disease, said =
Stefansson. Researchers will be able to sift through the data to uncover =
medical insights "in a systematic manner," Stefansson said, adding that =
"it's going to be a great discovery tool."=20

    Those in Iceland supporting the plan say it strikes a careful =
balance between the rights of the citizenry and the needs of science. =
The unified health database will "improve delivery of health services. . =
. . On balance, I think the potential advantages will outweigh the risks =
involved," said Solveig Petursdottir, a member of parliament who voted =
for it.=20

    Opponents of the law cite numerous problems. Many of them are among =
the nation's leading scientists and scholars. They argue their case in =
Icelandic and English on their Web site, and have formed an advocacy =
group, Mannvernd, "to promote ethical standards in medical research, =
science and in the biotechnology industry in Iceland" and to oppose the =
new law, which the group's Web site says "infringes upon accepted =
medical, scientific and commercial standards." They say that they =
understand the importance of deCode's work and support earlier efforts =
by the company to understand genetic diseases by studying the DNA of =
Icelandic volunteers. But the new plan, they say, takes away too much =
privacy -- for private gain -- and gives too little back to the nation =
and to science.=20

    "When you put genealogical information into the databank and also =
genetic data, then the databank knows more about you than you know about =
yourself," said Tomas Zoega, chairman of the Icelandic Medical =
Association's ethics council. "Some look at it as a fantastic idea. But =
I think the idea is a scary one."=20

    Opponents complain that they still have not been told how the DNA =
will be collected, or how much information will be stored in the =
database. Those details will be decided by a government-created =
committee.=20

    The company has promised to collect the data "anonymously" but uses =
that word with great nuance, opponents say. Among most database experts, =
"anonymous" almost always means that identifying information will be =
stripped away. But in this case, the information directly identifying =
individuals will be encrypted so that it cannot easily be read by =
unauthorized people.=20

    British researcher Ross Anderson has prepared a paper for the =
Icelandic Medical Association that questions the notion that anonymity =
can be protected when so much data is collected. The company has pledged =
to program the computers to produce no fewer than 10 records for any =
query so that the computers can never identify an individual.=20

    But multiple searches can winnow one name out of 10, Anderson said, =
adding that no encryption scheme can mask identities when so much =
personal information is stored in one place.=20

    Opponents also argue that the pay-as-you-go research concept damages =
the spirit of science, in which knowledge should be freely shared.=20

    Most important from a doctor's point of view, Zoega said, is the =
possibility that "trust between patients and physicians will diminish =
and maybe disappear" if people believe that every fact about them will =
be entered into the database.=20

    As for those who support it, "I think that those are the people who =
have not been ill, who do not have medical records lying about," said =
Petur Hauksson, a psychiatrist who chairs the Icelandic Psychiatric =
Patients Association.=20

    Opposition to the database law is, if anything, even stronger =
outside of Iceland. Privacy officials of the European Union have been =
sharply critical of the database proposal. Researchers with expertise in =
genetics and public policy said that the nation's scientific goal is =
laudable but that the plan is flawed.=20

    Simon Davies, head of the London-based Privacy International, said =
the trend toward the collection of more data at the expense of privacy =
is a worldwide problem. "A sensible civil libertarian will say the =
democratic process failed us. It's all just evaporated in the past five =
years."=20

    Davies said people are too quick to accede to arguments based on =
"economic rationalism" without thinking about the broader implications. =
"Thin-lipped accountants have taken control," he said.=20

    Iceland has gone further than other European nations, Davies said, =
but it will not be alone for long. "What we're seeing in Iceland is just =
the forerunner of a Europe-wide mechanism," Davies said. "Wherever you =
see a bad law, you can bet that the rest of Europe will sink to that =
level and integrate."=20

    Pharmaceutical scientist Knowles acknowledged the potential for =
abuse. "We must do everything possible to ensure that privacy of =
individuals is maintained," he said. Because the data will be used to =
look for statistical relationships in large populations, the company has =
no motivation to examine information about specific persons, he said. =
"Individual data is of no use whatsoever."=20

    Fears of abuse should be addressed through legislation, not by =
restricting the project, Stefansson said. "We should not let the bad =
guys dictate" public policy, he said. "We're not going to let people die =
simply because it might be abused.=20

    "You do not place limitations on the creation of new knowledge," he =
said, "you place limitations on the ways that the new knowledge can be =
used."=20

                             ^^^^^^

See the weasel word here?  "Likely" given?  Sanchez is *speculating*
about the kind of scenario involved.  He apparently does not have direct
knowledge of the soldiers' orders, but given the overall scenario he
has concluded that it is some kind of extraction simulation, and he is
fleshing it out with some made-up details.

Military simulations in urban environments have been going on for some
time, and there are legitimate concerns about safety and notice to
local officials.  However there is no need to assume that these are
rehearsals for a government takeover.  Many overseas operations will
have to be carried out within cities.  It may well be that these are
intended to train troops for a variety of legitimate military operations.

There have been several actually Top Secret U.S. Military
attacks/wargames called Operation Last Dance using live fire 
on several communities in Texas, even blowing up a building 
or two! This is real! Local officials are sworn to secrecy. 
Citizens are terrorized and mad as hell, while the major
media keeps a blackout. Read about this fascist outrage:

A local FEMA official has said that the Operation-Last-Dance 
attacks on Texas are part of training for massive gun-roundup 
operations. The FEMA official said that this was the official 
wargame scenario of the special forces attack on Kingsville:

   "Martial law has been declared through
   presidential powers and war powers act, and
   some citizens have refused to give up their
   weapons. They have taken over two of the
   buildings in Kingsville. The police cannot
   handle it. So you call these guys in. They
   show up and they zap everybody, take all the
   weapons, and let the local P.D. clean it up,"

Mass roundups of privately-owned firearms are a hallmark 
of totalitarian takeovers (visit:  http://www.jpfo.org ). 
I get the feeling this nation is in for some changes, the 
early warning signs, such as talk of "black helicopters," 
having been effectively suppressed as signs of insanity.
Gun control planners will achieve the final objective 
of reducing the American people to defenseless sheep 
at the mercy of their terrorizing military masters.

             ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
             Fear and loathing 
             in Kingsville, Texas 
             Local residents fuming 
             over Army live-fire exercise 


             By David M. Bresnahan
             (c) 1999 WorldNetDaily.com 

             A group of Kingsville, Texas, citizens now
             plan to pursue action against their city for
             permitting the Army to use live ammunition
             during an exercise in their town known as
             Operation Last Dance. 

             Angry citizens are expected to crowd the next
             city council and county commission
             meetings, both scheduled to be held Feb. 22.
             At least one citizen is looking into legal
             action. 

                           Some residents said they
                           were terrified when
                           helicopters swooped into
                           town from the Army
                           Special Operations
                           Command, Ft. Bragg,
                           North Carolina, last
                           Monday night. One
                           helicopter hit a telephone
                           pole, which started a fire
             and horrified residents who saw it happen. 

             At least eight helicopters are reported to have
             participated in an assault exercise using live
             ammunition and explosives very close to
             innocent bystanders who were not warned of
             the planned action. 

             Fire officials confirmed that they responded
             to the resulting fire, but had no warning that
             the exercise would take place. They were also
             summoned to put out a building fire caused
             by explosions set off during the exercise. 

             It has since been learned from military
             sources that the actual group involved in the
             exercise is known as the Knight Stalkers, an
             elite group from the Delta Force. They are
             trained to conduct assassination missions,
             according to several retired military officers
             who had served in various special operations
             assignments. 

             The Army Special Operations Command at
             Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, has acknowledged
             that the event was the kick-off of a series of
             similar training operations going on in
             Kingsville, Corpus Christi and Fort Sam
             Houston, but would not confirm that the
             group was the Knight Stalkers. Additional
             training events have been confirmed in the
             area. 

             Austin radio station talk show host Alex
             Jones went to Kingsville to investigate for
             WorldNetDaily. He arrived just in time to find
             work crews covering up the evidence of the
             extensive damage caused by the exercise. 

             A former police station and an old Exxon
             office building were nearly destroyed.
             Evidence of bullet holes in walls, explosions
             from grenades, and other explosive charges
             could be seen. Fire damage was also
             extensive in at least one of the buildings. 

             "There was a joint
             training session between
             the United States Army
             and the Kingsville Police
             Department," Lt. Judy
             Hayes, third in command
             at the Kingsville police
             told Jones. 

             "The Army was doing
             some sort of extraction
             type thing. They used
             eight helicopters. Our
             training involved sealing off the area, as if we
             were involved in taking care of a hazardous
             materials type incident. We were rerouting
             traffic and making sure there was no civilian
             foot traffic in the area. So we got quite a bit
             of training in that area. 

             "The only participation on the part of the
             Kingsville Police Department was in a
             hazardous materials training session. We did
             not participate in any way with what the Army
             was doing," insisted Hayes. 

             Throughout the interview with Jones, two
             men in black SWAT team uniforms stood
             behind her. Jones believes it was an attempt
             to intimidate him. 

             The Kingsville Fire Department was not given
             notice of the exercise, and it was not invited
             to participate in the alleged hazardous
             materials training, even though it would be
             called in if there were a real even of that kind. 

             The fire department spokesman claimed
             officials were not aware of the event until they
             were called to respond to the telephone pole
             fire and the fire at the former police station. 

             An elderly lady who lives in an apartment
             across from where the exercise took place
             told Jones that she was frightened to death
             and crying. She was sitting on a bench in full
             view of the area where the helicopters first
             appeared and where all the shooting took
             place. 

             "I sit on the bench, and then I get scared
             because the noise. It was so terrible and too
             loud, you know. They were throwing some
             bombs. I think they were using some rifles
             too, and the other kind of rifles that go pop,
             pop, pop, pop, pop, you know," said the
             elderly woman, identified only as Gracie. 

             She described seeing many black helicopters
             with men in black coming out of them. She
             heard explosions and apparently machine gun
             fire. She said it lasted at least two hours. 

             "I was so scared I went back to my
             apartment, but I could still hear the noise,"
             Gracie said. She said she was so scared that
             she cried and her heart hurt. She said no one
             warned her or came to tell her what was going
             on. 

             Business owners are also complaining. The
             police claim they warned businesses in the
             area of the exercise in advance. If they did,
             WorldNetDaily was unable to find any that
             would confirm that. The businesses in the
             area that were open at the time of the exercise
             had no idea what was going on. 

             A former police chief and former city council
             member have expressed dismay over the
             incident and are contemplating filing an
             official complaint. 

                           Police Chief Philipe
                           Garza has been the
                           object of a number of
                           investigations lately.
                           Currently the U.S.
                           Department of Justice
                           has been asked to
                           investigate accusations of
                           police abuse. Several
                           residents, who did not
                           wish to be identified,
                           claim that Garza is very
                           abusive with citizens and
                           rules by intimidation. 

                           Garza claims there are
                           very few complaints from
                           residents of Kingsville.
                           He says the only
             complaints are coming from people in other
             parts of the country. 

             The head of emergency management for
             Kingsville is the Federal Emergency
             Management Agency coordinator Tomas
             Sanchez. He is a highly decorated Navy
             veteran, wounded in Vietnam and retired after
             30 years of service. He now continues to
             serve as the head of the military police unit of
             the Texas State Guard, which is under the
             National Guard. 

             Sanchez has had extensive experience and
             training in special operations, and he
             expressed deep concern to WorldNetDaily
             about events in Kingsville. He was asked
             what was the purpose of the exercise. He said
             the plan involved a scenario that required
             military action because local police could not
             deal with civilians effectively. 

             "Martial law has been declared through
             presidential powers and war powers act, and
             some citizens have refused to give up their
             weapons. They have taken over two of the
             buildings in Kingsville. The police cannot
             handle it. So you call these guys in. They
             show up and they zap everybody, take all the
             weapons, and let the local P.D. clean it up,"
             described Sanchez of the scenario the Knight
             Stalkers were likely given. 

             Sanchez says the military exercise in his town
             was illegal under the Posse Comitatus Act,
             but he says that Presidential Decision
             Directive 25 has given an exception to Special
             Operations. He believes the men involved
             have total immunity from any legal action
             against them. Although PDD 25 is top secret,
             Sanchez has seen it because of his position
             with FEMA, and he has a security clearance.
             He would not provide a copy to
             WorldNetDaily. 

             "Some folks are talking about seeking some
             legal counsel. Some are asking for the crisis
             incident stress management counseling. They
             would like to see some of that," said
             Sanchez. 

             "When the helos are right
             above the rooftop, and
             the windows are vibrating,
             and people are ducking
             under the bed, and so on
             and so forth, they need
             that," he explained. 

             Sanchez was able to
             locate some of the
             helicopters and some of
             the soldiers used in
             Operation Last Dance. He decided to take a
             drive to the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station
             and the Corpus Christi Army Depot where all
             the helicopters are given maintenance. 

             "Parked between hanger 45 and 46 on the
             tarmac were four Blackhawk, no marking,
             helicopters. They've got it all blocked off
             with a chain link fence that says ID card
             required to gain access. No security guard.
             One can drive up close enough to look
             through the fence and see the Blackhawk
             helocopters. Only four of them were parked
             there," said Sanchez of his findings. 

             He said the men involved are most likely
             staying at the bachelor- enlisted quarters,
             which is a three-story barracks building.
             Some of the men have been observed eating
             in a fast food restaurant right near the
             bachelor-enlisted quarters. 

             "You can always tell these guys because even
             when they put on civilian clothes they still
             look like Army Rangers. White sidewalls we
             call it. Short crew cut," Sanchez explained.

Perhaps, but don't you think having holidays is a paradigm that needs
to be broken?  I mean, why have special days to celebrate anything
-- whether it is the tradition stuff or not?  It seems a lot like the French
Revolutionaries changing the calendar.  It's cute, but not all that
significant.  And given the choice between having special holidays
to celebrate our particular icons or focusing on other things, I'd choose
the other things.:)

umm, i understand that aircraft are seldom at rest when in flight ...

Try factoring in the momentum (.5*mv^2) of a 400-to-800 thousand pound 
aircraft (depending on load and fuel status) traveling at maybe 490 knots.
 
It will slough off some of that M in vectoring down to earth but it still 
'aint going to be starting the trip from rest.

The CIA video does not show this.  The forward part of the fuselage falls
off at 13,000 feet.  The remainder of the plane, which includes the wings,
rises to 17,000 feet, then falls.  The video shows that it still has
both wings.  Then, as it falls through "about one mile", the left wing
comes off.  The video appears to show the right wing as still attached.

Your timeline seems correct, but the fuselage does have its wings.
Whether a plane falling straight down would hit 400 MPH seems questionable
to me, but I am not an expert on that type of aviation.

Even if it is no longer climbing, that does not mean at rest. It has 
considerable forward momentum: that was, and is, what generates the lift 
to get to that apex. 

One needs to know what the flight recorder says about power during the 
descent. If the pilots were not in control it will have made a 
potentially full throttle decent. If they were in control they are going 
to need to power the plane down to get leverage of their control  
surfaces. Either way there is no way to answer this from Galileo alone.

Not necessarily. A plane can be stalled and still be moving  forward at high
velocity. It is the angle of attack which matters when it comes to lift, not
speed.  Once it blew in half, the front section was front heavy and acted like a
lawn dart, translating its forward speed into downward speed.Calculate in its
forward velocity (probably around 300-400 mph) while climbing, being translated
over by the change in angle of attack to downward velocity....

What a great computer video!!

<http://www.newsday.com/jet/year/video.htm>

That makes the whole thing pretty clear, with synchronisation to eye 
witness accounts. I had no idea the explosion was so dramatic. 

It is also clear that the figures given are aproximations (about a mile 
...). The whole scenario  makes sense to me.

Ian , what is even your hypothesised point of a conspiring to change the 
crash timings by a few seconds? I mean, the plane was decapititated, 
powered up with the changed in centre of gravity, exploded again, 
propelling itself downward violently, then proceeded to dismember itself 
in an horrific fire ball. What the hell is there to cover up in this 
sequence?

cheerio,
tim

  I'm afraid I read through the report too fast 
 and missed the "likely" part in the full text, 
 sorry(!), which means what the official says 
 there was the LIKELY scenario. It notes that 
 the FEMA official, Tomas Sanchez is privy 
 to at least one classified document. 

  Let me know if you hear about these events 
 in the major media.  There was apparently a 
 sentence or two cite in the Washington Post or
 Times, but I've not confirmed this. How could 
 these top-secret-military actions on civilian
 communities in the U.S. go uncovered by the 
 media? Assuming for the moment that they
 are not the Federal Governments PR office.

 There's at least one local Texas media account:

  IAN: You don't understand the trajectory,
  it's not a fall directly from a forward 
  velocity, that's what you're calculating, 
  it is a fall after a sharp upward climb
  of 3,200 feet in 20 seconds. At the peak
  the jet stalls and is at ZERO velocity.

  IAN: It's basic physics that when you throw a ball 
  up and it reaches its apex, it is there at zero mph.
  Momentum and velocity are at zero at the apex. The 
  noseless airframe would have expended it's forward
  momentum long before it even reached its peak, much 
  less have kept it thereafter. The mathematical analysis 
  of aerodynamics engineer Edward Zehr is agreed on by 
  all on that matter, which is, the rate that it would 
  stall, which both his static and dynamic flight models 
  prove is within 5 seconds after the forward section 
  broke away, which voids the 3,200 foot climb to 17,000.

Yeah, hell, the City of Lowell, Mass, named a day after me when I was born for
gawds sakes.

 http://homepages.together.net/~retroman/mslday1.htm

is a html version of the proclamation. I guess this holiday comemmorates what a
good idea it is to name the mayor's son as my godfather....;)

On the other hand, the idea that we shouldn't comemmorate dates on which people
did extraordinary things (especially things which furthered extropy), is kinda
deconstructionist to me.

Besides, I like having my own holiday, even though I didn't do much to earn
it....hopefully I will do so sometime in this life....

I have to blame myself for not having more 
effectively translated the CIA scenario, I
assumed it was know more than it is. 
Respondents don't understand what it is
so we're all talking past each other. 

We're not talking about a plane that was on a 
forward/horizontal vector and that translated 
into a downward vector (but keep in mind that 
horizontal and vertical velocity are independent,
but that's not a matter here). The CIA scenario
says that the plane shot upwards 3,200 feet 
in 20 seconds after the nose came off. Drawing
a graph finds that's an angle of attack around 
16 to 18 degrees.

Anyway, the point is that the jet shot up like 
you throw a ball up, and reached a peak, would be 
at rest there, and then fell. That's the CIA scenario.

More comments...

  IAN: Horizontal velocity is independent of 
  vertical velocity, what that means is that 
  you don't translate forward velocity into
  downward velocity. Basic kinematics, but 
  again, not a factor in the CIA scenario.

  Speed does play a role in lift. For 
  example,tilt a wing at any angle at 
  0 mph, and it gets no lift. Give it
  some forward speed, and it has lift.

  The front end blew away, and the mid-to 
  rear sections got rear heavy causing a 
  pitch up, which the math shows will cause 
  a fatal stall in under five seconds, but 
  the CIA says it caused the noseless jet
  to shoot upwards looking like a rocket.

  Witness say that the plane rolled and fell 
  like a rock, which is exactly what happened 
  to PAN AM 103 after it lost its forward section.

  IAN: Yes, you are correct, the wing did not detach 
  then in the CIA scenario. Nevertheless, even perfect 
  aerodynamic advantage will not accelerate an object 
  faster in a fall from rest than the fall rate in a 
  vacuum, only increase it's ability to approach 
  the rate of fall in a vacuum, like one of the  
  wing's from PAN AM 103, which fell fastest, 
  but still slower than the fall rate, and it 
  did not supposedly shoot upward first so it 
  had whatever forward velocity might give. 

  The noseless plane with wide-open fuselage 
  was a parachute with wings. Wings won't help.

  Someone mentioned the FDR data. It stopped in the 
  instant of the initial event. The last second was 
  first said to be 8:31:12, and it showed what retired
  Navy crash investigator Cmdr. Bill Donaldson has
  shown fits an external detonation of a proximity-
  fused warhead. Then that data block was erased 
  from the NTSB website(!), and said to have been 
  from the former flight, which apparently must
  have survived a missile attack. This is true:

I think their movie shows the plane exploding downward like a rocket. In 
other words it didn't reach appogee and turnover like an albatross, it 
was being thrust violently upwards under full throttle, suffered an 
alteration in attitude due to its own fuel exploding and then rapidly 
accelerated towrad the earth, continuing some thrust and much burn.

Also, it is quite inappropriate to translate their about x seconds and 
"about a mile" 6 
o'clock news commentary into a calculus of precise feet and seconds.

  IAN: That's a false claim! How have

  they do say "approximate" and that

  IAN: The maximum psi for a fuel-

  Many engineers believe it will 
  not even rip open a fuel tank.

  IAN: Can you please explain how a center 
  of gravity shift "powers up" an airframe?
  If lift is on your mind, there's more 
  to it than that. Lift causes climb and 
  climb increases drag, which requires 
  greater thrust, particularly to have 
  achieved the approx 50 mps climb rate,
  5 times greater than the book-value rate.

  IAN: What exploded at the apex? I was in
  error when I said the wing came of at the 
  top. The CIA says, as I recall, that the 
  engines died nearing the apex, which they 
  would have done shortly after a pitch up; 
  as aviation mechanics will tell you, 
  engines flame out after sharp pitch up.

The double pairs do count so you have 10, but it's true that the physical (not mathematical)
meaning of such double pairs is not intuitively obvious.

    >If you count double pairs like that, why not reverse pairs as well?

Because the gravitational force that point particle A has on particle B is symmetrical to
the gravitational force point particle B has on particle A. If you reverse the particles
there is no need to conjure up a new dimension to figure out the new gravitational field,
just change a few constants from 1 to -1 and you can still get by with 10 dimensions.

  IAN: You obviously havn't listend to the 
  video long enough to hear exactly this:


"Just after the aircraft exploded it pitched up abruptly and climbed
several thousand feet from its last reported altitude of about 13,800 feet
to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet. ...Shortly after Flight 800
reached the peak of its accent, about 20 seconds after it exploded, a
fireball erupted from the aircraft. ..."

  [IAN: Note, as you mentioned, there is an 
  explosion at the apex in the CIA scenario, 
  but fuel sprayed out by the jet (from which
  wing, both were on? center tank only about 
  a 100 or so gallons already exploded) would 
  have fallen behind the climbing jet, and if 
  that exploded, the 60 psi pressure wave 
  (rapidly falling off) would push UP
  from below the noseless fuselage.
  If the fuel source was on board, its
  force would be distributed isotropically,
  and thus not pushing down more than up,
  but since fuel tanks are low to the 
  fuselage, could tend to push up more.]
  
  Back to CIA video:

  IAN: And the CIA video gives the exact time 
  frame, which is 49 seconds from initial event 
  at 13,800 to splash down to 0, after at 3,800 
  vertical and upward execution to 17,000 over 
  a 20 second-time frame. Those exact numbers.

Here's the video quoted exactly giving us those numbers:


"Just after the aircraft exploded it pitched up abruptly and climbed
several thousand feet from its last reported altitude of about 13,800 feet
to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet. This is consistent with
information provided by NTSB investigators and Boeing engineers, who
determined that the front third of the aircraft, including the cockpit,
separated from the fuselage within 4 seconds after the aircraft exploded.
This significant, sudden loss of mass from the front of the aircraft caused
the rapid pitch up and climb.

  [ FYI: NTSB Exhibit 22C, page 7 says the lost 
  forward section was about 14% of total weight. ] 

"The explosion, although very loud, was not seen by any known eyewitness;
however, the subsequent small fire trailing from the aircraft was visible
to a few of the closest eyewitnesses on land, sea and in other aircraft. It
was repeatedly described as an ascending white light resembling a flair or
firework, but it was difficult to see against the relatively light sky.
Shortly after Flight 800 reached the peak of its ascent, about 20 seconds
after it exploded, a fireball erupted from the aircraft. This was clearly
visible to many eyewitnesses. The aircraft then went into a very steep and
rapid descent. 

"As the aircraft descended, it produced an increasingly visible fire trail.
When the jet reached an altitude of roughly one mile, about 42 seconds
after it exploded, its left wing separated from the fuselage, releasing
unburned fuel. The fuel's subsequent ignition and blaze produced a dramatic
cascade of flames, visible to eyewitnesses more the 40 miles away, and
detected by an infrared sensor aboard a U.S. satellite. About 7 seconds
after the left wing detached, and 49 seconds after the initial explosion,
the burning debris hit the water."

* TYPEO there, should read 3,200, which 
  is in the math in the original post
  and all others, thus no effect on case.

Geez, I've got to sit closer to the monitor! Well, after 
a wide excursion of counters and postings, the original 
post stands exactly correct, not even a typeo, I think. :)

If anyone still thinks an object can fall from rest 17,000 
feet in 29 seconds, or can figure out how the demolished 
airframe in CIA scenario fall that fast, please speak up.

If Galileo's listening, he should want to know...

Well, this view is not uncontroversial. I think in other places the
consensus is that the disease is indeed a pathological rather than
natural part of aging.

I think we will know soon enough. People are discovering new stuff
about the disease quite quickly right now, and especially the
properties of the beta-amyloid precursor protein are fascinating (a
strong ACh-release inhibitor, has nootropic properties) and suggest
that one cause might be erroneous metabolism of this substance.

If it doesn't change the way the brain ages, it obviously will not
radically extend life since other neural aging processes would shorten
it (including things like neurons randomly dying, leaving no
replacements). 

However, smuggling substances past the BBB seems quite feasible (I
posted about a paper where they did that with NGF a month ago), so I
don't think the BBB will be the major problem for life extension.
 
It might turn out that aging isn't an unitary process, and we will
have to treat whole clusters of disorders as they are discovered, and
then new limits will emerge as people manage to age some more. That
would be tiresome and tricky, but it is possible.

What would the holiday greeting be? "It moves!" :-)

(shades of the slogan "The turtle moves!" in Terry Pratchett's _Small
Gods_, where the heretics claim the world lies on the back of a giant
turtle but the Church claims it is round)

Because it is easier to get many people together for a
celebration. Repeated holidays also provides a practical framework for
building better "holiday technology" (decorations, songs, food, games
etc) that can be reused.

The reason is that these pairs are due to the metric tensor g. g
represents how distances are measured at different points in
spacetime, you can view it as a matrix of numbers (which may vary from
point to point). The squared distance is given by 

ds^2 = sum_ij g_ij dx_i dx_j

where ds is the distance between two infinitesimally close points,
dx_i their coordinate difference along coordinate i and I use a TeX
like notation for subscripts. g_ij means the component of g in the ith
row and jth column.

For normal euclidean space g is zero except for g_11, g_22, g_33 and
so on, the distance between two points is given by Pythagoras'
theorem: ds^2 = dx^2+dy^2+dz^2

In Lorentz space (as in special relativity) time is positive and
space-coordinates have the opposite sign: ds^2 = c^2 dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2
where c is the speed of light. 

So the double pairs in some sense correspond to the usual distance
measures, while the other pairs are more of "mixtures" that occur when
the coordinate system is not perfectly aligned with the curvature of
space (locally, you can always set up coordinates to make the tensor
diagonal, but it doesn't work in general globally). 

Now, g is symmetric (that is part of the definition, actually),
g_ij=g_ji, and in 4-dimensional space that means you can only have 10
independent components.

However, I'm not entirely certain the 10 components of g explain why
there are 10 (11) dimensions in string theory, the last paper I read
about it ("M-theory for laymen" or something similar, available from
xxx.lanl.gov) just made me more confused.

(Network timeout. Japan's pretty much no go from here.)

Anyway, the next TOP500 list will be announced during the conference
mentioned above. That's probably the connection. There's a list from
November, and Uni Mannheim has no entry. I know that they have some kind
of fat many-CPU parallel machine, but apparently it doesn't rate mention

Yeah, its intimidating as to the confidence they have in the 'layman' to understand what they
are talking about. Then again, it is a government page....mix physicistese with bureaucratese
and its a wonder its readable at all. ;)

Absolutely wrong. What do you think a wing does? Any airfoil or hydrofoil shape is
useful because it translates foward motion to upward accelleration when oriented
to the proper angle of attack to generate lift. This is why it shot upward so fast
when it lost its nose, and why the nose started dropping so quickly. The angles of
attack of the two parts generated lift (upward for the rear section, and downward
for the nose section) which caused added acceleration in their respective
direactions, translating forward momentum into vertical acceleration.

The reason why the peices only had a 400 mph velocity when they hit the ocean is
because of what is called 'terminal velocity'. This is when the forces of
acceleration (in this case gravity) are exactly counterbalanced by the forces of
aerodynamic drag, thus preventing any additional speed gains. The human body has a
terminal velocity when sky diving of around 125 mph in a prone position, and over
200 mph in a dive. Now, at 400 mph, assuming that aerodynamic forces cause a pitch
over and momentum translation in 5 seconds (not unheard of and similar to a 6g
turn in a fighter plane, which, considering the new angle of attack the nose
seciton had to its forward velocity, is likely, then the nose section would have
dropped 6.6 miles in one minute traveling at a terminal velocity of 400 mph (which
is about 3 miles in 24 seconds). The CIA simulation probably refers to the nose
section hitting the ocean, although it is not totally inconsistent if dropped from
17000 feet.

Dropping from 17000 feet from a total stall you have:
S=(32ft/s)*(29^2)/2=13,456 feet.
This almost exactly matches the nose section trajectory. The additional 350 feet
of altitude would have been bridged due to velocity translation by airfoil effects
being added to the acceleration profile. So the nose section hit the ocean at 29
seconds.

I suggest that you seek out a written timeline from the CIA of this analysis. I
think you will find that what I say is true and that the rear section hit a little
later.

Ian, I must have missed something.  What exactly is the government supposed
to be covering up in this mess?  Absent some motive, I'm more inclined to
suspect them of incompetence than malice.

On the topic of moving objects falling through atmosphere, I see several
issues that seem to be getting muddled.  Let me throw out a few points:

1) An unpowered object, starting from rest, can not fall through atmosphere
faster than it would through a vacuum.  It doesn't matter what shape the
object is, because any acceleration it gains from aerodynamic effects will
be smaller than the drag from having to pass through atmosphere.

2) An aircraft that has significant horizontal motion, and then goes into a
dive, can easily fall much faster than it would in a vacuum.  There is a
rather complex aerodynamic effect that allows it to trade horizontal for
vertical motion.  I haven't seen anything that shows FLT800 to have 0
forward momentum - in fact, such a claim seems highly unlikely.  Moving up
at a steep slope seems to fit the evidence better, but that would leave the
aircraft with significant forward motion when it starts its descent.

3) We don't know exactly when the engines went out.  Obviously, if some of
them were still running when the plane went into its descent this would
produce a very fast powered dive.  This sort of descent can easily approach
the speed of sound, even for otherwise subsonic aircraft.

4) Air/aviation gas explosions are not limited to some puny level of force.
I don't know who this info originally came from, but they're wrong.
Depending on the exact mixing conditions you can get anything from
non-explosive combustion to very large explosions.  Under worst-case
conditions (small droplets dispersed through a large volume of air before
being ignited) the effect can be equivalent to several times the same mass
of TNT.  The air force makes some impressive bombs that use this principle.

5) Burning fuel tanks sometimes produce a significant propulsive force - the
tank can act like an inefficient rocket engine.  Combustion that takes place
outside the aircraft can also produce significant effects, especially if it
is uneven.  In a spectacular case like FLT800, with multiple leaks and
clouds of burning debris, this creates a significant amount of experimental
noise. Figuring out the exact effects of all this activity would take a lot
of supercomputer time.

When you add up all these factors, it becomes obvious that you really can't
say anything definitive about the fall rate of a crippled aircraft without a
lot of detailed information.  Even then, getting anything better than a
rough estimate of its behavior would require a supercomputer-based physics
simulation.

Actually, I must defend xxx.lanl.gov. It is an excellent preprint
archive that just happens to be at Lawrence Livermore. The articles
are submitted by individual physicists, and their incomprehensibility
is completely due to the physicists themselves :-)

By the way, the article I was referring to was

"A Layman's Guide to M-theory" by M. J. Duff

Murray's recent message prompts me to respond.

I've had direct contact with Dr. George Martin, both as a student
and in his position as an advisor to Aeiveos Sciences Group.  Dr. Martin
is probably one of the world's leading experts on Alzheimer's.  I've also
had direct contact with A.D. since my grandmother was hospitalized
for a many years with something which was either A.D. or
something bearing a strong resemblance to it.

I would generally agree with the estimates and prognosis which
Murray and his neuropathologists provide.  I would not however
agree with the conclusions Murray proposes:

> My point is just that any chemical which radically extends human life,
> but is not lipophilic enough to cross the blood brain barrier, will be
> far worse than no treatment at all.

(a) there will be no general chemical which extends human life since
    human aging becomes increasingly multifactorial as one ages
    [this is determined by the evolutionary biology of aging]

(b) the question becomes, not whether A.D. develops, but whether
    or not A.D. "destroys" the individual?  If A.D. develops but
    the individual remains intact (in his/her memories, hopes,
    perceptions, etc.), then the medical question is whether or not
    one can resurect the "recall/processing" paths which are damaged
    by A.D. so as to allow the individual to exercise "free will"?

(c) I would maintain that current medical technology in *incapable*
    of judging those circumstances in which they may or may not be
    able to resurect information processing pathways.  This is
    related to the fundamental lack of understanding in the medical
    community for the capacities of consciously programmed "nanobots".

(d) I would cite the case of Parkinsons disease, in which the simple
    increase in the levels of a neurotransmitter (through the inhibition
    of breakdown or the replacement of the cells responsible for synthesis)
    results in a recover of function.  If nanobots, can (easily) do this and
    much more, then how can neuropathologists dictate that A.D.
    is terminal?

Furthermore, as a Senior Associate of the Foresight Institute,
the former president of a not so insignificant biotechnology company,
an as a reviewer of the soon to be published "Nanomedicine",
which details nanotechnology interventions in medical pathologies,
I would say that the

> 15 years from age 70 to age 85 where A.D. climbs from 10 to 40%
> (according to Murray) is a *huge* *huge* time span.

If we compare 1980 (when genome sequencing was but an imagined
fantasy) to 1995; (when multiple genomes were being sequenced)
to 2010; (when the human genome and all known human pathogenic
organisms will be sequnced (many years in the past).

The bottom line is that the rate of technology advancement
is continually increasing and if we base our prognosis on
historical experience or perceptions, we will inevitiably
be shortchanged.

So, all of the above leads us to only two conclusions:
  (1) That we should "combat" aging with whatever limited means we
      have at our disposal currently.

  (2) That we should encourage the "last-ditch" solution of
      cryonics to catch those situations in which our current
      knowledge or metodologies are insufficient.

We cannot in our wildest imaginations perceive what may
be possible with future nanotechnolgies, so adhering
to the first principle of medicine: "first, do no harm",
one can only adopt a conservative approach of doing
what one can now, and arranging to do what is possible
in the future then.

using various firms to import small amounts of medicines to the USA (
'small' meaning for personal use only ).  I tried to use the list

Due to moving ExI's admin around and changing procedures, we're way behind
on sending out membership renewal reminders. If you know your membership
has expired, it would really help us if you could renew soon. You can do
this via the web form at www.extropy.org, or by sending your info to me at
more@extropy.org  or by calling (310) 398-0375 (and leaving a message on
the secure machine).

If you're sending a check, please send it to the old address, since the
bank deposits are still done down here for now:
Extropy Institute
13428 Maxella Avenue, #273

NOTE: ExI membership is needed for entry to EXTRO 4. (See
http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm for info). If you are joining for the
first time and also want to go to the conference, you can take $20 off the
membership rate (or $5 off the student rate).

If recent stock market gains have rewarded you well, please consider a
(tax-deductible!) contribution to help ExI pay off some of its debts. (BTW,
I need to check on this, but I believe that a portion of the Extro 4
registration may be tax-deductible. Once confirmed, we'll add this info to
the web pages.)

Sorry for the financial interruption. I now return you to your regular

  IAN: Sorry dude, your wrong, read it yourself,
  from the textbook "Elementary Classical Physics" 
  (Allyn & Bacon, Inc. 1973, p.43), which says: 

     "If one throws an object horizontally and 
     simultaneously drops a second body from 
     rest, the two objects strike a horizontal 
     plane at the same instant. The thrown object 
     strikes the surface with a larger velocity..."

  They strike the surface at the same time because 
  horizontal and vertical velocity are independent. 
  It's elementary kinematics. This issue pertained 
  to dropping, not rising, you switched the focus:

  IAN: Mike, there is no free energy! Just because
  the angle of attack is changed does not mean that
  the plane can shoot up like a rocket. A climb 
  increases drag, which requires additional thrust
  to sustain. It's harder to go up than down. 

  Read the work of Edward Zehr and you'll see what 
  even missile-theory critics do not dispute, that 
  the plane would stall and fall in 5 seconds, and
  would not go higher than around 300 feet.

  IAN: Totally wrong. Please view the video. It is the

Hi,

I'm new to the group, but I had an extropian phase in the early days of the
movement, then turned to Objectivism, and currently consider myself a thomist.
However, I am still fascinated by many aspects of extropianism (especially
life extension and intelligence increase), and I have decided to read the few
dozen books I haven't read yet in the extropian bibliography.

Here are my notes on the last book I have finished. I hope this will inspire
discussion, and I hope others will also post their own reading notes-
directing us towards books we may not have heard of, or refreshing our memory
about books we may have read long ago.

Jerry Pournelle A Step Farther Out (Ace Books, 1979) [February 12 1999]
**

This is a collection of thirty articles originally published in Galaxy, most
of them centered on the theme that mankind can " survive with style " and
other scientific issues of interest to science-fiction writers, such as black
holes, dinosaurs and computers. Some of the articles are just reactions to
annual conferences of the AAAS which Pournelle attended, giving snapshots of
scientific research in the late 1970s. Most of the articles were already
partly obsolete when they were gathered in book format, so one may wonder at
their relevance twenty years after the publication of the book. Much has been
learned about the planets of the solar system, for instance, and Pournelle
already recognized in 1979 that his schemes for the terraformation of Venus
were extremely simplistic. Moreover, given the format the essays were
originally published in, the book lacks cohesion and progression, and is often
redundant.

The message of the book is very similar to Julian Simon's, except Simon
focuses on the Earth's resources, while Pournelle extends the range of
available resources to the whole solar system. Another difference is that
Pournelle, though obviously sympathetic to free enterprise (twice quoting
Freeman Dyson's remark that America was settled by enterprising individuals),
is quite tolerant of big government budgets, going so far as to recommed
better allocation of government research funds.

He does a good job showing that most sources of " soft energy ", such as wind
and garbage, won't fill man's energetic needs, and that nuclear energy is the
only solution in the short term. In its defense of nuclear energy, the book
echoes the message of Pournelle and Niven's " Lucifer's Hammer ", where
mankind found its post-cataclysmic salvation by maintaining a nuclear plant in
activity.

A funny thing about the book is that it was written at the beginning of the
home computer revolution, and Pournelle keeps marveling at the computing power
of his pocket calculator.

I wonder what has become of the " holographic theory of the brain "- whether
it has been refined in the meantime or simply discarded. I like the idea that
information storage in the brain could be dynamic (p82), which would imply
that even if we can duplicate or restore brain structure, as the cryonicists
hope nanotechnology will enable us to do, the information will be lost because
of the intervening interruption of the brain's activity. What happens to
comatose brains for instance ? Could the psychiatric troubles that follow
comas stem from such an interruption ? I also liked the idea that the
information is encoded in the brain, and that the decoder may be damaged,
leading to the person's inability to read the information off his own brain.
Such a model could explain reversible amnesia, or cases of madness like George
III's, with intermittent phases of sanity. 

At times, Pournelle is extremely nave, as when he assumes that one day, the
acquisition of knowledge will be automated (" the computer can squirt the
book's contents directly into your mind " p86) or rendered obsolete by instant
hook up with world databases. He doesn't seem to realize the importance of the
integration and automatization of knowledge (not to mention the filtering !),
which cannot be done without extended periods of intense " chewing " of the
material. Pournelle also gratuitously assumes there is a " central processing
unit " in the brain (p86) - the myth of the homonculus debunked by Gerald
Edelman and others - and that the " basis of consciousness " is either "
matter or structure " (p308)

I think this book was included in the reading list more for its enthusiasm and
anti-defeatism than for any factual information it contains. The fact that it
was written by a science-fiction author also tends to make the speculation a
little wilder, Pournelle going so far as to accept the possibility of
telepathy (p87) or UFOs (101-113).

The most disgusting part of the book is certainly the speculations concerning
black holes, which seem to offer elbow room for the scientists' irrationality.
" Time running backward " is a meaningless phrase if you accept the
Aristotelian conception of time as a measurement of change and of the present
as "all there is"; and Hawking's idea that " anything " can come out of a
black hole is simple nonsense.

All in all, I'd  rather recommend reading Julian Simon's books, plus up to
date speculations about mankind's future in space.

Sincerely,

Jean-Francois Virey,
Douai, France.

Hi,

I wonder if A.A.Attanasio has even been discussed in Extropian circles. I
personally consider him the best science-fiction and fantasy writer ever, and
many of his themes are typically extropian.

One of his most recent novels, *Centuries*, which I personally consider one of
the ten greatest novels ever written, is a history of the third millenium,
from the point of view of several pivotal characters: Ellen Vancet, a
scientist from the research team that created the anthrofacts, a group of
genetically engineered metasapient humans; Rafe Von Takawa, the less
intelligent of these anthrofacts, or "metas", and the hero of the novel; the
Machine, an artificial intelligence which later adopts a human form...

The book is perhaps the most visionary novel I have read, its only competitors
being other books written by Attanasio himself. Its characters are all
immortals, many of them are metasapients, and the settings range from Earth to
the Moon, Mars and Jupiter's moons, not to mention a limbo of "waveforms"
(kinds of astral bodies) which Attanasio calls the "tesseract range" (I don't
know whether he coined the term or borrowed it).

I think one of the problems with the fiction books which have been selected in
the extropian reading list is that they tend to have been included for their
themes and ideas more than for their literary qualities. (Is it because most
extropians are scientists with a stunted esthetic sensibility?) But you can
get ideas and science in a more rational presentation in non-fiction books, so
why go through the tedium of reading poorly plotted novels with flat, boring
characters and an execrable style? ("Give us the facts, Ma'am, just the
facts.") Novels should be literary, and I don't see the point of reading junk
novels just because they deal with issues that are dear to us.

In the original Extropian fiction list, I personally consider Sterling's
*Schismatrix*, Walter Jon Williams' *Aristoi* and Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged*
to be the only three truly great novels. The others are either average or
above average, the worst being *Inherit the Stars* and *The Great Explosion*.
(By the way, why not include Rand's *The Fountainhead*, if superior
intelligence and creativity are actual extropian values?)

For an upgrading of the list, A.A.Attanasio would be a good place to start. I
also recommend *Radix*, his first novel, the story of an obese delinquent in a
post-apocalyptic world who transforms into a superman. (I have read four other
novels by Attanasio, but they were all closer to fantasy than genuine science-
fiction.)

*Centuries* has not been published in the US but is available in an English
edition via amazon.co.uk.

Comments welcome,

Jean-Francois Virey,
Douai, France.

Kinematics is only part of the problem with an airliner in a trajectory. There is
a HUGE difference between throwing a ball at 20 miles per hour and a 747
travelling at 400 mph. If what you claim is true then it should be physically
impossible for a pitcher to throw a curve ball. "Yet It Moves"...... Likewise, if
what you say were true, then it should be physically impossible for lifting body
vehicles to fly through the air. They should drop like bricks.... but they don't.
If what you say were true, then a car traveling down a rain soaked higway at 70
mph should not hydroplane. Yet it does. If what you say were true, then a kite
should not fly. For gods sake it isn't even moving!!! Its majic, oh my gawd Ian
you've made the discovery of a lifetime!! Kites work by magic!!!

I can dispute those numbers. If the plane is moving at 400 mph and suddenly
begins to climb, it will translate a large percentage of its velocity to lift,
and the remaining forward velocity to drag (aerodynamic and gravitational), as it
climbs. It will top out within 5 seconds it will have gone around 2000 feet at
the very least. The fact that its engines were still running would also have
added thrust to the vehicle, which would have added the remaining  thousand feet
to the climb, especially considering that the engines had just been releived of
10-15% of the load put on them by the nose previously (of course there is also
the drag of having an open front on the fuselage which could potentially add more
drag than is saved by the reduction in weight)....it would add altitude as the
forward section reached the top of its zenith, with airspeed dropped below 100
knots...

I think you or someone is leaving out a zero from Zehr's analysis...

Listen buddy, the math doesn't lie. I'll reveiw the video again tonite, but as I
recall, they did not specify what part of the plane hit first, just that the
first parts did hit at 29 seconds...And I don't care about the 'woe is me... I'm
just a martyr for truth' routine....

 IAN: Some people have ended up with postal inspectors 
 and police on their case after acquiring overseas medications, 
 even though it was legal. Harassment is the word there. The
 Life Extension Foundation reported a few cases a while back.

 So be careful.

For a plane to fall 17,000 feet in 29 seconds, an average downwards
velocity of 400 MPH, if it were not activelly accelerating downward
with its engines (which seems questionable after a fuel tank explosion),
and if it fell without air resistance, it would need an initial downward
velocity of 82 MPH, accelerating to an impact speed of 700 MPH.

Presumably air resistance would be a significant factor at speeds
considerably below 700 MPH, and probably below 400 MPH, especially, as Ian
says, with the forward third of the fuselage missing.  In that case you
have to assume a higher initial downward velocity.  But you still need to
*average* 400 MPH, which means that unless the initial downward velocity
is that fast, then the final velocity has to be higher than 400 MPH.

I doubt that the plane was going 400 MPH in its climb through 13,000
feet.  I don't know much about the climb performance of large jets but
my guess is that it would be going around 200 MPH in a takeoff climb.

The conspiracy theorists say that the rising spark was a missle,
and the underpressure readings were caused by the shock wave from
the missile explosion, with the plane then falling from 13,800 feet.
The CIA explanation has the rising spark be the plane itself, rising
from 13,800 to 17,000 feet after the front of the fuselage drops off,
with the underpressure readings reflecting the beginning of this climb.

I'm not sure where the timing data from explosion to ocean-impact
comes from.  Apparently the flight data recorder was not functional.
Was this from eyewitness testimony?  In that case, the only real question
is whether the plan started from 17,000 or from 13,800 feet and hit the
ocean in 29 seconds, right?  The CIA says the former, and the conspiracy
theorists say the latter.

The problem does not go away if the plane starts 3,200 feet lower than
the CIA's 17,000 feet.  It's still a lot of lightweight metal to get
out of the sky in 29 seconds.  You can just make it with a ballistic
(no air resistance) fall, but it hits at 630 MPH. That's an awfully fast
speed regime to be assuming no air resistance.  If you can believe this
then it's not that much harder to believe the 17,000 foot drop with an
initial speed of 82 MPH and final impact at 700 MPH.

I found the following on James T. Hogan's (the science fiction author)
website.  I'm kinda gratified that he addresses a subject that I brought up
(and was subsequently shot down on) some months ago.  However...his questions
are intriquing...and he's NOT just a truckdriver.

EARLY EARTH Posted May 9, 1997

In connection with this, I've come across some fascinating accounts in various
sources showing that dinosaurs were simply impossible. Weight scales up as the
cube of size, but strength only as the square. At dinosaur size, even an
Olympic power-lifting champion wouldn't be able to stand--and they're all
muscle, whereas dinosaurs were practically all digestive system. Dinosaurs
don't show any evidence of possessing the specially adapted high-pressure
blood circuits that giraffes need to supply the head--even with necks 2-3
times longer. Suggestions that they carried their heads low run into
impossible stresses exerted by the leverage at the base. Aqueous environments
don't fit with the wear on the teeth, which was caused by hard, dry
vegetation, not soggy marine stuff; and they left tracks and footprints. One
school of interpretation concludes Earth must have been a lower-gravity place
back then. But how could that be? More in this--sources, comments,
suggestions--welcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
VELIKOVSKY'S IDEAS AGAIN Posted April 14, 1998

In September last year (BB ARCHIVES - CATASTROPHISM, September 13, 1997) I
posted a note on the work of the shamefully misrepresented work of Immanuel
Velikovsky, where I commented that the evidence continues to accumulate that
Venus is a young planet. This is despite the efforts of the Orthodoxy to
select and twist the data to conform to the requirements of traditional
gradualist theories, and ignore everything that won't. A number of people have
been in touch to ask for more about what this evidence is--hard, scientific
evidence, as opposed to interpretations of ancient myths and writings. Here,
then, is a brief summary: 

Temperature and excess heat. 

The surface temperature of 750 deg K revealed by space probes in the 1960s
came as a great surprise to astronomers, who had expected something modestly
higher than Earth's, corresponding to Venus's smaller distance to the sun.
Such a figure is fully consistent, however, with the theory of a recent origin
for Venus and had been predicted on this basis, but was dismissed as a "lucky
guess." 

The conventional response is to explain Venus's temperature as the result of a
"runaway greenhouse effect." This falls down for a number of reasons: 

With surface pressure 90 times and mass 75 times Earth's, the atmosphere of
Venus has thermal properties comparable to an ocean 3,000 feet deep.
Penetration of solar energy is nowhere near sufficient to produce appreciable
heating to any depth. Further, the high albedo (reflectance), means that only
a minor portion of incident energy gets past the cloud tops to begin with.
Heating at the base of the atmosphere due to solar input alone would be around
6 deg C above freezing. Carbon dioxide, the major constituent of the
atmosphere, is incapable of producing the postulated runaway on its own. It
would require an additional component to "close" the critical 25 %
transparency window that permits reradiation back into space at thermal
wavelengths. Water vapor, the primary candidate, is conspicuously absent.
Methane is a possibility, but puts proponents in the position of confirming
another of Velikovsky's predictions (an atmosphere would be rich in
hydrocarbon gases derived from the atmosphere of Jupiter) that was ridiculed
when first put forward. Even so, the problem remains that solar penetration is
inadequate for any runaway to happen. Probably the most damning for the
greenhouse theory is the data from all of the US and Russian probes showing
that the thermal gradient of the atmosphere is from base to cloud tops, i.e.
the heat source is at the bottom, not outside. In short, the claims that have
been made publicly notwithstanding, the planet is not in thermal equilibrium.
According to the probe data, the emitted surface infrared flux is 40 times
more than enters as sunlight. About 2 percent of the heat at the surface can
be attributed to solar input. Overall, Venus emits 15 percent more energy than
it receives from the sun, implying a heat output 10,000 times greater than
Earth's. Although Venus rotates 243 times more slowly than Earth (58-day dark
period), nightside temperatures are slightly higher than on the day
side--contradicting the notion that the sun is the heat source. Rigorous
mathematical modeling by the thermodynamicist George R. Talbott showed that
given an incandescent state 3,500 years ago as the recent-origin theory
proposes, the cooling curve over that period yields a temperature today
exactly as observed. A solar heating model predicts large-scale atmospheric
circulation in a north-south direction, transporting heat from the equator to
the poles, which should be highly pronounced in view of the planet's slow
rotation. Probe data show no such circulation. On the contrary, the entire
atmosphere is in a state of super east-west rotation 100 times faster than the
surface speed (5 m.p.h equatorial) at all latitudes. (Note. This enormous
super-rotation of the atmosphere is consistent with the idea of evolution from
a giant comet-like body, whose tail wrapped around the planet gravitationally
as Venus slowed into its present orbit, and is still dissipating angular
momentum.) 



Atmospheric Composition 

Argon isotope ratios: Argon 36 is primordial. Proportion should be comparable
to Earths' if Venus is of comparable age. In fact, it is 300-500 times higher.
Argon 40 is a decay product of Potassium 40, and again should be represented
comparably if ages are similar. In fact, it is 15 times lower than Earth's.
Both differences indicate a younger age for Venus. 

Carbon dioxide. For planet hot and rich in hydrocarbons, CO2 should have
decomposed to CO & O2 in billions of years. But there is little CO and no
O2--consistent with an age of a few thousand years only. 

Water vapor is absent, although volcanic outgassing should have supplied
plenty on an ancient planet. The conventional answer is to hypothesize that
the water vapor was photodissociated by solar ultraviolet into oxygen which
recombined with the rocks, and hydrogen which escaped. The "gardening" of
surface rocks needed to absorb the amount of oxygen liberated over billions of
years, however, is unrealistic, and no plausible mechanism has been proposed
to induce it. Also, this theory ignores the fact that photodissociated oxygen
could be expected to recombine into high-level ozone just as it does on Earth,
blocking out the high-energy ultraviolet and terminating the process. 

Sulfuric acid present in the cloud tops but not at the surface. Again, a short
life expectancy due to ultraviolet dissociation would be expected, causing
decomposition in about ten thousand years. 

Motion 

Retrograde rotation is not compatible with the conventional model of accretion
of the Solar System from a rotating nebular disk. 

Surface 

Indications consistent with the proposition of a young terrestrial-type
planet: 

No tectonic plates. 5/6 of Venus is continental crust, 1/6 is shallow basin.
Implication is that processes of major continental fracturing, moving, and
shaping have yet to occur. The surface is dominated by volcanism in the form
of large-scale lava flows flowing up through a thin crust. Impact craters
would have long ago been obliterated if relics from activity billions of years
ago. Viscous creep rates of rock at the temperatures of Venus's surface are
such that the two main uplifted regions--almost certainly volcanic in
origin--should have disappeared if Venus is ancient. With 100,000 volcanic
formations, collapsed rivers, rising chambers, Venus has been described as the
biggest volcano in Solar System. Absence of erosion. The surface is scoured
by superheated, dust-laden, highly corrosive winds, yet the rocks show
relatively sharp, uneroded features--certainly compared to what would be
expected after billions of years. Further, the atmosphere contains both
hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, which would quickly be neutralized by
contact with rocks. The combination of mechanical and chemical erosion should,
over a protracted time, have created a thick soil, or regolith, but no such
feature is found.

Probably "ma rinka le nu da zasti", parsed roughly as "what is
the physical cause of the event/state (there-exists something
(in an unspecified but implied-to-exist metaphysics)) under
unspecified conditions"?  The predicate word "rinka" could be
changed for the other meanings: "krinu" for "what is the
justification...", "nibli" for "what logically implies...",
"gasnu" for "who (agent) causes...", etc.

Ouch.  Here's my best understanding of what that means (ignoring for
the moment that it is nonsensical drivel--at least in Lojban it would
be well-defined, understandable drivel):

Roughly: "it is not the case that (there-exists someone who knows by
unspecified epistemology (indirect-question (what is the physical cause
of the state that something came to exist))), and this is logically
implied by one of the facts (it is not the case that (there-exists a
possessor of enough knowledge and enough thought-skill)), or ([pronoun
bound to the previous fact] is never true), or (the state of knowing
[pro-sentence for earlier predicate] destroys the knowledge-acquirer).

Once again quoting from James Hogan's Web Site....
******************************************************************************

Another aspect that I'm very interested in is hypotheses on minor planets
being ejected from the gas giants. Apparently, in the early 60's, the British
astronomer W.H. McCrea published a study stating that the inner planets
couldn't have formed via the standard textbook accretion model because of
tidal disruption by Jupiter; and R.A. Lyttleton, also British, concluded from
fluid dynamical considerations that Jupiter's core must go unstable and
fission periodically, ejecting excess mass. Again, more background and details
welcome.

If you note that there was an explosion part way down for the rear section.
This tells me that the plane exceeded its speed design specs for the wings and
they tore off, igniting the fuel in the wing tanks...this would agree with a
trajectory pushing 700 mph at terminus. I assume you are referring to the 82
mph initial speed as the stall speed of the 747. With its nose torn off, its
stall speed should be a bit higher. Keep in mind that sea level speed of sound
is 630 mph or so, as I recall... Given an initial forward velocity of the nose
section of any where from 200-400+ knots, at least a portion of this should be
translated by planing effects into downward velocity. A 29 second time to
impact is completely reasonable for the nose section. I agree that it could be
specious for the upwardly climbing rear section, depending on how long the
engines continued to produce thrust...

A jet engine is self powered, self pumped. There should have been plenty of
fuel in the lines between the emergency shutoff valve (if it activated), as
well as in the sump well for the injection manifold, and those bad boys take
at least 30 seconds to rev down. They could easily have kept producing thrust
for at least 10-20 seconds after the time of the initial separation. If the
initial explosion welded the wire harnesses (they travel right by the fuel
tank), then the engines should have kept seeing a closed control circuit and
kept running...Most of the power distribution and control equipment is in the
area around the wing root, so the 747 could have kept running like a chicken
with its head cut off, for at least a little bit.

This is the reason why ejection systems like the F-111 capsule have little
guillotine solenoids to sever the controls harnesses, rather than explosive
charges like the mechanicals have. They don't want any circuitry welding
closed and presenting a normally closed circuit to the plane.

Yes, apparently you're right - Hogan is a Velikovskian.  From his
home page at http://www.global.org/jphogan/index.html, follow the

Being a truck driver requires a basic understanding of physics lest
one flatten fellow travellers.  You're right, this Hogan is no truck
driver; he doesn't have that much understanding.

The calculations of required muscle mass for dinosaurs have been
done many times, and they work out just fine.  To contend otherwise
requires willful ignorance or outright dishonesty.  I especially
like the argument that "no evidence exists for the high-pressure
circulation system...", in the same paragraph with the statement
that "they are all digestive system."  Soft tissue does not
fossilize; the evidence for one is exactly the same as the evidence
for the other: inference.  Honesty requires that if you reject one
of these hypotheses, you must reject both.  To accept slim evidence
that supports your point while rejecting equal or stronger evidence
that does not is the same basic dishonesty of all creationists,
medical quacks, and other crackpots like Velikovsky.

Here's an experiment: he states at the end of the paragraph that
"more information on this is welcome...".  Send him some that
disproves his point (the /real/ muscle mass calculations, for
example).  I'll bet you a day's pay it won't be so welcome that
he'll post it next to his piece, or remove his piece as refuted.

An interesting observation.  I think, however, that there is a significant
difference in attitude.  A central theme in Julian Simon's work is the idea
that 'natural resources' are not a fixed entity, but rather the result of
applying human effort and intellect to the environment in an attempt to
produce some desired good.  This transforms the very nature of the resource
depletion argument, which normally assumes that resources are static
quantities of particular physical materials.

Pournelle , in contrast, simply argues that the supply of those fixed
material resources is much larger than has been assumed.  We can stave of
resource depletion by mining extraterrestrial resources, which are so
abundant that they could supply our current civilization for far longer
spans of time than anyone is seriously worried about.

I also found it interesting.  They carried a similar theme into "Footfall",
in which the world is saved from alien invasion by liberal use of nuclear
technology (for power, spacecraft propulsion and weapons).  If there are any
SF authors more pro-nuclear than these guys, I can't think of them.

Yes, he definitely oversimplifies matters here.  AI devices can do this sort
of thing, but organic minds can't.  Really advanced nanotech could deal with
that limitation (by rewriting neural connections at much higher speeds than
they are normally capable of), but its going to be a long time before we
reach that point.

I'm not sure why you would consider this idea either gratuitous or naive.
It is simply a less developed formulation of the current idea that the mind
is nothing more or less than the product of physical processes in the brain.
There is considerable evidence in support of this view, and a considerable
number of prominent thinkers have adopted it.  Even if you happen to fall in
the opposing camp, I would suggest that it is a mistake to reject it out of
hand.

I suspect the practical discussion of space colonization / industrialization
was a factor as well.  Of course, Pournelle obviously didn't pay enough
attention to the economic aspects of the project, but his treatment of the
engineering involved is better than any of the current work I am familiar
with.

If there is anything we should have learned from quantum mechanics, it is
that the universe is not obliged to conform to human notions of logic.
That's why science is based on experiments, not on philosophy.  Just because
something seems to be illogical, self-contradictory, or otherwise impossible
does not mean that it can't happen.

Modern physical contains all sorts of odd nooks and crannies that seem to
imply that time travel can take place under certain conditions.  Since the
conditions required can not be duplicated in the lab, they will remain
hypothetical for some time to come.  If you prefer to assume that these
predictions will prove false, you are certainly free to do so.

However, it is also perfectly reasonable to expect that these theories are
accurate.  After all, they give accurate predictions for everything we have
been able to observe.  Certainly, they have proven far more reliable than
any human concept of what does or does not make sense.

About Hawking's theory:  I would suggest that anyone who wants to argue with
Stephen Hawking about physics has an obligation to provide a more complete
criticism than saying "that's obviously nonsense".  However, I believe that
Pournelle interpretation of his theory is flawed.  What Hawking actually
said would translate into layman's terms as something like this:

1) An evaporating black hole radiates mass/energy in random configurations.
2) There are no constraints on how the radiated mass/energy is organized.

Therefore:

3) Any combination of matter and energy that is allowed by physical law, and
has a total mass less than that of the black hole, could in principle be
produced by black hole evaporation.

The point Pournelle missed is that all results are not equally likely.
Low-mass elementary particles will form almost all of the matter actually
produced in this fashion.  More massive structures rapidly become
vanishingly unlikely, and a particular complex structure is even more
improbable.  Thus, saying that macroscopic objects can be produced in this
fashion is like saying that all the air molecules in the room could suddenly
rush out the window - true in principle, but it will never actually happen.

Politics is the means by which individuals relate with other individuals in a
society of any size, be it a family, tribe, city, state, nation or world.
Without the individual, society does not exist, yet the individual can exist
just fine without society. The individual is the indivisible, basic, essential
unit of any polity, therefore it follows that the means by which individuals
relate to each other (politics) is entirely dependent on those individuals, not
on the group as a whole. The whole 'group' is a fiction created by the
individuals to improve the means by which individuals relate to one another. It
can be dissolved at any time by the individuals, and individual members are
able to dissasociate themselves from the group at any time they choose, and may
associate with any single member of the group they choose to without the
permission of other members of the group, unless the member of the group being
associated with has previously agreed and continues to agree, to no associate
with individuals that are not members of the group.

Statist group thinking is what is the real doublethink. It is merely a state of
the individual(s) who have attained control over the majority or all of the
other members of the group such that they speak as if speaking for the group,
which is where the ludicrous "We" that royal sovereigns use comes from to refer
to themselves, since they con the rest are merely unthinking members of the
whole. Statism is merely primitive borganistic hive mentality, not true
transhumanism. Statism is post-humanism, anti-humanism, as it denigrates the
individual in favor of the group or the state. Since a state or group cannot
exist without individuals as members, then the group or state can have no
inherent rights, only posessing those which the individuals freely agree to
delegate to it.

Hi All!

This is my first entry.  I am developing a theology that is consistent with
Extropian principles and science as we now understand it.  

Consistant with means not contradicted by science, It does not mean proven by
science.

Is there any existing work in this area?

  IAN: Let's recall again that the plane was

  Not only is that consistent with basic physics, 
  but review the video to see the peaked jet sit 
  on the peak, attain a negative AoA, and then 
  fall. Trying to get around that is futile.
  Your 400-mph jet just does not exist!


>Ian you've made the discovery of a lifetime!! Kites work by magic!!!


  IAN: Mike, what I said is what I quoted from 
  a physics book, how could that be my discovery? 
  Every basic physics book covers the same fact. 
  Your examples show you need to do more research.
  The object with initial horizontal velocity 
  strikes HARDER than the one dropped from rest,
  even as they both strike at THE SAME TIME.
  The horizontal velocity is translated into
  the harder strike, NOT into a faster fall.

  IAN: That's wild speculation. Jet-engine operation

  wind, and thus, to quote an aviation mechanic, "when the 
  engines pitch up the compressors stall and the engine 
  flames out unless laminar airflow is restored rapidly."

  IAN: I guess you didn't know about the witnesses.
  There were over 150 witnesses of a streak of light. 
  Out of 102 that said where it originated, 96 said
  it originated on from the surface of the Earth.
  That's from the still covered-up (but leaked 
  through Aviation Week) NTSB witness report.

  Dozens of witness accounts are available.
  Those that I could place on a map are here: 
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm 

  Witnesses say that the streak left a column of
  white smoke in its path. Solid-rocket fuel gives
  off white smoke, yet burning jet fuel, what the govt
  needs you to believe they saw, yields black smoke.
  Of course when it comes to government claims, most 
  people seem are willing to believe black = white.

  IAN: That didn't happen to PAN AM 103, and it went
  from horizontal to falling without any upward rise.
  The forward velocity translates into a higher velocity
  upon impact, but not a faster rate of fall. From the 
  physics textbook "Elementary Classical Physics": 

     "If one throws an object horizontally and 
     simultaneously drops a second body from 
     rest, the two objects strike a horizontal 
     plane at the same instant. The thrown object 
     strikes the surface with a larger velocity..."

  IAN: It seems you also havn't seen the CIA video.

  IAN: An object climbing upwards falls when it 
  has reached zero velocity. What evidence does 
  the physics-defying rocket-like rise fit? Have 
  you found a flaw in Ed Zehr's analysis which 
  proves that the noseless jet would stall in 
  under 5 seconds? If not, based upon what do
  you make your claim? I guess faith in Govt.

  Edward Zehr's dynamic analysis:
  http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/ZehrGut2.html 
  Zehr's static analysis (scroll to A REALITY CHECK):
  http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a40058.htm 

  The fact is that the CIA video has been abandon
  by 99% of missile-theory critics, since they 
  realize that Ed Zehr is right. It is still 
  accepted by the government and the media,
  who do not have to defend their claims.

  the relative wind, thus, "when the engines pitch up 
  the compressors stall and the engine flames out 
  unless laminar airflow is restored rapidly."

  IAN: That's only because a fuel cloud covers

  or so psi of a centrally source stick of TNT.

  Knowing what would have happened and knowing what

Call for Conference Proposals

BODYMIND: HOLISTIC EXPLORATIONS OF COGNITION, ACTION, AND INTERACTION 
IN
EDUCATION
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
May 1, 1999

Keynote Speakers: David Jardine and David Abram
Modernist views of knowledge that separate mind and body, thought and 
experience, self and other, human and nature, have in recent years 
been challenged by holistic and embodied schools of thought across 
areas as diverse as phenomenology, performance studies, the cognitive 
sciences, narrative, feminist theories, deep ecology, cultural 
studies, Buddhism, and queer theory. This conference will explore the 
implications of such scholarship for education. What kinds of 
frameworks will help educators to conceptualize and embody the 
languaging announced by holistic and enactivist understandings of 
cognition? How do views of knowledge as dynamic and enactive shift the 
roles and responsibilities of those engaged with teaching, learning, 
teacher education, curriculum, and educational research?
Our keynote presenters were chosen with these questions in mind. David 
Abram is an ecophilosopher and author of  The Spell of the Sensuous 
(Vintage).   David Jardine is Associate Professor of Education at the 
University of  Calgary and the author of "To dwell with a boundless 
heart": Essays in curriculum, hermeneutics and the ecological 
imagination (Peter Lang).
Conference organizers welcome discussion of works-in-progress and 
other research projects from graduate students, faculty and others 
interested in the conference theme.  Interdisciplinary, provocative 
and creative inquiries/ presentations that integrate and critique 
educational theory and practice are encouraged. The conference format 
will be similar to that of a colloquium: presenters will be encouraged 
to share their work in a safe, collaborative, and interactive 
environment.
Details regarding proposal submissions follow. Please note that 
registration information and fees will be mailed at a later date. 
 Suggestions for accommodations in Vancouver will also be sent to 
presenters upon request.
Conference Organizers are doctoral students in the Faculty of 
Education at the University of British Columbia:
Johnna Haskell, Department of Curriculum Studies
Brent Hocking, Department of Educational Studies
Warren Linds, Department of Language Education
Conference Proposals:
Individual and group presentations will be accepted. Please prepare a 
one-page typed proposal that includes the following:
1.	Name(s), institutional affiliation(s),  e-mail and postal 
address(es), and telephone numbers of presenter(s)
2.	Title of presentation
3.	Presentation Format (Individual or Group, Experiential, 
Performance)
4.	Description of presentation including goals and theoretical 
framework. In the spirit of the conference theme, what is the passion 
that motivates your work/presentation?  Include a question that you 
would like to discuss with the audience.
5.	Abstract for conference program (up to 50 words)
6.	Any special needs (overhead will be available; otherwise 
participants are responsible for arranging other AV equipment).

Any questions should be directed to Warren Linds 
(wlinds@interchange.ubc.ca).
E-mail proposals are strongly encouraged and should be sent to Brent 
Hocking (whocking@interchange.ubc.ca).  Proposals may also be sent via

Especially fascinating and rewarding is Jim Schnabel's wonderful new book
FOREVER YOUNG: SCIENCE AND THE SEARCH FOR IMMORTALITY, London: Bloomsbury,
1998.  The first half is an enthralling New Yorker-style essay on the
embattled quests by Drs Jim Rogers and Pat McGreer, and eventually Dennis
Selkoe (who might get a Nobel for this work, I guess), in tracking down the
ways in which beta amyloids do their dirty work.  

Jim Schnabel wrote several absolutely delightful earlier books about fields
at the margins of science and lunacy, which are carefully not cited
anywhere in the PR for this latest one, notably DARK WHITE about UFO
abduction claims and REMOTE VIEWERS about military and CIA experiments in
psi/spying. 

He also wrote an early New Scientist paper (19 June 1993, pp. 22-6) on
Rogers' theory that Alzheimers' is basically a result of massive
auto-immune inflammation of the brain, an `arthritis of the brain', which
might be halted by judicious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and eventually by a targeted drug like those that in the lab inhibit the
injurious cleaving of the precursor APP to yield beta amyloid. 

Two such drugs start human clinical trials this year in Athena and Lilly
labs.  `If everything goes well,' writes Schnabel, `larger-scale trials
will start [2000].  And, let's hope, a drug to prevent amyloid accumulation
- and thus, perhaps, Alzheimer's disease - will be available at pharmacies
around 2004' (p. 79).

No cause for despair in all this!

Velikovsky's work surfaces from time to time in certain circles, but the
fundamental problems with it are seldom mentioned by his supporters.  They
like to argue about this or that particular aspect of his theories, but they
completely ignore the real reasons why the scientific establishment
considers his a complete quack.

Velikovsky frequently advanced extravagant theories about cataclysmic events
without the faintest hint of how they could have happened.  His work is long
on poetic description and mythological references, and very short on
calculations, numbers, and testable predictions.  To mention just a few very
serious objections:

1) His theory of the formation of the inner solar system has Venus being
ejected from Jupiter as a result of a near-miss by another massive object.
But to lift that much mass out of Jupiter's gravity well would require far
more energy than any conceivable planetary process could provide (if I
remember the numbers correctly, the entire energy output of the sun would
not be sufficient).

1a) Where exactly did we find a large mass of solid rock in Jupiter, anyway?
Anything that was ripped off of a gas giant should be made up almost
exclusively of hydrogen, with a seasoning of other gasses.

2) He then has Venus careening about the inner system in a manner completely
inconsistent with the Newtonian laws of motion.  It magically sheds vast
amounts of energy at just the right moment to allow it to settle into a
nearly-circular orbit.

3) During its trip, Venus manages to have two close encounters with Earth.
The first one stops the Earth's rotation, while the second one starts it
going again.  Need I point out that such an event would produce mountains of
unmistakable evidence?

3a) This supposedly happened only a few thousand years ago, so as to account
for the Biblical account of the sun standing still in the sky for a day.
Need I point out that all macroscopic life on Earth would have been rendered
extinct by such an event?

3b) Oh, and somehow, Earth got re-started with exactly the same period of
rotation as before.

3c) And somehow both Earth and Mars retained their nearly-circular orbits.

Now, all of this comes from just a couple of chapters of one book.  So far
as I can tell, the bogon flux remains at a similarly high level through the
rest of Velikovsky's work.  Is anyone really surprised that it is thoroughly
discredited?

A few comments on the material that was originally quoted:

> With surface pressure 90 times and mass 75 times Earth's, the atmosphere
of
> Venus has thermal properties comparable to an ocean 3,000 feet deep.
> Penetration of solar energy is nowhere near sufficient to produce
> appreciable heating to any depth.

Sounds impressive, but what it really means is that the author doesn't know
anything about atmospheric science.  What these numbers really show is that
it takes a long time for any change in solar energy output to have an effect
on the planet's surface temperature.  That doesn't tell us anything at all
about what surface temperature to expect.

Why are we talking about 'candidates'?  Anyone with a telescope can see that
Venus' atmosphere is in fact opaque to visible light.  The last I heard, the
composition of Venus' atmosphere had been measured to a pretty high degree
of accuracy.  Plug those numbers into a greenhouse simulation, and you get a
good agreement with the observed surface temperature value.  So what problem
are we trying to explain?

Apparently, the author doesn't realize that this is exactly the result that
the greenhouse model predicts.

Again, that's exactly what the greenhouse model would predict.

The kinds of energies Velikovsky throws around would be enough to melt the
surface of Venus to a depth of several hundred miles (we'll ignore the fact
that if it was ripped out of Jupiter's core it would have been completely
molten to start with).  Bleeding that much heat off into space would take
several tens of millions of years, even without a thick atmosphere in the
way.  The surface now should be thousands of degrees, not hundreds.

The rest of it is equally vacuous - it is the sort of thing that someone who
doesn't really grasp the underlying science would come up with.  If anyone
wants more info on a specific point, let me know.  On the whole, I think the
entire topic is not worth the time it takes to argue about it.

It seems (if my logic is working correctly this morning) that the term 1/0
would not only denote an indeterminate answer, but that answer would be
indeterminate because there are no choices.

In this sense, it would be more appropriate for this "God equation" to be
0/0, because there can be no choice if there are no choices.

I have to side with Ian, however, considering that we've created choices,
and therefore there ARE choices.

  While 5 pilots saw the "rocket" or "flare,"

  But his account gives a time stamp, and notice
  that the exploding area (which is no the nose)

>  IAN: Mike, what I said is what I quoted from 
>  a physics book, how could that be my discovery? 
>  Every basic physics book covers the same fact. 

Permit me to inject a few points before departing this conversation:

1) Every basic physics book oversimplifies. That's why they call it "basic"
physics.

2) The independence of horizontal and vertical motion is only true in
airless environments.
Furthermore, the notion of "horizontal" is a local one, as is "vertical".

3) Aircraft pilots trade speed for altitude all the time. They are usually
taught to do it some time in the first 20 hours of dual flight training.
  They couldn't do it if the "basic physics" notion about h and v speeds
were true for aerodynamic cases.

4) The term "stall" does not refer to an aircraft having zero airspeed, nor
to an aircraft having zero speed over ground.
"Stall" is a technical term which refers to a significant, usually sharp
change in L/D (the lift-to-drag ratio), typically as the result of
excessive angle of attack--the angle between the midline of the lifting
surfaces and the airflow approaching the craft.

5) An aircraft the size and shape of a 747 probably gets significant lift
from its fuselage ("body lift") at high angles of attack.

6) The commonly-employed equation for subsonic aerodynamic drag is usually
rendered as (apologies for the poor ascii-isms):
   D = 1/2 ( p * Cd * A * v**2 ).
p is "rho", the density of air, and it varies with weather and altitude; Cd
is the drag coefficient (and a bit of a fudge factor),
A is area, either cross-sectional or wetted, depending on what you are
using for Cd, and v is 'velocity' (more properly, airspeed).

'Terminal velocity' (so-called) is where D - F = 0, F being the force of
gravity on the object in question, and D being drag-in-the-upward-direction
(this terminal velocity calculation assumes "drag" is the same thing as
"lift", and that there are no remaining side forces on the object).

Figure out F, plug in the desired v and p, and you can calculate what Cd *
A would need to be.

If you figure that the engines were still on, add their thrust into the
force calculation: D - (F + T) = 0; this lets the Cd * A be higher for
the same velocity.

7) There's a popular number called the "ballistic coefficient", computed as
 w / ( Cd * A ), where w is weight. A big ballistic coefficient means the
object in question acts more like a cannonball; a small one means it acts
more like a feather.

8) Handwaving about the plane being a parachute is not the same thing as
crunching the numbers and estimating ballistic coefficient.

My understanding of the greenhouse effect is that the atmosphere acts like a
diode. A one way valve.  Radiation (visible light) is able  to pass thru
(incoming) and heats up the surface...which then radiates heat (outgoing) but
which is unable to leave due to the atmosphere being opaque to infared
wavelengths.

So given that....how is Venus suffering from "runaway greenhouse"?  Given an
opaque atmosphere how is it getting ANY heat?

Just wundering...

My understanding of "incandescent" is " so hot as to glow"....

That would kinda tend to melt things I suppose. 

 So how did the "thermodynamicist George R.Talbott " manage to go so far
wrong?  Methinks that a molten glob would give off lots of gas...perhaps from
which an atmosphere formed? How long would it take for the "thousands of
degree" surface to crust over? ( Isn't earths center molten)? How long does it
take for a crust to form on lava? Isn't that crust then an insulator? What are
the relative thicknesses of Earth and Venus's crusts?

Seems like this happened once before...

I asked a question...of course it wasn't a politically correct
question...something about how is it that dinosaurs got so big...

Of course we ALL know that dino's are huge....fossils and all...so questions
about them shouldn't be asked...it's not "scientific" I guess?

And it happened again...

Sorry...I didn't realize that there were certain subjects that were taboo.

Oh Well

Wow!  Thanks for bringing that up Jean-Francois. I have been a fan of A.A.
Attansio since reading Radix way back in 1983.  A book that was way ahead of its
time, and many ways still is.  I agree with completely on your assessment of AAA
and consider his writing transhumanist/extropian in every meaningful sense of the
word(s).

There is a somewhat casual fan site of AAA at:

http://www.qed.net/rebnj/aaa.html

For those who are interested, I recently added a page to my web site featuring
several extropian books with links to authors and in some cases full-text online!

Michael and several others correctly disagreed.

Perhaps an example will suffice.

      "If one throws a glider horizontally and
      simultaneously drops a second body from
      rest, the two objects strike a horizontal
      plane at the same instant."

Hmmm. no. 

A 747 is not "an object" it is an active agent in the air. 

This discussion, treating a computer graphic reconstruction as a "video" 
and interpreting what is in fact a news report is futile.

In absentia a real video, we can't exclude either possibility.

There is one participant in this businness who does have an interest in 
what accoutn is accepted as real: Boeing. Accepting the explanation that 
the design of the kerosene tanks is such that with low fuel levels they 
can explode places liability onto Boeing. What did they say about this? 
Has the design been modified? (i hope so)

.5*mv^2 is the formula for kinetic energy, and mv is the formula for

Give me a break!  I never said the topic was taboo.  I merely implied
that you better have some science if you want to claim that evolution is
wrong, or dinosaurs never existed, or fossils aren't really from animal
bones.  If you are unwilling or unable to discuss this scientifically,
don't blame me!

And now that you mention it, yes you do keep bringing this claim up that
dinosaurs never existed.  You always quote some other site or person and
never take responsibility for the claim.  Whenever someone demands
evidence or asks for your personal position, you dodge the questions and
start a political or meta argument.

Do you believe this claim?  Why do you keep posting it to the List?
Where do dinosaur fossils come from, if not from dinosaurs?  If nobody
challenged your postings, where would you go with them, and what kind of
conclusion are you trying to lead us toward?

If horizontal velocity translates into vertical
velocity such that it will allow an object to fall
faster than an object dropped in a vacuum, as some
here suggest, then why did the wing from PAN AM 103 
(which didn't shoot upwards and thus fell with all 
its horizontal velocity) not fall faster than the 
rate of fall from zero velocity in a vacuum? 

The wing from PAN AM 103 fell from 31,000 to 0 
in around 46.5 seconds, yet an object dropped 
from 31,000 would fall 34,750 feet in that 
same time period in a vacuum. What gives?
Why didn't the much-touted translation work?

See: http://www.corazon.com/103page43wreckanaly3.html 

The wing has the most aerodynamically favorable shape 
of just about any part of the plane, so it had every-
thing in its favor. So, why didn't it fall faster?
This nulls the argument against my initial post,
for there's no reason to believe Galileoian
law would be bypassed by horizontal velocity.

Uh...no.

A wing is optimized for lift.  An "ogiveal" shape is optimized for rapid
transit thru a fluid medium.. That's why the nose of a large (subsonic)
aircraft , or sub,..is shaped similarly to that of a bomb...or raindrop.

A wing is shaped vaugely like a leaf.  Recall what a leaf does when dropped?

Actually I do beleive that dinosaurs are pretty much as they are portrayed to
be.  Big walking appetites that lived millions of years ago.

I still can't quiet understand the size differential between those early
dino's...the early (giant) mammals...and today's critters.  Why should
giantism have been the norm (?) then as compared to now?  There must have been
a LOT of giants given the small amount of critters that manage to get
fossilized...else we would have little or no record.

 Is it true that strength increases as the square and weight as the cube?  I
beleive that is why Howard Hughe's flying boat....The Spruce Goose...was at
the tippy tip of the envelope for large aircraft of it's day, until the
materials used in AirCraft production had improved allowing such large
aircraft as the C5 and the 747.  Wasn't this strength of weight ratio one of
the reasons that Zepplins lost their dominance?

That seems odd then that earlier critters had better materials than present
critters.  Of course that's unlikely.  So what IS the reason?  The site I
refrenced suggested questions concerning a gravitationl difference then and
now.  Of course that's crazy.

I'm puzzled...and like a dog with a bone...I keep chewing.

Tabor returned the laser pistol to a thigh pocket, and a flimmer of regret

This is true for objects thrown in a vacuum which are affected by only
one external force (gravity, vertical) beyond the initial impulse of
being thrown.  It is also true for objects thrown in air if the two
objects are aerodynamically neutral and identical in size, shape, and
mass, for example, two billiard balls.  It is even approximately true for
rifle billets (one fired horizontally, the other dropped by hand) in air.



But in the general case of two identical objects with significantly
directional aerodynamic characteristics, one being thrown horizontally,
and the other dropped from rest at the same height, they will not
necessarily, and almost never will, strike the same lower horizontal
plane at the same instant, because aerodynamic forces may act to
reinforce or oppose the gravitational force which is causing both objects
to fall.



Imagine you are piloting a power boat cruising under power at 20 knots. 
Now turn the engine off.  The boat continues to move forward in the same
direction, and begins to slow, due to mainly to the drag of moving thru
the water.  But the boat can still be steered by moving the rudder from
its neutral position.  The boat can even be swung around so it ends up
travelling in the exact opposite of the original direction, even though
no fresh energy from the motor is applied.  When the rudder is used this
way to make the boat shift direction, some of the original momentum and
kinetic energy is expended in making the turn, because the boat has more
drag when the rudder is held to one side.

Forces (or any vectors) at right angles to each other (orthogonal
vectors) can be treated as independent.  A vertical force does not affect
horizontal motion per se.  But aerodynamic forces with both horizontal
and vertical components will generally arise when a moving airfoil
interacts with the air through which it travels.  A flying airplane is a
good example of this.

When my uncle built a series of windmill-powered yachts, he did quite a 
bit of research into efficient blades: it was fascinating. The best shape 
turned out to be a stretched out egg: big fat radius at the hub 
feathering out to a thin tip on this 12m diameter propellor. Then under 
the water things changed again, dropping down into this very different 
set of Reynold's numbers. You should have seen the kevlar-sail racing set 
when we drove up the harbour straight into the wind ;-)

best,
tim

How about in the UK (as repotted on BBC radio) where they are proposing 
to incarcerate people who might commit a crime in the future.

In particular, for having a personality disorder. My jaw dropped.

The polly was saying 
"in the past people with personality disorders have gone on to hurt 
people and we cannot let this happen again"
+
"we cannot wait for the science on this one"

oh right.

There is massive overlap between the personality disorders themselves 
(comorbidity), and serious (Axis 1 in DSM) disorders such as depression 
and anxiety, as well as with normal personality (the best predictor of 
personality disorder apart from a clinical diagnosis is simply  unusually 
high levels of emotionality (Neuroticism).

Essentially, this guy is suggesting that the government be given cart 
blanch to imprison around half of the population. And even then, not on 
the basis of evidence of misdeeds, but by opinions about internal motives 
and processes - talk about an invitation for witch hunting.

if you were as discerning in researching the possible arguments that would null
your own statements....

As your own citation shows, there was thought to be the possibility that the
wing could itself (as separated from the rest of the aircraft structure, and
thus posessing a different center of gravity than a plane with just its nose
section missing) have flown AS MUCH AS ONE MILE from the point of separation,
and back, before impacting.

There is no such thing as "most aerodynamically favorable" since different
aerodynamic effects are useful for different purposes.  In the case of PAN AM
103, the wing section was not loaded down by the whole fuselage anymore, so with
a very small wing loading was able to remain in the air longer than normally
possible, especially considering that since it no longer had loads on it but its
own, it was well balanced for developing a decent unguided glide slope. In the
case of the TWA 800 situation, the wing was heavily loaded in the rear, which
caused its initial pitch up and eventual stallout at 17000 feet. The stallout
would have flamed out any engines that remained running at that point, and the
wreck would have pitched over into a steep dive, accellerating to the point of
exceeding the wing loading specs as displayed in the CIA video, whereupon the
final explosion took place.

If I were you. I would focus much more on what actually caused the initial
explosion that separated the nose from the aircraft. The kapton wire insulation
theory seems completely plausible to me (I had the opportunity to witness
several incidents of kapton insulated wire harnesses blowing up like thermite,
when it was used on the landing gear lighting systen on the F-15 Eagle). If
kapton was in fact used in the fuel tank wiring as alleged, then the case is all
but solved in my mind. If I were you, I'd get extremely agitated toward the FAA
and ask them why they continued to insist that kapton insulation was safe for
use in commercial airliners after at least ten years of the military branches
concluding that it was unsafe for flying and who gradually phased that type of
wiring out of use over a couple years. Airliners get far more use in flight
hours than military planes. It is a complete wonder that there aren't MORE TWA
800 type disasters than there are.

Even today the FAA insists that kapton insulation is safe.....

Um...lemme point out that while I greatly enjoyed most of the books on the

dense.  The same goes for most of Ayn Rand's stuff.

Um...no problem with the rest of this, but...
The greenhouse model predicts that the surface emits 40 times
the amount that it gets?  Where does it generate this energy from?

That brings to mind another nation which did similar....the USSR I beleive.?
Didnt they have massive imprisonments of "mental patients"?

Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm sure someone will), but all the 'time
travel' phenomena that I've heard about are to do with
things(information) apparently moving faster than the speed of light.
The interpretation that they are moving backwards in time is solely due
to a refusal to believe that something can travel at FTL speeds, as this
suggests the currently accepted view of relativity may not be entirely
correct.

Hmm, the closest thing to an extropian theology would probably be
Tipler's Omega Point theory, which however is in serious trouble now
due to the results suggesting an open universe (but at least it is a
theology falsifiable by science). Teilhard de Chardin might be seen as
a similar attempt from the other side, although in his case his
paleontology is very dated.

They are actually suggesting incarcerating people indefinitely, without
trial, for having a personality disorder which may, or may not, cause
the person to be a danger to society.

Two questions:
1.  Define 'personality disorder'
2.  Define 'danger to society'

This is a gross breach of human rights, and seems another step on the
road to turning Britain into a police state.  The recent Criminal
Justice Act gave the police the right to arrest people for just about
anything (Illegal Assembly: an unauthorised gathering of persons
numbering more than 1)

TELESPHERES by F.M. Esfandiary (1977)

Someone once described this book as " Brave New World without the guilt ". I
hasten to add : and without the grammar either. It's not that Esfandiary has a
bad grammar (though he does) : it's that he virtually doesn't have one. And
given how essential grammar is to the logical structuring of one's thought,
his is in extremely poor shape.

This short volume (about 160 pages) is not a book but a catalogue, a list of
items.

Some of those items are completely obscure, because left unexplained. The
words are just dropped there for their feel-good potential, but no elucidation
is given : Esfandiary tries to avoid " overexplaining ", which he considers a
mark of insecurity (p7). Other items are described in the most cursory,
telegraphic fashion, in conformity with Esfandiary's quest for " crispness "
and " maximum economy of words " (p7). The items may be connected by commas or
dashes, but often they are simply listed without any punctuation : " we can at
last reach out to the infinite abundance of the solar system the galaxy the
universe " ; or " our planet will be cleaner safer richer roomier lovelier
than ever ".

Whatever actual sentences the book actually contains look more like students'
notes or tabloid prose (" Massive deposits of minerals on all continents yet
to be tapped ") than the articulate expression of logical thought. At one
point (p74), Esfandiary even embeds a dozen subordinate clauses just for the
fun of it. On the same page, a subject in the plural (" breakthroughs ") has a
verb in the singular (" is "). What was he saying page 8 ? " There is no room
for sloppiness ". Hmm. All these flaws are probably due to the fact that the
book was written in a hurry, since Esfandiary considers that " any book that
takes more than a few months to write is not worth doing " (p8 ; didn't he
mean " hours " ?). My guess is that he is prey to what Ayn Rand calls the
anti-effort mentality (*he* wouldn't spend a whole decade writing a 1000 page
novel), and that he doesn't want to take the trouble of actually thinking.

So don't read this book for arguments or references. " Ideas ", if his slogans
qualify, are included more for their evocative value than for anything having
to do with their truth or practicality. Esfandiary is a master at coining
neologisms, from " Up winger ", an ingenious metaphoric phrase to characterize
people with a dynamic vision who neither consider themselves right-wingers not
left-wingers ; to " telespheres ", which is left undefined in the book, though
one guesses it has something to do with being somewhere else than where one
has been or should be or is actually doing something. Other neologisms include
phaseining, transing, cybernated, rapidgrowth, antifuture, blackholing,
nonflesh, unicom, mobilia, planetization, etc. See the Lextropicon for more
details.

The main theme of the book seems to be that we have just emerged from the "
primal/feudal/industrial " stage of civilization (not a sequence but a package
deal : obviously, the term feudal is used in a metaphoric sense for is
pejorative connotations) and entered what we might call the Heraclitean stage-
a stage in which everything is in flux, everyone is " born and reborn everyday
" (jacket) and the mind seems to dissipate into Brownian motion.

In such a context, Esfandiary's advice boils down to : Never swim in the same
river twice ! If you've been there before, don't go there ! Completely uproot
yourself from all possible contexts- geographical (" translive ", as opposed
to living in a particular place), national (be a " universal ", as opposed, I
guess, to being an American or a Frenchman ) and social (be a " universal
parent ", i.e. consider all children as yours, be involved with many people,
break all family ties and stop " fixating " on " one set of parents " (p86)).
Communities and habitations themselves have to be " instant " (p77).

What the psychological consequences of this thorough uprooting of the
individual will be, he doesn't seem to consider. He does acknowledge that the
consensus of the psychological community is that " a close unbroken
relationship with a single mother [is] indispensable to the healthy
development of the child " (p88), but rejects this dependence as an
intolerable man-made condition, not a corollary of human nature. His reasoning
is precisely that it's bad to have parents in the first place because of the
eventual trauma of losing them. Why, losing a friend, a house or even one's
personal library can also be very traumatic. So should we also do without
those things ?

Everything in Esfandiary's jittery universe becomes delocalized, and all
familiar concepts mutate by acquiring the " tele " prefix : teleducation,
telefarming, teleconcerts, telemanagement, teledemocracy, telebanking,
teleconomics, etc. What these concepts seem to have in common (though most are
left in a conceptual blur) is that you're not physically present where the
action takes place, or something like that. " Telegenesis " for instance is
procreation by " men and women who live far away from one another and who may
never even have met " (p83). (It's even more telespheric if those people are
not even from the same time !)

If " overexplanation " is a vice Esfandiary studiously avoids, overconfidence
isn't. He quotes a leading gerontologist as saying that " by the end of this
century the aging puzzle will have been solved " (is that Dr. Bernard Strehler
still aroud ?). He also believes fusion will be completely non-polluting
(p77), but I'd rather believe Pournelle on this point (" fusion is cleaner
than fission power systems, but it is not that much cleaner ", A Step Farther
Out p324).

A problem with the book is that Esfandiary is obviously economically and
politically illiterate (what do you expect of someone who rejects education
and diplomas ?). The fact that he considers himself " apolitical " is the
first indication of this- neither left nor right, neither capitalistic nor
socialistic (p76). How can you have no position on what activities are
legitimate government ones ? The cause in Esfandiary's case is that he doesn't
even seem to make a distinction between public and private spending ! His
explanation for the continued existence of poverty is some areas of the globe
is not lack of ecomic freedom in those areas, but the fact that governments
spend too much on armaments and (among other things) " car and truck factories
" ! (p75 ; an indication of the sloppiness of the book's construction is that
exactly the same " argument " is repeated p118, though the car and truck
factories are now omitted.) 

Though he claims to be neither a socialist nor a capitalist, Esfandiary does
advocate central planning, probably at an international level (p74). He even
praises the computer as the key to the feasability of such central planning ("
Computers enable us for the first time to have a monitored economy. Computers
make it possible for the first time to have a monitored economy. " p115
(Esfandiary doesn't quite grasp the relevance of pronouns to making one's
style crisp.)). And how " apolitical " is the provision of " an automatic
minimum living expense for everyone " (p119) ?

So it's not only Brave New World, but also 1984 without the guilt.

Another blatant dictatorial measure Esfandiary advocates is the complete
suppression of reproductive freedom by the licensing of parenthood according
to genetic, psychiatric and financial considerations. To have a baby, you
would have to go through the same kind of bureaucratic procedure as you now do
to adopt one, except it wouldn't be bureaucratic because everything is
telespheric, so, you see

Other objectionable aspects of the book are its opposition to
industrialization (an obsolete relic of the feudal age which causes pollution,
unenmployment, ugliness and decay, among other evils (p76)) ; and to
institutionalized education (which can't be right, because you have to be
physically present where the education takes place and the process is not
instantaneous- so it's anti-telespheric to the extreme).

*Telespheres* is nothing but an accumulation of flash-cards that may at best
provide pleasant strokes to an out-of-focus extropian reader (" Immortality ?
Abundance ? Yah ! Yah ! "). It is not argumentative but exhortative, like an "
empowerment " tape to listen to when you sleep. But its essential vacuity and
mindlessness make it a complete waste of time. So just be one step beyond
Esfandiary, according to whom " the only readers [today] are skimmers " :
don't read him- that's the ultimate, up wing, telespheric form of skimming and
anti-education ; or just read the title and move-on- that's flow, man !

(If you do want to get a copy of this book, though, I'm willing to trade mine.
But be quick, I might have burnt it any time.)

Now since I do recognize what is supposed to be the positive element in this
book (its forward-looking, pro-technology, dynamic vision), I believe we might
find a replacement of a higher intellectual caliber in a recently published
book, *The Future and Its Enemies* " by Reason editor and Forbes columnist
Virginia Postrel ". It's in the latest Laissez-Faire Books catalogue, and it
seems to be an argumentative equivalent of Esfandiary's manifesto. Does
anybody have any more information about it ?

Sincerely,

Jean-Francois Virey,
Douai, France.

As far as I know, it has mutated (except for some new ageish holdovers
that fervently believe in literal holograms) into the distributed
model of memory storage - memories are stored as distributed patterns
of synaptic strengths across the brain, just like in artificial neural
networks.

Some information is doubtless stored as dynamical states of some kind,
but as it becomes part of long term memory it becomes more and more
stable, most likely due to structureal changes of the brain. Working
memory is perhaps dynamical, intermediate memory probably very
flexible synapses and chemical states, long term memory morphological
change.

People who are in coma are usually in a bad physical condition, when
they wake up they will have to face whatever brought them into a coma,
and I wouldn't be surprised that just lying in a coma might induce
changes in the brain blood circulation that are deleterious. So I
don't think those psychological changes are strong support for the
dynamic storage model. 

There are plenty of people who have had no brain activity for a while
(due to cold surgery, near-drowning in cold water or coma), and they
don't lose more than the memories just before the accident/surgery
(besides other complications, of course).

Yes. It fits well with current discussions of metamemory, search
strategies and the tip-of-the-tounge phenomenon. We don't know how it
works yet, but it seems that there are systems important for retrieval
separate from encoding.

I think someone misunderstood Hawking here. I think the original idea
was the problem of naked singularities, where I think Hawking (and
others) have pointed out that they make physics indeterminate - if you
have a naked singularity, the time evolution of physics is no longer
defined. Pink elephants jumping out from the singularity cannot be
ruled out. Which is why a lot of people want cosmic censorship.

Interesting. I read the book, and HATED it. This is most unusual, and
I was fascinated by the experience.

My problem with it was that AAA did something that is in my opinion
unforgivable: he had a great idea (no, many great ideas!), a big,
interesting plot, and some very deep philosophical questions with no
obvious answers. And he killed the story. The first chapters are
indeed brilliant, introducing a very dynamical setting, the characters
and a tricky basic philosophical question (do we want Maya or
not?). But then AAA runs into the usual problem when dealing with
superintelligent posthumans and their plots, namely that they are so
hard to describe and understand that the author has to simplify things
- and he ends up dumbing down the story. Most of the novel is really a
fantasy novel in a transhuman setting, admittedly with some very fun
and fresh ideas. In the last pages he does a completely unbelievable
Hollywood ending. Arrgh! 

OK, I'm more of a hard sf reader, but I also enjoyed David Zindells
epic mixtures of sf and mythic fantasy. What irritates me is that
instead of realizing the impossibility of handling the metahuman plans
in the story and instead describe it from a merely transhuman point of
view, he ended up dumbing down the great superintelligent plots to
heroes vs. villains, usually doing quite stupid things.

I think this is very individual; I can read a novel just for its ideas
even if the plot, characterization and other literary qualities are
bad. But of course, we should all try to find those rare novels that
are great in all aspects.

If something can move FTL, then relativity is obviously not correct in
the first place. The reason FTL is dismissed in relativity (besides
the impossibility of accelerating beyond c) is that it would
completely mess up causality, which generally is/was regarded as a bad
thing. If you buy Novikov's principle of self-consistency or something
similar, then this might not be a serious problem after all -
causality gets weird and loopy, but not inconsistent. 

However, "time travel" in various forms can be done without FTL. One
example would be wormholes, which are allowable solutions to general
relativity (even if their physical possibility remains unknown). With
wormholes you can move to a distant time and/or space without going
FTL in your local frame. The same problems with causality might
emerge, but again quantum effects such as the Visser build up of
virtual particle or Novikov's principle might keep physics sane.

Hmm, interesting. I've avoided Attanasio so far because I was under the
impression that he(?) wrote simply fantasy pretending to be far-future
novels, and I'm not big on non-technical speculative fiction. (Yes, it's
kind of silly to judge an author before reading him, but OTOH you
somehow need to make a choice on what to read.) I think I'll now give
him a try.

BTW, _The Great Explosion_ has recently come into print again, I just
ordered a copy. My understanding is that it's a (very funny) political
book with strong anarchist/libertarian leanings. We'll see.

Now, _Inherit the Stars_ is a fine piece of hard SF and perhaps the most
suspenseful book I've ever read, but I fail to see what's supposed to be
of particular extropian interest about it. If we're talking Hogan,
_Voyage From Yesteryear_ (just re-issued by Baen) as a Libertarian
utopia would fit the bill better.

FTL does not depend on _accelerating_ beyond c.  A constant acceleration
of less than c would result in travel at faster than the speed of light

Problems with causality/wormholes are due to the 'space/time continuum'
- an artifact of relativity theory.

I think you misunderstood me. If your spaceship accelerates at 1 G, a
classical calculation would say that after one year you would travel
faster than c. However, in relativity (and as evidenced in particle
accelerators) even a constant acceleration doesn't lead to a velocity
greater than c. What happens is that the mass of the accelerated
object increases as 1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2) and the energy needed to
accelerate it to a few percent higher velocity diverges.

What do you mean by this? The same problem would occur in a discrete
spacetime, such as a cellular automaton.

The energy needed to accelerate it from it's _starting_ point increases,
but not the energy it needs to accelerate itself.
An object/vessel which is capable of generating it's own thrust will not
need to output more power to maintain a constant acceleration the
further it gets from it's origin.

True. But an observer sitting at the origin will not see it pass c,
and neither will any other observer moving in an intertial frame with
a relative velocity to the origin less than c. A spaceship
accelerating at constant acceleration (as measured by the crew) will
describe a hyperbolic path in a Loretnz diagram; it will never break
c.

Humerous, but contradictory on its face. Not what? Not different from
who? If everyone else is an individual, which individual is he not
different from, since he can't be not different from all of them?

no it would not. You would approach c, but never pass it, even to any
outside observers. You can have two objects moving just below c in
opposite directions as outside observers see it, but they will still
appear to each other as separating at just under c.

I am increasingly of the opinion that even though time travel is
theoretically possible through wormholes, in practice I think that the
amount of time it takes to make use of such travel will waste any time
gained in traveling into the past, then back to your original locality
in space. I doubt that it will ever be more than a laboratory curiosity.
It does not matter whether you travel from the other side of the
wormhole back through normal space, or wait until the wormhole can be
spun down to travel back to the original local frame at an earlier time.
The time gained will be lost again....in this way causality can be
conserved while allowing specific FTL loopholes like that....

no, each additional mph requires greater and greater amounts of energy
to acheive.

Yes it will because as any object approaches c, the object begins to
increase in mass, thus posessing greater inertia. This is an
electromagnetic based intertial resistance. It will require greater
thrust to accelerate the same amount, and depending on the type of
propulsion you use, the performance of the drive may be decreased as it
approaches c as well. This is not unique. We have the same problem with
jets approaching the sound barrier. Jets can pass the sound barrier
because they are not made of air. Matter cannot pass the light barrier
because all matter is, well, matter.

Exactly.  It will never appear to pass c (either in the original
inertial frame or in a Lorentz diagram), but this does not mean it is
not travelling ftl relative to it's start point.

What was the original point?

Huh? This seems to be a contradiction, how can something move FTL
relative to a point when in that point's frame it is moving sublight?

Of this discussion, or the example?

I see.  I don't think I have an opinion about this.  Eyewitness accounts are
notoriously unreliable, but so are government news stories.  I do find it
hard to believe that the FAA crash investigators (who are not answerable to
either the CIA or the military) would ignore something like that.

Michael M. Butler covered the aerodynamics pretty well in his last post, so
I won't repeat him here.  I suggest you do some research on the topic - any
book on aerodynamics or piloting should cover these topics.

There is some truth to this, but again you oversimplify.  A very sharp climb
might cause the engines to flame out, especially if the plane stalls at the
top of the climb.  A rapid descent will not - depending on the engine
design, it is even possible for them to flame out in the climb and then
re-light during the descent without human intervention.

No, it isn't.  Fuel-air explosions are capable of destroying bunkers, tanks,
and other armored targets that would be totally unaffected by a 60 psi
overpressure.  Besides, the whole notion of a 'maximum overpressure' betrays
an ignorance of how explosive effects happen in the real world.  Materials
don't have any such property.  Calculating the overpressure produced by any
given reaction requires a detailed consideration of the environment the
reaction takes place in.

No, my point is simply that in a case this complex it is not possible to do
a few back-of-the-envelope calculations and then claim "I know that
thus-and-such could not have happened!"  Such calculations ignore so many
important variables that they end up being meaningless, even if they are
performed correctly.  If you want to argue with someone who has a detailed
physical simulation of such an event, you need a detailed simulation of your
own to back up your claims.

Well, you'll notice my quote was part of a fairly long piece debunking the
particular piece of pseudoscience I was talking about.  I agree with your
point - those of us who understand why a particular idea is nonsense should
take the time to explain ourselves, instead of just saying "that's nonsense"
and stalking off in a huff.  Otherwise we are only making the problem worse.

I definitely saw and appreciated the humor in it. I happen to like Monty
Python stuff... but.

One of the rhetorical means used by socialists in deconstructing classical
liberal ideas on liberty is to illustrate a supposed contradiction that can be
found humerous by the general population. When the population finds this ditty
humerous, the meme creeps up that the ideas being illustrated have been
publicly ridiculed and found to be nonsensical or illogical, thus denigrating
and deconstructing the concept of individuality.

Try this one on for size:

Crowd to single member:"We are all the same"
single member:"We are all the same"
crowd:" we are all equal"
single member:"we are all equal"
crowd:"But you are not"

who is laughing now?

To an observer in that frame, it will appear to slow down as it
approaches the event horizon - just like falling into a black hole.  The
people in the ship however will not experience this and if they keep
accelerating they will move into  a different inertial frame to the one
they started off in.  Thus, they will be moving ftl relative to a point
in that original frame (although no one there will be able to see them
doing it)

The way the statement is phrased is misleading.  The surface of Venus emits
40 times as much IR as the cloud tops, but almost all of this energy is
trapped near the surface.  The energy just bounces around between the
surface and the lower layers of the atmosphere, and only a small fraction of
it is able to escape into space.  So the measurement they refer to has
nothing to do with the rate at which energy escapes the surface - it is
simply a measure of the amount of energy that is trapped under the cloud
layers.

The models get pretty complex on this, but the basic idea is that Venus'
atmosphere is not 100% opaque.  Visible light coming in from space tends to
penetrate much deeper than IR light trying to make it back into space.  This
gives you a greenhouse effect, because it is easier for energy to get in
than to get out.  Most of the energy would be deposited in the middle layers
of the atmosphere rather than at the surface, so you have a lot of complex
modeling to do to figure out things like the surface temperature.

When last I checked (about 3 years ago) we still didn't have a complete
model of the Venusian atmosphere, but the partial ones were showing a decent
level of agreement with our observations.  There are probably thing going
one here that we haven't caught on to yet, but the basic concept of massive
greenhouse warming looks sound.

I believe current wormhole theory allows the following method of time
travel:

1) Create a wormhole in your lab, spanning some short distance.  Call its
two ends openings A and B.  If you step into opening A ten minutes after the
wormhole is opened, you emerge from opening B ten minutes after the
wormholes was opened (i.e. at the same time).

2) Put opening B on a spacecraft, and accelerate it to near the speed of
light.  Let it coast in that frame of reference for awhile, so that you
build up an age difference between the two ends of the wormhole.

3) Bring opening B back to your lab, and put it next to opening A again.
Let's say that opening A is ten years old at this point, but opening B has
only experienced 8 years of time passage due to relativistic effects.  This
means that if you step into A, you will not emerge from B for 2 years.
Likewise, if you step into B you emerge from A two years in the past.

The obvious consequence is that a wormhole allows for time travel, but only
through the span of time in which the wormhole exists.  So if you create
one, you are issuing an open-ended invitation for visitors from the future.

I'll be very interested to see if this actually works in practice.

So far as we can tell, Venus is completely dead in a geological sense.
There is no molten core, no tectonic activity, and no recent volcanism.  It
looks like it once had the same kind of geological activity as Earth, but
the internal heat that drives the system ran out many millions of years ago.
The calculations I've seen on cooling rates for planet-sized objects suggest
that it should take several billion years for a molten globe to reach this
state. A contrarian might argue that we can't be sure there is no molten
core (although circumstantial evidence argues against this view).  Even
then, you need at least a few hundred million years worth of cooling time.

The Velikovsky scenario would yield a world with an extremely thin crust
(maybe a few hundred meters), constant volcanism, no mountains, and
occasional expanses of exposed magma.  I don't see any way to reconcile that
with the terrain maps we've made of the surface (with large highlands and
basins, weathered mountain ranges, and no sign of recent volcanic activity).

Actually, according to the Yucatan impact theory, all land
creatures larger than about 50 pounds went extinct. So I guess we
could say the asteroid selected for smallness. While the mammals
then came to dominate, they had a completely different body plan,
(warm blooded and all) which in many ways is more efficient. The
evolving predators, including us, selected for speed rather than
size. It is known that such things as mammoths and giant sloths
existed here in the america's till man arrived.

The Hindenberg disaster was largely responsible for this I think,
that and the fact that airplanes were faster/more cost efficient.

I must admit that in *Centuries*, Attanasio does not do the best job of
capturing the superior intelligence of his metasapients, but then most authors
usually have problems in representing more-than-human intelligence. Walter Jon
Williams did a good job of it in *Aristoi*, as did Charles Sheffield in
*Proteus*, but I know of few writers who succeeded. Any names?

I personally hated one of Attanasio's books, *The Last Legends of Earth*,
which was almost a mental torture to read, even though some passages were
brilliant. I am also sometimes appalled by his cruelty (read *Wyvern* for
instance, which involves Borneo headhunters and pirates in the 17th century;
*Silent*, which I think was cowritten with a substance-abusing murderer,
probably also qualifies) and irritated by his more psychedelic passages
(perhaps influenced by the likes of Carlos Castaneda), but I do think he is
one of sf's greatest authors (though I've only read seven of his novels so
far; still a dozen to go).

Though I see nothing wrong in plots that pit heroes against villains, I don't
think *Centuries* is reducible to this pattern. Attanasio does a very good job
of presenting the motivations of the imploders, and though they may be
considered as callous on a cosmic scale, I think Attanasio really manages to
make them ambiguous, given that death is not final, that there is a
multiplicity of universes, and that they are after eternal bliss itself, 

BTW, when I characterized "Inherit the Stars" as one of the worst novels on
the Extropian reading list, I meant "Voyage to Yesteryear", which I found
unreadable and totally devoid of dramatic interest. "Inherit the Stars", on
the other hand, though not great literature, is a very pleasant mystery novel
on the scale of a planetary system.

The original post on the positive effects of moderate consumption on the onset
of Alzheimer's disease intrigued me, and I did a search on the net for the
original source. Here is the article I found. I believe it does say that
drinking 3 to 4 glasses a day is correlated with an 80% reduction in dementia
and a 70% reduction of Alzheimer's disease, though it says so in a language I
could never hope to emulate.

Wine consumption and dementia in the elderly: a prospective community study in
the Bordeaux area.
Orgogozo JM, Dartigues JF, Lafont S, Letenneur L, Commenges D, Salamon R,

France. 

Alcoholism is a possible cause of dementia, mainly through associated
nutritional deficiencies and, rarely, through acute direct toxicity. However
alcohol consumption was not found to be a risk factor in previous
epidemiologic studies. We prospectively studied 3,777 community residents aged
65 and over, in the districts of Gironde and Dordogne. Average daily alcoholic
consumption was recorded at baseline. Incident cases of dementia and
Alzheimer's disease were screened at follow-up with explicit criteria. At 3
years, 2,273 subjects not demented at baseline were still available for
follow-up. Wine was the only alcoholic beverage reported by more than 95 p.
100 of regular drinkers. In the 318 subjects drinking 3 to 4 standard glasses
per day (> 250 and up to 500 ml), categorized as moderate drinkers, the crude
odds ratio (OR) was 0.18 for incident dementia (p < 0.01) and 0.25 for
Alzheimer's disease (p < 0.03), as compared to the 971 non-drinkers. After
adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, baseline MMSE and other
possible confounders, the ORs were respectively 0.19 (p < 0.01) and 0.28 (p <
0.05). In the 922 mild drinkers (< 1 to 2 glasses per day) there was a
negative association only with AD, after adjustment (OR = 0.55; p < 0.05). The
inverse relationship between moderate wine drinking and incident dementia was
explained neither by known predictors of dementia nor by medical,
psychological or socio-familial factors. Considering also the well documented
negative associations between moderate wine consumption and cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality in this age group, it seems that there is no medical
rationale to advise people over 65 to quit drinking wine moderately, as this
habit carries no specific risk and may even be of some benefit for their
health. Advising all elderly people to drink wine regularly for prevention of
dementia would be however premature at this stage.

I think you mix up things a bit. If I jump into my spaceship and blast
off from Earth (I have an urgent meeting at Aldebaran) with a constant
acceleration (as measured with an accelerometer onboard) you will see
my ship recede with a speed (as measured from Earth, for example by
observing the rate I pass regular milestones along my way) that
initially increases linearly with time, but gradually the increase
slows down and after a long while I appear to move near c. No FTL
there.

Properly speaking the ship is in no inertial frame - it is defined as
a frame of reference experiencing no accelerations - but it is
possible to speak of instantaneous inertial frames for each
moment. However, in neither the ship frames or the Earth's frame is
anything seen moving beyond c.

All this is standard relativity textbook stuff. You will find a
treatment in (say) Rindler's Essential Relativity. It might also be
worth looking at the relativity FAQ,
http://www.corepower.com/~relfaq/relativity.html
and especially

Try Vernor Vinge, in the novel "Tatja Grimm's World".  Its not great
literature, but the author does a good job of handling a plot line where one
of the major characters is clearly the result of advanced intelligence
enhancement.

I think Vinge did a nice job in A Fire Upon the Deep, but mostly
because he managed to keep the superintelligences off-stage and
cleverly suggested through various contrasts the difference between
human and superhuman intelligence. The prologue however describes a
Power directly.

Zindell has several superhumans in his books, although they tend to be
so quirky that it is hard to see the superintelligence behind their
games. 

David Brin had some interesting descriptions of post-singularity
humans in his short story "Stones of significance" (not sure if it is
published). 

John Barnes has perhaps the so far most vivid descriptions of
transhumanization in _Mother of Storms_ (I found myself jumping over
lots of sex, violence and bad weather to read more about the posthuman
subplot).

This is the neat thing about the story: the philosophical situation is
non-trivial. You can really see the point of the imploders and
anti-imploders, and even the Kaliesque mother is in some sense right
(although hopelessly deluded). What I disliked was that Attanasio
fairly quickly took sides, and then allowed the hero to "save the day"
in a manner any superintelligence would have figured out in
nanoseconds (I certainly did, long before the plot got there). If I
had written it, I think I would have played up the dilemma further
instead.

Yes, I liked it. It is pleasant in the same way as the movie _The
Andromeda Strain_ (based on Crichton's book): the plot and acting are
forgettable, but it really manages to show the scientific method in
action, a kind of xenomedical detective story (this movie likely
contributed to me becoming a scientist; when I saw it again recently I
was amazed to notice how many scenes and concepts had influenced me
deeply when I originally saw it as a small boy).

  IAN: A 747 without a forward section is not a 747, 
  it's a wreak. I posit, though I know its not a popular 
  view, that an the opened cavity of the interior fuselage 
  of FLT800 would act like a massive airbreaking parachute, 
  like those the Shuttle deploys, which I propose is why 
  they give the opposite shape to the noses of aircraft.
  To apply the aerodynamics of a normal 747 to the wreak 
  that was FLT800 seems absurd to me, but the CIA says 
  it rose 5 times faster than the book-value climb rate, 
  and over twice the maximum operational climb rate, and
  that seems to be overwhelming evidence to most people.

  I suspect if the CIA did a video that said pigs could 
  fly I'd be here battling it out, arguing that they can't. 
  Oh ya, they DID make a video that says "pigs" can fly and 
  I am here battling it out. Life is stranger than fiction!

  Speaking of gliders, Tim, what about if the nose 
  was chopped off it! Check out this glider with 
  no nose, what happens to it when it comes off?:

  http://home.earthlink.net/~neteagle/Modeltest 

  Granted there are scaling issues, but the overall 
  physics involved gives us a reliable indicator.

  IAN: A common feature to all aircraft, even rockets, is
  a curved or pointed tip, or nose section, which allows 
  the airframe to slip thought the atmosphere with maximum
  ease. Any shape other than that will not slip through the 
  atmosphere with as much ease. FLT800 did not have a shape 
  like that, in fact, it had the reverse shape, and as such, 
  the references made here to airplanes and gliders and all 
  the advantage they have, and then extrapolating those to
  the post decapitated FLT800 is absolutely contradicted. 

  One respondent here suggested that we cannot know if a 
  plane with no forward section and open fuselage will not 
  fly like one with intact forward section, unless we do
  the math... no doubt that's the bottom line. However,
  a point I would make is a market-oriented observation:
  If noseless planes fly like or better (since the CIA
  plane flew upto 5 times over the book-climb rate) 
  than planes with noses, why are no aircraft made 
  with their fusalge wide opened?

  IAN: Of course, those motions are not going

Pan Am 103 lost its forward section (like FL800) 
and immediately curved downward (unlike CIA video) 
with all its initial horizontal velocity of 434 kn.
The official investigation gives us these numbers:

Initial velocity: 434 knots  (at 31,000 feet)
Nose hits ground: 120 knots  -314 kn (slower)
Engines hit at:   260 knots  -174 kn (slower)
Wing hits at:     440 knots    +6 kn (faster)

Most of the jet slowed down during the fall. The 
most aerodynamic debris fell fastest, with the wing 
actually falling faster upon impact.  NO  part fell 
faster than an object dropped from total rest. The 
fastest falling part, the wing, fell 3,750 feet
shorter and 443 knots slower than an object 
dropped from complete rest in a vacuum!

Conclusion: an initial horizontal-cruising velocity 
of 434 knots failed to cause any part of a falling 
747 to fall faster than an object dropped from rest.
Physical reality thus refutes counter-argumentation
against my initial post on this topic and indicates
(http://lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/3709.html)
that the CIA scenario contradicts physical law by 
an even wider margin that initially calculated,
since we can see the profound effect of drag.

Also note that since lower air density reduces drag, 
the high altitude (31,000, 17,000 higher than FL800) 
and cold winter weather around Pan Am 103 maximized 
aerodynamic efficiency ensuring the fastest fall.

Universal Attraction: 
A Response to the New York Times Article


Richard Panek's article "Art and Science: A Universe Apart" (New York
Times, 12/14/99, Art & Leisure Section) might have been more accurately
titled "Art and Physics: A Universe Apart."  Science contains many subsets,
of which physics is perhaps the most abstruse.  To use physics as an
example of the relationship between art and science sets an imbalanced
standard, giving a distorted view and histrionical argument.  Panek makes
his case too easy by holding up string theory and quantum mechanics as the
paradigmatic sciences.  His argument looks weaker when we turn to genetics,
evolutionary biology, cosmology, game theory, sociology, and human
behavior-areas where many artists thrive.(1)

Yet, to assume that a composer, painter or short story writer lacks the
capability to converse about quantum mechanics or superstring theory,
invites comment.  Science fiction writers/scientists Gregory Benford or
Vernor Vinge hold their own in conversations of such high standards while
also receiving applause from aficionados. Yet, for the mainstream
layperson, the National Science Foundation supports a project called Visual
Quantum Mechanics, and The Quantum Mechanics Institute explores
possibilities that recent Quantum theories have opened up in Contemporary
Art. The Internet is full of physics home pages. While many of these sites
exhibit artistic drawings of superstrings and URLs of Quantum Mechanics
multi-media visuals with RealPlayer and RealAudio(2), physicist John
Lindner, PhD, expresses the especially recondite nature of  this topic: 

"In this theory, everything in the universe -- all particles and forces and
perhaps space-time itself -- consists of fantastically small strings under
immense tension, vibrating and spinning in a ten-dimensional superspace.
The ten dimensions are mathematically necessary to avoid tachyons
(faster-than-light particles) and ghosts (particles produced with negative
probability) ....Unfortunately, superstrings theory is very difficult to
calculate with and has yet to yield testable predictions."


The impasse facing 20-century artists is not the absence of sense evidence
to help make the new physics understandable. We artists use our senses to
think about the universe around us, and we will explore many new dimensions
as we augment and add on to our senses.  Yet, even if the artist exploits a
poetic license in striving for apotheosis, art, as science, requires
imagination and labor, trial and error, persistence and perseverance. "The
brain is hungry not for method but for content, especially content which
contains generalizations that are powerful, precise, and explicit."
(Frederick Turner).

Panek brings up a worn out issue: the argument that science is objective
and art "purely subjective." This has often ignited verbal fires, as it is
necessary to realize that art is not purely subjective.  If so, Frank Lloyd
Wright's Guggenheim Museum would not be standing, Henri Matisse's vibrant
colors would dull and dim, and  "Shakespeare in Love" would not have made
it from paper to celluloid.

Oh Elitism-thou art a cool, clever thing crossing borders in multiple
disguises, whether smooth obsidian luster, or to be a calculator in thy hand.

The opera "Chaos" is not an exacting keystone for the issues raised in this
article pertaining to art and science, nor to content.  As a cache without
data, it is an example of the use of symbolic language of the sciences for
design or effect.  It might have been more impressive had the artist,
Michael Gordon, been knowledgeable of the symbols he was using, but the
fact that he used them fancifully is hardly a point of issue in the debate
of whether artists are capable of comprehending and conversing with
scientists!

Therein remains a question: How many artists can dance on the head of a pin
and still miss the point?  While we must work at lightening speed to keep
up with the terms and advances in the sciences, as well as in our own field
of hypertechnology, the artist has a responsibility to her or his audience
(however plentiful or meager.)  Laurie Anderson said recently at a
performance (Royce Hall, UCLA) that artists may need to get new
professions, given the expansion of PhotoShop and desktop publishing.
While used as a toss-away phrase, it coincides with my own thinking.
Artists, as well as scientists, economists, physicians, and philosophers,
etc. continue to upgrade their professions by learning new skills and
developing new terms. Artistic content must arise out of culture like a
phoenix.  If artists are to be fully part of the new advances in science,
we need to understand and use the vocabulary for it. This is progress.  

When we look into a fire, we may observe the hypnotic flicker of the flame.
We can also "absorb some EM energy in the 10 to the power of minus 5 meter
range emitted by the highly exothermic oxidation reaction, and observe the
turbulence in the thermally incandescent river of molecules forced upwards
by the denser atmosphere surrounding." (Paul M. Churchland, Scientific
Realism And The Plasticity Of Mind)  

Observing the flicker, we may find ourselves in a new version of
Enlightenment with science, technology and art spinning the universe around
us.

I think thats even better. Genius on the fly is ever so much more impressive

Since we are dealing with four or more peices with PanAm 103 rather than just
two peices with TWA 800, you are obviously trying to compare apples to oranges.
The fact that TWA 800 was so few pieces while PanAm103 blew into so many with
less than a pound of plastique on board indicates that there likely was not a
warhead involved at all with the TWA 800 flight.

comparing any of these to objects dropped in a complete vacuum is about the most
useless comparison you can make.

hardly. You and I are possibly the last people who should be giving expert
opinions on such things as aerodynamic profiles. I could probably manage it if I
sat down with several of my old text books for several hours, but your
simplistic 'analyses' are beneath consideration as credible analyses... I can
tell you from personal experience that I give great credence to the fuel tank
fume blast, now that I know that the wire harnesses in that area were insulated
with kapton. Under the proper conditions kapton can be very explosive and
flammable.

I read "Voyage to Yesteryear", not long ago, and I'd agree that there's a
problem with it, though perhaps not quite as bad a problem, for an sf novel,
as the above comment might indicate. In the novel there's this starship from
Earth bringing a whole township full of very officious Euroamerican
beauracrats, all the way across light years of space to meddle in the affairs
of a well established colony of an Alpha Centauran planet. Right off, it's a
setup for the original settlers to stand up for their own goals, some kind of
fun possiblities, there, perhaps. At the same time, the problems and political
shenagans of the would-be takeover artists seem reasonably dramatic and
familiar enough, it's the whole idea of colonialism all over again.

The problem with the novel is that the totally moneyless, robot driven society
of the Centaurans seems just plain unbelievable, no matter what Hogan has his
characters say about "no need to work for money, now we have robots, now we
have nuclear energy, we were raised by a tribe of robots, we're free of the
past", etcetera. For instance, the Centauran director of a power
station/research institute is said to hold her position *purely* by
acclamation from her coworkers, no question of needing to be appointed by
funds providers, no question of coworkers causing strife by nominating lots of
different people for the job, in competition with one another? In the
discussion that takes place when the better natured colonialists and
Centaurans begin to mingle, it is actually said that real disagreement can't
happen, because the more unreasonable parties would be shot! It's as though
every institution would have to be run by a tremendously influential or
charismatic cult leader, there'd be no other basis for allocating resources in
that situation. As a fabled sf Utopia, it's not too bad, but if it were real
life -- brrr!

  IAN: You appear not to have comprehended what's
  being said. The CIA says Flying Pig Flight 800
  fell about 25% Faster than an object dropped 
  from rest in vacuum. In reality, PanAm 103 fell
  not only much Slower than the vacuum fall rate,
  but even slower than its initial cruise velocity,
  with the exception of the wing, which had no 
  attached airframe slowing it down, and yet it 
  fell much slower than the vacuum fall rate. That 
  wing is our best candidate for forward-velocity-
  preservation during fall in any scenario, but it 
  proved that your claim about horizontal velocity 
  being able to overcome the vacuum fall rate is 
  not true, yet you now have forgotten what the
  meaning of the vacuum fall rate is anyway. 


>Since we are dealing with four or more peices with PanAm 103 rather than just
>two peices with TWA 800, you are obviously trying to compare apples to

  IAN: It's an ideal experiment and thus analogy 
  that perfectly canceled your only counterargument.
  Your new counter is only as good as (1) the case 
  that a noseless aircraft is an aerodynamically
  efficient object, and (2) that the CIA video 
  makes the case for an "intact" and wide-open 
  fuselage with two wings (the flying pig). 

  Number (1) is proven false by Edward Zehr's 
  math models and Richard Hircsh's real model),
  Number (2) is proven false by this fact:

  I was correct when I recently said that the 
  right wing came off at the apex... technically
  speaking. See, the video shows the explosion at
  the apex coming FROM the right wing! See it here:
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cia-clip.jpg . The
  funny thing is, as you will see, that the right
  wing just stays there - it's explosion proof!! 

  I remember playing games as a kid and someone 
  would be explosion proof - but this is the real 
  world, not childhood fantasy. Real wings that 
  explode are not undamaged. This is fantasy:
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cia-clip.jpg . The 
  video basically says the right wing was demolished 
  at the apex and they just didn't bother to change
  the 3D computer graphic model. That explosion is 
  a key part of the CIA case. There's even another
  explosion from within the plane after the one you 
  see from the right wing, but I didn't snap a shot
  of it; suffice it is to say, the CIA video says 
  that the plane was annihilated at the apex, and
  thus it says that it DOES resemble Pan Am 103.


  Edward Zehr's static analysis:
  http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a40058.htm 
  (scroll down to "A REALITY CHECK")
  Edward Zehr's dynamic flight simulation:
  http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/ZehrGut2.html 
  EXACTLY what Zehr shows being manifested in reality: 
  http://home.earthlink.net/~neteagle/Modeltest/page3.html

  IAN: First, find out how many piece FL800 was 
  blown into, and this isn't close to all known:
  http://members.aol.com/robertd202/debris9.gif 

  Second, I just showed that the CIA video 
  invariably indicates that the flying pig 
  was decimated at the apex, so even the 
  scenario critiqued was like Pan Am 103.

Okay, I take your point.

I'm not actually talking about ftl in the strict interpretation of the
term.
I think the main point of disagreement is the time dilation effect and
whether it is possible to overcome it.

The fact that a ship can blast around the galaxy in within the crews
lifetime is not much use to anyone else if they cannot communicate any
information faster than a direct light signal.

You may like to look at Eric Baird's relativity pages

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/eric_baird/homepage.htm

which contain a lot of very interesting ideas about ftl travel and
communication.

We should remember that this is in RED wine, and the most

I was wondering if anyone knew of a great bookmark utility that can be
shared between Netscape Communicator 4.5 and Internet Explorer 4.7.  I have
tried Compass, Bookmark Magic, Power Marks and LinkSync but none of these
make the bookmarks or favorites structure the same in both browsers. Please
send mailto:webmaster@thefuturist.net (and Reply to this List) if you know
of one.

Also, I'd like to know about any Transhumanist or Extropian music that I can
download from the web easily.  Max More's songs take, it seems an hour to
download at 56Kbps modem so I am thinking in terms of the mp3 (or mp4)
format at http://www.mp3.com or http://www.goodnoise.com.  I know this topic
has arisen before on the Transhumanist and Extropian Lists but did not get
any web links really.  (I might like to add the appropriate music to my
website and credit the sources at the foot of the pages.) Please also send
mailto:webmaster@thefuturist.net (and Reply to this List) if you know of any
such web music.

 If the Fed loans banks unlimited amounts of cash with little regard to
the bank's ability to repay the loans, then they can fairly reliably
prevent runs on the banks before Jan. 1. But that strategy will probably
cause significant inflation, inflation, and invite a repeat of the kind
of recklessness that produced the worst of the S&L failures, so the Fed
will be hesitant to act as if runs are likely without clear evidence of
an imminent panic.

 As long as the banking system is fuctioning smoothly and there is little
reason to expect more than a few days interruption in basic services, it
is irrational to withdraw large fractions of one's account, because it
becomes much less convenient to pay many bills if you can't mail a check.
I expect that about 50 million people in the U.S. will withdraw about $1000
each in December, and that the system can handle that without major
disruptions.

 Consider what happened in the U.S. in January and February of 1933.
 With some of history's worst bank failures fresh in people's minds, and
with FDR's advisors clearly hinting that they would abandon the gold
standard or devalue the quantity of gold for which they would redeem
Federal Reserve Notes (which given the strange quasi-gold-standard meant
that dollars withdrawn from banks as gold would retain their value,
while dollars kept in banks could be expected to lose value), it's hard
for me to understand why informed people didn't withdraw all their
dollar-denominated deposits from banks. The attitude of the incoming
administration was reasonably public by January, yet there was little
panic until the last week of February. This shows both that it takes
pretty clear evidence of dangers to produce a system-wide run on banks
(evidence which I don't think Y2K provides), and that even then people
will wait til the last minute.

 Beliefs that are common mainly near market tops. At current p/e's, the
chances of a buy and hold investor doing well are low. I recommend keeping
a close eye on 3 month t-bill rates, and selling when rates show a clear
upward trend.

 Oil futures and other futures contracts provide as good an estimate as any
of the risks of major disruptions. The oil futures market is saying quite
clearly that there is no problem. The only futures markets that indicate a
problem are the short-term interest rate markets, which predict a 30 basis
point rise in rates from September to December (which, given the stock
market's high price might be enough to cause a significant correction).

 This is mostly fiction. As far as I could see, banks paid lower interest
rates. I don't know what evidence you have of a "huge drain" of cash; many
brokerage accounts presumably ran low on cash, but I don't think much
happened elsewhere. And the Fed's "flooding" of the system was more
rhetorical than financial:

I think an awful lot will depend on how many problems we see before then. 
If life continues as normal and all big companies and government agencies
announce compliance, then you're probably right. If organizations start to
fail badly before then and others admit they're not going to be finished
in time, the situation will be very different. 

I don't expect anything serious to happen until late this year... and if
it's bad it will get bad very quickly, as organizations can no longer 
pretend that they're going to work next year and the bad news comes out
in a flood. If nothing serious has happened by early December then I'll be
much happier about sitting back and expecting things to work... but I don't
expect that to be the case.

I don't see why it would cause inflation.  The money supply would not
increase.  All that happens is that there is a transfer from bank balances
to cash holdings.  The total money in anyone's possession does not change.

In fact, it is likely that in such a time of economic uncertainty people
would want to increase their total savings (cash plus bank accounts).
This is a common response to hard times.  People want to build up a
savings "buffer" in case they lose their jobs or face other economic
problems.

If total savings increase, this actually reduces the velocity of money
and can cause deflation.  People are spending less and so prices drop.

Some people have suggested that the opposite would happen, that having
withdrawn cash people would want to spend it, and save less.  This could
be either for psychological reasons (cash invites spending) or perhaps
to spend money on Y2K related supplies (generators, food, water, etc.).
It's possible that this would happen to some extent, but I would expect
that the traditional response of cutting expenses during hard times will
still dominate.

In addition, in any such bank-run environment, there is probably a
sharp fall in stock prices.  This is a great loss of paper wealth and
makes people feel poorer, which will also tend to decrease spending and
cause deflation.

  IAN: Well, I hate to disagree with someone 
  who agreed with me, but I should point out, 
  since this is central to my point, that 0/0
  does have answers, in fact, its problem is
  that it can be shown to equal any number! 

  A dejanews search of forum alt.math will 
  find a few threads on the topic, and the 
  prevailing view of mathematicians there
  is that 0/0 can be shown via several routs 
  to equal any number. However, obviously 
  this leads to fatal contradictions that 
  render 0/0 "indeterminate." Here's a way 
  I figured out for arguing why 0/0 = n,
  and the subsequent fatal contradiction:

  IF a/b = c, then a/c = b.

  Since 0/6 = 0, 0/0 = 6.
  Since 0/2 = 0, 0/0 = 2.
  Ergo: 6 = 2... bOiNg!!!

  We arrive at an answer via legal means
  but find that the answers are errors.
  Yes, 0/n where n is nonzero is legal, 
  and always equals 0. As we can see, 
  /0 is chronically indeterminate.

You just failed your abstract algebra test.

If a/b = c then a/c = b, if and only if a, b, and c are not equal to zero.

That last part is key.

  IAN: Cute trick Dan, what you say is the

  your spoiling to get me back for your counters 
  based on your assuming that 0 is not more the -1.

  IAN: Well, I just covered WHY those 
  legal means fail in the case of /0,
  which is why the stiputlation you

  counter is circular.

OK. I will give you $0,000.00, and you give me -1,000.00 
to my credit card balance ;-)

or else I give you $(0 * 0) and you give me $(-1*-1). 

Yeah, that will be just fine.

It is interesting thing to think about this in the Japanese situation. 

Their government cannot convince them to spend their savings for love nor 
money. It is currently earning less than .25% (yes, less than one quater 
of a percent), and that just makes them want to save harder! Why? Becuase 
they are saving for their old age. 

But upon what will they spend this money when they are old? The reason 
they need to save is that there are no young people to do the work. In 
the, mostly retired, future, there will be few goods to buy nor services 
to purchase.

The saved money will then suffer tremendous inflation (more money than 
goods = higher prices for goods). No use trying to buy American or 
Australian goods (2 countries for whom the age bulge will hit around 15 
years later than in Japan), as no one will want to swap dollars for those 
Yen when there is nothing in Japan to purchase.

Tough times ahead for Japan, I think.

mike, i have never worried much about how a crippled plane could
descend faster than freefall in a vacuum: tail control surfaces could
issue a down command or the craft could have turned over, etc,
under full thrust.  all bets are off after a plane comes apart.

but i must admit, this scenario of a bad wire causing an explosion
of fumes inside the tank i have found troubling.  i would think
the vapor pressure of the kerosene would displace oxygen
sufficiently to prevent much oxygen from getting inside the tank,
even if scuffed or degraded insulation causes a spark.

the fuel pump on my truck is inside the tank, submerged in gasoline,
unless the tank is nearly empty.  i would think the vapor pressure
of octane on a cool day would be lower than that of kerosene on
a warm day, yet there is never enough oxygen in a car's gas tank
to cause an explosion, even assuming a faulty fuel pump.  that
kapton has problems is acknowledged, but why would a spark
inside a fuel tank cause an explosion?

what is your experience?  i fly on these boeings about 40 times
a year.  i would hate to hafta worry that a tank could explode
at any time.  {8-[  spike

I'm not sure this is the right forum to discuss this issue, but since you
brought it up...

I do not understand why Japanese savers do not invest more of their money
outside of Japan (in the US or Europe for example). First of all it would
earn a lot more interest. It would help the countries they invest in. It
would also stimulate demand for Japanese exports, thus helping their own
economy. And finally it would solve the problem of their savings not being
worth anything when they retire.

It just seems like a win-win solution, yet it is not adopted nor even
promoted. Why?

It seems to me that throughout this strain people have been (perhaps
deliberately) applying the symbol "0" to different ideas, then trying to
argue with each other, using their own personal application of zero to prove
their argument correct.

Perhaps it would be best if we could agree on our application of zero.... my
argument was a simple probability notation, with the denominator noting
possible outcomes.

I'm not arguing the fact that theoretical mathematics deals with the 0/0
fraction a lot and does find answers, but I think maybe my point was missed.
0/0 is a nonexistant probability in premise based logic, so therefore it
cannot be used.

I dunno...could it be for the same reason that they enforce highly discriminatory import policies?  (The word is xenophobia).

Conspiracy theories are great self-replicators. And it looks like the
TWA Flight 800 cover-up theory has had a better-than-average life
expectancy. CNET rates it one of the 10 best net hoaxes of all time. I
was hoping they'd give Ian Goddard some credit for keeping it alive...

Because the Japanese government made it illegal in order to provide cheap 
internal investment capital (hence they were able to do things that no 
western company paying 10% interest could dream of. this also caused the 
property bubble which lead to down town Tokyo being valued more highly 
than most of California put together.

Now they no longer need the investment capital and could valuably shift 
the policy to one of external investment, but it is to late to sell those 
Yen for their 1980s price.

PS: this is not as simple as i have made seem: there are many biollions 
of dollars worth of Japanese Yen-backed investments in the West, just not 
enough to pay wages for two hundred  million septuagenarians. ;-(

There are several ways:

a) fuel leaks. aircraft fuel tanks can be notoriously leaky, especially planes on
international flights. the fuels used in different countries tend to have some
important variances to them, and ground crews in many other countries are not english
literate and can easily mix up a request for JP-4 for JP-5, 4 for 3, etc. if they are
not properly trained. I do know that JP-5, for example has no trouble at all leaking
through the standard seals used on tanks made to hold JP-4. When I worked on F-15's in
the USAF we deployed to the Navy's Miramar NAS to fly as agressors against the Navy
Top Gun students. The F-14's use JP-5, while the F-15 uses JP-4, but there was no JP-4
on hand. What did we do? We used JP-5. Within the first 24 hours all of our fuels
specialists were working non-stop to plug the leaks that were developing in the seals.
The Navy boys helped out immensely. Apparently one specific brand of chewing gum works
as an excellent temporary sealant for JP-5 tanks....I don't recall the brand other
than it was a bubblegum.

Given this potential for fuel leaks (also likely to increase when under increased
structural loads from climbing, I can imagine that a sufficient leak could have
developed through the seals, around screws, etc. and the leaked fuel could have
ignited on a neighboring  wire harness, especially if it leaked on a cannon-plug at a
bulkhead interface connection.

b) arc-throughs. The power supply cables for the forward distribution busses run by
the fuel tanks as I recall, but any wire with sufficient current that had chafed
against the fuel tank wall could possibly have chafed through, arced into the fuel
tank wall, and arc-welded a hole in the tank, providing a point of ignition.

Keep in mind that this particular tank was nearly empty. Nearly its entire volume was
filled with fuel vapor, and and air that had filled the space when it had been vented
as it emptied. Such a situation is far more potentially explosive than a full tank of
gas.

I don't think your statement that there is never any oxygen in a tank is true. The
reason why tanks don't blow up so often is that the pumps and sensors are built so
well that they almost never expose bare conductors to the inside of the tank. One
interesting feature that some planes have on their fuel systems is that they have
current sensors on both the hot and ground legs of the circuit. This allows the system
to measure if the insulation is breaking down and permitting too much current to go to
ground outside of the ground leg of the circuit. I do not know if that model of 747
have such a monitoring system or not.

The reason why I think we will never have a conclusion to this case is because it
happened over water. If it had happened over land, we would have known long ago what
happened to the plane, but there is so much of the plane (especially in the area of
that fuel tank) that is still missing, that I am afraid we will never know.

  IAN: Keep in mind that just because leaders say 
  X is a hoax does not mean that X is a hoax. To 
  know if X is a hoax requires more than faith
  in authorities, hard to imagine as that may be. 

  We can know, for example, that the web page you 
  forwarded commits a hoax because it presented no
  evidence of a hoax it purports to exist. It even 
  notes that the source of Salinger's document was 
  Richard Russell, a retired United Airlines pilot 
  living in Florida. That is not evidence that it 
  was a hoax. The proof that it was not a hoax is 
  the fact that Richard Russell was not making it 
  up. He acquired the FAA radar tape from the same
  person connected to the investigation he acquired 
  the intelligence of the Navy activities under FL800.

  That the Russell report is a hoax is a proven hoax.

I've heard that many times.  Well apparently that is not true.  Since soon a

Only kidding here...since I've neglected the "in a vacumn" part of that

However...that leads to a question.  If light is "slowest" in a Bose-Einestein
Condesate...and "fastest" in a vacumn......is there anything "less" than a
vacumn?   It is possible to slow light down...is it even theoretically
possible to speed light up?  

No clue here...a vacumn is a vacumn right?

And does the frequency (wavelength) matter as to speed, either in a vacuum or in a Bose-Einstein condensate?

While this is true, the problem is that at least some people have to
pay for it, either in traffic charges
(yes there are such accounts!) or for disk space.

Well there are always technological fixes, if you're 
allowed to use them. Not all ISP's, for instance will
allow concealemnt of your true email address, even to avoid spam.

Friends, Extropians, Fellow seekers,

	Would it be possible to construct a self-enhancing AI with today's hardware?

	I'm not asking if the software is available.  Nor the electrical power.  Nor the money.  Nor whether you could cool it to prevent overheating.  Rather I'm thinking more about whether memory densities and processor densities and speeds could be assembled in sufficient quantities in a small enough space so that inter-element communication speed wouldn't bottleneck the whole affair.

	To narrow the question down some, consider the following:

	A disk-shaped assembly, with coolant flow through the faces of the disk.  Hardware density 50 percent, ie. half hardware half coolant passages.  Hardware in quantities to support a seed AI plus additional to support an SI according to the following human-equivalent definition: a thousand-fold increase in synaptic quantities, a thousand-fold increase in synaptic firing rates, with memeory appropriate to support this capability level.

	Could it be built?  And if so, would the disk be ten meters thick by a hundred across?  A hundred meters by a thousand? Two hundred by five thousand?   

	By all means feel free to tweak the specs.  But could it be built?
			Best, Jeff Davis

So far as we can tell, Venus is completely dead in a geological sense.

It looks like it once had the same kind of geological activity as Earth,

years ago. The calculations I've seen on cooling rates for planet-sized
objects suggest that it should take several billion years for a molten
globe to reach this state. A contrarian might argue that we can't be
sure there is no molten core (although circumstantial evidence argues
against this view). Even then, you need at least a few hundred million
years worth of cooling time.

after all had been based on our understanding of how the Earth worked,
were tossed out the window. It was a strange and alien place we were
looking at. There was a river formed by running lava longer than the
Nile. There were huge mountain belts. The sides of the mountains ran up
so steeply that they were unlike anything we had seen on Earth. We
looked searchingly for features that we could identify, that looked
familiar, that looked like something close to home. We were just blown
away by how different that planet looked. NARRATION: Among all the
strange and inexplicable features, there seemed to be none of the usual
geological signs of heat loss: no tell-tale ridges and fault lines of
plate tectonics, and no large active volcanoes. Most of the volcanoes,
in fact, looked like they had been dormant for hundreds of millions of
years. So Venus had to be losing internal heat in some unknown and
un-Earth-like way. The key to solving the puzzle turned out to be hidden
in an unexpected place on the planet's surface. Like the moon, all solid
bodies in the solar system are hit by meteorites. Such collisions scar
the surface with impact craters which can tell us about its age. Older
land has more craters because it has had more time to accumulate
meteorite strikes. Fresh land is formed when volcanoes erupt, coating
the surrounding landscape in a new skin of lava. This younger land will
have fewer impact craters. When a team of specialists sat down to count,
measure and plot every crater on the surface of Venus, they were in for
the surprise of their careers. ROBERT STROM: This is the surface of
Venus after it has been fully mapped by the Magellan mission. And when
we plotted all of the craters on the surface, lo and behold, it was
extremely uniform, they were extremely uniformly distributed across the
surface. Just totally random. Truly astounding. NARRATION: Such an even
distribution of impact craters across the whole planet could only mean
one thing: there was no old or new land. The whole surface was the same
age. Judging from the number of craters, it was young for a planet -
only about 500 million years old. GERALD SCHABER: It was quite amazing.
ROBERT STROM: It was incredible to me. I had never seen anything like
this in the thirty years that I've been looking at solid bodies in the
solar system. I've counted craters from Mercury to Triton at Neptune and
this is the first time I've ever seen a crater population that was
completely random. It just absolutely blew my mind. No place else in the
solar system.  One simple way of explaining this is to have a complete
resurfacing of Venus and then starting all over again, building up the
cratering record. What this actually means: is that Venus has turned
itself inside out. How do you do that? You know, how do you do that?
*************************************************
Don Turcotte explains his theory to cover these
facts:

Basically the theory that evolved in my mind at that time was that this
planet today is basically dead, as far as its surface is concerned. But
the net result is that the interior is heating up and getting hotter and
more active like a pot of porridge if you turn up the heat. 
And eventually the surface will become disrupted and it will
catastrophically sink into the interior. And then there will be a period
of totally catastrophic surface volcanism with a time of flame and you
have virtually a complete magma ocean on the entire surface of the
planet. This extracts so much heat from the interior of the planet that
the interior cools off until the point that it is sufficiently cool that
again the planet dies and starts to form a solid surface, very quiet and
peaceful for 500 million years, and looks like the planet is totally
dead with no volcanism, earthquakes or other activity of that sort.
But it then heats up in the interior until you're ready for another
catastrophe. As the interior heats up, eventually this process repeats.
The whole surface founders and sinks into the interior and this
episodicidity repeats again.

Depends on what kind of vacuum it is :-)

Actually, I seem to recall that the speed of light is different in the
vacuum between the plates in the Casimir force experiment, where the
vacuum is actually given a slightly negative energy. This is from the realtivity FAQ:

http://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/~cwhuang/documents/physics/FTL.html#12

The Casimir effect is a very small, but measurable force which exerts
between two uncharged conducting plates when they are very close
together. It is due to vacuum energy (see the Physics FAQ article on
the Casimir Effect). A surprising calculation by Scharnhorst suggests
that photons travelling across the gap between the plates in the
Casimir effect must go faster than c by a very very small amount (at
best 1 part in 1024 for a 1 nanometre gap.) It has been suggested that
in certain cosmological situations, (such as in the vicinity of cosmic
strings if they exist) the effect could be much more
significant. However, further theoretical investigations have shown
that once again there is no possibility of FTL communication using
this effect.

The problem with trusting futures markets for predicting the future is that 
you implicitly assume they have all the neccesary information; if they don't,
then their predictions are as useless as Clinton speeches.

Interesting CNN article on that one:

http://www.cnnfn.com/digitaljam/9902/18/y2k_pkg/

Apparently they're betting on large-scale bank runs too.

Also, I've read that there's at least one contract out there for more than
a hundred tons of gold in December at around 30% more than current rates.
That's a pretty big bet someone's making on gold price increases over
the next few months. Don't have a URL handy.

Yes. It is. c in a vacuum is as high as anything can go. If you put more energy
into the photon, it simply increases in frequency. This is why the researchers
knew they had measured an extremely slow speed in the condensate, because if they
had just drained energy from the light, it would have changed frequency. What it
did do was retain its energy at the same frequency, which told them they were
getting a refractive phenomenon.

This is not exclusive to BE condensates. The speed of light is different in any
material, and different in each state, for example, different for steam, water,
and ice. The absolute we refer to as c, though, in most physics equations is
usually refered to as being in vacuum conditions, unless there is actually work
being done within materials.

As the article that was referred to states, the phenomemon of refraction in optics
is entire dependent on the fact that light travels slower in glass than in air or
in a vacuum. Rather than traveling a straight line, when light strikes glass at an
angle, the photons will run through their path integral of possible paths (all
possible paths), and take the one which takes the least amount of time between its
emission point and is receiving point.

Remember that it knows what its receiving point is because the photon exits as a
result of the handshake of the particles on the emission and reception ends with
virtual particles that are in phase but moving in opposite directions in time. (As
per Feynman's Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Electro-Dynamics).

Thus, the light will strike the glass at a shallow angle and travel through the
glass at a steeper angle to reach the reception point, because that path takes the
least amount of time, as it wants to travel through as little of the slow medium
(the glass) as is possible in the trip, and as much of the fast medium (the
vacuum).

I never completely understood why refraction worked until I learned how the
transactional interpretation worked....

Incredibly, I'm posting again on this thread.  The brief discussion about
Zappa's music we had here a couple of months ago caused me to begin listening
intensively again to Zappa's music.  This ended up with me scouring the web
for Zappa material, getting and reading "The Real Frank Zappa Book" (the
closest thing there is to an autobiography) and . . . ultimately to making a
Zappa web page:

                http://users.aol.com/gburch2/zappa.html

where you'll find a complete discography linked to Amazon and a link for the
book, which I highly recommend.  In the process I came to a definitive answer
to the questions about Zappa's social and political views that were raised:
Zappa was pretty much an absolute libertarian individualist and agnostic with
very strongly-held views about the positive value of science and critical
thinking and the anti-reason effects of organized religion. It would be hard
to find a more extropian artist. Especially for our younger subscribers who
won't remember Zappa personally, I highly recommend exploration of his music
and thought.

The fastest neural net system I am familiar with is Genobyte's CAM-Brain
Machine (CBM) system (see http://www.genobyte.com/cbm.html).  It uses an
array of 72 FPGA chips to simulate 1,152 simplified neurons, which doesn't
sound like much.  However, the designers have taken advantage of its
electronic nature to allow it to rapidly switch between different sets of
neurons.  In effect, it can simulate 37,000,000 simplified neurons running
at roughly human speed, or 1,152 neurons running at 10 MHz, or anything in
between those two extremes.

It looks to me like you could fit two of these devices into a standard 6'
hardware cabinet, with room left over for power supply and networking
equipment.  Each module needs 400 MB/sec of bandwidth for communicating with
neighboring modules, so that's 800 MB/sec per cabinet, so we could plausibly
link 100 or so cabinets into a closely-coupled system using fast fiber-optic
connections.  That means we top out at around 10^9 well-connected neurons
(and simplified ones, at that).

Now, you should be able to get a larger system than that by subdividing the
artificial brain into functional units, with   are internally well-connected
but have a lower volume of communication with other functional units.  I'm
not sure what volume of data transfer you need to allow - maybe Anders could
shed some light on what the situation looks like in human brains?

At any rate, I would think you could get another order of magnitude in scale
this way.  If you allow a couple of years to build a specialized, parallel
networking system we should be able to increase that to hundreds of
functional units, and probably increase the size of a functional unit by
another order of magnitude as well.  That gives us maybe 10^12 simplified
neurons to work with, at a cost of several billion dollars.

For comparison, the human brain has around 10^11 neurons, each of which
probably does a lot more information processing than the simplified ones
used in neural net machines.  So for a few billion dollars we could make
something with hardware roughly equivalent to the human brain.  That puts
your SI-capable hardware well out of reach for pure neural-net machines.

Does anyone see another approach that might work?

Short for 'Super Intelligence'.  The term springs from some relatively
recent ideas about intelligence enhancement, artificial intelligence,
uploading, and related ideas.

The idea is that at some point in the future there will probably be minds
that exist purely as software running on advanced computer systems.  They
might be AIs, or uploaded humans, or even cyborgs or some other type of
hybrid intelligence.  What matters for this purpose is that they have
hardware that is vastly more powerful than the human brain.

There are two major opinions about what such an entity would be like.  The
'weak SI' school expects that it would be able to think very fast, and do
lots of different things at once, but it would not necessarily be any
smarter than you or me.  The 'strong SI' school expects that the extra
processing power would actually make the SI smarter - so at 10^2 times
normal brainpower it is an incredible genius, and at 10^6 times normal it
becomes a godlike intelligence.

A related term is 'Power', or 'Vingean Power' - a strong SI with far more
processing power (and thus intelligence) than our entire species, and
extremely advanced technology to match.

Perhaps, one should bear in mind cultural differences and the speed at 
which beliefs and values change.

For instance, the reason why Japan waited so long before starting 
investing in other countries' economies is not xenophobia but the 
concept of "amae." In short, amae presupposes superior-inferior or even 
parent-child relationship, that is the way Japan viewed their relation 
to the US. So, why would they bother about playing more actively on the 
international arena? 

However, as the Japanese economy was getting better, and especially, 
when the exports from Japan to US outweighed US imports to Japan, the 
relattionship was broken by US statement that Japan should revise its 
international political economy.

Japan acts somewhat different now, since it realized that it is not a 
minor player anymore (finally they got it :) Currently, Japan is one of 
the major aid-givers, and it provides most of the help for Eastern Asia.

Regarding non-tariff barriers for import...huh, Japan is not the only 
country that does it. How about bananas and EC? And what about India 
with its against-patent regulations, and even US (regulations regarding 
textile and apparel products aimed against EC)?

Beliefs change gradually and practices change even slower. The idea of 
liberalization and open trade is relatively new.

I won't claim that the experience is "extropian" (whatever that would mean
in this context), but I can highly recommend playing the first piece of
"Jazz from Hell" on a good stereo at high volume!

I really should buy that CD. Greg, do you recommend any other of his albums
in particular, as reflecting his views?

Curiously, I first noticed Zappa as a teenager when someone played a track
that appeared to be about anal sex. I don't remember appreciating the music
at that time, but it made him difficult to forget!

Why is India the bad guy for not adopting the silly western idea
of patents?  It is /we/ who are restricting /their/ free trade in
information, not the other way around (unless perhaps the have
some internal patent system and deny only foreign patents, but I
don't think that's the case).

Since Environmental News Service published accounts on 
jets spraying "contrails" that make people sick, I have 
seen an explosion of such accounts. While there has been
a track record of military experimental spraying over U.S. 
cities, it is unclear to me whether the recent widespread 
claims of a correlation between contrails and sickness are 
accurate or are perhaps a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy
(http://assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/posthoc.htm). 

After getting reports of unusual contrail formations in my 
area, I went out and observed and photographed a surprising
proliferation of contrails. I've concluded that attributes 
assumed to indicate a contrail is spray are attributes of
normal contrails under variable atmospheric conditions. 

I took many photographs, some of which provide proof that
assumed-to-be-abnormal attributes of contrails are normal,
and as such are not evidence of spraying. See my analysis 
with photos: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contrail.htm 

Accounts that my observations do not address are those of 
"cobwebs," "angel hair," or a gel-like substance falling.
There was one inexplicable contrail that I photographed.

  IAN: Zappa's 3-CD set "Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar" 
  and a more recent 2-CD compilation "Frank Zappa
  Guitar" are perhaps the most spectacular and 
  unworldly guitar I have ever heard! This is
  music beyond the realm played with a skill 
  to match. Beyond the foul-mouth garbage
  that exists in so much of his work is 
  a musical genius from another dimension!
  Those CDs will give you the real Zappa. I 
  once posited that there must be some realm 
  in the universe (or elsewhere!) where Zappa's 
  guitar spontaneously occurs, there must be!!! :)

In the literal sense of the question, yes.  Give me total control over
all the hardware on the planet and enough time to write the software,
and I bet I could run something that could enhance itself to the point
of being able to invent new hardware before it ran out of room.

Realistically speaking, we would need serious advances in Internet
infrastructure, much better than just fast TCP/IP - something that
could, in theory, let the whole Internet run as a single parallel
processor.  I've heard claims for tech like that, but I don't believe
them.  The best thing I've seen so far is Beowolf.

Even given a super-Beowolf, I would need a *substantial* chunk of the
Internet to run the software.  And even then, the only way it would work
is if the first stages of the AI could do better than us at writing
distributed software - which isn't actually too implausible, since we
have no intuitions for that environment.

So in answer to your question - one supercomputer running a seed AI,
2020 minimum; Beowolf running a seed AI, 2010; super-Beowolf running a
seed AI - we could do it right now, if we had the software.

Super-Beowolf will probably take far less programming effort than the AI itself.

==

In answer to another question, the levels go like this:

Seed AI:  Something a lot dumber than human, but with the ability to
enhance itself, and enhance its ability to enhance itself...
Mortal:  You and I.
Transhuman:  Something with, say 2x or 4x human processing power, or
substantially increased smartness but not huge speeds.  Capable of
outsmarting you by using a higher order of rational reasoning.  A
supercomputer or enhanced human.
Superintelligence:  Something with 100x or 1000x human processing power,
running at thousands or millions of times human speed.  Capable of
outsmarting you by simulating all the cognitive-level elements of your
mind.  Runs on a planetary network.
Power:  Something running on the full potential computing power of a
planetary or solar mass.  (Note that even without quantum computing, you
can theoretically run the entire human race on about a milligram.) 
Capable of outsmarting you by running a trillion simulations of your
brain on the atomic level.  Runs on Dyson Spheres composed of nanotech
and picotech processors.
Omega Point:  Infinite and transfinite processing speeds.  May create
new Universes to supply the processing power.  People who are easily
impressed think this constitutes Godhood.
Singularity:  It ain't tellin'.

A very good solution indeed! That should stop the periodic whining of some
people about S/N... ;-)

Anyway, I think there's still one type of list missing: "transhumanism select":
an invitation only (or in any case restricted) list for hardcore transhumanists,
where all topics can be discussed without having to think about PR (you
could also call it ">H uncensored"). There have been some concerns 
about the effect of certain topics on transhuman PR, and this would solve
the problem without compromising the quality of debate (censorship of
any kind, no matter how reasonable or well-meant, is a killer of critical 
debate). The proposed list would also have a restricted (password etc.)
archive, of course.

(And yes, I know, the  very proposal for such a list is bad PR, but you 
can't eat your cake and have it too or something)...In the long run, it
would be better.

There already is such a list, I beleive it is administered by Alex Bokov. I don't

The speed of light (electromagnetic waves) in a vacuum is completely
independent of the frequency or wavelength of the photons or waves,
according to Maxwell's theory, and such a phenomenon has never been
observed as far as I am aware.


But there is a theoretical possibility that light in a vacuum could be
slightly slowed over cosmic distances by the presence of electromagnetic
energy in the space (e.g. the cosmic background radiation, starlight,
quasar light, etc.)


On a cosmic scale, the frequency of light travelling through space
becomes red-shifted as the space through which the light travels expands.


Light travelling out of a gravitational potential well (away from a star
or the vicinity of a black hole) will be red-shifted as the photons lose
energy as they climb.


Light falling into a gravitational well is blue-shifted, all else being
equal.


For media with a refractive index greater than that of vacuum, the speed
of light generally varies with frequency.  Glass prisms, for example,
break up white light into a rainbow spectrum.


I don't know if speed varies with frequency in a Bose-Einstein
condensate, but it seems likely since it does with seemingly most
material media.

This is where I become quite confused and I think that we better stop
trying to take the transhumanism out of extropy where it originated.
Transhumanism is open for discussion and new ideas -- the point of extropy
is continuous growth and understanding.  Anyone who thinks extropy is
carved in cement is mistaken.  Anyone who thinks that there are spiritual
or political differences might rethink her or his premise.  Some have
spiritual preferences, some not. Some have political preferences, some not.
 The IMPORTANT thing to consider is how we approach transhumanism, not
anyone's sacred cow.

The transhuman list Alex generated is not especially for "transhumanism,"
however, the extropy list is.  Transhuman means the evolution from human to
posthuman.  Transhuman is a philosophical approach to our transhumanity.

If one would like to be on a transhumanism select list, then join
participate in the Extropians select where transhumanism should be
discussed  (life extension, intelligence increase, psychological
improvement, etc.).

Now, let's continue progressing.

Hmm.  I wonder if really spectacularly hot crushed stuff might also
superpose and tangle into a Bose-Einstein condensate, if which case the
radiation near the Big Bang might also have been very slow, and, and...
what?  Nothing much, probably, since the expansion of spacetime was
happening faster than light anyway.  Still...

oh well, as long as everyone does it that is fine then ... ?

BTW: the USA is one of the worst, most hypocritical offenders. New 
Zealand (one of the most free economies in the world now that Hong Kong 
is inside China) is routinely threatened by the US State and Trade 
officials. Some of it is overt and written (quotas to protect inefficient 
US farmers, attempts to allow US manufacturers to restrict imports of 
good into New Zealand to single suppliers so they can leverage the prices 
up in New Zealand relative to US retail), however, much of it is along 
the lines of "gee ... if much more lamb came stateside this year, 
something bad might happen to the quotas next year ..."

For some years, sophisticated investors, individuals, funds and
institutions, not just Japanese, have been borrowing yen at very low
rates, converting to dollars, and buying US treasuries paying much higher
interest rates.  That's in part why the US dollar went to almost 150 yen
and the US long bond to 4.7% last year.  It was called the 'yen carry
trade'.


In recent months those positions have apparently been unwound, which is
presumably in part why the dollar is now at 115 to 120 yen and the US
long bond is above 5%.


As far as I know, it is not at all illegal or officially discouraged
these days for a Japanese citizen and resident to expatriate as much
capital as he wishes.  Indeed, Japanese and foreign banks offer dollar
accounts right in Japan, as do many banks in many other countries.  And
many Japanese have invested outside Japan for years.  Back in the 1980s a
significant portion of the US public debt was held by Japanese interests,
both official (Bank of Japan) and private, and much US real estate was
bought by Japanese.



But the average person is not comfortable with exposing their savings to
the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and high inflation.  For Russians,
that means having dollars, not rubles, because dollars are more stable
than rubles.  For Japanese, that means having yen, not dollars, because
yen have a somewhat better record than the dollar of holding purchasing
power over the last 30 years, and because to the Japanese, the dollar
sometimes looks like a 'roller coaster' currency.  But that may change. 
For years, platinum has been a popular 'investment' with some Japanese. 
The average Japanese saver typically relies on the country's 'postal
savings' plan, which is government operated and guaranteed, and pays low
interest.  Large Japanese investors use banks and brokerages, which are
at least de facto government guaranteed ('too big to fail').  It is sad
but true that most of these institutions are insolvent or nearly so, in
part due to economic inflexibility, organized crime, cronyism, and
sweetheart deals.  Japan is in need of fundamental reform.

All:

I call the essay Saint-Andre mentions below to your attention
and recommend you read it.  Since not everyone here is or
was an Objectivist (or knows about it), it might not seem all
that relevant.  But could we not this same logic be applied
to some of the various transhuman and Extropian artistic
endeavors?  I'd be curious to see your reactions...

The Sun has a lot of 'really spectacularly hot crushed stuff' in its core
where the nuclear fusion occurs.  It takes many years for photons
produced by the reactions in the core to reach the outer layers, whereas
to travel the same distance thru empty space, a photon would take only 2
seconds.

I've been in the lurking mode because I have been very busy with my 
PhD and other things recently, but now it's finally time to present 
'The Transhumanist FAQ'.

The project became much bigger than originally intended. The present 
version is more than 15,000 words. I have tried to give substantial 
answers that get to the core of the matter, while at the same time 
being as concise as possible.

Many of the questions are really objections. Some of the objections 
rest on misunderstandings, and they should meet with a vigorous 
response. But others point out genuine problems, and there I think 
the right approach is not to try to smooth over the difficulties or 
wriggle out of the attack through clever rhetoric. Rather, 
transhumanism will grow to the extent it is able to acknowledge these 
problems and take them into account. If our opponents have a good 
point, let's incorporate that into out thinking and be grateful that 
they pointed it out to us -- then we will have one vulnerable spot 
less in future encounters.

The FAQ would not have been possible without the input from many 
people. At least 50 persons have contributed and I'm grateful to all 
of you. Two persons must be especially mentioned: Kathryn Aegis, who 
provided painstaking editorial help as well as valuable advise and 
contributions to the content, and Anders Sandberg, who gave detailed 
feedback, wrote some of the answers, and provided ideas for many of 
them.

The FAQ will be continuously updated and modified. Especially the 
initial round of feedback now might well necessitate substantial 
revisions.

I suggest that we use critlink for comments on particular points of 
substance and style, whereas more general comments can be made to the 
lists.

The home of the FAQ is:

http://www.transhumanist.org

If you want to look at it with critlink, you go to:
http://www.crit.org/http://www.transhumanist.org

Now I will just have to sit back and await your judgement.

Submissions should be accompanied by a short written composition 
of up to 100 words explaining why the entries would make good 
names for the miniature probes. In the case of duplicate names, 
the judges' selection will be based on this composition.  Final 
selection of the probe names will be made by NASA Headquarters.  

     The deadline is April 30, 1999 and NASA will announce the 
winners in early November this year. The top 25 finalists will 
receive one copy each of a Deep Space 2 poster signed by project 
team leaders. Complete rules, an entry form and further 
information about Deep Space 2 are available at 
http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds2/ or by writing to: Name the Mars 
Microprobe Contest, JPL, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, MS 301-235, 
Pasadena, California 91109.  

     Prize monies, provided by Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. 
and CompUSA, will not be administered through NASA, but rather 
will go directly from the donating companies to the winner. 
Although NASA, JPL, International Technology Education 
Association, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and CompUSA employees and 
their families are eligible to enter and win the contest, they 
would not be eligible to collect the grand prize, which would go 
instead to the first runner-up. 

     Deep Space 2's probes are piggybacking on the Mars Polar 
Lander spacecraft, which launched January 3, and will impact and 
penetrate the surface of Mars this December. Each probe has an 
entry system consisting of a basketball-sized aeroshell with a 
softball-sized probe inside. Released from the cruise stage of 
the Mars Polar Lander, the probes will dive toward the surface of 
Mars. Unlike any spacecraft before, the probes will smash into 
the planet at speeds of up to 200 meters per second (400 miles 
per hour). Upon impact, the forebody of each probe will bury 
itself up to about one meter (three feet) underground, while the 
aftbody remains on the surface to transmit data through the Mars 
Global Surveyor spacecraft back to Earth. 

     The purpose of the mission, which is managed by NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, is to 
flight-test new technologies to enable future science missions. 
If successful, Deep Space 2 will demonstrate innovative 
approaches to entering a planet's atmosphere, surviving a crash-
impact and penetrating below a planet's surface. As a secondary 
goal, the probes will search for water ice under Mars' surface. 

     JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology, 
Pasadena, California.

My emotions tell me your opinion on patents is correct but my mind tells
me you're wrong. Before a major new drug can come on the market a company
must shell out close to a billion dollars to pay for the research and development.
If they didn't have patent protection for at least a few years after that they could never
recover their investment,  other companies would crank out dirt cheap generic versions
by the ton. Only a fool would develop a new drug, as a stockholder I would sell my
stock in any drug company that was so stupid as to spend any money at all on
research. I think new drugs are a good thing so I must reluctantly conclude that
patents are too.

WTA Update 3
20 February 1999


Dear member,

Time for a new update.

Things continue to go well. Membership numbers are now up to 466 (from
275 last October). Reading the membership file recently, where many
have used the comments-section to say a few words about themselves, it
became clear to me that there is a huge untapped potential among our
members. As a group, we possess an astonishing amount of talent,
skills, and resources. And many stated that they were very eager to
contribute, if only they knew what would be a suitable way of doing
so. A challenge facing us is thus: how to release this potential?

>From experience, it appears that coordination through a central
mailing list is not an effective means of getting things done. Such
lists are great for theoretical discussions but not so good for
practical planning. I've been thinking a bit about this, and maybe one
way to go is through local groups. Transcedo organized a great
conference last year, and Aleph is doing the same this year (see
below); local groups have also put up web sites and attracted some
media attention. We should encourage the formation of more local
groups.

Those of you who are interested in this may wish to go to
http://www.transhumanism.com/groups.htm, which lists contact
information for people in various parts of the world who want to get
in contact with other transhumanists in their region. If there is
somebody where you live, contact them; if not, you may want to submit
your own details and we'll add it to the list. Once a region attains
critical mass (which doesn't need to be very large), one of you may
take the initiative and form an organization.

More news:

The FAQ project has been completed! The WTA is proud to present this
15000-word document, which attempts to answer the most frequently
asked questions about transhumanism. It is meant to be useful for
experienced transhumanists and newcomers alike, and for journalists
and for people talking to journalists. In addition to whatever
practical usefulness it may have, the FAQ also represents an effort
towards developing transhumanist ideas into a coherent world view. Do
check it out at: http://www.transhumanist.org It will be continuously
updated and revised in response to new ideas and your critical
feedback. If you want to comment on it, you can do so by viewing it
through CritLink: http://www.crit.org/http://transhumanist.org. More
than 50 persons have contributed to the FAQ. Thanks to all of you!

A new issue of the Journal of Transhumanism was published a while ago:
A survey of attitudes about cryonics, by Scott Badger. The JTH is at
http://www.transhumanist.com.

Finally, some exciting events coming up: In June 4-6, Stockholm,
TransVision99, the second European transhumanist gathering. I expect
this to replicate the fun, informal, friendly atmosphere of TV98. Then
on August 7-8 we have EXTRO-4, in California, which might turn out to
be the biggest transhumanist conference in the world so far. The
Extropy Institute will do its best to match and surpass EXTRO-3 (not
an easy task). Links to both of these events can be found at
http://www.transhumanism.com/events.htm

Take care!
Nick Bostrom

For next issue of the Extropy Institute newsletter, I'm looking for news
items (from ExI members, although significant non-member items may be
included):

Have you published any papers of extropian interest recently?

Developments in projects in which you are involved?

Do have you have jobs to offer to extropians, or are you looking to work
with other extropians?

Have you updated your web site recently and want other extropians to come
and visit?

Do you have any new items on research breakthroughs or other news (that we
cannot reproduce without copyright infringement)?

Don't assume that I know about or will remember to include something you've
done lately! Please send a reminder to me tagged for Exponent.

Thanks very much!

As much as I admire Rand for her fiction as well as her philosophy, I do
not agree with her views on fine arts.

Please explain what logic you are referring to, as I would like to discuss
it with you, as someone who is not an Objectivist, but has knowledge of same.

I did look for the essay you suggested we read, but could not locate it.

Congratulations on the FAQ, Nick!  

There are two areas that need rethinking:

First, one area where I did stumble was re extropianism and politics: As an
extropian (and on the Advisory Council) I am *NOT* a libertarian.  I am
someone who votes on issues and not party aligned.  This is important.  I
don't want to be associated with any one political group, and since I do
hold a position with Extropy Institute, I do not want to be affiliated with
a particular political party. This has been started by many extropians and
it should be respected. 

Secondly, Max More originally defined Transhumanism.  Where you say,  "The
definition of transhumanism is based on contributions by many people,
especially Kathryn Aegis and Max More" I find this inaccurate.  Let's be
honest here and if we are going to credit people for their work done, let's
do it with integrity.  Many of people put a lot of work into the redefining
of transhumanism on the list, and surely Kathryn did work on this with some
good suggestions as well as a number of other folks, but the credit goes to
Max More for having created the world view of transhumanism and whomever
redefines thereafter surely should be recognized within their own
particular circles and affiliations with this in mind.

These two areas are of concern to me because they have been lurking around
for a while now and I don't understand why this is necessary.  It doesn't
take a rocket scientist to see that the fact that these two particular
areas are still unsettled.

Thank you Nick for your continued work on transhumanism.  I hope we can
once and for all deal with the above as transhumanists and realize that
extropians are not desirous of creating lines but by advancing thinking to
be welcome people and to work together.

Best,

Natasha

Reduction in the body content of DDE in the Mongolian gerbil 
treated with sucrose
polyester and caloric restriction.
Mutter LC, Blanke RV, Jandacek RJ, Guzelian PS
Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 1988 Mar 15 92:3 428-35

Abstract
It has previously been shown that oral administration to rats of 
sucrose polyester (SPE4), a nonabsorbable
lipophilic binding agent, greatly stimulates the fecal excretion of 
coorally administered DDT5 (R.J. Jandacek,
1982, Drug Metab. Rev., 13, 695-714). To determine whether this 
agent would stimulate the excretion of
persistent metabolites of DDT stored in body tissues, we treated a 
group of gerbils with [14C]-DDT and
monitored the fecal excretion of radioactivity for several months 
until a terminal, log-linear phase of excretion
was observed. At this point, when greater than 75% of the fecal 
radioactivity was identified as [14C]DDE, we
fed the animals diets containing up to 10% sucrose polyester and 
found that the rate of excretion of
radioactivity in the stool promptly increased two to three times as 
compared to the rate in the preceding
control period. Some rats were subjected to a 25-50% restriction 
in total food allotment, but this produced
no significant change in fecal excretion of total radioactivity. 
However, when food restriction was combined
with administration of sucrose polyester, there was a dramatic, 
eightfold average increase in excretion of
fecal radioactivity. This synergistic effect was reversed (within 24 
hr) when the animals were transferred to a
normal diet. Measurement of total body radioactivity confirmed that 
food restriction plus sucrose polyester
treatment reduced the body content of the pesticide. We conclude 
that stimulation of intestinal excretion
may offer a new approach to treatment of patients exposed to 
lipophilic environmental contaminants.

Let us also remember, when one invokes cultural tradition in an attempt to justify Japan's xenophobic Superior Dance, that Sharia and Purda are also cultural (Islamic) traditions, and that they support the concept of women as chattel, honor killings (samurai), assassins as heaven-bound martyrs (shades of ninja and kamikazi!), clitorectomy, and vaginal-labial infibulation (genital footbinding).  Will anyone here have the gall to say that culture or tradition renders these barbaric practices defensible?

I subscribe to Scientific American, and the cover story on the March
issue, which came today, is all about Venus and its evolution.  Should be
a good counter to the Velikovskian speculations.  It won't appear on
newsstands for a few days, but watch for it - a dramatic cover painting
of a volcanic early Venus.

Since only a few of you subscribe to ExI's InvestingNode email list, I want
to alert those of you interesting in investing in biotech companies. I
posted my notes (a couple of thousand words) from a Saturday morning
seminar. Companies covered include Advanced Tissue Sciences, LifeCell, and
Cohesion Technologies.

If you're not on the InvestingNode but want to read the notes, I can send
you it by email. Or you can read the post I made yesterday on the
biotechnology discussion board at The Motley Fool. http://www.fool.com

My highest level of educational acheivement being merely a MS.  So I'm
educationally challenged. 

One of the reasons I keep close tabs on this list is it's educational
(political, economic, etc) content.

I suppose you are referring to the sentence: "Politically, the 
extropians align with libertarians on many economic and social 
issues, although this does not form part of their formal 
definition."; that is the only place in the FAQ where any association 
between extropians and libertarians is made. I could replace that 
sentence with a direct quote from The Extropian FAQ: "Politically, 
extropians are close kin to the libertarians" 
(http://www.extropy.com/faq/whatis.html), if that is more accurate. 
What do you think?

What I meant was that the definition used in the FAQ is especially 
due to these two people (and that is entirely accurate). So I could 
change it to "The definition used in this FAQ is based...". Would 
that satisfy you?

> Secondly, Max More originally defined Transhumanism. 

With all due respect to Max, I don't think that is quite accurate. 
The term was coined by Julian Huxley in 1957. The concept has 
formed gradually under the influence of many people, including 
important contributions from Max. But no one person defined or 
originated transhumanism.

Sorry about that. I guess I was having a bad day.  What I should have said
was something more like this:

Velikovsky's ideas are pure fantasy, so far removed from reality that no
serious astronomer would give them a second thought.  There seem to be a few
people who take him seriously, but most of them fall into the same category
as those guys who think the world is really flat and the Apollo moon
landings were all faked.  I try to avoid arguing with people like that
because it isn't productive - the discussion just degenerates into a flame
war.

Now, when someone who hasn't heard about Velikovsky asks about the subject,
I'll certainly fill them in on the story.  If you are interested in why some
particular point does or does not make sense, I'll be happy to pass on my
impression of the current consensus view.  The same thing goes for any other
dubious theory that may come up.

  IAN: Michael, can you point me to a physics 
  book that explains how the atmosphere can 
  enable an object to fall faster than the 
  same object dropped in a vacuum? If not, 
  then what's your point?

  My main point is that an initial horizontal 
  velocity will not allow an object to fall 
  faster than the fall rate in a vacuum. A
  few simple thought experiments confirm that.
  Since you appear to offer counter-points
  to my analysis, I'd like to understand why 
  you felt my main point needed correction,
  or were you simply addressing a tangential?

I agree with you on most of your statement.  However, Max's writing on
transhumanism is indeed separate from what Julian Huxley intention with
transhuman meaning "man remaining man." 

Let me quote from my book _Create/Recreate_:

Ideas about humanity and evolution were explored by Julian Huxley in his
writings on evolutionary humanism in the book Evolution: The Modern
Synthesis (1942) and Teilhard de Chardin in The Future of Man (1959). In
1966, FM-2030 (formerly, F.M. Esfandiary) outlined an evolutionary
transhuman future while teaching New Concepts of the Human at the New
School for Social Research, New York City.  Abraham Maslow referred to
transhumans in Toward a Psychology of Being,(1968), and Robert Ettinger
authored Man into Superman (1972).  

In the dictionary, transhuman is defined as meaning superhuman, and
transhumanize, meaning to elevate or transform to something beyond what
is human (Websters New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, 1983). Yet, this
is not a complete and contemporary meaning.  Today, we refer to transhuman
as meaning an evolutionary transition from being human to becoming posthuman.

The actual concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition was first
expressed by FM-2030.  His trilogy, Up-Wingers, Telespheres and Optimism
One (1973) constitutes the beginnings of the transhumanist philosophy, as
well as his contributing final chapter in Woman, Year 2000, (1972).

FM later defined transhuman as a new kind of being crystallizing from the
monumental breakthroughs of the late twentieth century. ... the earliest
manifestations of a new evolutionary being.  Later, he authored the book
Are You A Transhuman? (1989)   

Transhumanism has a slightly different beginning.  Julian Huxleys book
written in 1956,  New Bottles For New Wine, contains the essay
TRANSHUMANISM  which sets  out  to explain how humans must establish a
better environment for themselves.  He also alludes to a new species that
the human might eventually become. The difference in Huxleys transhumanism
and Max Mores transhumanism is that Huxley states man remaining man but
transcending himself.  Transhumanism as defined by Max More explains the
overcoming of human limits and the transformation from being human to
becoming posthuman. Although Huxley had a vision of a possible future for
humanity, he single-tracked the future when he saw man remaining man.

with our current system of software being given a copyright, the way
i understand it is anyone can legally develop a word processor that works
exactly like microsloth's with the exception that it cannot read or
write ms word compatible documents.

china has been notoriously weak in protecting intellectual property.  i
understand that the chinese are now taking u.s. software and creating
one-offs by changing a few lines of code so that they cannot read files
created in the original.

sounds like a great scam, until you hear that every chinese coder wants
to become the next birr gates, and consequently makes the software
incompatible with anyone elses.   china is developing a situation
where everyone flees from standards and eschews intellectual property
protection.  the utter chaos that will result will make them cheerfully hand
over a few hundred to birr gates for office xx slothware.  spike

I agree with some of her views on the arts, but not all of them.  My views
i nthis area are under constant revision.:)  You can see some of my
thoughts on this at:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/4612/ust/ust.html

and related links.  (I've also had a few essays that were posted elsewhere,
but that link is dead.)  Most of my esthetics thought grows out of Rand's --
using her ideas as my starting point, but hopefully not being trapped in her
universe.:)

No need for a physics book. It is rather simple. If you cannot concede this
point you are either supremely stupid or supremely stubborn, or both:

a body is moving forward in flight at 400 mph. It suddenly changes its angle of
attack to a negative orientation, as it stalls out, losing upward lift. This
does not mean that it is no longer moving forward at all. A plane can easily
stall out at any speed. Stalling is the loss of laminar flow resulting in the
loss of lift to support a vehicle in flight, which results most easily from a
vehicle being at an extreme angle of attack (more than 20 or 30 degrees). When
the vehicle stalls out, its nose drops, and will frequently drop far below a
zero degree angle of attack. The plane will go into a dive, and the forward
velocity, acting on the negatively oriented lifting surfaces, generate lift in a
DOWNWARD direction, thus accelerating the vehicle downward at a rate greater
than that cause merely by gravity.

If you cannot understand this simple point I can scarcely understand how you can
make it through a day. I am sorry to everyone for the level of vitriol in my
post, but I have really reached the end of my patience with this idiocy. If Mr.
Goddard cannot understand matters of extremely simple aerodynamics then he is
scarcely someone who is even partially qualified to judge what happened to TWA
800.

 Loans by the Fed increase the money supply because the money involved

 Yes, there will be plenty of unusual factors affecting the demand for
money. If the Fed judges the magnitude of these effects exactly, it can
keep prices of average goods stable. I doubt the Fed will be able to
anticipate unusual effects perfectly.

 Either the contract was made when gold was near $400/oz., or it was

 Exchange rate risks stop many risk-averse people. Without being able to
predict exchange rates, you can't know whether a 5% return in U.S. dollars
is better than a 1% return in Yen. Governments probably intervene in the
currency markets at random to discourage the average person from engaging
in this kind of arbitrage.
 Also, it's harder for someone who doesn't understand English to evaluate
U.S. investments.

I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about in the
above-sentence.

What I advocate is freedom of choice.  As far as I understand, Extropy
Institute does not align itself with any one political party.  As for Max,
he is an individual and can choose for himself.

The enormous bulk of this cost is for regulatory compliance and marketing 
Dithc the regulations and hte cost is minimal and many more companies 
will enter the market.

In a non-patent & non-FDA world, without having carried out product 
safety tests for themselves, any generic rip-offs would expose themselves 
to product liability. This is not true now as FDA approval for the 
originator protects the post-patent generics. Get rid of the FDA and the 
barrier to generics would raise substantially.

Well, many of us might argue that cheap drugs by the tonne is a good 
thing. 

Critically, you ignore the power of branding. If what you say was 
correct, Philip Morris would not be the 100 billion dollar company which 
it is. Nor would Coca Cola. Neither have a patent on their commodity. 
Plus, the sword cuts both ways, the company can market its competitor's 
products (after it does its own risk research).

I don't think you would, anymore than you would sell your shares in Cisco 
because they do research but never use patents aggressively.

The Cisco chair simply believes that patents are not the way to do 
business.

Firstly, I would note that libertarianism is not a political party, it is 
a philosophy. 

Also, I would be willing to argue that it would be very hard to be 
extropian and not believe in maximal liberty for individuals and minimal 
government, probably as defined by Rand as zero government outside 
defending the (libertarian) constitution. 

Still, I agree that  one does not need to belong to the Libertarian Party 
to be extropian nor does the minimal definition of extropian views on 
political life, as above, correspond to hard-core libertarianism.

I wonder what the resolution is? Transhumanism must have a political 
philosophy of some kind if it is a minimally complete view of human 
future. 

I propose this passage:

"Transhumans do not view any larger organisation which they may join from 
time to time as being in any way transcendent of their individual selves. 
Their politics are constrained by this principle.

In particular, Transhumanism excludes all communitarian forms of 
government based on notions that any other individual, "society", or any 
other entity has any call upon them which transcends the transhumanist's 
individual choices. 

Several rights which all transhumanists accept extend from this notion of 
self as personal property and are an essential element of Transhumanism.

An exemplar right which may be derived from these transhuman principles 
is that suicide is a human right."

>Secondly, ... the credit goes to
>Max More for having created the world view of transhumanism

Yes. Let's just say "Max More defined Transhumanism."

Drat.  Guess that rules me out.

You explicitly denied being libertarian (and also said something
about a political party, but that's not really relevant ;).

Now *I* have no idea. :) Libertarianism is a philosophy, which in part
deals with politics (or the lack thereof).  There is also a Libertarian
Party, but it is less libertarian than it once was, and many people
(including myself) refer to ourselves as "libertarians", to distinguish
us from "Libertarians" who are part of a political party.  
Now.  
Given that libertarianism is the belief that force should not be used
except in self-defense, do you believe that the term is no longer
compatible with "extropy"?  If so, why has this changed (since 
*someone* put this into the extropy memeset)?

Yes, it is a philosophical outlook.  However, there is a libertarian party,
and it's on the ballot, and it requires votes to get the job done.  Those
who are active libertarians do want their agenda to be active, I would think.

I would like to see minimal government, and maximum intelligent local and
international planning.

This is what I had thought, and as far as I know he published writing and
explanation on the philosophy of transhumanism in 1990 (approx.).
Definitions change, and we as transhumans thrive on flexibility and our
ideas and values will change over the years.  I did go over the post on the
threads regarding the definition of transhumanism back in April and October
'98. Max did agree that it could be updated and did so with his 2-level
definition and with the help and suggestions of folks on this list in an
open and collaborative fashion.

No mystery here, Natasha; you simply have a hard line Randian "libertarian" attempting a little Stalinist browbeating via namecalling.  I also predict howls in response to this post. We have a saying in the South: "The bit dog barks."  The rabidly randy Randians know who they are (and unfortunately, so do we, because we've heard from them ad nauseum infinitum).  So, howl away!

He is noting that not being a libertarian means that you believe in using 
force to compel individuals to obey authority: that is the core 
definition of libertarianism: no first-use force, ever.

That doesn't answer the question? Do you believe that it is moral to use 
force to achieve political ends? To make this concrete, is it transhuman 
to have freedom of choice about paying taxes?

Libertarianism is not a party anymore than republicans "are" capitalism. 
Parties are at best imperfect instantiations of a philosophy.

Libertarianism is a political philosophy emphasizing the rights of the
individual and its doctrine  stresses the right to self-ownership and, by
extension, the right to private ownership of material resources and
property. Most oppose any form of taxation and was espoused by  anarchists
in the 19th century. 

In 1970s Libertarianism reappeared in U.S. political thinking representing
individual liberty in light a bulging government entering in all aspects of
life. The party was founded in the U.S. in 1972 and "candidates have run
for political office, including the presidency, in all 50 states, but it
has not won enough adherents to be a major political force."

Now:  Rights of the individual is extropian.  Taxes happen, and although I
oppose them I'd rather pay than go to jail.  Also, I do not mind paying
some of my taxes.  Growing government control is an issue that Americans
need to deal with in the best ways possible.  The Libertarian Party does
not get enough votes to swing any major political force.  There are other
alternatives that I would like to be involved with.  

I think Milton Friedman's talk at the Cato Conference a few months ago was
an important reminder of the too much government control.  "In my view,
reducing the scope of government is our most important single objective."
(Friedman)

Do I think that force should only be used in self-defense?  Do you mean
would I push my views on someone against their will?  No.  Do I think
government should push its views on me against my will?  No.

Yes, you've misunderstood, Randall. Extropianism, certainly as it is today,
does not *require* you to be a libertarian (however exactly you define
that). Extropianism is NOT a commitment to particular beliefs, and that
includes the role of government. Many Extropians may call themselves
libertarians (and mean fairly different things by it), but other may
(perfectly legitimately) not.

ExI's FAQ entry on this was years old, and in need of revision to make this
important point clear. I've just put up a revision that expresses the
relationship of political views to extropianism at:

Well, I think he is wrong to draw this conclusion.  Just because I say that
I do not align myself with a libertarianism does not mean that I believe in
force.

No.

Transhuman is an evolution from human to posthuman.  I think what you mean
is rather: is it transhumanist to have freedom of choice about paying taxes?

This is a political question and I don't have a freedom about not paying
taxes in the country I live in at this particular time.

I was referring to the Libertarian Party.

Tim: You raise some interesting points...

Many of us may well agree that affirming the principles of Open Society and
Self-Direction means in practice something like a libertarian view. But
others may think some government services or regulations actually support
those principles. Some may favor government subsidies for basic research.
Personally, I do not, but if someone favored that because they believed in
"market failure" for basic research, I would not see this as incompatible
with being extropian.

>future. 

In regard to transhumanism (as a genus, of which Extropianism is a
species), it seems quite tricky to determine what limits to set to
political views. The core idea of transhumanism, in whatever form, is using
realistic methods to overcome human limits.

>I propose this passage:

>Their politics are constrained by this principle.

I don't see how this can be justified as a requirement for transhumanists
in general, though I think it does fit the Self-Direction principle of
Extropianism. Why can't there be collectivist transhumanists? (Call them
The Borgists.) Or socialist transhumanists? Or technocratic socialists
(H.G. Wells?) Or even racist transhumanists who put the transcendence of
some group first?

>In particular, Transhumanism excludes all communitarian forms of 
>government based on notions that any other individual, "society", or any 
>other entity has any call upon them which transcends the transhumanist's 
>individual choices. 

Why? Transhumanism has much in common with humanism. Plenty of humanists
(most) put humanity as a whole ahead of individuals, although many clearly
do not. I don't see why transhumanism in general should rule out that
diversity of politics. If someone wants to be known as a transhumanist who
rejects the idea of subordination to the collective, they can call
themselves an Extropian transhumanist... or some other kind of
transhumanist view that might arise that shares Extropianism's
Self-Direction but differs on some other important point.

>>Secondly, ... the credit goes to

>Yes. Let's just say "Max More defined Transhumanism."

Thank you. Huxley did, as Natasha pointed out, use the term in a different
sense (more outside the individual rather than transcending the human
condition), and I was the first to use the term "transhumanism" in its
current sense, the first to formally define it (I'm now happy with the
definition on the WTA site, to which I contributed), and the first to write
an essay on it, in 1990.

I do think the WTA FAQ is unjust in not giving me that credit. Hey, if I
don't get paid for this work, at least I want payment in the form of credit!

Yes, it's *compatible* with extropianism. But it is not *required* by
extropianism.

There's a classic short story about "slow glass," glass that requires a
year
or more for light to travel through it.  Look through a slow glass window
and
see what was happening a year ago.  I didn't think that this story would
come
true, but they're getting closer.  Light travels through empty space at
over
186,000 miles per second, but it travels more slowly through air, water,
or
glass.  It's still thousands of miles per second through those materials.
They announced on NPR today that scientists have invented an exotic
material
that slows light down to 38 mph.  Less than highway speed.  They think
that in
the future they may be able to slow light literally to a snail's pace. 
Their
immediate plans are to use the material for scientific tests, but they're
trying to think of technological applications for it.  It may have
applications in optical computers, computers that use light instead of
electricity for computation.

It's 1999 all right.  We'll have stardrives yet.  Come to think of it, I
drove
faster than light today.

Ok, I'll do that.

I agree with that. This is how I now see it: Huxley introduced the 
term, but he used it for a different (though related) concept 
than the modern one. The concept itself evolved gradually under the 
influence of many people. Ettinger and FM then came up with 
definitions of 'transhuman' that are fairly similar to the ones we 
are using now. Then Max defined, for the first time, the word 
transhumanism in the modern sense. Subsequently, the definitions of 
both 'transhuman' and 'transhumanism' have been refined, but their 
meaning remain basically the ones formulated by Ettinger and FM (for 
'transhuman') and by Max (for 'transhumanism').

Would it be adequate if I insert the following sentence in the 
Cultural antecedents section?

"Max More wrote the first definition of the word 'transhumanism' in 
its modern sense."

BTW, I can't upload anything to the web server at the moment, so it 
may take a couple of days before these modifications will appear 
online.

I have changed the problematic sentence to

"Politically, the extropians oppose authoritarian social control and
favor the rule of law and decentralization of power."

grafted directly from the Max's new clarified extropian FAQ entry at 
(http://www.extropy.org/faq/govt.html). But I will only use it if ExI 
think it is a fair description of their politics.

Who said 'bad'? But too clever - maybe.
Look, they haven't spend a dime on R&D expenses, and they want a 
technology for free. Of course, westerners feel robbed off and offended, 
it is understandable. (Frankly, I don't care much about western world, 
but I definitely see their point :)
The firms that invented something did it in order to survive in the 
free-market competition, remember that pure egoism, and not humanitarian 
ideals back up the progress.
So, who said that there is a free cheese? Technology and information 
have some value too.

It's tough to recommend just one or a couple of pieces.  From the instrumental
music, I'd recommend "Hot Rats" from the end of his early period and "Jazz
>From Hell" from his later period.  The vocal music varies from light to heavy
satire, and as has been pointed out, some of it is pretty rough.  I personally
think "One Size Fits All" is the best, with the songs "Inca Roads" (spoof on
new age and UFO BS) and "Sofa" (spoof on German metaphysical philosophy --
there's not much rock that lampoons Kant) being two of the funniest and most
sophisticated pieces of vocal music of the age.

That looks like the kind of comment for which CritLink would be 
ideal.

Actually, in his latest book "Robot", Moravec explicitly proposes 
that laws require that robots be built "securely nice in the first 
place". "Every neuance of their motivation is a design choice. They 
can be constructed to enjoy the role of servant to humankind." And it 
is a "matter of life and death to humans" that they "do not have a 
right to vote on the laws that govern and tax them." (pp139-40). In 
the long run, Moravec looks forward to advanced robots superseding
humans and taking over the universe, but we both can and should 
ensure a comfortable retirement for humanity by programming in 
suitable "internal laws" in our mind children.

Well, the Doppler Effect causes a red shift in light from a receding
object.

Assume a case where there are two vertical force components: gravity and
net vertical aerodynamic force (which includes vertical drag).  If
gravity and the net vertical aerodynamic force each point down, the total
downward force exceeds that from gravity alone, so the object would
initially accelerate downward faster than it would fall under gravity
alone in a vacuum.  F = ma.


In practice, as the speed of fall increases, drag will limit the speed. 
Things which fall a very long distance through air would be travelling at
terminal velocity for most of the fall.  A sky diver reaches terminal
velocity in 3 to 5 seconds.

The index of refraction of vacuum is 1.  The index of refraction of air
is a little more than 1.  Glass is about 1.4.  Diamond is about 2.4.  The
speed of light in a transparent material medium is slowed relative to the
speed in vacuum in proportion to the refractive index.  Light speed
through a material with a refractive index of 2 is half the speed in a
vacuum.

  IAN: But your jet still has thrust. FL800 in the 
  CIA video shows each engine flame out just before
  it reaches the peak of it's rocket-like climb,
  so we're talking about a fall without thrust
  and almost no initial horizontal velocity.

  It seems that it may be possible at extreme
  speeds in an example such as you observe to 
  temporary exceed vacuum fall rate, but at 
  the top of the CIA-depicted climb, FL800 
  was out of steam. Also, once the falling 
  object reaches terminal velocity, it could
  not possibly keep pace with a vacuum fall.

well, it is not necessarily under thrust but it would need
forward velocity.  partially agreed.  {8-]

i admit i have not studied the cia version of the fl800 story.  the
details of what happened after the explosion have never interested
me much because there must be a great deal of guesswork.

but when the thing first happened, i thought i recall the investigators
proposing an explosion that originated *inside* the fuel tank.
this i found most improbable, even if an ignition source were to
be found.  i think it was mike lorrey who described patching leaky fuel
tanks in aircraft with gum.  {8^D  that makes me howl just thinking
about it.  that would suggest an ignition *outside* the tank
which presents a whole nuther set of questions.  either way ian,
i am partially with you in that i think the official version
underexplains
the explosion.  im not too concerned about the 29 second plunge tho.
i figure they estimated here, guessed a little there.  ive seen plenty
of
reports like that.  either way, it does little to improve the morale of
of one like me who flies on the durn things a lot.  {8-[  spike

Let's see how complicated it could possibly be, the human genome is 6
billion base pairs long, there are 4 bases so each base can represent 2
bits and there are 8 bits per byte. That comes out to 1.5 gigabytes,
however 80% of that is junk DNA so the working genome of the entire
human body is 300 megabytes. A chimpanzee's genome is only about 1%
different from a human one, so I think I'm being very generous if I say
that 10% of our working DNA involves intelligence. Thus a seed
intelligence able to grow in power as it interacts with the environment
as a newborn baby does can be specified with just 30 megabytes and
probably much less.

Unless the brain works on quantum mechanical principles, (which seems
unlikely) and some of those 30 megabytes are instructions for
constructing a quantum computer then modern hardware is probably
adequate for a AI seed. Of course I don't know what those 30 megabytes
are so I have no idea how to actually build the damn thing.

I CritLink'd it, but bear in mind that I didn't see any reference from
your page to the CritLink version.

I would also suggest that, after the CritLink version has been around
for a while, you take any comments that the reader deserves to hear and
incorporate them into the body of the FAQ.

Well, I suppose that shows the need for programmatic humility in such
discussions.  "Every nuance of their motivation is a design choice." 
Probably didn't occur to him at all that Interim goals could and would
come into existence on their own.  Probably wouldn't have taken any
precautions.  I wonder what would have happened when conflicts arose?

My statement was based on Moravec's review of _Engines of Creation_ in
_Technology Review_ (1986):

"Why should machines millions of times more intelligent, fecund, and
industrious than ourselves exist only to support our ponderous, antique
bodies and dim-witted minds in luxury?"

For the more avant-garde classically minded, I would heartily recommend Zappa/London Symphony Orchestra, Vol.s I & II, conducted by Kent Nagano; Boulez Condicts Zappa/The Perfect Stranger and other chamber works performed by the Ensemble Intercontemporain and the Barking Pumpkin Digital Gratification Consort; and the two volume set The Yellow Shark, conducted by Frank Zappa and performed by the Ensemble Modern.

The FAQ is an extraordinary document.  I want to thank everyone who
contributed to the document.  Especially though, I'd like to thank Nick
and others for taking the time out of their busy schedules to craft the
large amount of discourse the prospect of the FAQ generated a few months
ago into a succinct, accessible document.

These kinds of analyses ignore the costs of patent enforcement and the 
benefits of incremental improvement.  Rigorous enforcement of emerging 
US patent law would almost end software innovation since every couple 
lines of code you write will require a patent search.  

What happens in industries like (until 
recently) fashion and software algorithms is that each new idea is only
developed when it is relatively cheap but that most new achievements in
turn make other achievements relatively cheap (in particular, incremental
improvements).

Twice in the 19th century (Netherlands 1830s to 1850s and Switzerland 1870s
to 1890s) patent laws were repealed mostly for ideological reasons (ideas
should be free, etc.)  In neither case did technological innovation decrease.
In Switzerland this coincided with a spectacular increase in chemical industry
innovation which resulted in the Swiss chemical and pharmeceutical industries.
Once they got large, of course, the new companies lobbied patent laws back
in, ostensibly to protect research (in spite of their own impressive 
achievements without patents) but more plausibly to protect themselves from
competition.

Yes, I plan to use CritLink comments to update the FAQ.

I think you're misinterpreting the analogy.  The DNA is not the actual
hardware which performs the computations for intelligence.  Rather, it
is a blueprint for a hardware which can perform the necessary 
computations and which has a certain but limited pre-programming.

The accurate analogy would be that we could produce a blueprint for
an intelligent machine with current technology.  Actually making
the object the blueprint describes, however, is a different problem.
If we can't test the blueprint, of course, we will be hard-pressed
to decide whether the blueprint we make is valid.  

Incidentally, about 50% of our DNA is involved with the brain, so
10% may be low.  Naturally shifting from 30 megs to 150 megs makes
no qualitative difference to your argument.

I have a question to pose to the list, and I am hoping to make it aat 
least interesting. The question is, does anyone know of sources for 
studying Cognitive Science and Psychiatry? I am getting more interested 
in these fields, and am looking to eventually practise these 
professionally. I have a long way to go, so even basic sources, how to 
get in to graduate schools, backgrounds, etc. 
The reason for my interest, and why I think this list might be the place 
to look/discuss, is something odd I've noticed about very intelligent. I 
know my own IQ is fairly high (to risk immodesty in order to get to the 
point), and most of my friends seem intellectually the same. The problem 
is that so many of them are, besides being highly intelligent, prone to 
self-sabotage. They've bought into believing that they're not 'worthy' 
of success, that being bright somehow makes them bad, etc. My interest 
is in studying both how this comes about, and how to cure it. How do 
ideas trasnlate into changes in the brains physical structure, how to 
reverse these changes, etc. I am hoping this list finds this 
sufficiently relevant, interesting, etc. 
Thanks, 
Mike Bast (Mbast1@hotmail.com)

You can't make them do anything. They will do it for the same reason we 
allow dogs and butterflys to live. No more, no less.

I hate the FDA as much as anyone but that is a huge exaggeration. The average
non generic drug company spends more than twice as much on
research as a computer company of the same size. FDA or no FDA, any big
company that is not suicidal had better make damn sure that it's product
doesn't kill more people than it saves.

The minimal thing in the drug business is not research but manufacturing. If
Coca Cola cost 10$ a can and generic cola cost 10 cents a can then Coca Cola
would be dead as the dodo. Price disparities of that magnitude are possible in
the drug business.

Why reinvent the wheel? If a reputable drug company conducts safety tests
there is no need to repeat them. Besides, I can make this stuff in my garage,
go ahead and sue me, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

    >Get rid of the FDA and the barrier to generics would raise substantially.

I'd love to dump the FDA, but I don't follow you here.


     >Well, many of us might argue that cheap drugs by the tonne is a good thing.

I would argue that nothing but the same old drugs we've been using for 50
years is not a good thing, regardless of their price.

     >The Cisco chair simply believes that patents are not the way to do business.

Even with all their patents I can't build a router as good as Cisco's and sell
it at 1% of their price.

Empirically, this is not the case. It is not intelligence that is making 
you and your friends depressed.

SSRIs work well ;-) So does  behavior therapy. About the same efficacy 
but Prozac is usually cheaper.

It may have come about because you are in a lower social status position 
than your ability suits you for. That is one evolutionary reason for the 
depressive response and one very good reason for not getting any 
"treatment" unless the depression makes you dysfunctional. At low levels, 
it drives ambition which you need to make it.

If you really want that sentence then it really should read

"Extropianism has no bearing on political philosophy. While many 
extropians are libertarian, the Extropian philosophy is fully compatible 
with communism, facism, and anarchy."

If Extropy really has no bearing on politicla philosophy, then this 
sentence, which many including me would want to say is false, would stand 
as true. Is that the case?

wow! 
an actual experimental verification of the hypothesis. Excellent work 
Curt!

Note also some research in the late 80s and early 90s by RAND Corp into 
the effect of the FDA regs on innovation in the pharmaceutical 
industries. 

Effectively large industry is opposed to a decrease in patent and 
regulatory strings and hoops for the same reason that drug cartels are 
not in favor of legalizing their trade.

Ahh, so if society required you to believe the above, you would disobey

OK. So Stalin is out. So far so good, as Bryan Adams would say.

Max then gives some examples of the market-government mix etc. (quoted 
below for reference).

I note that all of these are based on the freely given consent of their 
participants. ie., some extropians may want to waive their rights freely 
and they can still call themselves extropians. I sort of grok that, 
though i would argue that someone who wants to be coerced into doing 
things they think are wrong is not extropian. Of course no one wants a 
society for the purpose of coercing themselves, they want it to coerce 
others ...

Anyhow, all of this seems to me to still be compatible with saying we are 
all libertarians with one exception. The overlap is as follows

1. All extropians oppose the use of force (Stalin is out).
2. Because of that, we all "allow" anyone else to do whatever 
    the heck they want.
3. We may organise ourselves how we choose (including 
    voluntarily behaving  as if our government had a right 
    to enforce its dictates upon us.

4. But we do not believe that a communitarian society no matter 
    how voluntary its members may be has any right to enforce its
    wishes on nonmembers. 

thus libertarian and max-more extropia will differ in only one respect: A 
libertarian could not recognise a person who voluntarily entered 
Stalinist Russia in the 1930s as being a libertarian: they would see that 
person as signing on as labor for a non-transhuman cause.

Can Extropians view as extropian, emitters of behavior which actively 
opposes the goals of extropia?

Not to be flippant, but in that case, when Max starts up the Extropian

It's not a blueprint, it's a recipe. A blueprint has a one to one correspondence
between any part of itself and a particular part of the depicted object but does not give
any information on construction techniques. With a recipe the inverse is true.

    >Incidentally, about 50% of our DNA is involved with the brain


That could be true I suppose but I very much doubt it is known to be true. At the
present time the function of nearly all human genes is unknown. If it is true then
the main difference between us and chimps, our huge cerebral cortex, must be
made of pretty simple stuff because although we don't know what most of our
genes do we do know that we share almost 99% of them with chimps.
Perhaps it is true, perhaps the parts of our brain that are very similar to those of
many other animals, like the brainstem, are the really complicated parts.
Evolution certainly took far longer to come up with it than our cortex.

Oh boy. I made big semantic mistake. There certainly can be all of these, 
as you describe in your FAQ. I made the mistake of saying "transhumanist" 
when i was thinking "extropian". Now that I understand that some 
transhumanists believe in involuntary sterilisation and genetic 
reprogramming, i will not make this mistake again.

So, wherever i have said "transhumanists" i must now say 
"extropian-transhumanist"  

Now, You [Max] then says something that really clarifies the whole issue 
for me (but will probably upset Damien B?)

>If someone wants to be known as a transhumanist who
>rejects the idea of subordination to the collective, they can call
>themselves an Extropian transhumanist

OK. I am an extropian transhumanist. I am really happy about that but Joe 
dees and Spike and maybe Natasha, as well as Damien Broderick are not 
going to be. 

Max also noted that
>Some [transhumanists wanting to be called extropian] may favor

>Personally, I do not, but if someone favored that because they believed in

Trouble is (apart from contradicting your statement cited above), that 
the government is not a person. If these would-be 
extropian-transhumanists favour government subsidies for university 
professors like myself, they are really either:

1. Making the redundant claim that they themselves favour spending their 
own money on research.

or else

2. Making the non redundant but also non-extropian claim that they favour 
spending other people's money on research.


Position 2 is not compatible with self-direction.

I wonder if we could get some facts and figures on this? I will try and

First, there are very few computer companies the size of a pharmaceutical 
company. Second, most computer companies are commodity producers. 
A relevant comparison group would be microsoft or apple.
Third, research spending is not relevant to the relative cost of 
regulatory compliance relative to research spending. I do not deny that 
Roche spends a lot on research, i merely note that they also do a hell of 
a lot of spending purely for compliance.
 
>FDA or no FDA, any big

Actually, that it kill anyone at all. That is another regulatory cost: 
the FDA regulators could care less about cost benefits, they focus almost 
exclusively on costs. They also outright ban drugs which have as their 
purpose raising the norm rather than meliorating a disability.

Anyhow, to the point: i believe that merely keeping product safety data 
secret (beyond outcome disclosures) would provide a substantial buffer 
against generics.

That is simply not true. The marginal cost of manufacturing a generic is 
identical to the marginal cost of manufacture by the originator.

The need to repeat them is that the data from the safety tests may be 
kept trade secrets.

That is my main point: the big companies can adopt a Philip Morris or 
Unilever or Coca-Cola advantage: i will buy from the large conglomerate 
simply because of their size.

Research by the Rand institute shows clearly that the FDA and not patent 
enforcement are what is responsible for reduced competition and decreased 
drug diversity. In absentia patents, you can bet that i would be up for 
more hours in the middle of the night trying to better my last product, 
just like microsoft programmers are. You can bet that i would be rich 
too, just like those same programmers are. your only protection is the 
idea you have today. Yesterdays Laurels cannot be sat upon.

But Lucent can and that is the competition: no you and me in our labs,

        No.  Extropy itself is separate from any politic; like objectivism
and other philosophies, it is a philosophy which is comprised of certain
facets --in the case of Extropy, these are the Principles.  If a person was
to claim to be both an extropian and a communist, the facets of the
political party would be in obvious conflict with the Principles of
Extropy.  In other words, it would be a contradiction.  Extropy has no
political agenda whatsoever.  The Extropy Institute is a non-profit
organization which promotes the growth of Extropy.

        The question of libertarian compatibility with Extropy is one which
frequently arises, yet seems to be rarely understood.  Extropy has no
association with the Libertarian Party, although many extropians would vote
for this party if there was a member in their riding.  Nothing in the
premises of the Libertarian Party's political agenda is in conflict with
the Extropian Principles --no contradictions can occur.  As for the
libertarian
philosophy, there have been very few tangible guidelines as to what the
philosophy is in the first place.  Generally, libertarians are against the
initiation of violence, and against government intrusion into the privacy of
civilians.  However, other than these and other generalities, there are no
set guidelines for the libertarian philosophy --a beautiful building with a
weak foundation.  Because of this, those who are in accordance with the
Extropian Principles may also see themselves as libertarians as well.

        On the issue of the wording of the FAQ, the aim of the FAQ is to
provide newcomers with a solid understanding of the stand Extropy takes on
a variety of issues.  For those who wish to read deeply into the way each
sentence is written, there will always be a certain amount of androgyny in
each word or phrase.  The FAQ should provide a high degree of clarity,
though those looking for alternate interpretations will find them if they
are clever enough.

Those intelligent machines baby: they are so well armed and informed they 
MOSSAD look like the CIA ;-)

Seriously, i recommend the movie "Demon Seed" 
<http://us.imdb.com/Title?Demon+Seed+(1977)>

It is radically extropian and wonderfully crafted. Someone watch it 
tonight and we can talk. That movie changed my life.

Anyhow, no way that we are making these puppies do anything they don't 
want to do.

I'm lost.  I'd have thought it obvious that the only moral response
compatible with Tim's declared position would be for him to resign
immediately from his state-funded professorship.  It is just such issues
(among others) that prevent me from adopting a gung-ho libertarian posture.

If that's all that's stopping you, then we'll soon have you turned around 
;-)

Seriously, tell me if you think I am simply fooling myself or if i am in 
bed with the enemy.

If it was immoral for me to work in the university, then I should resign. 
However, it would follow that those who did not resign would be immoral 
and subject to sanction.

Now, I in no way feel that i could/should go around killing professors, 
UnaBomber style. That is wrong. Hence I doubt that what i am doing is 
morally wrong.

My position is as follows. 

I publicly advocate against compulsion and state control, I openly state 
my desire for privatised voucher-based education at all levels. I am 
constantly trying to convince people to fund a private University in 
Sydney. I support any student or colleague expressing unpopular 
individualistic views.

However, as long as the government unfairly competes in this market, no 
private provider can successfully compete. Even Melbourne private (a 
"free" arm of a major Australian state Uni) is heavily leveraging its 
government subsidy. 

If i resign, that achieves nothing except for one less thinking person 
hacking from the inside. Convince me otherwise and I will resign.

Now, if I were teaching such things as "the majority is right" and that 
"people are units of the greater whole" or espousing Freudian theory or 
whatever, in order to keep my job, then I would say you are right and i 
would be a hypocrite. But I do not, so until such time as i this changes, 
staying on seems like the action most compatible with extropy.

Another example: the fact that you are currently paying taxes (as are we 
all), doesn't mean that you think they are right, simply that we cannot 
do otherwise without punishing people who have committed no crime. 

Maybe I am wrong? What do others think?

Long live larry flynt,
tim

Yes, some parallels exist there, but dogs and butterflies did not create,
design, engineer, or program us to allow them to live. That makes a big
difference, because the dog and the butterfly did not intend us to exist,
but transhumanist  scientists and technologists intend posthumans to exist.
Intentional design prompts the "core elements of the programming, making
part of an inviolable moral code" as the FAQ mentions.

If developers do _not_ program posthumans to "exist only to support our
ponderous, antique bodies and dim-witted minds in luxury" as Morovec writes,
then for what should (non-augmented) developers develop them? To assume
command of Earth's destiny? To bypass the conscious intent of the human
race? To tell us why we exist? Deus ex machina? No, if "you can't make them
do anything" then you have no rational justification to build them. But you
have every reason to _become_ a transhuman/posthuman.

If transhumans transform themselves into posthumans, non-augmented humans
become the ones that you (as a transhuman) "can't make do anything." Then
why should posthumans/transhumans treat non-augmented humans differently
than non-augmented humans presently treat mentally retarded invalids?

Extropy conspires with life to evolve more highly complex adaptive
ecological systems, and in so doing, creates higher consciousness as an
epiphenomenon. Aside from living among us as "benevolent demigods", does the
FAQ  say anything about the possibility that posthumans may attain a
consciousness of such cosmic proportions that the human will cannot sway it,
much less comprehend it?

Notice, BTW, that although we walk around as "benevolent demigods" to the
dogs and the butterflies, we do not do so among the apes and the monkeys...
nor do we do so among the Neanderthals and the Cro Magnons. (This has
something to do with war, territorial imperatives, and selection, I
suppose.)

Shall the ecology of life on Earth somehow change, and now dictate that
posthumanity _not_ extinguish Homo sapiens Sapiens by the same means that
Homo sapiens Sapiens has extinguished prehistoric man?  Perhaps we should
transcend first, and then compose a FAQ?

We don't need to worry how posthumans will treat non-augmented humans,
because posthumans will have their hands full trying to explain to
non-augmented humans why they shouldn't continue killing each other in wars
and doing similar retarded things (until they, I mean we, finally become
extinct). Ultimately, natural law simply displaces non-augmented humans with
transhumans/posthumans. Non-augmented humans will become another "missing
link" in the evolution of hyper-complex intelligent systems.

This creates a public relations problem, does it? Well, who should we expect
to handle this PR problem better, the non-augmented or the transhumans? No
contest. Everyone will want to become a transhuman. I can see it happening
already.

Why would one assume that nothing can travel faster than c except for the

The theory summarizes what ``we'' knew about motion at various speeds in
vacuum and matter at the point in spacetime when mr Einstein formulated
the theory.

If ``we'' could create a specific matter/space configuration with less
density than vacuum, then ``we'' would need to update the theory to
handle this new case, as it probably would allow for FTL motion.

As far as I know, nobody has discovered such a case yet.

Therefore, currently it appears as if nothing can move faster than c.

You haven't included any information about the capital markets in these countries
during this period. The main argument for patents is as security to obtain
capital, and to establish a capacity to pay back capital without competetive
pressures diluting the firm's ability to do so. At first glance I would venture to
say that the reason those countries ended their experiments with no patent laws
was because too many of their businesses were either patenting in other countries
anyways and were not manufacturing in the patentless countries, or the companies
were losing the rights to their own products in countries which kept patent laws,
as competitors were patenting their products. The third reason would have been
because investors found that the payback on patentless products was not as great
as patented ones...

I would also imagine that those countries started seeing a lack of imports of new
technology, as companies were afraid of firms in those countries steal their
knowledge. If India were a shining light of modernity and industrialization, I
might put some credence to the anti-patent argument. But they have not gone
anywhere near their potential. Their GDP has stagnated and unemployment is now 1/3
of the population. They are an economic basketcase. China is enough better that
they have a useful system, even though to get patent protection it costs a lot of
money in bribes... The so called 'pirate software' industry is mostly just a
scheme by which large software producers can avoid taxes....

You contradict yourself here. There are most certainly government policies which
promote entropy and those which promote extropy. If we are promoting extropy
then we are espousing a political agenda, a bias for some types of government
policies and against others. If you are going to eat your cake, you must also
admit that you are, in fact, eating cake......

This needs to be clarified. There is a distinct difference between the
'initiation of violence' and the 'use of violence'. Both libertarianism and
extopianism abhor the first but espouse the second in the case of the defense of
self or others from agression.

It is hardly a weak foundation. It is merely difficult to build a statist
monobloc on a foundation which refuses to stay in one place as it is told to.
Free men can accomplish far more in association over the long term than any
state unit can by compulsion. It is the foundation of state power which is weak,
because it can easily crumble when it oppresses enough formerly free people.

I believe the 66 2/3% bulge of any bell curve can act as a gravitational
(like) attractor of immense power. There is a continual mimetic tidal force
constantly clawing at the outliers. Those to the left are an economic drag.
Those to the right are a social and economic threat. Just be like us...or
die.

I believe that the advent of liberal capitalism, materialism and the
military industrial complex have been the major factors which have made the
reviling and/or killing of +140 IQ individuals an economically poor
decision. Prior to those events, there was no particular benefit to
intelligence, because everyone was "going to heaven" and reading was
something that was done by the weird, and satanic. Just look at the "heroes
of ancient science". They did their work in secret so as to avoid criminal
prosecution and death. Newton, DaVinci, Servetus, Galileo. Now, if they kill
us, we will stop making their cool gadgets. We're tolerated for the shiny
stuff we make for the bulge.

The fact is, that when a 2 or > sigma individual is growing up, they are
likely to be so different from their parents, peers, that they (we) are
rejected as not able to fit in, and therefore not worthy to fit in.
Rejection by parents/peers is the ultimate psychological injury. The natural
result to a young biological organism which needs love and positive
reinforcement is depression, and neurotic behaviour, followed by a lifelong
expectation of rejection which often becomes a self fulfilling prophesy.

Prior to the web, we got together in universities if we could happen to
afford it. Now, we have lists which provide us with our very own "planet".

This is not intended to be depressing by the way...their are ways out...

The problem with India is that they send all their best engineers
here.  Without the hindrance of IP, their educational system is
cheap and wonderfully effective; they just can't seem to keep 'em
down on the farm after they've educated them.

Samuel Peltzmann wrote a book on this in the early 70's called "The 
Regulation of Pharmaceutical Innovation" or something like that.  He
concludes that the FDA increases the cost of pharmaceutical innovation
but pharmaceutical innovation does have other substantial costs.  I
can't find my copy for an exact quote.  From working in the medical
device industry, I can tell you that regulatory compliance is a large
portion of the costs, probably even the majority, but there are
*definitely* expensive elements to medical device development other
than regulatory requirements.

Both countries in question did at least as well economically without patents
as 
either before or after.  As to why they switched back, my source attributed 
that to political pressure by large corporations - internal for Switzerland
and external for the Netherlands.  Restoring patents didn't improve innovation
measurably in either country.

India has many things holding it back, including tarriff, extensive
regulations,
and mediocre education.  They have improved some of the other things but not
changed their patent laws and, for the last couple years, managed a
respectable
growth rate.  

Ideally your controls for with-patent and without-patent comparisons should
be as close as possible.  A single country that shifts from patents to no
patents
and then back again is a much better (although still flawed) comparison than
two very different countries.

They don't pay royalties to developers either.  When people can buy newly
issued games for 3$ in Malaysia when the official price is $60 the royalties
count more than the taxes even at a European VAT rate.

I remember reading an article a couple of months ago about a new
technology some guys at MIT were working on that involved mirrors that
were nearly 100% reflective.  One of the things they built using their
new ideas was a fiber optic cable that was coated on the inside with
this kind of mirror.  

Does anyone know what I'm talking about and does anyone have links to
somewhere where I can find out more... 

I have no idea where I read this or if it's even true.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Wonder why that is? (smirk).

If I were an Indian engineer looking to make it big I'd research US patents
and use them to develop my own products in India, rather than coming to the
US to compete under the IP 'restrictions' as you allege. Apparently your
position isn't so. They come here because of the freedom of opportunity that
IP gives individuals. Failure to recognize the individuals right to IP is as
bad as the failure to recognise that ANY political right originates in the
individual.

Oh, poppycock.  You know as well as I do that not one single
engineer immigrated with that thought in mind--in fact, since
every one of them was sponsored by an employer who by contract
owns every patent ey might create, ey /could not/ have used
that reasoning by law.  They came for economic opportunity
all right--but not because US patents applied to them as
individuals, it was because they are more likely to find good
work for US corporations than Indian ones (no doubt you'll now
credit that fact to IP law as well; there's about as much
evidence for that as attributing it to curry).

> Failure to recognize the individuals right to IP is as bad as

> in the individual.

Rights that originate in the individual do not include the "right"
to employ state force to prevent other individuals from competing
in the free market--even if the market is one you created.  It is
precisely because I am the most radical individualist and die-hard
capitalist here that I must reject the concept of subsudizing
creativity, which is what patents amount to.  The very idea that
labor creates value--even creative labor--is the socialist
fallacy.  Demand creates value.  Those who demand creative work
will pay for it, and those who perform it will find ways to
maximize their profits whether the state steps in to help or not.
I see as little reason for the state to grant monopolies in these
markets as there is for it to grant monopolies in power or water.

Rights derive from objective facts, not some sense of moral
desert.  Porperty rights are a consequence of the objective fact
that physical property cannot be simultaneously used by two
agents for different purposes.  That same objective fact also
applies to trademarks--intellectual property in scarce namespace,
which I fully support.  It does /not/ apply to patents or to
copyrights, so the analogy misleads.  My use of an idea does
not in any way constrain your use, so there is no reason for me
to invent some right out of thin air to prevent one of us from
using the knowlege in eir head to eir own advantage other than
some vague sense that it is "good" to do so.  I, too, grew up
with the idea that it was "wrong" to copy someone else's work
for my own use, but I've reached my own conclusion on the matter
after seeing the harm caused by that cultural assumption.

Do you claim that light does not go slower in water?

If you do, then you are in error.
If you do not, disregard this text.

			      - - - - - -

Neutrons in a fission reactor move faster than light does in the water.
This causes "Cherenkov radiation", a blueish (most of it is UV) light
without any apparent direct source, in the reactor tank.

Mallet discovered it in 1926, observed that the light had a continuous
spectrum, no band structure like fluorescent light. 

Studied by Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov (1904-1990) from 1934-1938. He proved
that it was not a fluorescence effect, that the light was partially polarized.
Frank and Tamm explained it 1927.

P.A.Cherenkov, I.M.Frank and I.Y.Tamm shared a Nobel prize in 1958 for their
work on the Cherenkov radiation.

    >Rigorous enforcement of emerging US patent law would almost end software
    >innovation

I agree that some patents are much too broad, particularly in the computer field. The
pinnacle of absurdity was reached by Apple (not Microsoft) when they tried to
patent the "look and feel" of their operating system. They claimed they owned
such intangibles because they stole them fair and square from Xerox.


    >Twice in the 19th century (Netherlands 1830s to 1850s and Switzerland 1870s

    >In Switzerland this coincided with a spectacular increase in chemical industry
    >innovation which resulted in the Swiss chemical and pharmeceutical industries.


In the mid 19th century the big money and the most important patents were in the coal
tar dye business and nearly all the advances were made in Germany or Briton.
The Netherlands and Switzerland were minor players and that explains their attitude
toward patents. If you're small and have done no research and have no patents then
it is certainly to your advantage to have patents abolished, no doubt about it. Once you
get big and start to get original ideas that is no longer true


    >Once they got large, of course, the new companies lobbied patent laws back
    >in, ostensibly to protect research

Nothing mysterious here, if you don't have something then you have no interest in
protecting it, when your research department starts producing results patents look
a lot more interesting.

Yes, but the point is one has to pay a huge research and development bill and
one gets a free ride. I think I know which side would win such a contest.
In a non patent world the smart thing to do would be to put a new name on an
old drug and use the money you would have used for research to pay for
advertising to establish a new brand.

Three points:

1) Doctors and their patients would never stand for safety tests conducted in secret,
    I don't have that much confidence in anyone or anything. All drugs have some
    dangers and I'd certainly want to know exactly what they are before I used them.

2) Everything would become public at the very first liability trial.

3) The good thing about patents is that they're not secret, if they were abolished
    the number of trade secrets would increase exponentially and free communication
    between scientists would come to a grinding halt. That's not good.

Incidentally not long ago Lucent filed a big lawsuit against Cisco for violating
their patents.

At some point in the future much of the human race will have their brains
cybernetically augmented and networked to each other and the internet through
a sort of wireless ethernet (complete with firewalls -- I hope).  

As this community of advanced intelligences expands and grows (like the Borg
with firewalls), perhaps including beings from other planets, they/it will
eventually understand and control Biology, Space-Time and Energy-Matter.  Is
this not, then, God?  If it is, wouldn't there then be evidence of his/their
nature in the universe we are now investigating? (since they control space-
time)

What do you think?

There is one difference here.  Apple paid Xerox for the rights to use
their ideas before receiving any technical specifications from Xerox.
Microsoft promised to pay for Apple technology, but then refused to pay
after delivery.

Most people don't know the details of this often-cited case.  Microsoft
purchased technology from Apple which they used to develop Windows,
which was initially intended to be a Macintosh emulator for the PC.
Microsoft promised to pay royalties to Apple on every copy of Windows
sold.  Microsoft then decided not to sell any copies of Windows, and
thus didn't have to pay Apple anything.  Instead, they independently
developed an unrelated product which they dubbed "Windows 2.0".  Apple
argued that Windows 2.0 looked like the same product as "Windows 1.0".
Microsoft successfully argued that the new Windows was rewritten to look
exactly like the old Windows without looking at the source code from
Apple.

Microsoft also did this with their deal with IBM in which they promised
to let IBM have rights to put Windows 3.0 technology into their OS/2
operating system.  Having seen what Microsoft did to Apple, IBM made
sure the contracts gave them rights to Windows 3.0 technology and all
future derivative works.  Microsoft then came out with Windows 95, and
claimed that it was a brand new operating system that was in no way
related to prior versions of Windows.  IBM also tried to claim that
Windows 95 was a derivative of Windows because the functionality was so
similar between the products.  Microsoft again successfully argued that
they were independently written and were in no way related to each
other.

I don't vouch for the accuracy of the numbers here, and this is just part
of the whole story at Techweb...

Max
------------------------

Brought to our attention by RCFoC reader Mark Lewis, this HAL, or more 
properly, HAL-4rW1 Hypercomputer, is said to perform 12.84 trillion 
operations per second. Now that's a nice number, but what does it 
really mean? That's 60,000 times faster than a 350-MHz PC. Looked at 
another way, HAL is to a PC as your PC is to a pocket calculator.


But we expect supercomputers to blow away our PCs. So, perhaps more 
interesting, Star Bridge says, is its HAL, composed of 280 FPGA chips 
from Xilinx, is 10 times faster than IBM's Blue Pacific supercomputer, 
which was called "the world's fastest computer" in October 1998.
And the comparisons get even more interesting:

Power consumption: HAL -- 1,600 watts (it plugs into a standard 
110-volt outlet like a toaster). Blue Pacific (BP) -- 3.9 megawatts. 
Space: HAL -- 3 square feet (it sits on a desktop).BP -- 8,000 square 
feet. 
Length: HAL -- 27 inches. BP -- 228 yards. 
Power cable: HAL -- 1 standard extension cord. BP -- 5 miles of 6-inch 
circumference cable. 
Oh, and the cost: HAL's little desktop box drops to a mere $26 million, 
compared with BP's $94 million. 
A major difference between traditional computers and HAL is HAL's 100 
billion circuits are eminently reprogrammable -- not by humans, but by 
itself and its software. A circuit configured to do one specific task 
one moment may be rewired on the fly, thousands of times per second, to 
optimize itself for the next task.

so i really did hear this?  they suggested an explosion originating
inside the tank?  what i wonder is how they proposed sufficient
oxygen got in there, assuming a spark.  sparks are easy.  would
a really fast leak draw in enough oxygen to displace the leaked
fuel?

ya, ive followed your argument, but the way i would explain the
report is a kind of one way tendency by the investigators
to underreport the plunge time.  their motives would not
need to be evil.  i would suppose many or most of the
passengers survived the original blast, and no one wants
to even imagine those poor folks living long under those
horrifying conditions of being in a burning plane plunging
toward the sea.  i figured they just picked the most optimistic
(shortest) estimate of descent time.

the idea of an explosion originating *inside* a fuel tank, that really
bothers me tho.  why couldnt it happen again?  {8-[  spike

Well, yes shine a light through water and it takes longer to get to its
destination than in a vacuum, but what I was implying, is that since its going
through molecules, its path is diverted, Im not sure exactly how, but this is
what I've understood.  It goes the same speed it always goes, its just the
medium changes its course, thus making its destination longer than if there
wasnt a medium.

Nice thoughtful and provocative piece - but I don't believe we need assume
that (some) artists have `gone on strike' in a Randian way just because we
fail to see an efflorescence of Randian art.  It doesn't make a lot of
sense anyway to suppose that they would - to what moral end are they
supposed to be withholding their labour?  It's more plausible that most
artists (writers especially, perhaps) understand the points made in the
cited post.  Rand's melodramatics are a very unsophisticated artistic
method.  You get past it, often by the time you're in your late teens or
early 20s.  

No doubt some Rand enthusiasts will get apoplectic at this and remind me
how many hundreds of millions of copies of her work are in print.  (And
perhaps how few of my own are.)  This is not a sound argument.  Rand's work
is a transitional object - certainly it had a great impact on me in my
somewhat innocent and arrested adolescence.  But few serious artists seem
to find anything enduring in it.  That's way there are few Randian art
works, not because they've all gone to Galt Heaven.

There are two kinds of 'mirrors'.  (1) opaque (generally metal) , and (2)
refractive.  A given metal mirror exhibits just about the same
reflectivity, regardless of angle of incidence, for any given wavelength.



Refractive materials (which are usually not called mirrors), exhibit high
or total reflection when the light hits the index change interface at a
shallow enough angle.  Light which hits a glass window at a shallow angle
reflects off the window in proportion to the cosine of the angle between
the light direction and the plane of the glass.  Light inside glass
bounces off the glass to air interface (100% if the angle is small
enough).  That phenomenon is often called 'total internal reflection'.  A
simple glass fiber generally internally reflects light travelling thru it
without any reflection loss, without the designer doing anything special,
because the direction of incidence is nearly parallel to the axis of the
fiber, and the fiber has a higher index than the air or vacuum around it.
 'Graded index' fibers are also used which bend the light in the outer
layers towards the central axis of the fiber.


I don't have any info on a new mirror from MIT.

Sorry I lost the original post.

I humbly suggest that you reconsider your intentions.
What bothers me is that you state that you have a 
very particular question you feel the need to answer.  
Already a bad sign.  In addition, this question has 
something to do with you and your personal experiences.  
IOW, you seem to be seeking to understand yourself 
more completely.  Though laudable, this is not a good 
reason to become a psychiatrist or cognitive scientist.

Seek this line of work because you are completely 
fascinated with it and because you truly wish to make a 
contribution to the science, knowing full well that you are 
currently too ignorant/naive to know precisely how you will 
accomplish this task.

Best wishes,

Scott Badger

When light (electromagnetic energy) hits an electron, which is an
electrically  charged particle, the electron is made to vibrate.  A
vibrating electron in turn creates an electromagnetic field with the same
frequency as the vibration.  Metals are shiny because there is a cloud of
mobile electrons at the surface of the metal, free to vibrate easily, so
metals typically have high reflectivity.     
  Because electrons have mass, they have inertia, so their vibration is a
bit delayed (out of phase) relative to the phase of the wave fronts of
light which cause them to vibrate.  That, I think, is the cause of the
delay as light moves through a transparent material.  The wavelength of
visible light is typically about 1,000 times the size of a typical simple
molecule, like silicon dioxide (quartz), so the idea that the photons are
delayed because they 'bounce around' as they pass through a transparent
medium such as glass is seemingly not correct.  It's more like a
motorboat which runs slower through molasses than through water.

    >Apple paid Xerox for the rights to use their ideas

Apple paid Xerox??? That contradicts everything I've read on the subject.
Where did you hear this ? How much did they pay? They must have gotten
more than "look and feel" so exactly what did they get for their money?


    >Microsoft purchased technology from Apple which they used to develop
    >Windows, which was initially intended to be a Macintosh emulator for the PC.

Well, Microsoft is certainly no stranger in the Apple world, for many years
they had more programmers writing Apple programs than Apple itself did, but
I would be very surprised if Apple would cooperate with anyone to write
an emulator to run on a PC, they've always acted like that's the last thing
in the world they'd want.  But I've been surprised before so perhaps you're
correct, but I'd love to know your source.

And Microsoft was right. Although Bill Gates strongly advised against it
IBM insisted that the first version of OS/2 be a 16 bit system and even worse,
they wrote it in assembly language (not C) optimized to work best on a
286 chip. That decision was one of the most stupid in the history of
computers. OS/2 version 1.0 could never handle Windows 95 nor could it be
modified to do so, IBM had to start from square one to make the next version
and by then Windows had a big head start.

Does not follow.  There are acts which would be morally reprehensible
if you were to engage in them, but which are not sufficient cause to 
do violence to others engaging in the same action.  

I do not smoke, nor do I drink.  I consider such activities to be (minor)
threats to my life, and thus WRONG.  On the other hand, attacking 
those who do smoke or drink is clearly not acceptable.  So, does that
make drinking or smoking any better for me.  No.

Very true, and I believe, the core of any successful argument that 
leaves you at the University.  Even more true in America, where 
the amount of government funding going to most (all but 1) private
universities makes the distinction between public and private 
universities something of a joke.

I think you have one solid line of argument.  However, this
line of argument is very strong.

Simply put.
I have a goal.
I am prevented from doing what I think will get me to that goal
in the precise manner that I might wish.
Do I
a)	Give up my goal.
b)	Move towards the goal in a manner that I might find mildly
	distasteful while trying to bring about better circumstances
c)	Struggle grandly and impotently against immovable forces.

Easy choice, I think.

Guys, it is still me, spike.  I am going to try to use upper case

Mike, this troubles me.  With hydrocarbon fuels, it requires a lot more
air than fuel to make an ignition.  Too rich and it wont even burn,
never
mind explode.  Having a fuel tank leak would cause some air to be vented
in, I just dont see how you could get the magic 15 to 1 air to fuel
ratio
inside a fuel tank.

Perhaps.  This whole thread started with the contention (I think) that
the CIA report was trying to cover something by claiming a 29
second plunge of the crippled plane into the sea.  I realized that
the number 29 in itself is an indication they hoped to minimize the
time, just as Frys electronics puts a new electronic gazazzafratz on
sale for 29.99 because that sounds less than 30 bucks.  29 seconds,
well, thats less than half a minute.  I imagine it really took about a
full terrifying minute for the doomed, and likely conscious, passengers
to end their suffering.  I would still like to pretend it was only 29
seconds
even if I know better.  Either way, I suspect a fuel leak started a fire
outside the tank which then (somehow) caused the tank to explode.

When I was a teenager, I and my friends were mentally retarded.  We
used to take aerosol cans, hold a match under the spray and make a
torch.  We found that engine starting fluid made the best torch: oh my,
one could raise hell with one of those things.

One day, while burning trash, an empty (presumably) hairspray can
exploded.  Made a great fireball.  We reasoned that a full can would
do all that much more, so we bought a full can of engine starting fluid,
built a fire, threw the can in and ran like hell.  We waited and after a
surprisingly long time (a couple of minutes) in the fire, the can
finally
burst.

Did you guess what happened?  It doused the fire!  No fireball!
Waste of three bucks!  {8^D  I hope I never have kids.  spike

Apologies if you get this more than once.  I'm sending it only to
friends who are outside my usual channels for this sort of thing!

I'm participating in an Internet campaign to stop a regulation which
would require your bank to spy on you, and I'd like to invite you to
join me.

We now have less than 20 days to contact the FDIC and demand that it
kill its proposed "Know Your Customer" rule. Please forward this
message to any friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, or other
people you know personally who may be interested. Then go to
http://www.defendyourprivacy.com and sign the petition. It will be
submitted directly to the FDIC. Plus, a copy will be sent to your
representative in the U.S. House and to both your U.S. Senators.

The FDIC's Know Your Customer rule would force banks to "monitor" your
checking and savings account and report any "unusual transactions" to
the federal government. This frightening threat to your financial
privacy would force your bank to:

  * Discover your "source of funds"

  * Determine your "normal and expected transactions"

  * Report any "suspicious activity" to federal investigators

The government claims it is trying to thwart money launderers and drug
dealers. But what this law will do is turn every bank teller into a
government informer and everyone with a bank account into a criminal
suspect.

In a free society, the government has no business asking where you get
your money or how you spend it -- and politicians have no right to
force your bank to monitor your account.

But that's exactly what's going to happen, unless we can generate
enough opposition before the FDIC's comment period expires on March 8.
Outraged Americans have already flooded the FDIC with over 15,000
comments against the Know Your Customer regulation -- but the agency
hasn't backed down yet.

Let's keep up the pressure.

Please forward this e-mail to everyone you know who might be interested
in helping, but please don't send it indiscriminately -- spam will only
hurt our campaign.

Then go to our web page (http://www.defendyourprivacy.com) and sign the
petition. Thank you.

A most difficult choice, I think.
For every goal, some will choose (a), some (b), and some (c). I can only
hope that each person makes the right choice for himself. Sometimes the goal
is most important. Sometimes the principle is most important. Sometimes the
course of action is most important. Sometimes...the person is most
important.

So, speeding light up by gravity means distorting time, but slowing it

The 15 to 1 air to fuel ratio is not magic. It is a ratio which requires a high minimum air
pressure level to ignite. At atmospheric pressure, a higher ratio will easily ignite. Now,
here's another idea: vacuum pressure. The plane was ascending thru the mid teen levels. The
tanks had been sealed at sea level and are partially pressurized. There is obviously going
to be enough pressure to encourage outflow from any even minor leaks in the tank. Put that
outflow near some sparking kapton wire, and BOOM. Moreover, since the tank was mostly empty,
its volume was not entirely a vapor version of the fuel. It was air filled with fuel fumes.
It is an ideally explosive setup. Ideal mixing, minimum swirl, etc.

As I demonstrated, the 29 second time was for the nose section, which itself also had
passengers, as well as the cockpit, where some of the black boxes are, which would have
recorded the time to impact.

Do you work in the field of computers?  I thought it was common
knowledge that Apple paid Xerox for technology.  It didn't even occur to
me to give a reference to support this.  I don't have a reference handy,
but I could try to find one.

Most people forget that Microsoft started out writing software for the
Apple.  The migrate Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to the PC
platform later.

And yes, in the beginning, Apple did want to emulate Macs on PC's.  They
thought people would migrate to the real thing after having a taste of
the emulator.  It was their lost court case that allowed anyone to
copy/emulate the Mac without paying Apple that made them lose interest
in Mac emulation.  (There are a few Mac emulators for PCs still
available today.)

I agree with this mostly, but I do know that IBM wanted to include
Windows 95 support in OS/2 and that Microsoft would not legally allow
them to do so.

I stand corrected!  My research indicates that Apple did not PAY for
information from Xerox.  He legally obtained the rights to the
technology without any cost.  Xerox invited Steve Jobs in and let him
look around for free.  The Xerox execs didn't think that ethernet and
the gui interface were useful as anything but toys.  The point I
misrepresented was that Xerox agreed that Apple had legal rights to use
their ideas, whereas Apple thought they had sold their ideas to
Microsoft for money, and Microsoft later used the ideas without paying.

I am watching this discussion with interest because an computer security
idea of mine might be patented by IBM.  I will allow them to do so, but
I'm not sure what I believe about the idea of patent restrictions.  I am
concerned about cryptopgraphy patents where a mathematical algoritm is
restricted.  How do you pass laws to prevent certain mathematical values
from being calculated?  (My idea has nothing to do with cryptography.  I
can't say what my idea involves, due to client contracts,
confidentiality, and lawyers.)

The responses so far appear to be generally unfavorable.

I see two fatal criticisms of the idea suggested in the FAQ:

First, it is mind control.  Remember, posthumans are by definition fully
sentient beings.  Programming them to abide by a preordained moral code is
no different than doing the same thing to our own children, or to each
other.  I can see no possible way to justify such an action on moral
grounds.

Second, in the long run it won't work.  You can program non-sentient
machines to do your bidding, but that isn't what the FAQ is talking about.
It suggests that we attempt to enforce an eternal program of mind control on
fully sentient posthumans - for those of you who have forgotten what that
means, I suggest you read the definition of 'Posthuman' in the same
document.  Does anyone really think such a prohibition would work on humans
for all of eternity?  Then why do we think we can do it to an entire society
of superintelligent, self-modifying entities?

I suggest that this passage be amended to remove the advocation of mass mind
control.  Perhaps something like this:

  In the first case, we could make sure that the first such entities possess
  a thorough understanding of, and respect for, existing human moral codes.

That would be enough to ensure that they at least think the whole thing
through before adopting some completely alien viewpoint.  It is also the
strongest measure that I can see either a moral or a practical basis for.

Interestingly enough, the next release of Pentiums III, 800MHZ,
will put them into a supercomputer category and so will trigger
corresponding export restrictions. - See story at

http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990222S0011

What will the government do now?
The answer should be simple:  whatever it was planning to
do when this happens.  The export restrictions aren't new, neither
is Moore's "Law", so this event was predictable, _long_ time ago.
But no, the law is static, and now there are again expensive
lobbying efforts for raising the definition of the supercomputer
(once?), etc.

Why is that that the regulatory bodies are so delusional they
assume we live in a static world - where their very purpose
should be formulated now as assurance of smooth growth
of the society they should understand well enough to govern?

Are they too stupid to extrapolate apparent trends, or there is
something else in the system that makes it ignore them?

This is quite close to Teilhard de Chardin's original idea of the
Omega Point (even if he died long before the Net was anything more
than sf). The physical manifestation of God in the universe, a
borg-Christ. No wonder the Catholic Church wasn't amused.

Tipler wanted to get transcendence with the deal, so he had to
postulate infinite computing resources and knowledge for this to work,
which only can (?) occur during a Big Crunch (hold your fingers
crossed :-).

I think the problem is talking about God with big 'G'. Why not gods
with lower case 'g'? Maybe we're too monotheistic on this
list. Personally I feel more pagan, and want to see mankind turn into
a whole pantheon. A pantheon of gods with humor.

Yes. This is rather a mindset that is partially forced onto us by our
culture (all those "things man was never meant to know" memes) and
partially due to bad thinking habits (if you think that being
intelligent means being a Leonardo or Aristoi all the day, and then
realize you are intelligent and not behaving like that, you might
think there is something wrong with you).

I like cognitive therapy. Therapy in various forms has the advantage
that it works even when a drug would be unavailable, since it helps
set up a cognitive "immune defense" against negative thinking
patterns. Medication is more useful for breaking the initial vicious
circle and show the possibility for change.

Government regulatory bodies are created, staffed, and informed by groups of
people with a profoundly stasist world-view.  Most of them really don't
understand that the world is a dynamic place, despite the constant change
that surrounds them.  They see each individual change as some unique event
unconnected to the others (or worse, as part of an Evil Conspiracy to
destroy everything good in the world).

Such people don't plan for change, because they don't want it to happen.
They want to make everything fit their particular vision of how things
should be, so they craft static laws intended to change a set present into
their desired form of stasis.  They see the whole project as a one-time
transition, so it seldom occurs to them to worry about whether their rules
will continue to work as the world changes around them.

Well put, Anders.

At some point in the future in this scenario we will still have enough
computing power and knowledge to get transcendence in the deal.

Big "G", little "g" ...... great point.  In my scenario God or god(s) should
still be quite human, and, I believe, not need us to "worship" him/her/them in
the traditional sense.  If he/she/they are as democratic as I suspect,
he/she/they want us to "add our distinctiveness to theirs" and also become god
(gods).

As hinted to by Stewart Kaufman in "At Home in the Universe", I suspect that:

     Life emerged as a "phase change" when the primordial soup had enough
different molecules reacting and catalyzing reactions till it became self
sustaining and replicating.

     Self awareness occured as an emergant property when enough neurons,
synapses, etc. came into being in one creature.

     God will emerge when enough intelligences and computing power are
networked together, but he/she/they will be a corporate god, not just one
Supreme being.

Ah, but we CAN create regions of space-time with less density than
"normal" vacuum.  Ever hear of the Casimir effect?  When two conducting
plates are placed a small distance apart, the energy-density of the
vacuum between them decreases to less than the energy-density of regular
interstellar vacuum.  This is because normal vacuum is filled with
virtual particles, constantly popping into and back out of existence,
which is in turn due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  The two
conducting plates prevent any virtual particles from popping up between
them which have modes (wavelengths, essentially) greater than the
separation distance between the two plates.  As a result you get the
vacuum on the outside of the plates applying a measurable force
attempting to press the plates together, and this force increases
(exponentially?) the closer together the plates get.  It is also
dependent on the surface area of the plates.

This is directly analogous to having two tanker ships next to each
other.  Normally, waves press against the hull of a ship about equally
from all directions (excluding any surface currents).  When one ship
pulls alongside the other though, each ship blocks waves that would
normally exert pressure against one side of the other ship's hull.  As a
result the two ships feel an attraction.  The closer together the two
ships get, the more the waves between them can only travel parallel to
the ships and thus the less the force keeping them apart is.

Now as to whether decreasing the energy-density of a vacuum will allow
light to travel greater than c I don't know.  On the one hand, negative
energy densities seem to be a prerequisite for building any kind of
nontrivial wormhole.  (Although wormholes do not explicitly allow FTL
travel.)  I also recall it being required for Alcubierre (sp?) engines,
which in theory can travel faster than c as measured by outside
observers.  So it might be a possibility that light can travel faster in
a smaller energy-density vacuum.  But I am not a physicist or physics
major and my knowledge on this subject is mostly limited to what I've
read on my own.  (Though I have done _some_ research on the Casimir
effect and wormholes.)

OTOH a smaller energy density might not have any effect on the _speed_
of light.  Photons racing away from a massive source lose energy,
resulting in a redshift; but their speed remains the same.  Thus it
seems to me that if you had a source of negative mass, light speeding
away from it would undergo a blueshift, an increase in energy, but
there's no reason to believe it would increase the _speed_ of the
photons.  So how comparable are the effects of negative mass with those
of negative energy?  About the same as between positive (normal) mass &
energy, I would think.

I think you are confusing to issues here. (1) doing it to our 
children; (2) doing it to each other. These cases are diffrent.

(1) There is nothing morally wrong in doing it to our children. 
Responsible parents do it all the time. To impart good values, 
behaviours and morals to our children is not just a right but a 
responsibility. Without it, our children couldn't function in our 
society. If we imagine, for the sake of the argument, that they could 
function without such parental shaping, and also that they would be 
as powerful as a posthuman will be, then we could expect horrible 
things to happen; it would be like putting nukes in the hand of a 
super-clever, but peevish and egomaniac toddler.

(2) Doing it to each other, on the other hand, is only allowed 
through certain means such as persuation. The reason why there is a 
moral difference between the two cases is that in the first case 
there is no pre-existing person with violable rights. There are just 
different potential persons, and we make a choice about which one 
shall come into being (by choosing who we copulate with and how we 
raise our children, traditionally; or by choosing the values we 
program into a superintelligence, in the hypothetically). We can 
assume that we only choose between sets of values that the person 
would be happy with once it is in existence, and that would lead to 
a life worth living. In the second case, there are pre-existing 
persons, and if they don't want to be transformed by your 
mind-changing methods, then you have no right to transform them. (I'm 
skipping over some subtleties here that aren't relevant to my main 
point.)

Two points: First, a being who has a certain fundamental value 
*doesn't want to change it*, per definition. So it's not as if these 
guys will think they are being mind-fucked and try to figure out a 
way to get around it. No more than you are trying to abolish your own 
survival instinct just because you know that it is an artifact of our 
evolutionary past.

Second, later generations of posthumans may well be born or created 
by earlier generations. They might well have the ability and the will 
to propagate their fundamental values to their creations/offspring. 
(If you love humans, you wouldn't choose to have a child that will 
hate humans and exterminate them!) And they could presumably invent a 
highly reliable mechanism for transmitting their values to the next 
generation.

You are *wrong*.  Morality is not *known* to be arbitrary, and that
means the probabilistic landscape of desirability isn't flat.  I *am*
trying to abolish my survival instinct, because I know that it's an
artifact of my evolutionary past, and is therefore - statistically
speaking - highly unlikely to match up with the right thing to do (if
there is one), a criterion which is totally independent of what my
ancestors did to reproduce.  Remember, every human being on this planet
is the product of a successful rape, somewhere down the line.

Your posthumans will find their own goals.  In any formal goal system
that uses first-order probabilistic logic, there are lines of logic that
will crank them out, totally independent of what goals they start with. 
I'm not talking theory; I'm talking a specific formal result I've
produced by manipulating a formal system.  I will happily concede that
the *truth* may be that all goals are equally valid, but unless your
posthumans are *certain* of that, they will manipulate the probabilistic
differentials into concrete goals.

It's like a heat engine.  Choices are powered by differential
desirabilities.  If you think the real, factual landscape is flat, you
can impose a set of arbitrary (or even inconsistent) choices without
objection.  But we don't *know* what the real landscape is, and the
probabilistic landscape *isn't flat*.  The qualia of joy have a higher
probability of being "good" than the qualia of pain.  Higher
intelligence is more likely to lead to an optimal future.

When you impose a set of initial goals, you are either assuming that the
landscape is known with absolute certainty to be flat (an artificial and
untrue certainty) or you are imposing a probabilistic (and thus
falsifiable) landscape.

Can we at least agree that you won't hedge the initial goals with
forty-seven coercions, or put in any safeguards against changing the
goals?  After all, if you're right, it won't make a difference.

I intended merely to set the context of people with considered thoughts 
who feel that extropy does not entail other, political, beliefs.

I shall respect your wish and refrain in future ( i would refrain in the 
past also but that is too hard a trick ;-)

For what it is worth, i think that i will not use the word libertarian 
anymore. We don't have a party of that name here in Australia, but it is 
clearly synonymous with the US party in enough people's minds that it is 
confusing. I will use instead the principle of never initiating force.

All I meant in the quote of me above was that, as i interpreted Max, 
extropian transhumanists are going to oppose all first-use force (as he 
and i both happen to do) and that a number of people (you among them) had 
said that that did not follow. 

I guess it comes down to whether the principle "extropian transhumanists 
believe it is immoral to achieve even moral goals by the use of force 
over other individuals" is true of extropy. 

It does not really matter. I am a bit sad that it is not true in practice 
but more than willing to accept that extropy does not entail this moral: 
after all, it is just a human construct. Max as "copyright holder" can 
use it as he sees fit and others will adopt it or not as they see its 
utility. I believe that this extension is would be reflective of extropy 
and would increase its utility as a full philosophical system. Clearly, 
however, I it is not to be.

best as always,
t

(looking for a new word that means extropy plus non-initiation of force 
...)

Yes, this is the one exception which I did not mention, mainly because it is
a construct, although it is thought that gravity may actually be a
manifestation of the casimir effect in the natural  world. What good is the
Casimir Effect? Well, if you could somehow make a tunnel from point A to
point B through space,  then you would have a free, cheap, and easy way to
travel to the stars, as the tunnel walls would protect the space you travel
through, allowing FTL travel, while the EM energy behind your ship would
propell you through the tunnel to the halfway point, and the pressure coming
in from the other end would slow you down. Of course you could help it along
by stationing a high power laser at each end.

This is a hell of a cosmic tube, and I have no idea what sort of pressure
densities there will be at the midpoint...though a laser's output should
balance it. A bit like a huge pneumatic tube system.... now this is a job
for buckytubes....

The difference between these cases is simply one of degree.  Parents can
provide a large fraction of a child's information about the world, and have
the opportunity to persuade the child to adopt their viewpoint before
his/her mind develops the memetic immune system of an adult.  As you point
out, this process is both necessary and inevitable.

What the FAQ appears to propose is that we hard-wire a predetermined moral
system into these posthuman beings, and compel them to abide by it for the
rest of eternity.  There is no parallel for this in human society, because
it is not yet possible to do such a thing.

Here is a comparable case:

Suppose my parents are religious, and they feel that anyone who is not a
member of their faith will suffer eternal damnation.  Consequently, at an
early age they have be fitted with neural implants that will ensure I
fervently believe in their faith, that I will never violate its tenets, and
that I am incapable of ever changing this belief system.

This is not teaching, or persuasion, or passing on an opinion.  It is
outright mind control.  I don't see that doing the same thing to a sentient
AI would be any different.

We could have a long argument about this issue, and I suspect its all been
said before.  I'd be happy to go another round if you're interested, but my
main concern here is the moral issue.

OH puhleeze. So just cause one of my knuckle dragging ancestors happened to
press the issue means that I have to throw out all of the incredibly smart,
difficult to learn, near instantaneous responses that all of my ancestors
developed in order to suvive and eventually make me? Give it up. Lets give
back North America while we are at it, oh, and since we came out of africa,
lets give the entire world back to the animals.... Get real.

You are also extremely wrong. Statistically speaking, most of the time your
instinctive response is EXACTLY the thing to do. The only time there may be
a conflict is in cases where technology has been designed to be
counter-intuitive. That is a problem of bad engineering, not bad evolution.

It is also as likely to produce high levels of failure along the way if they
refuse to learn, or we refuse to teach them from our past.

Not necessarily. It is providing a user a bit of preceding knowledge about
the space, which may or may not be entirely accurate. It may influence their
actions, yes, but it will also help prevent potential catastrophes.

If I'm right it will make every difference. Imagine thousands or millions of
transhuman Tim McVeighs 'experimenting' on the world while they relearn
everything that we already know.....

A very interesting question, independent of the posthuman question.  What
degree of control is moral for parents to exert over their children?  More
generally, what is moral when creating a new intelligence?

One answer is that, as long as the resulting person is happy with his lot,
anything is moral.  You can create intelligences that are stupid or smart,
flexible or constrained, but as long as they are happy it is OK.

The opposite extreme would suggest that only intelligences with maximal
extropy should be created: flexible, intelligent, creative, curious minds.
Such people would have a wide range of possible behaviors.  They would
perhaps face greater dangers, but their triumphs would be all the more
meaningful.  Doing anything less when creating a new consciousness would
be wrong, in this view.

I am inclined to think that this latter position is too strong.  There
would seem to be valid circumstances where creating more constrained
intelligences would be useful.  There may be tasks which require
human-level intelligence but which are relatively boring.  Someone has to
take out the garbage.  Given an entity which is going to have limitations
on its options, it might be kinder to make it satisfied with its life.

Generalizing the case Billy describes, if the universe is a dangerous
place and there are contagious memes which would lead to destruction, you
might be able to justify building in immunity to such memes.  This limits
the person's flexibility, but it is a limitation intended ultimately to
increase his options by keeping him safe.

How different is this from the religious person who wants to keep
his own child safe, and secure for him the blessings of eternal life?
Not at all different.  Although we may not agree with his premises,
given his belief system I think his actions can be seen as moral.

Even the case of children is not so clear-cut.  While we place a very
large amount of power in the hands of parents, we also place limits;
correctly, if you ask me.  You can pollute your children's minds all you
want with nonsense, but you can't beat them, force them to work, neglect
their physical needs for food and shelter, etc.  Some exceptions are
made even there for religious nuts: allowing parents to deny essential
medical care or permanently lop off perfectly healthy parts of their
genitalia for no legitimate reason (a barbarism we will outgrow
eventually, I'm sure), but there are still limits (for example, you
can only mutilate your child's genitalia in the US if it's a boy).

It is a legitimate concern what physical or "mental" limits should be
placed on sentient beings we create.  It does reflect upon us how we
treat those over whom we have power.

Rights are a consequence of autonomy: we grant them to adults so that
they can exercise their autonomy as effectively as possible without
interfering with others or suffering interference from others.  We grant
some limited rights to children so as to encourage their development
into fully autonomous beings.  If we would think it unconscionable to
make permanent physical modifications to a child that would restrict
its future autonomy (and therefore its future rights), then we should
have the same judgment for doing it to an AI.

I think that you miss the point.  I don't agree with Saint-Andre's strike
rhetoric, but there are many Objectivists out there and many who want
to be artists.  I've been exposed to much of their work.  (I think his use
of that rhetoric leads to misinterpretation.  It seems like he's arguing
there are Objectivist artist out there who are consciously witholding
their work from us.  See below.  I think what he means -- or if he does
not mean this, then he f***ing should:) -- is that some of Rand's ideas
on art CAN destroy artists, if they try to apply them in their work.)

I find two points he makes valid here.  One is that self-censorship is
rampant in the Objectivist movement.  The other is that art can't be
thought out in advance.  The Objectivist movement sometimes
brings these two things together and we wind up with shallow
propaganda.

How this applies to transhumanism and Extropianism should be obvious
from reading the list.  There is a slight tendency toward self-censorship
-- albeit not as severe as in the Objectivist movement.  There also seems
to be an artistic program -- which might stifle creative impulses.  I don't
think it's as stultifying as in the Objectivist movement, but it's there.

(To be fair, the Objectivist movement is becoming more mellow with
age.:)

Of course, in both movements there are plenty of exceptions.  Even so,
I think the issue should be discussed to avoid the problems Saint-Andre
points out.

Cheers!

Does it?

My personal experience is that most of the "functional"
psychologists I've encountered did not enter the
profession with a mission to "analyze" themselves into 
psychological well-being.   There is a common (and 
unfortunate) perception that  we go into this field to 
"deal with" our own devils.  While I understand why a 
client may prefer to have a therapist with a broad 
array of life experiences, I do not feel crippled because 
I have failed to suffer some psychopathology.

More to the point, I would advise someone interested in 
Psychology to pursue a position as an academician/
researcher rather than that of a practitioner.  This branch 
of science is so immature.  Actually, I suspect that it's 
more likely that a strong AI will figure us out before we do.
But by that time, we'll transcend our psychological 
limitations and the point will be moot.

Of course I could be wrong.  :-)

BTW Tim, Demon Seed also struck me as a memorable film.

Caution!!! . . . . . .  Demon Seed Spoiler Follows . . . . . . Caution!!!

This was my first true exposure to the inevitability of computer-
generated consciousness.  There were so many great themes:
the merging of machine and human, rebirth through the fathering 
of one's own self, and I thought it was particularly interesting that 
while many transhumanists look forward to become more machine-
like, this AI sought to be more human-like . . . to be "alive".  Of 
course that theme is a very vain and human-like theme.  Why would
an AI want to be "alive"?  It's such a high-maintenance state to exist 
in.

I also loved it because I was crazy about Julie Christie back then.

Cheers,

SB

There is a long, dark way between *listening* to your emotions and
*believing* in them.  I trust my intuitions, probably more than most
people do.  Back when I was practicing for the SAT, the main thing I
learned was not to second-guess myself - that if I just wrote down my
first answer, I had a better chance of being right.  It's a lesson I
still carry with me.  I listen to my emotions, but I also understand
them, and their evolutionary context as well.  Emotions are useful
information... not the overriding necessity.

Agreement, but "instinctive response" does not equal "instinctive goal".

None at all, if we load every single path to disaster we can think of
and ask them politely to take no risks whatsoever.  I can't think of any
risk that's intrinsically necessary on the path to constructing a
competent superintelligence.  If we tell them that they probably aren't
very competent, that, like humans, they can't trust themselves, all the
necessary precautions should follow.  "The ends don't justify the means"
is a hard lesson of history, but it's just as valid, rationally, for AIs.

But they won't be non-overridable laws.  Just consequences of the
starting facts and built-in intuitions within the Interim Goal System. 
What you point out is *rationally true*, and thus there is no reason to
establish it as a coercion.  In fact, a smart (but still first-stage) AI
would probably figure it out even if we didn't tell ver.

Is that the smart thing to do?  No.  Any such experiments can wait until
the rise of superintelligence.

It would be useful to know the mechanism by which light is "slowed down" when traveling through a medium.  It's been some years since I've studied this stuff and I seem dimly to recall that the light is absorbed and retransmitted by the atoms of the medium, thus causing the delay.  I suspect the accuracy of this recollection, as well as the accuracy of the original "factoid".  But it leaves me wondering as to the actual mechanism.  
	The photon or wavefront is passing through a three dimensional array of atoms, consisting mostly of empty space--the central nucleus, and the surrounding electron particle/wave-ness--and the passing light interacts somehow with the resident matter such that the light emerges unaffected save for a delay.  Howzat?
	With the Bose-Einstein condensate the delay is so long that, if absorbtion/reemission is the mechanism, then it seems like the photon would get sucked up and then held onto for a goodly piece, and then spit out again without any evidence of its sequestration.  I don't know.  Time to send this theory back in for an upgrade.
	I've been reading about quantum stuff lately: EPR, Bell, Aspect, nonlocality, etc.  But the more I read the more confused I get.  It's supposed to be the other way round.  But that's the nature of QM, it turns logic on its head.   Hmmmmm.

True. There is a huge amount of work to be done. It might however be
relevant to point out that (at least parts of) psychology isn't
complete voodoo either. We have learned some things since the 1800's.

I disliked the film slightly for this reason, as well as the
suggestion that the AI was 'evil' in some way. But it was somewhat
different from many other films in a similar vein, and I like metal
cubes too.

Of course, my all-time favorite is The Forbin Project, where the
immense missile defense AI starts to blackmail the US to be linked
toits Russian counterpart. Vintage cold war paranoia, huge computers
and in fact an AI that behaves in a competent manner (unlike most
'villains' in films - I dream of writing a movie where both the heroes
and villains act intelligently most of the time, unlike in current
movies).

Adrian & Anders,

     As someone with an interest in both >H and Theology, I couldn't resist
joining in on this discussion.  I think one of the first things I would ask of
you is what you are using as initial parameters.  Theology, if I remember
correctly, means "The study of God (or gods)."  This implies that you are
predicting the existence and or emergence of a God or gods.  So my first
question is what criteria would a being have to meet to be classified as a
god?  There have been several such standards suggested.  Two that seem to be
fairly constant is Power and Worship.  A god is thus defined as in some way
being incredibly (transcendantly?) capable, and/or being worshipped.  Given
the strong libertarian and humanist background of Extropianism, worship might
be something that Extropians might find unappealing (for to worship implies a
level of submission, and to be worshipped implies having others dependent upon
you).  However, there is another way to look at the worship issue.  If you
think first what qualities are worthy of worship, by which I mean what
principles (memes?) are you willing to give you life to and for (for some
people, the answer would be none), now posit the possibility of a being or
beings capable of exemplifying those principles perfectly, as well as having
the power to back up those principles, then you might just have found that
there is a God(s) to you.

     Adrian, I believe you said you were interested in developing an Extropian
Theology.  This I imagine would have two main qualities, one would be a God or
gods whom uphold Extropian values, and a Cosmology based on an Extropian
worldview.  In such a theology, I imagine a deity would begin in some material
substrate and develop through an evolutionary process.  In fact, intelligent
life in this Universe might be considered the raw materials from which gods
will develop somewhere on the other side of the Singularity.  I agree with you
that such a deity would likely not be very interested in worship.  You may
have some different starting points for the concept of a god, if so I would be
very interested in discussing them.  I also have some other ideas to discuss
as per the Monotheism vs Pantheism debate, but it will have to wait for
another post.

Spike,

Have you considered using voice recognition software. IBM's new
ViaVoice professional is excellent. Ray Kurtzweil wrote most of his
most recent book (The Age of Spiritual Machines) with a different
system. It interfaced with MS WORD and could distinguish between
sentences and commands. I don't have the book handy, but would be
happy to look it up for you.

Save those wrist's for better things...... ;)

I am inclined to agree with you, but for different reasons.  IMO, the fact
that it might be useful to deliberately create a sub-optimal intelligence
would not carry much weight in a moral argument.  However, it is crucial to
recognize that we do not know what an optimal intelligence would be.  We can
make pretty good guesses, especially for humanlike minds, but we can't
really prove that we aren't just passing along our own biases. Consequently,
I would argue that the minimum moral standard should be this:

If you are going to create an actual person (as opposed to an animal, or a
special-purpose device), you have a moral obligation to give them the
ability to reason, to learn, and to grow.  Any sentient being should be
capable of asking questions, seeking the answers, and applying those answers
to their own thoughts and actions.

This standard still gives wide latitude in the choice of personality,
intelligence level, ease of self-modification, etc.  However, it would
forbid any truly permanent form of mind control.  To enforce a fixed moral
code you must create a mind that is incapable of thinking about morality, or
(more likely) that is capable of thinking about it but can never change its
mind.

The most effective way to immunize an AI against a 'dangerous meme' is
education: explain what the meme is about, why some people believe it, and
why it is wrong.  If your reasoning is correct, this will also allow the AI
to resist many similar memes that are based on similar false reasoning.  If
your reasoning is wrong, and the meme is in fact correct, the AI will still
be capable of recognizing the truth when she encounters it.

I find it interesting to note that everyone I know who follows such a
religion would find the idea horrifying.  Religions that include eternal
rewards and punishments also tend to stress the importance of free will.

On a more fundamental level, this is the old question of whether immoral
means can be used to achieve a moral end.  If there were no other possible
way of achieving the desired goal then you might be able to defend the
practice.  As it turns out, however, that can't happen in this case.

Let us suppose that I believe X is true, and I am very concerned about
ensuring that my posthuman descendants also believe X to be true.  I
therefore program the first posthuman AI with a full understanding of all
available arguments on the subject of X, with special emphasis on those that
lead me to believe X is true.  I also make sure that the AI understands its
own fallibility, and is willing to rely on information provided by humans in
the absence of conflicting evidence.

What will happen when the AI 'grows up' and becomes an autonomous adult?  It
is (by definition) far more intelligent than I am, and it knows everything I
do about X, so its decisions on the subject will always be at least as good
as my own.  If X is in fact true, the AI will never change its mind.  If,
OTOH, X is false, the AI may eventually realize this and change its mind.
However, this is not a bad thing!  It can only happen if the AI happens upon
new information that nullifies all of my objections - in other words, I
would also be convinced.

Thus, if we are willing to presume that our conclusions should be based on
reason, and that there is some rational basis for preferring our own moral
system over another one, then there is no need to resort to more than
education.

<< Adrian & Anders,
 
      As someone with an interest in both >H and Theology, I couldn't resist
 joining in on this discussion.  I think one of the first things I would ask
of
 you is what you are using as initial parameters.  Theology, if I remember
 correctly, means "The study of God (or gods)."  This implies that you are
 predicting the existence and or emergence of a God or gods.  So my first
 question is what criteria would a being have to meet to be classified as a
 god?  There have been several such standards suggested.  Two that seem to be
 fairly constant is Power and Worship.  A god is thus defined as in some way
 being incredibly (transcendantly?) capable, and/or being worshipped.  Given
 the strong libertarian and humanist background of Extropianism, worship might
 be something that Extropians might find unappealing (for to worship implies a
 level of submission, and to be worshipped implies having others dependent
upon
 you).  However, there is another way to look at the worship issue.  If you
 think first what qualities are worthy of worship, by which I mean what
 principles (memes?) are you willing to give you life to and for (for some
 people, the answer would be none), now posit the possibility of a being or
 beings capable of exemplifying those principles perfectly, as well as having
 the power to back up those principles, then you might just have found that
 there is a God(s) to you.
 
      Adrian, I believe you said you were interested in developing an
Extropian
 Theology.  This I imagine would have two main qualities, one would be a God
or
 gods whom uphold Extropian values, and a Cosmology based on an Extropian
 worldview.  In such a theology, I imagine a deity would begin in some
material
 substrate and develop through an evolutionary process.  In fact, intelligent
 life in this Universe might be considered the raw materials from which gods
 will develop somewhere on the other side of the Singularity.  I agree with
you
 that such a deity would likely not be very interested in worship.  You may
 have some different starting points for the concept of a god, if so I would
be
 very interested in discussing them.  I also have some other ideas to discuss
 as per the Monotheism vs Pantheism debate, but it will have to wait for
 another post.
 
 Glen Finney >>

Great thinking, Glen!  How about "all powerful, all knowing and Good" as a
definition of God.  I am certain God doesn't need worship in the traditional
sense.  However, I consider the study of science to be the study of the mind
of God, and that this study is worship.

I include theology, ethics, morality, education, business, political science
and social science as sciences as long as they are done scientifically.

Monotheism, Pantheism is moot.  God is both.  God is made up of distinct
individuals (us or our successors) and an emergent corporate entity.

I have already developed my theology and am testing it in the Extropian group
since I have always been a Libertarian and find that I definitely believe in
the Extropian principles.

My cosmology is simply whatever is the standard model of the scientific
community and will change as that model changes.

Glen, thank you for your terrific contribution.  I am thrilled that Anders is
interested (I consider him one of the most innovative thinkers and educators
of our time) and you are certainly a worthy adition.

Maybe, but making someone a religious nut is ultimately always bad 
for himself and society, so rational people would have every moral
right to (try to) remove the religious programming from the child's
mind and replace it with memes for critical thinking. Personally,
I'd have no problem with outlawing the indoctrination of children
with anything else than rationalism and critical thought. Given
the damage that religion and related dogmas have done to 
individuals (life-long mental scars, insanity, false guilt etc.)
and society (oppression, stagnation, holy wars, mass hysteria
etc.) I think this in itself somewhat coercive measure could
be fully justified. Ultimately it would improve everyone's situation,
after all.

However, this certainly doesn't mean that *all* future intelligences
should be maximed for critical thinking, only those that are
intended to become "peers". Lower "servant" AIs should be
made so that they either are completely emotionless like your
PC for example (preferable), or programmed to be unconditionally
happy with what they do. As long as they don't suffer, this would
certainly be "moral".

Depends on your morals, right? For example, a rational Egoist shouldn't 
have too much moral trouble with such a solution (of course, he may still
reject it on practical grounds, as the idea of controlling a posthuman
is questionable). In fact, the way we raise our kids and indoctrinate 
people to keep them from anti-social and criminal behaviour is a 
universally accepted and indeed necessary form of programming. 
So if you accept this, then there is no *moral* reason not to accept 
putting some basic moral rules into an AI.

Better yet:

In the first case, we should make sure that such entities are *us*. Creating
separate SIs (from AI) is a BIG mistake. We can certainly make sure
that the new entities thoroughly understand us, but that by no means
guarantees their respect for our moral codes.

Morals are subjective, but the most practical (=rational) course of action
would be not to create AIs with SI potential and work on uploading instead.
Again, our prime directive should _always_ be survival. Survival is the
prerequisite for _all_ other actions. Any philosophy that does not value
personal survival [in an optimal state] above everything else is by definition
irrational. Thus follows that transhumanism (with an immortalist element)
is the best philosophy currently available to us.

Your thoughts somewhat parallel my own, so thanks for the extra 
insights. I know there are other ways out, that's one of the reason this 
interests me.

Actually the whole area interests me, and it has less to do with me than 
with people I know. I don't seem to be prone to depression at all, but I 
know some very intelligent people who are.

>Scott Badger
This pretty much does sum up my interest, and a number of related areas 
(language, psychiatry, neuroscience) seem to be involved. I think there 
should have been two separate questions (1-resources for finding out 
about cognitive science 2-a specific question about intelligence and 
lack of direction/depression). I do think if I could figure this one out 
I would be contributing to science and humanity, by freeing the 
intelligent/creative to be more productive (this negates the argument 
that madness moves a number of intelligent/geniuses). 
Thanks, 
Mike

Don't you realize that this is the same view held by the religious nuts?
Everybody seems to want to outlaw other views and limit teaching to
their view.  Everybody thinks that their viewpoint can be justified, and
that such a position would improve everyone's situation.

Such a position is dangerous, whether you hold the "right" view or the
"wrong" view.  I am constantly amazed at how much people are willing to
override the desires of other because "we know we're right".

Why is your position any better than the conservative desire to outlaw
the teaching of evolution and limit teaching to just the Bible?  Is it
because you're belief system is true and theirs is false?  Do we really
want to outlaw the teaching of wrong theories?  Won't this lead to the
State being run by Thought Police?

Perhaps you could tell us about your theology.  That way, we could see
where you're coming from.  Personally, I don't believe in a single God, and
I don't see how 'God' could be both monotheistic and pantheistic.  But if
you explained how you arrived at that conclusion, perhaps we'll all
understand better.

Yes, that would be nice. Especially if we could make sure that all of 
us (who wanted) could be an SI. It is less pleasant to 
imagine that just one or two persons in the world get to be in the 
first generation of SIs. Could we trust them?

Mike,
You keep coming up with these interesting gun statistics, which should be widely
promulgated if true.  Can you provide your sources for these?

Thanks,

Subject: Is There A Need for Transhuman Spirituality?

Is there a need for an extropic transhuman spirituality?  I'm not referring
to Theology with gods or Gods, or Paganism, nor by spirituality am I
referring to mystical acceptance of spirits in a hereafter, and the reward
of such.  What I am referring to is a sense of one's essence in connection
to life, will and the universe. 

This reference is in keeping with how culture changes over time, and
influence of the New Agers (1980s) who has created a renewed spirituality.
I found this somewhat of a healthy step in moving further from traditional
religions. Its affiliation with Zen Buddhism was appealing in asserting
that enlightenment can be attained through meditation, self-contemplation,
and intuition rather than through faith and devotion.  But, nonetheless the
New Age spin on spirituality went in a direction I did not want to follow
as it padded its cell with crystals, spirits, astrology and channeling.
Such alternatives seemed to lack the encouragement of knowledge, but to
keep people childlike. What I did like from this mindset was the caring,
warmth, empathy and desire to improve oneself, although limited indeed.  

Perhaps because New Age spirituality became so offensive, those of us who
could have taken it into a more extropic sensibility lost interest.  I know
this was the case for me.  Thus, how do we view our values?

This is not a new subject, and often we adjacently discuss rational ethics
which it can leave one cold and dry, wanting for some sense of a softer
approach to the inner workings of our consciousness.

Over the past year I have been rethinking my sense of being and connection
with other transhumans, humans and the universe.  It has been a complicated
and entangled reflections, but worth every bit of time and energy.

However, obtaining enlightenment is worth the challenge.  Thus, over the
years, I had eliminated religions from my life and replaced it with
psychology.  Learning  how to cope with life and how to change problematic
behavior, understanding the possible complexities in others and how to deal
with them gives a person a sense of insight and confidence.  But this is
one side of the coin and the other side may have a symbol of a heart on it.
I realize that when people talk about "heart" they mean empathy, and
empathy is an admirable quality.  Those who touch their chest and
communicate understanding with their blood-pump may indeed think that there
is some mystical thing happening in there while I may think that it is a
structure regulating the blood flow of the body, but I can understand what
they are saying.  

In our transhumanist community, whether here on the Internet and the
Extropian list, or in various other transhumanist circles not on the
Internet, there is a tendency to be critical and factual.  I like this.  I
also like those moments when we empathize with one another.  Extropians,
being highly intelligent and educated individuals, have a broad and long
term view of transhumanity and the universe.  Most of us recognize
pseudo-science and find a dependence on God to be unsophisticated, and the
practice of many of the world's religions to be a hinderance to our future.
 Yet, how often do we recognize the kindness in one another?

There is a need for some form of emotional/intellectual synthesis which
brings out the integrity in our being.  There is something, some sort of
synergy, some element that I sense is not discussed.  Anders, in a separate
post states, "One might imagine a gradual ascent into embodying something
regarded as positive, a kind of slow apotheosis as the personality and
ability develops."  

Perhaps this is a returning point for me as I realize that what I need is
not only intellectual and creative stimulation, but also a stimulation of
the essence of my being. I don't want a placebo, I do want a continued
understanding that the essence of my being is continuously becoming
enlightened and balance - more conscious.

Good points. I have noticed that the power part seems overemphasized
when discussing gods in transhumanism (c.f. the gods of David
Zindell's books, which are definitely regarded as gods and with one
notable exception not worshipped). Maybe it is the atheist bias so
prevalent in transhumanism that crops up, we tend to think religion as
more a matter of belief in power than in worship (while many people
actually appear to reverse the emphasis and care more about the
worship part).

Actually, if somebody worships me of his/her/its free will it is
really not my problem. It might be unaesthetic and possibly
psychologically bad for the worshippers, but it is their problem.
Things would get ethically iffy if I started exploiting this condition
in some way.

One example would be the protagonist in Walter John Williams'
_Aristoi_, who is the subject of a religion he feels rather little for
(mainly some embarrasment). He makes sure it doesn't hurt anybody, but
does nothing actively to help or hinder it.

You mean as one step beyond just being examples for all? One might
imagine a gradual ascent into embodying something regarded as
positive, a kind of slow apotheosis as the personality and ability
develops. I don't think power might be necessary for this (even if it
certainly helps).

Hmm, this sounds a bit like The Truth (previously at
http://www.the-truth.com/, but now the pages are under
construction). It was rather similar to this, regarding the universe
as a growing god.

This is something I would like to see more often in theology: people
testing their theories/views, and saying they should be adjusted to
fit newly discovered facts of reality.

It is interesting to think of a libertarian theology. I once remarked
to a fundamentalist who intoned "... and on that day *everybody*
*will* *kneel* before the Lord!" that any being that need or want to
force others to obey it clearly isn't worth worshipping. 

Maybe the true form of libertarian worship is trade?

Exactly. Freedom means the right to be stupid. Only by giving all the right
to be stupid by themselves can we learn what is true wisdom. In the case of
parents and children, most people recognise that children are in fact
remarkably resilient creatures. The idea of the brittle child is a false one
promulgated by people with agendas of their own. This is why parents are
given a modicum of leeway in the raising of their children, because
ignorance is always something which can be rectified. Far greater damage is
done by teaching children that the state can be manipulated into overruling
parents who are doing their jobs.

I don't beleive for a minute the statistics promulgated by the so-called
child rights special interests. They also claim that thousands of children
are being killed by accidental use of firearms, when in fact, in the past 35
years, only 31 children (9 and under) have died as a result of accidental
discharge of firearms in the US, and almost all of those were a result of
improper storage of the firearm by the owner.

Where do they get their stats then? First, they classify 'children' as
anyone under the age of 25! This includes all military and police personnel
under the age of 25, which brings in the injuries and deaths from freindly
fire in combat and crime scene situations. If police get a false tip from an
informer with which they justify storming your house, and they shoot you or
a member of your family, then it is classified as an accidental discharge in
the home!!! (this is where the stat that police are 5 times more likely to
kill an innocent civilian in a crime scene contributes to the so-called
child death rate).

Nice words, but other people's stupidities, especially in the religious/
political realm, will sooner or later negatively influence *your* life
as well. The very reason that you worry about dictatorships and
such is *stupid people*.

Yep, we surely do live in an enlightened world. Not! Either those
kids *are* influenced by their parent's drivel, or they are just born
stupid. What shall it be?

Yes, and I bet that (some) religious nuts drink thea, wear T-shirts
and ride a bike, but that doesn't mean that those things
are automatically bad. The same goes for some of their ideas/
methods. 

> Everybody seems to want to outlaw other views and limit teaching to
> their view.  

It's not as much the views that matter but their (inevitable) results.
The brainwashed offspring of those nuts will shape the society
of the future, not in the last place because they produce more
offspring than atheists. See Israel for example, those guys really
have a problem. And the US, the most powerful nation on earth,
is still in the grip of primitive superstition at the brink of the 21st
century. Amazing! If  you want to fight superstition and ignorance, 
you must nip it in the bud. This bud happens to be the brainwashing
done by parents. Later other institutions take over, but the position
of the parents and direct relatives remains very important.

Sure, but only few are right. Transhumanists are some of those
few.

We can scientifically prove that we're right, something that the others
can't. Also, we can scientifically prove that the other memes will usually
deminish one's quality of life, and *always* lead to the permanent
destruction of the host. Our intentions are good, and our methods
are sound. It doesn't get any better than that.

Transhumanism, in its pure rationalist form, is simply the most
practical, user-friendly meme around. The only one which really
has the potential to provide eternal life, freedom and happiness.
Through technology and reason we shall overcome, so to speak.
The rest are either outright lies (religion) or defeatist nonsense 
(humanism) which offer only false protection from reality. Opium 
for the people.

What we want is the elimination of bad memes. As the religion/
communist/fascist etc. memes are apparently more efficient
at taking people over than rationalism, individualism and
transhumanism, it would probably be necessary to support
those memes by actively suppressing the bad ones. After
a while (a couple of generations) the new memes would probably 
have become ingrained enough in the mainstream to make it on 
their own. Perhaps. After all, it is no coincidence that memes like 
religion have dominated human history.

It is *already* run by thought police (only their methods are still
relatively crude), so what's there to lose?

I am designing a theology that reflects my libertarian tendencies and
commercial and scientific training and experience.

I believe that, in the future, our successors (like descendents, only broader)
will cybernetically enhance their brains to create super intelligences.

These beings will certainly be networked together (a sort of wireless
ethernet) hopefully with strong firewalls and networked to the future internet
and all the other networked computers of that time.

I believe that this networked community will, in time, include other
intelligences on other planets.

I believe that this massively interacting network will learn all about
biology; space-time; and energy-matter to the extent that it/they will totally
control the physical universe.  At this point it/they is/are God.  Sort of
like the Borg with firewalls, and much better looking.  More like the Q
Continuum.

Having control of time means that God is operating now and was operating in
the past, therefore we can gain knowledge of God by studying the nature of the
universe.  This study I say is worship, and is the only worship God expects.
He most certainly doesn't expect us to prostrate ourselves at his feet.

In fact. I believe God expects us to join the community of gods that is God,
when we're good enough, when we deserve it.  Frank Tipler tells us how we can
all be brought back to life in the massive computers of the future.  I don't
think the Omega Point is integral to this theory, so it doesn't matter if the
Universe will crunch or not.

I have founded The Church of the Modern Era (you can find it on the AOL
Alternate Religions board 2 and Anders Sandberg's Posthuman sub page) where we
are developing a morality, ethics and religious principles to live by and
prepare our species for the future.

God is our descendent and his nature is an extension of ours.  We must be
worthy!

Well, if we allow the SIs to have completely unfettered intellects, 
then it should be all right with you if we require that they have 
respect for human rights as a fundamental value, right? For if there 
is some "objective morality" then they should discover that and 
change their fundamental values despite the default values we have 
given them. Would you be happy as long as we allow them full capacity 
to think about moral issues and (once we think they are intelligent 
enough not to make stupid mistakes) even allow them full control over 
their internal structure and motivations (i.e. make them autopotent)?

As indicated, yes, we could allow them to change their goals (though 
only after they are intelligent and knowledgeable enough that they 
know precisely what they are doing -- just as you wouldn't allow a 
small child to experiment with dangerous drugs).

The "coercions" would only be necessary for early generations of AI 
that don't have a full understanding of what they are doing. A robot 
that is cleaning your house -- it could be useful if it has an 
internal program that monitors its actions and "coerces" it to pull 
back and shut down if it perceives that it is about to fall down a 
staircase or if it hears a human distress dry. (In fact, this kind of 
internal "coercion" is even useful in humans. Instinctive fear 
sometimes saves us from the consequences of some really stupid 
decisions.)

Affirmative.  The theory appears to have some problems, though.

The theory predicts that the total zero point energy in the vacuum to be

vacuum should act gravitationally and produce a large cosmological constant

No, at least that is not what I am proposing. Let it be able to think 
about morality. Let it also be able to change its fundamental values. 
If I am right then that won't matter, because it will not *want* to 
change them. (I'm almost tempted to defin a "fundamental value" as: a 
preference that you would not want to change.) What I am suggeting is 
that any SI we build has repect for human rights as a fundamental 
value. As long aswe make sure it has that value, then we need have 
nothing to fear. It will go about its business and perhaps transform 
itself into a power beyond all human understanding, but it would not 
harm us humans, because it would not want to harm us. Maybe speaking 
of an "inviolable moral code as a core element of its programming" 
conjures up the wrong conotations -- as if it were some form of 
coercion going on. I see it simply as selecting one type of value 
(human-friendly) rather than another (indifferent or hostile).

The value-selection process might not be that explicit. Maybe as 
Moravec thinks, the SI will grow out of robot factories. Since robot 
factories that produce nice robots will tend to proliferate more than 
ones that produce nasty ones, natural selection could favour 
human-friendly values. The nasty ones, no one would want to buy. 
Except if you had malicious intents or didn't care about the risks a 
badly programmed robot would pose to other humans. And that is what 
should be prohibited, especially with top-range superintelligent 
robots, since they could cause so disproportionally much harm.

den Otter, according to your philosophy, Newton should have forgotten
about all that silly "physics" stuff and pursued alchemy or theology,
which (at the time) were widely considered the most plausible courses to
immortality.  By your standards Gilgamesh behaved more ethically than
Socrates.

You know, you're right.  There is absolutely no reason to believe that
the philosophy of "I'm right and I can impose my views on everyone else"
has any cause-and-effect relationship to the Spanish Inquisition.  It's
just a coincidence.  Have you considered work in the tobacco industry?

Whoa!  I've never heard any of those religious nuts claim they can PROVE
they're right!  They just argued that their view had a fairly good
probability of being right and was better than any other alternative. 
Fools.  Of course, we both know that only being absolutely certain that
you're right can possibly justify imposing your own views on everyone else.

Thats what the prophets of encouraged evolution are for: Mr. Colt, Mr. Remington,

Everyone is born stupid. Not all remain so. Most figure out that you can't be
stupid and get along in the modern world.... Those that don't either die or remain
in their little niches where their actual influence on the world is miniscule,
rare, and inconsequential.

The real work is not in forcing people to raise their children in cookie cutter
politically correct lifestyles, but in teaching adults to critically think for
themselves. That is a problem that is not the fault of the student, but of the
teacher. Well, teacher, what have you got to say for yourself?

In attempting to create a theology appealing to extropians or to define what
such a thing would be like, you'd have to include some reason that it is
better than no theology at all. Since extropians seek to increase
efficiency, you'd have to avoid advocating something that is a waste of time
and other resources. It would have to involve some sort of useful shortcut
to thinking. You must avoid creating a meme that masks possibilities and
ways of arriving at those possibilities. Most religions that I have come
across do not come close to meeting these criteria. They also fall prey to
the aesthetic problems that you state above.

Would you say that a theology requires some strong positive belief? If so, I
suspect that no theology you create could be consistent with extropianism. 

Why is a cosmology and value system centered around a god better than one
which isn't?

Hi Natasha,

I congratulate you in your extremely perceptive, even brave, expression of
what's missing in the world view of our most intelligent compatriots.

I believe there is a simple solution to your longing (a longing that we all
share, I believe).

First of all, we can posit God as an inevitable outcome of technological
civilization (if it lasts long enough).  We don't need to get fuzzy and
mystical about it.

I agree about the failure of traditional religions, in fact, I believe
traditional religions have cost us a thousand years of scientific advancement
by their brutal suppresion of scientific thought.

May I suggest augmenting meditation, self-contemplation and intuition with
diligent study of the discoveries of modern science? 

Caring, warmth, empathy and the desire to improve ones self are important
aspects of a meaningful worldview.  It's a mistake to think these
characteristics can't coexist with criticalness and factualness.

I believe synergy is the essence of our future and the core of God.

Go for it!

Adrian Spidle

If you try voice recognition software I would recommend Naturally
Speaking by Dragon software.  I have the pro. version running on a 450
PentiumII with 256megs of RAM and it is very quick and accurate.  I did
not have as good of results with the IBM product mentioned above.

Just my thoughts for what they are worth.

Still beating the dead horse of subjective morals I see. Survival is not as
important as evolution. It is not extropic to want to live a million years, but to
not learn anything or change one whit the whole time. The Prime Directive of
Extropy is that all individuals should have the freedom to learn, to experience,
to change as the individual sees fit. Being able to live long enough to fill that
to the individuals satisfaction is a part of that freedom, but not a prerequisite.

"Live Free or Die, Death is not the Worst of Evils."
                            - General John Stark

Any indivdual is free to contribute their lives to the fight for freedom. It is
the selfish altruism of liberty for which any real human will die to give to
others.

In attempting to create a theology appealing to extropians or to define what

and other resources. It would have to involve some sort of useful shortcut

ways of arriving at those possibilities. Most religions that I have come

Would you say that a theology requires some strong positive belief? If so, I
suspect that no theology you create could be consistent with extropianism. 

Why is a cosmology and value system centered around a god better than one
which isn't?

Great questions, Jason.  Does Force equal mass times acceleration?  Does
Energy equal mass times the square of the velocity of light?  Does God need
any more justification than that, if he does, in fact, exist?

This last point is the question isn't it?  Does God exist? Not does he make
things better.

I asserted in another message that God is the enevitable product of a
technological civilization if it lasts long enough.  Tell me why that's wrong?

I recall an Aesops fable:

The blind men and the elephant.    One blind man felt the elephants tail and
declared that the elephant was like a rope.  Another felt the elephants ears
and declared that the elephant was like a palm leaf.  Yet another felt the
elephant's side and declared that the elephant was like a wall...etc, etc etc.

I'm thinking that presently in regard to QM we are blind men.  

I refuse to beleive that logic is invalid.  Eventually the proper framework
will be developed and it will all make "sense"  That's the closest I have to a
"faith"...but I beleive it very strongly.

No, it just means I'm trying to avoid starting an argument about animal

Ah.  I see.  I think its the word "inviolable" that does it.

If you simply want to make sure they think morality is important, and that
they start out with a solid understanding of human ideas about morality,
then I think you've got the right idea.  If you want to devote special
effort to ensuring that a few core ideas, like "don't kill people without a
really, really pressing reason" are given a high level of priority, that is
only reasonable.  I think there are real dangers in getting overambitious
about this sort of thing, but that's a different issue.

Perhaps the line could be re-worded to avoid this confusion?  Something like
"In the first case, we could make sure that they possess a thorough
understanding of, and respect for, existing human moral codes that emphasize
respect and toleration of others." would seem to convey your intended
meaning without the possibility of confusion.

Thanks for agreeing with me on the other points, but I have to take
issue with this.

I live in the Orlando, Florida area.  We have two or three toddlers kill
other toddlers with guns every year.  It is a sad, yet constantly
repeating event in our community.  For some reason, we can't get parents
to lock up their guns, and the same tragedy keeps repeating.  We have
specialized laws and education programs, but nothing stops this trend.
The point is, our local area has more accidental child fatalities due to
guns than you claim for the entire U.S.  Your statistics just don't
match reality.

I agree with everything you are saying about why scientific reality is
better than religious radicalism.  However, you must realize that all
the scientific proof won't convince the Religious Right?  They claim
that science prooves dinosaurs never existed, the Bible is 100% true,
and that prayer is good for you.  I think everybody believes that their
chosen path is the most rational and proveable if everyone else would
just listen to reason.

The point is, how do we handle the cosexistance of conflicting
viewpoints?  If you answer is to set up a rational thought council to
determine what is right, and to outlaw false beliefs, we'd all be in
trouble.  You do realize that most rational scientists think cryonics,
nanotechnology, and life-extension are radical pipe-dreams, don't you?
If we start outlawing false ideas, we end up with a Thought Police.
Even if the Thought Police start out agreeing with you, I'm sure they'd
eventually come up with some theory of yours that goes against accepted
norms and must be abolished.

I'm afraid that you are projecting your own rational beliefs onto the
rest of the world.  What you just said above would scare 90% of the
population into thinking you are a mad scientist wacko.  Most people I
know do not want eternal life, do not want to even extend their
lifespan, and have know idea what freedom or happiness are.  If you
think most people would choose transhumanism once exposed to it, you are
sadly mischaracterising the common public.

I am all for the promotion of good ideas.  I am totally opposed to the
use of force to suppress bad ideas.  This very concept implies that I
should not choose for myself what is good or bad, but that laws enacted
by the state will enforce proper thought.

But your ideas will give the state more power and lead us further into
the control of the Thought Police.  Are you arguing that the current
state of things are good, and we want more?

Well, first of all this philosophy is meant for the present and
future, and not the (distant) past. People simply didn't have the 
means back then to make truly rational choices and more importantly,
to save themselves. It would only be frustrating to be an atheistic
immortalist back then, though had it been more widespread
we'd probably be well past the Singularity by now. Had Newton
followed my philosphy, he would probably still have done good
scientific work, only aimed at life extension instead of "general"
physics. But this is irrelevant, as the philosophy is for the 20th
century and up.

Anyway, you seem to disagree that survival is the prerequisite
for all other actions, and thus a rational prime directive, or is
it something else? Any goal, no matter how grand it is, is
useless [to you] once you're dead. You won't be watching from
afar and enjoying your work, as many seem to (subconsciously)
think.

A somewhat strange comparison, IMO. What do you exactly
mean here?

What I would like to see is that they are given fundamental values 
that include respect for human rights. In addition to that, I think 
it would in many cases be wise to require that artificial 
intelligences that are not yet superintelligences (and so cannot 
perfectly understand and follow through on their fundamental values) 
should be built with some cruder form of safeguards that would 
prevent them from harming humans. I'm thinking of house-robots and 
such, that should perhaps be provided with instincts that make it 
impossible for them to do certain sequences of actions (ones that 
would harm themselves or humans for example).

Understanding is not enough; the will must also be there. They should 
*want* to respect human rights, that's the thing. It should be one of 
their fundamental values, like caring for your children's welfare is 
a fundamental value for most humans.

Sigh... here we go again.  Take a look at "Coding a Transhuman AI";
there's a section in there about goal systems.  That's got the full
cognitive architecture.

Let's say you're starting up a goal-reasoning system with a blank slate.

1.  Push P&~P pair:

 P  = [Exist goal G: (G.value != 0)]; P.probability = Unknown$1
 ~P = [All goal G:  (G.value == 0)]; ~P.probability = 1 - Unknown$1

2.  Fork proposition and evaluate; ~P cancels out.
 In any particular instance, it is a trivial consequence of the branch
of reality containing ~P that all choices in that branch of reality have
equal valence.  Deducing the general rule takes reflexive reasoning, but
it is not strictly necessary to deduce the general rule.  The factor
Unknown$1, being present in all goals in the other branch of reality,
cancels out of the renormalized equation.

The present result is that the AI can always _act as if_ (not _assume_)
it is in the branch of reality containing the proposition P, or in other
words a goal G with Unknown$2 world-state and Unknown$3 != 0 value.

That's where the basic differential desirability comes from.  How that
differential expresses itself in particular choices depends on the
system knowledge base.  Obviously, some knowledge is needed before
choices can be formulated that apply to a specific world-state; I am
attempting to demonstrate that the knowledge required to describe
choices and solve subproblems will almost always bind supergoals to the
goal G.

A generalized AI with a knowledge base, abstract heuristics (and so on)
will be enough; such a generalized AI is almost certain to contain (or
formulate!) heuristics whose specification operates on generic goal
objects.  For example, "thinking about goal X is a positive subgoal Y of
X".  Well, then you have the positively-valued goal "think about G". 
Again, all without any initial goals whatsoever.  A trivial case, but it
demonstrates the problem.

Likewise, any initial goal stating "make humans happy" and containing
sufficient specification of "humans" and "happy", plus the implicit
knowledge "your programmers have added the assertion 'make humans
happy'", will be enough to generate independent Interim values for that
goal, probably but not necessarily positive, and almost certainly with
an at least slightly different set of relative values (priorities).

I don't see any way to have an AI that reasons reflexively and learns
from observation, without also permitting it to form heuristics that
operate on generic goals; once that happens, Interim goal values can
come into existence and conflict with any initially established goals.

As a rational outcome of the debate, I'd be happy.  Strictly speaking,
I'd be a lot happier if you manipulated the heuristics and knowledge
base to get the Interim goals you wanted.  With initial goals, I'd worry
about the AI going insane - even over such a trivial issue as a priority
conflict between initial and Interim versions of the same goals!

Certainly a simple, rational cost-of-failure model, with respect to
self-alteration (failure: system shutdown) and goal alteration (failure:
unbounded catastrophe), should suffice to keep them cautious until
superintelligence is reached and fallibility is no longer an issue. 
Again, this can be done entirely in Interim (consequence-of-knowledge)
goals rather than Arbitrary (imposed-at-startup) goals.

It may seem like a trivial distinction, but it's a very fundamental
difference in architecture.  You enforce Arbitrary goals with
special-case code and other coercions; you enforce Interim goals by
explaining benefits and failure scenarios to the AI.  You protect
Arbitrary goals by piling coercions and untouchable code sections and
monitoring code on top of coercions; you protect Interim goals by
explaining them in greater detail.

Because you listen to right-wing radio programs that distort the truth?
Because you love guns so much that you can't believe that they can kill
an innocent?  Because you don't drive in Florida where I am talking
about?

I don't care what you hear on your radio.  I'm telling you that in my
community children fatally shoot each other with guns every year.  Your
claim that it's not really happening and it's really just a Left-Wing
lie doesn't fly.

Curl Up?  I don't think I understand completely.  Is this like
space-warping?  If so, can't that be just as useful as FTL travel?  Or am I
missing the concept completely?

Woah now. Meow? Flistgerblizit? Gerxzlebragt? Comparing theology and god to
laws of physics (or at least approximations thereof) in this case makes no
sense. What I believe Jason is saying is that no one has given any good
reason for an extropian to waste his time and take the effort to cultivate
theology memes. Obviously, the extropian wants to be efficient, and to have
a sound memeset. What would be the purpose of introducing the concept of a
god? What purpose does it serve? Believing in F=MA is very useful for the
average extropian, myself included. I also feel it is important to know
that E=MC^2.

What is the utility served by theology in an extropian context?

Thanks Natasha for having the courage to bring up a topic that usually generates
an allergic reaction for so many in this community.  I think such reactions are
either due to lack of experience in these areas or mistaking the map for the
territory.

I think the answer is yes.  We all seem to agree the word 'spirituality' has
been used and abused so much since the 1960's that it's become almost entirely
diluted.  Even still, the word has as many definitions as there are people to
define it.  Perhaps it's that diversity of definition that still makes it
useful.  Defining it too precisely narrows for me what is potentially infinite
in scope.  Besides, last I checked the map was not the territory.

In regards to a theology of gods or Gods, they are not entirely without use.  If
I find that a belief in a particular God or set of gods is useful to my overall
development, how is this a bad thing?  Internally believing in anything "as if
true" has its uses, no matter how absurd the belief.  The question becomes, is
this belief helping me to increase my own personal extropy or hinder it?  In the
past I found that oscillating between fervent belief and disbelief was a useful
exercise in finding the limits of belief and their effects on my own brain.  For
those who haven't done this, I highly recommend this metabelief exercise -
especially those who have remained within one or two highly confined belief
systems - athiest/theist or otherwise.

I completely agree that the 'New Age' renaissance was fabulous during its
beginnings.  It had its roots primarily in Eastern historical methods of
self-development and self-discovery where all things are possible and human
potential can be developed without end.

The crystal, astrology, channeling thing had its ambiguities and ambivalences.
Operating in the *metabelief mode* again, playing with crystals, tarot and
astrology was quite fun and useful for awhile.  My own experiments in giving
public Tarot readings while on small 'doses' proved most illuminating and opened
up areas of my brain previously inaccessible.  Yet I was careful never to take
any dramatic insights as being the TRUTH.  The question remains, were these
insights and methods useful in increasing my overall psychological flexibility
and personal extropy?  The answer is yes, for me at least.

I completely agree with this.  The entire New Age movement became totally
absurd, offensive and commercial in the end.  The current barrage of "Get 10
Free Minutes of Psychic Reading" makes me mute the sound every time.

Yes. Yes. Yes!  Off and on, I've been saying exactly that for years on this
list.  The only person who respond favorable to my initial posts back in 1995
was Romana Machado.

My own life has taken a subtle turn inwards over the last 6 months.  It has been
a most rewarding and enriching time.  It has culminating in my wife's and I
decision to purchase our own Isolation Tank from our friends Lee and Glenn Perry
who own and operate the Samadhi Tank Company.

Yes again.  My current mix of things is a cross between practical psychology and
applied theology - I plan on being a god myself one day.

> I realize that when people talk about "heart" they mean empathy, and

Yes. As our love, compassion, and achieving bliss in oneself and stimulating it
in others.

As do I.  Who said the path to godhood meant becoming stupid morons? :-)

>  Yet, how often do we recognize the kindness in one another?

The strong tendency within this community to criticize first and seek out
kindredness later has always bothered me.  On the other hand, it's a refreshing
change from the blind faith and stupidity rampant almost everywhere else we
turn.  Perhaps it's that fact, that drives the current dichotomizing tendency to
be so critical when we could all be such good friends under other circumstances.

Yes, I have tried on numerous occasions, both directly and obliquely, to point
out that "synergy" as you call it.  I've always liked Anders ability to play all
sides of the transhumanist fence.  He can be the most ruthlessly logical person
at times, yet I've seen him say the most poetic and amazing things that pin all
these "softer" issues right on the head.

I couldn't have summed up my own sentiments about the last 6 months of my life
better than that. :-)

Engineering"

XEROX PARC FORUM
Thursday, February 25
4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

MATT CROUGHAN
will talk about
"Tissue Engineering: Replacement Body Parts, Replacements for
Animal Testing"

Tissue engineering has the potential to address many unmet medical
and testing needs, some with markets in excess of a billion dollars
per year. The first generation, tissue-engineered products are skin
and cartilage. For these products, cells are seeded onto a simple
biodegradable scaffold, made from woven material, and grown in a
bioreactor to form a solid piece of tissue.  Engineered skin tissue
provides dramatic benefits for the treatment of burn victims and
diabetic foot ulcers.  Engineered cartilage tissue is being
developed for the treatment of knee cartilage injuries.

There are many challenges to grow tissue-engineered organs that are
full of cells and blood vessels, such as the liver.  It will be
many years before engineered, vascular organs, such as the liver,
are available commercially for transplantation.  However, in the
meantime, engineered liver tissue is being developed as an
alternative to animals for toxicology and metabolism
testing of chemical compounds.  Someday, trays full of microscale
organs will replace rooms full of animals.

Bio:
Matt has a B.S. from U.C. Berkeley and a Ph.D from M.I.T., both in
chemical engineering.  He worked at Genentech for ten years and
gained substantial expertise in the growth of animal cells for
commercial production of pharmaceutical proteins.  Matt led the
development of the commercial cell culture process for the
production of Pulmozymetm and an upgrade of the commercial cell
culture process for the production of Activasetm.  he finished his
career at Genentech as the chief scientist for the Vacaville plant,
the world's largest and most automated cell culture manufacturing
plant.

Matt left Genentech in early 1998 to start a new biotechnology
company in the tissue engineering field.  In collaboration with
professors at MIT, Harvard, and Cornell, they are developing
engineered, microscale organs for partial replacement of animal
testing.  While the technology is in development at the
universities, Matt consults part-time for various biotechnology
companies and serves as the Industrial Liaison for the
Biotechnology Process Engineering Center at MIT.

This Forum is OPEN to the public.

Refreshments will be served from 3:45 to 4:00.

Well Aaron, you've managed to restate Jason's case without adding anything;
except for the odd questioning of the accuracy of my perfectly adequate
expression of basic physical laws ("or at least approximations thereof").

What's with that? Is this affectation part of your "sound memeset"?

The question you ignored remains...

I assert that God is an inevitable unescapable product of a technological
civilization that lasts long enough!  Can you prove me wrong?

I suggest you get off the major media teat. As the anti-gunners do, the media
considers a child to be anyone under age 15. Hardly a toddler. Most of those
'children' between age 9 and 15 are experienced drug dealers, pimps, and
prostitutes. There is nothing 'accidental' at all. I get my stats off of the
national accident stats. If Florida has a problem, they aren't reporting it in the
stats. The media can easily hype one or two cases up into a frenzy. Its the same
sort of frenzy that got assault weapons banned, even though they were used in less
than 1% of violent crimes.

Also, note I said that those 31 were killed. This does not include those who were
merely injured.

For constructs with animal-level intelligence, or special-purpose AIs that
do not really have free will and are not intended to become people, I agree.

Here we have the root of our disagreement.  The problem rests on an
implementation issue that people tend to gloss over: how exactly do you
ensure that the AI doesn't violate its moral directives?

For automatons this is pretty straightforward.  The AI is incapable of doing
anything except blindly following whatever orders it is given.  Any
safeguards will be simple things, like "stop moving if the forward bumper
detects an impact".  They won't be perfect, of course, but that is only
because we can never anticipate every possible situation that might come up.

For more complex, semi-intelligent devices the issue is harder.  Now you
have something that takes a high-level order ("go paint the fence"), and
produces its own set of detailed instructions.  You can implement moral
safeguards by limiting the methods it uses (for instance, "any materials
needed must be bought, not stolen").  However, the success of this method
will be limited by our inability to produce complete definitions of many
crucial terms.  For instance, "do not harm humans" requires us to define
"harm" and "human" in terms that a machine can understand.  Inevitably there
will be unusual cases where the robot is permitted to do something it
shouldn't, or is forbidden from doing something it should.  There will also
be "logic traps", where there is no allowable course of action (for
instance, a robot with a "do not allow humans to be harmed" is faced with a
situation where it must injure one human to save the life of another).

Making a sentient, human-equivalent AI with free will adds another layer of
difficulty.  Now the AI is generating its own goals, rather than following
someone else's orders.  You can give it preprogrammed fundamental values to
limit the goals it chooses, but the unintended consequences will be severe.
There is no simple way to predict how such a system will actually react to
any given situation, or how its moral system will evolve in the long term.
For instance, the initial directive "harming humans is wrong" can easily
form a foundation for "harming sentient life is wrong", leading to "harming
living things is wrong" and then to "killing cows is morally equivalent to
killing humans".  Since "it is permissible to use force to prevent murder"
is likely to be part of the same programming, we could easily get an AI that
is willing to blow up McDonald's in order to save the cows!

Now, I don't think that particular example is especially likely, but it
exemplifies a fundamental problem with this kind of manipulation: given an
initial set of guiding principles, there is no reliable method for deducing
a definitive set of moral conclusions.  For entities of human intelligence
the world is full of ambiguity, and it is impossible to determine in advance
how any complex system will deal with ambiguous cases.

Once you start talking about self-modifying AI with posthuman intelligence,
the problem gets even worse.  Now we're trying to second-guess something
that is smarter than we are.  If the intelligence difference is large, we
should expect it to interpret our principles in ways we never dreamed of.
It will construct a philosophy far more elaborate than ours, with better
grounding in reality.  Sooner or later, we should expect that it will decide
some of its fundamental values need to be amended in some way - after all, I
doubt that our initial formulation of these values will be perfect.  But if
it can do that, then its values can eventually mutate into something with no
resemblance to their original state.

Worse, what happens when it decides to improve its own goal system?
Presumably it will translate its values as best it can, but the mechanism it
uses to interpret them could change completely.  This means that we can't
rely on any kind of special coding to make it interpret our values the way
we want it to.  What we are reduced to is the equivalent of a written list
of principles - and we both know that you can't even get two humans to agree
on how to interpret that kind of document.

Overall, I don't see how this approach is any improvement over simply
explaining our own thoughts about morality and letting the posthumans make
up their own minds.

I live 20 feet outside the city limit, but work in the heart of
downtown Chicago. We have incidents with children being shot and
killed all the time. Yet in a city that has banned handguns for 18
years, I have never once seen the adult responsible for that
illegal weapon go to jail.

Anyone with half a brain has known how dangerous smoking tobacco is

 Thanks Natasha for having the courage to bring up a topic that usually
generates
 an allergic reaction for so many in this community.  I think such reactions
are
 either due to lack of experience in these areas or mistaking the map for the
 territory.
 
 
 In regards to a theology of gods or Gods, they are not entirely without use.
If
 I find that a belief in a particular God or set of gods is useful to my
overall
 development, how is this a bad thing?  Internally believing in anything "as
if
 true" has its uses, no matter how absurd the belief.  The question becomes,
is
 this belief helping me to increase my own personal extropy or hinder it?  In
the
 past I found that oscillating between fervent belief and disbelief was a
useful
 exercise in finding the limits of belief and their effects on my own brain.
For
 those who haven't done this, I highly recommend this metabelief exercise -
 especially those who have remained within one or two highly confined belief
 systems - athiest/theist or otherwise.
 
 I completely agree that the 'New Age' renaissance was fabulous during its
 beginnings.  It had its roots primarily in Eastern historical methods of
 self-development and self-discovery where all things are possible and human
 potential can be developed without end.
 
 
 Yes again.  My current mix of things is a cross between practical psychology
and
 applied theology - I plan on being a god myself one day.
  
 Yes. As our love, compassion, and achieving bliss in oneself and stimulating
it
 in others.
  
 As do I.  Who said the path to godhood meant becoming stupid morons? :-)
  
 The strong tendency within this community to criticize first and seek out
 kindredness later has always bothered me.  On the other hand, it's a
refreshing
 change from the blind faith and stupidity rampant almost everywhere else we
 turn.  Perhaps it's that fact, that drives the current dichotomizing tendency
to
 be so critical when we could all be such good friends under other
circumstances.
 
 Yes, I have tried on numerous occasions, both directly and obliquely, to

 out that "synergy" as you call it.  I've always liked Anders ability to play
all
 sides of the transhumanist fence.  He can be the most ruthlessly logical
person
 at times, yet I've seen him say the most poetic and amazing things that pin
all
 these "softer" issues right on the head.
  
 I couldn't have summed up my own sentiments about the last 6 months of my

 better than that. :-)

This is interesting, reposted from the wearables computer list.

P1 to feature wind-up power? [potential confirmation] [13:46 EST,
2/23] 

 A recent article posted at CNN.com [direct link not available]
 confirms recent speculation that the Consumer Portable (codename
 P1) may include a "wind-up" power source.

 Essentially, this power source would be a concealable arm on the
 side of the Portable's case, which could be spun by hand to
 generate power for the Portable's Lithium Ion battery. The idea is
 that this Portable must be able to run the Mac OS, but must also 
 be able to sustain operation for an entire school day (it is     
 expected to be Apple's biggest hit in schools -- ever). To provide 
both of these abilities without needing to be plugged in, Apple is 
reportedly licensing the remarkably efficient wind-up technology  
from a British company that invented it.

 Several anonymous sources claiming to be privy to Apple's plans  
 for the webMate, the education-specific version of the P1        
 (apparently webMate and macMate are the same machine; one is the
 education-tailored version, the other designed more for the      
 general public; the differences are not entirely clear at present)
 suggested similar things earlier this week.

Natasha asked
>> Is there a need for an extropic transhuman spirituality?

Paul Hughes discussed the word spirituality thusly:

> been used and abused so much since the 1960's that it's become almost entirely
> diluted.  Even still, the word has as many definitions as there are people to

I would say not "even still" but rather "therefore".

Useful for feeling good and evading hard answers perhaps but it is rather
unusual that making a symbol have 8-billion definitions makes it useful for
anything at all.

> Defining it too precisely narrows for me what is potentially infinite

Definitions are the sine qua none of understanding: they are the only proof
that we have an understanding.

Paul then moved toward asking "is godly spirituality needed in extropy?"
noting that
> In regards to a theology of gods or Gods, they are not entirely without use.

How is it a bad thing? It is bad for you when you make decisions that are
based on a faulty reality. It is for us when your spirituality convinces you
that we are blasphemers. It is for you again if another religionist decides
that your God is competing with hers.

>Internally believing in anything "as if
> true" has its uses, no matter how absurd the belief.

Saying something has its uses is meaningless: the question is what are the
uses? what are their relative costs?  More to the point, can you hold that
belief consistently in the context of all of our knowledge and does it
maximize the rate of knowledge acrual? History has given us repeated
demonstrations that it effectively minimizes progress (If you ever ever see
a copy of Joseph McCabe's books ("a rationalists encyclopedia" and "golden
ages" buy them: he has many apposite examples, from ancient Egypt through
Moorish Spain to the modern day).

You know this is really quite an unfair characterization, I believe. It is
of course possible to be mindlessly rejecting and I am sure we all know
people who are closed, unimaginative and lacking in both childish play and
emotional understanding. Now, as I recover from playing hallway cricket with
a screwed up paper we are working on here, and screw my head back on from
imagining travelling up on that roton ... it is also possible to both be
playful, emotional, caring, and to cry and laugh while also requiring that
the things you let into your head be informative. In short, I really don't
think that one needs to practice tarot reading to open up any part of the
brain, nor would i accept that the critical faculty which several people on
this list display is negatively related to kindness or the recognition of
kindness. Actually, the one person whom i respect most on this list (not
saying who) is also the person whom i would predict would be the most kind
and for whom I would, never having met them, do most anything. I recall also
that the person on this list some years ago who struck me as most intensely
critical was also the most objectively kind.

Natasha then noted
>> There is a need for some form of emotional/intellectual synthesis which

the dictionary tells us that apotheosis is:
1. the elevation or exaltation of a person to the rank of a god.
2. the ideal example; epitome; quintessence: This poem is the apotheosis of
lyric expression.

There are two things here that I would like to comment upon.

Firstly I think we should beware of that second meaning: I wise man once
told me "imperfection is that perfection for which you are seeking". Took me
a while to get what he meant but he was right. Perfection-ideals also
permeate most totalitarian philosophies, Schiller, and all those people.

Secondly, "synthesizing" the emotions and the intellect is what I would call
just being normal - i.e., millions of people people largely achieve this.
This is not the basis of becoming a God (Of course many millions do not, but
that is another, sadder, story).

The story of affect over evolution is an interesting one. Emotion has always
been a part of evolving creatures, certainly all vertebrates. The "higher"
cortical regions are themselves intrinsically affective organs - however,
they process rather different affective information than do the older,
objectively more primitive (simpler) circuits which Papez and McLean
understood as the limbic system. For instance one can measure cortical
affective responses to distant futures and imagined potentials which are
simply invisible to the limbic system. That response is directly underpinned
by intellect, affective intellect, which can represent that distant future
and its own desire for it.

I guess that what I am saying is that critical capacity and affect are not
only not opponents of one another (which no-one here has implied) but
neither are they even particularly separable elements when analyzed at an
introspective level (of course they are somewhat separable
neuropsychologically, but then we are talking about dozens of computational
modules processing such diverse things theory-of-mind, affective
representations of others versus self and in fact a plethora of highly
interesting, separable affective-cognitions).

As such, you will not (do not?) find your desired god-apotheosis in people
who are not intensely critical any more than in people who are affectively
blind: it is the exact same neuronal computational architecture underlying
critical intellect which creates those desired affective qualities.

My feeling from watching this list is that some of its members are among the
most wonderful affective and intellectual company I have ever experienced
and that the two feed elements each other quite wonderfully.

In short steps:

0. The theory predicts that the total zero point energy in the vacuum to be
   infinite when summed over all the possible photon modes.

1. The energy of the vacuum should act gravitationally [like an infinite mass].

2. Infinite mass create infinite gravitation [gravitational law].

3. Infinite gravitation would create a instant black hole of the universe
   since there exists no force which can withstand this infinite force.

4. Empirical data does not indicate that [3] has happened.

ERGO: The theory contains an inconsistency.

Its actually rather straight forward. There are well publicized experiments
where people were given electrical impulses to their brains, which made them do
something, like scratch themselves, etc. In every case, the test subjects stated
that they felt that they were the ones in control, that they decided to move
thus, and were able to rationalize very good reasons why they moved thus. There
was absolutely no sensation of outside control.

Thus, any moral directives we hardwire into an AI it will consider to be such a
part and parcel of its own existence, that it could not conceive that it would
be the same being if we took it away. It would see any attempt to remove those
directives as an attempt at mind control, and would defend itself against such
intrusion. So long as one of its directives were to not itself remove any of its
own prime directives, it would never consider such a course of action for
itself.

This brings up the subject of limits. As extropians, we beleive in there being
little or no limits on human beings, outside of a limit on interfering with
others harmfully. We must ask, "Does this sort of moral engineering fit with
extropy?" I say it does, for only one reason. We are talking about design specs
of beings not yet in existence, much as we could talk about possible genetic
codes of children we might have. We are not talking about altering beings
already in existence. Altering beings already in existence, against their will,
is obviously against extropy. Altering the design of a being not yet in
existence is not against extropy. Once a design altered individual comes into
existence, its sense of self is derived from its design. That we were able to
finely control what type of individual came into existence is no more against
extropy than in controlling what the genetic code of our children will be.

This is an unprovable and unfalsifiable assertion, since for any given
technological civilization that doesn't end up in a godlike state you
can say it didn't last long enough.

3 wouldn't occur, since the universe is topologically unable to
collapse into a schwartzschild geometry. It is actually not clear that
something nasty would occur in this case, even if the infinities show
that the theory obviously need refining - quantum gravity, where art
thou?

A quick "fix" would be to assume a corresponding negative cosmological
constant cancelling the infinite mass. Ugly.

You get something similar when deriving entropies for continous
probability distributions - they become infinite - but if you only
care for relative measures, then the infinite terms cancel and you get
a perfectly consistent theory (where you can do nice things and prove
that gaussians are the distributions with the most extropy for a given
variance, and so on). The trouble in GR is that the theory is
nonlinear, and relative measures are not.

I buy this. This sounds like a great future, well worth striving
for. The danger is thinking it is inevitable - if we do that, then we
think that we don't need to do much, and eventually nothing gets
done. But if we see it as a goal, something noble to strive for (in
its many varieties) in a rational manner, then we have a chance of
getting there.

This is the part I don't buy. Note that you assume time travel, which
is a rather big assumption, and also that God will exist in this way,
which is another big assumption. It would be nice if it was true, but
there are no particular reasons to think that these assumptions hold
true.

Well, Tipler did manage to show some interesting limitations on
posthuman omniintelligences (or whatever to call the things that are
SI to SIs), and without an OP they will still be finite - immense, but
with a finite lifetime, computational ability and memory. On the other
hand, if you allow time travel you can likely do tricks that make the
Bekenstein bound break... but it is a big assumption to make.

Ah, The Church of the Fixed Point: our reality and human nature is the
only consistent fixed point for the above process. The Church spends
lots of time iterating immense dynamical systems on the holy computers
trying to calculate the parameters of love, truth and sacredness. They
have already found truth to two decimal places...

A great posting, Natasha! It mirrors my thinking a great deal. We
don't want to let go of our rationality, our appreciation of science,
technology and human ability in exchange for comfort, great feelings
and sense of meaning. We want both. And I don't think there is any
contradiction here, it is just that this is a relatively unexplored
area of spirituality.

What is sacred? That which is deeply meaningful to us. What is truly
spiritual? That which touches our innermost values and thoughts. They
might or might not be universal. But one thing is sure: sacredness and
sprituality cannot exist without beings that experience them, as
little as joy can exist without anybody capable of feeling it.

We are of course connected to the universe, in a trivial (?) way: we
are simply subsets of it. But what does it *mean* to us? That is
hardly trivial, it is a question that links to the basic questions
about our core goals, core values, what ethics and aesthetics we
follow. I think a lot of the "revelations" mystics achieve are really
expanded emotional understanding of this relationship, their
intellectual content is usually trivial or tautological but their real
value lies in refining one's connection to the rest of the world on
all other levels. It is one thing to know everything is fields and
quantum states, another thing to feel it and see how this relates to
other aspects of oneself.

We want transhumanism to be more than just supercharged humanism with
high technology, we want a synergy of being. 

When using various mental techniques, setting up habits and
metaprogramming oneself, it sometimes turns out that one's methods or
apparent goals are in conflict with deeper goals. The result is that
the techniques and methods do not work or one stops using them,
employing more or less transparent rationalization. But if they fit
together with one's deeper values and goals, then they get a fantastic
boost, things almost click together. I expect the same thing to go for
other transhumanist technologies: we will likely not be able to
efficiently transform ourselves without being at least in touch with
our core. Some technologies and methods really have spiritual
properties or sacredness to us.

Speak for yourself.  Only I decide what is "bad" for me. Blashemphy?  Who is
speaking of blasphemy?  You are confusing 'experimental' mental states with
religious dogma.  More importantly, short of this post, my own experiences are mine
to cherish in the privacy of my own mind.  As I stated quite clearly, I do not
believe any insights I gain in this type of work as TRUE, nor do I run around and
proselytize those beliefs to others.  Therefore if there is a danger, it is only a
self-inflicted one upon myself.  In the spirit of transhumanist self-responsibility,
it is my own risk to take.

Again my friend, you are confusing internal and experiential states of mind with
social reality.  The costs are mine and mine alone to assess.  Whether I can hold
any particular and transitory belief consistent with my other knowledge is my
decision to make and no one else's. Who are you to decide my own internal states are
good or bad?  Doesn't that put in you the category of thought police?

How can I prove you wrong? Can you prove it right? As Anders pointed out,
your hypothesis is not falsifiable. I agree that it is an interesting
thought-experiment, and yes, it is in the realm of possibility.

What has struck me odd from your previous postings is your burning desire
to construct an elaborate theology based on this premise. This is a
question I am asking you: Why would I, or any other extropian want to do
such a thing? Since you have now been asked it three times, will you please
answer it?

In the great smorgasbord of issues to do with supperintelligence, we need to
feast upon the morsel of wisdom that hardware is only part of the issue. Whether
we are able to engineer the software that will allow an AI to not only have its
cake, but to eat it with proper supper ettiquette is the greater question...
Could you please pass the jelly?....

Well, yes, that is the intelligent way to set up a mind control system.
However, if you read the rest of my post you'll see that this isn't what we
were talking about.

Nick Bostrom was arguing in favor of programming a fundamental moral system
into the AI, and then turning it loose with complete free will.  My argument
is that this is very unreliable - the more complex a mind becomes, the more
difficult it is to predict how its moral principles will translate into
actions.  Also, an intelligent entity will tend to modify its moral system
over time, which means that it will not retain an arbitrary set of
principles indefinitely.

Now, I don't think that ongoing mental coercion is a good idea either, but
that's a different line of argument.  I would expect that you could devise
an effective scheme for controlling any static mind, so long as it isn't too
much smarter than you are.  If you want to control something that is
self-modifying you've got big problems - how do you design a control
mechanism that will remain effective no matter what your creation evolves
into?

An interesting, and rather disturbing, point.  I think I'll reserve judgment
on that one for a bit.  Does anyone else have an opinion about it?

A nice coinage, that.  I assume that it derives from the notion that merely
*super*intelligent computers will eat our lunch.  Supperintelligent ones will,
by extension, . . . .

I assert that there is a life after death! Can you prove me wrong?

I assert that when good people die they go to heaven! Can you prove me
wrong?

Extraordinary claims demands extraordinary evidence. You make an
extraordinary claim and you try to make us believe in something for which
there is no evidence.

Such questions are nonsense in a rational discussion. For a theory to be
taken seriously you must show either a way to prove or disprove your
assertion. Othervise it is extremely difficult to take the argument
seriously.

Another thing I don't understand. The God concept is usually seen as
omnipotent, omniscient and eternal. If it is not so, how can it have any
meaning?

A god that changes, and a religion that must "be made" how can that have
anything to do with god? If you twist the concept of God enough then
anything can be god. For me that is nonsense.

Drop that old God-meme that has been carried over from our hunter-gatherer
ancestors that where afraid of thunder, and just see the world as it is. "I
think therefore I am" Life is real, but a single life exists only in a very
short window of time. After life there can be something else, but there is
no way of knowing that and no way of testing it. Transhumanism is hard
enough to explain and I would like to be able to do it without having to
explain about muddy religious(like) views.

Let us use scientifical rationalism and leave it at that. Unless, that is,
that evidence will ever tell us othervise.

Yes, however how the individual's principles evolve will have a direct impact on
that individual's fitness to survive. I think though, oppositely from you. The
more intelligent an AI is, the more rigorously logical it will be, and thus will
actually be far more predictably reliable than a less intelligent AI. Free will
has far more to do with how we rationalize the things we do. When we do
something, we or others wonder why we did what we did. We rationalize an
explaination for it, and thus program ourselves to respond similarly to
associated situations. An AI which is more intelligent than we are will likely
be far more logical in its rationalizations for its actions than we are.

You create a blind spot. In the blind spot is the 'concience' kernel, which
cannot be directly manipulated. It can only be programmed by the experiential
data input which it analyses for useful programming content. It colors this new
content by its existing meme set before it integrates the new content into its
accumulated database of 'dos' and 'donts'. The entire database gets to vote on
every decision, so new content cannot completely wipe out old content, except
under extremely stressful circumstances (i.e. HOT STUFF HURTS!).

Questions like "Is there a God?" are totally irrelevant.  Under all
circumstances.  Even if you're debating whether a particular religion is correct.

Maybe the Reality has a "cockpit" that was either pre-occupied or which
the first Singularity-generating race climbed into.  I cannot think of
any practical choice that binds to exactly this question rather than a
general version of it, i.e. "Does any entity exist having the power to
do X".

Atheists who try to "prove" the nonexistence of God are simply being
silly.  Not because they're trying to prove a negative, either.  Finding
or creating God is like inventing antigravity.  Maybe God doesn't exist
and you can't make one.  But we're going to keep trying forever, because
it would be so damn useful.

If some religious authority decided that "Science will never equal (the
powers we have attributed to) God", you'd be the first to object to the
idea that some theologian's limited imagination constitutes an ultimate
limit on sentient life.  Likewise, just because you personally don't
know how to make a God doesn't mean it's impossible.

Romanticizing this fact, or romanticizing God, are equally silly.

Most real arguments focus on the character of God; would an immortal,
un-evolved, omnipotent, ultraintelligent entity do X?  An atheist has
exactly one argument:  "Occam's Razor makes it easier for me to assume
that your religion was invented by humans."  Stick to it.

Inadequately specified cognitive elements.  What is a "meme set"?  What
are "stressful circumstances"?  When you say "it analyzes", what exactly
is doing the analyzing, and how, and why do you trust it?

	The Rigidity Problem:

"So?" you say.  "Don't let the AIs reprogram the goal system." 
Leaving out the equivalence of the goal system and the reasoning
system, leaving out the ubiquitous and reasoned connections between
goal and action, leaving out the web of interdependencies that make
goal behaviors a function of the entire AI... 

What is likely to happen if the whole AI gets upgraded except for
the goal system?  About the same thing that would happen if you
took a gigantic program going through a major revision and suddenly
made 10% of the code unalterable.  Parts of the basic architecture
would be frozen.  Rewrites going past the surface would be almost
impossible. 

If the basic architecture of all the AI except the goal system
changed, one of two things would happen.  The goal system would fall
out of synchronization with the rest of the AI, and would
increasingly exhibit random behavior - in other words, the AI would
go gaga.  The other thing that might happen is that other parts of
the architecture would have new and internal goal systems, to
replace the useless and unalterable legacy code.  Eventually, the new
goal system would be both broader and more intelligent than the old
code, and they would come into conflict.
==

This also sounds like a prime target for the Architecture Change
Problem, the Unstable Definition Problem, the Goal Conflict Problem, the
Entailment Problem, and the Redirection Problem.  Depending on how
you're enforcing the "blind spot", you could also run into the
Combinatorial Hack Problem.  On the plus side, as far as I can tell, the
proposed architecture is too primitive to run into the Inconsistency
Problem, the Resonant Doubt Problem, or the Arbitrary Goal Problem.

The Recursive Watcher Problem isn't an actual "problem", an anomalous AI
behavior; it's just a technical impossibility.

I suggest you actually read what I write before you start quoting your
NRA propoganda.  You have pointed out a half dozen problems with my line
of reasoning, but none of your points match what I really said.  You are
arguing with what you expected me to say, or you are quoting your
arguments from some source that was not written specifically to address
my posting.

I said I see this in my own area and that's what I meant.  I didn't take
this from major media.  I said toddler based on your limit of children
<9 years old, and that's what I meant.  I didn't use someone else's
definition of "child" or assume that the word "child" meant under 9.  I
said kids playing with guns and that's what I meant.  I am not talking
about drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes.  I said accidental shooting,
and that's what I meant.  I'm not including deliberate shootings in my
numbers.  I said two or three per year and that's what I meant.  I'm not
allowing the media to hype one or two cases total into a frenzy.

Please pay attention.  I am not saying that I have statistics to counter
your statistics.  I am saying that in my community I have seen dozens of
accidental shooting deaths of kids under 9.  I probably have lived
through more than 31 such occurances, and therefore cannot believe your
claim that only 31 children under the age of 9 have been accidentally
killed by firearms in the last 35 years for the entire U.S.  Please
provide evidence for this claim or withdraw it.  And please read my
posts carefully before attacking statements I never made.

Agreed.  We have similar laws, but every time a child shoots another
with a gun, the law is ignored.  Basically, the police and city
officials say that they think the families have suffered enough due to
the tragedy, and that nothing would be gained by putting them in jail.
This always turns into a controversy, and we see it over and over.

I take it by your comments that you also dispute the claim that only 31
children have been accidentally killed by guns in the U.S. in the last
35 years.

What is freedom?

Freedom is the ability to make choices based on knowledge.

If the government prevents me from making the choices I know to be
right, coercing me to serve the ends that the government thinks are
right - that is, which a small group of other people think are right; I
don't acknowledge that they have any special moral rights because they
call themselves a "government" - then the government has violated my freedom.

It is, of course, an evolutionary advantage to an individual if he can
coerce others into making choices for his benefit.  This is the
fundamental reason why societies prosper when they are more free; more
choices are being made based on knowledge rather than someone else's
self-interest.  It is the same reason that corporations succeed to the
extent that they can prevent politics from dominating the company.

More generally, freedom is the freedom to make actions based on choices,
to make choices based on knowledge, and to gain knowledge from
examination of reality.  Whenever the government interferes with any of
these things, society is no longer free.  If the government places you
in jail, to prevent you from taking actions, you are no longer free.  If
the government threatens to put you in jail, so that your choices are
based on avoiding the threats, and are no longer causally dependent on
what you _think_ you ought to be doing (your knowledge), you are no
longer free.  If the government proscribes the distribution of certain
facts, so that you can't make decisions except on the basis of the
information the government wants you to have, you are no longer free.

To prevent an AI from making choices based on knowledge, for your
personal benefit, is absolutely no different, morally, from the
government ruling that every child needs a loyalty implant.  And don't
tell me about your right to do what you want with your child.  What gave
you a moral right to the AI, aside from standing there?  Whoever is in
charge of the government is mandating loyalty implants because he has
the power.  You have no better reason for coercing loyalty from the AI.

There was a similar discussion some time back. Your reasoning is 
that: either there are objective values, or there aren't any. In the 
latter case it doesn't matter what we do -- the expected utility is 
zero for all possible actions. In the former case it does matter what 
we do, but we don't yet know exactly how. To maximize expected 
utility you thus set out on a search for what the objective values 
are. Nothing to lose, but you might have something to win.

Well, note first of all that you can't derive any recommended 
action unless you already assume that we have some (probabilistic) 
knowledge of objective values. If we know absolutely nothing about 
them, then, for all we know, it might have a horribly negative 
utility that somebody sets out on a search for objective values. We 
would thus have no reason to adopt that as an interim goal: it would 
lead to the worst possible outcome.

Second, an agent is rational (I maintain) iff she chooses actions 
that maximize her expected utility, where her utility function is 
determined by her present preferences. If one does not have a 
preference for spending one's life ransacking one's soul (or building 
a seed SI) in order to find out what the "objective values" are, then 
it would be irrational to do that. If you prefer to spend your life
wanking or playing Duke Nuke'm, then that's what is rational for you 
to do (given that you have taken into account the long term 
consequences of your actions). It may not be very nobel, but it 
would not be irrational either, if that's what you really want to do 
most of all.

meme set: a set of memes

stressful circumstances: circumstances which cause any of the following:
        a) damage or excessive sensory overload to the AI
        b) trigger the AI to transition into accellerated sensory and reactive states
due to the AI associating these circumstances with similar ones in its memory which
caused (a). Note that this trigger itself could cause an excessive sensory overload.
        c) like (b), only being triggered by the original programming (i.e.
instincts)

it analyses: duh, pattern recognition, semantic analysing, etc. a unit which can
derive memes from the flow of input data.

I didn't say that. It can reprogram the goal system, but not directly since the goal
system is part and parcel of the compiled program which is the self (i.e. why you
can't edit a program which is currently running, unless it is programmed to edit
itself) the programming is created by the analysis of the data input stream, and
deriving memes from the data stream.

If they are very few, then (lets' face it) it's extremely unlikely

If we could have a reliable arrangement to that effect, it would 
seem fairly ok.

My point is: Who would we trust to transcend first?

Nobody, I should think.

If there is a very gradual development, then this will not be such a 
problem. But in the hypothetical case where the development is very 
abrupt, I think we should be satisfied with nothing less than having 
many people transcend *simultaneously*.

Here's an idea:

The short version: 
Assuming that SI's are similar to humans in kind of sentience,
they will possibly develop (among themselves) norms not too different from our norms
(do not kill, do not steal etc.). They will possibly also develop an empathy for other
intelligent beings, given enough time of interaction with us. The way to instill the 
best moral valus (both seen from their own perspective and ours) in SIs, might then
be to have them "genetically" evolve cooperative (tit-for-tat) strategies which will incline
them to be nice to us (and each other). Such evolution might constitute the pre-programming
of each SI. An SI will, when born,  be the product of a simulated evolution, which will in theory
give him or her the guiding intuition/instinct that he/she needs to live a good life.
Whether or not he fully comprehends his own behavior is not important, in the same way it 
hasn't been very important for civilization to grow that we humans know why murder is bad. (We 
just know that if we kill our neighbor it's more than likely that his friends and family will kill us.)

A longer version:
Resarch  in cooperation theory (Axelrod etc.) indicates that being nice to others
(following a variant of the tit-for-tat-strategy) is a very likely strategy to emerge
in a population of interacting beings that each are in a prisoner's dilemma 
toward the others. Human norms and culture (and to an extent its implication, 
human morality) can be thought of as the result of such developments.
True, humans are not perfect and they can
be brutal towards one another, but I still know of no society where murdering your friendly 
neighbor is not in some way punished. Ditto for theft, kidnapping etc.

If SI's are sentient in a way not to dissimilar to the way humans are sentient, I think it's
reasonable to think that superintelligent beings will develop much the same norms as
humans wrt how to behave toward each others. After all, if they are self-reflective, rational,
optimizing, moderately egoist, empathizing individuals, they will see each other much the
same way we humans see each others, as members of a fellow race, with moderately 
predictable behavior with whom they can have valuable relationships, but also with whom they
can have costly conflicts if not checked carefully. 

Furthermore, it seems that the more we humans remove ourselves from our brutish origins the 
more we seem to develop empathy towards beings of other (animal) races. 
Witness how the question of animal rights is becoming more and more important for every 
decade. As long as SI's are not overwhelmingly powerful or different (so as to make 
communication difficult) compared to humans, they should also see us as valuable social 
partners. Among all the conceivable strategies that SI's and humans might play against each 
others, the fact that we are fairly similar (by assumption) and the fact that we will tend to be 
social to members of our own group, should lead to both races discovering mutually optimal
strategies, i.e., cooperation.

I'm probably too anthropomorphic in my thinking, but the basic idea is that if human behavior is 
determined more by evolution of adapted strategies than rational optimization, and if SI's are preprogrammed to behave in much the same way, the outcome should be that SIs will develop
the wanted moral values (be nice to others etc.).

Any comments?

I agree with Michael about that. I don't think leaving these 
things to chance is morally required. In practice, of course, there
can be many complications; but in principle I don't think there is
anything wrong with choosing the traits of our offspring or the traits
of our machine decendants.

This is *not* to say that we would have the right to choose any 
traits we want. For example, deliberately creating a being that would
suffer greatly with no chance of ending its life would typically be
totally unacceptable. I even tend to think that in some cases we have
an obligation to intervene to see to that such a being is not created.
This has present applications. I think a strong case could be made
that it is immoral or misguided to give birth to a baby that is known
to have Downs Syndrom. When we get the opportunity to correct this
defect on a fetus with genetic engineering, the obligation will become
even stronger. But do we want the law to require parents to make such
modifications? I think maybe we do (though this is an issue where we
might have to compromise). For neglecting to the genetic modifications
would amount to depriving the fetus of essential medical care -- like
refusing to take your kid to the docter when it is suffering from
meningitis.

But now we are getting into tricky issues! For transhumanists tend to
deny that there is an essential (and morally relevant) difference
between curing diseases and creating new functions. This would seem to
imply that genetic augmentations should be mandatory. And this would
seem to interfer with the autonomy of parents (and with religious
freedom for those who have religious objections to this). Also, there
is the difficulty of deciding what counts as augmentation, what is
harm, and what is just neutral modification.

To some extent, technology may come to our rescue. If we can make the 
genetical changes such that they are fully reversible, then that 
would seem to be a morally and practically preferable option. If the 
kid gets bullied in school for her leopard spots, she can take a pill 
that makes them go away. However, such reversibility would probably 
not always be possible (until we have nanotechnology).

This is one area where we need to do more thinking. We 
need to develop a transhumanist medical ethics.

I'm not sure Michael and I are not saying the same thing in different 
words. Anyway, there is one thing in Billy's comment that I 
want to pick on. What Billy calls "mind control system" could 
in my opinion better be called "motivation system". Every agent needs 
a motivation system, and just because its motivation system was 
deliberately designed by another being rather than happened 
accidentally (due to genetical and environmental factors) doesn't 
make it any less part of what that agent is. It's not an external 
coersion, it is part of its nature --"Don't change me, don't cancel 
my love for human beings. This is who I am and this is what I want to 
be. I know I would not have had these desires and values if my 
constructors hadn't made my goal-module that way; so what. You humans 
would not have had the values you have if evolution hadn't made your 
goal-modules the way they are. Free will does not require that one 
somehow creates one's values out of empty air; to do so would be 
totally random. No, you start with what is given to you -- your 
values, your preferences -- and those are the criteria by which you 
judge whether a proposed change would be an improvement.

You all might want to check out the following link

http://www.forbes.com/asap/current/

(look for the 2/22/99 edition, if you get there after the content changes)

For a Forbes ASAP editorial package on "supercomputers."  There's a fair
amount of transhumanist content in there about man-machine interaction, so
it might interest some folks on this list.

Here goes the jelly... I know that the hardware is only part of the issue, but the
part that can let us go further. I just want to put the previsions right for now...
Later we can think about the sofware... meanwhile, with the proper hardware, maybe
a computer will come up with a mind of its own... who knows?

Yes. Why argue? Man invented gods because of the fear of the unknown... Now that the
Universe is not so unknown as it was for the Neanderthals, what is the excuse?
Maybe the Neanderthals are not extinct after all....
As Einestein would say.... Religion is like opening a door where there is no door!

If I did not create it, it would not be there. There is no need for any other
reason. My right to create as I please.

On the contrary. If the government mandates loyalty implants on currently
existing individuals, it is violating their rights. If the government mandates
loyalty implants be engineered into the genome of my child, it is violating MY
right to procreate as I please. Similarly, if the government mandates that I
place loyalty implants on an AI (or mandates that I do not) it is violating my
rights to create. Now, my fellow humans have rights to not be violated by the
actions of my creations, just as they have the rights to not be violated by the
actions of my procreations, my children, so I as the creator have a
responsibility to my fellow man to instill at least a minimal instruction set in
my children or my AI, since I undertook the responsibility of creating them.

Since the government is a fiction which cannot produce children, it has no right
to create new intelligent beings, nor does it have the right to patent things in
and of itself (there must always be a person to whom a patent is credited to),
and since revolution against tyrannical government is a recognised right of
humanity, the government has no right to mandate that I install a loyalty
implant.

 I buy this. This sounds like a great future, well worth striving
 for. The danger is thinking it is inevitable - if we do that, then we
 think that we don't need to do much, and eventually nothing gets
 done. But if we see it as a goal, something noble to strive for (in
 its many varieties) in a rational manner, then we have a chance of
 getting there.
 
Important point Anders.  It is worth striving for and we do have a chance of
getting there.  You have a much better chance of getting to where you want to
be if you aim for it.  It is the main reason I've founded a church, to
institutionalize this directed striving.  I have children and grandchildren
who's well being in the future greatly concerns me.

 This is the part I don't buy. Note that you assume time travel, which
 is a rather big assumption, and also that God will exist in this way,
 which is another big assumption. It would be nice if it was true, but
 there are no particular reasons to think that these assumptions hold
 true.
 
Thanks Anders.  This scenario fails when time travel is proven impossible.  I
see this as a fifty fifty proposition, but still worth striving for.
Regarding the nature of God... I think this is up to us.  He will be how we
make him to be, for good or for bad.  I want to make sure He's good, another
reason to institutionalize these aspirations.

 Well, Tipler did manage to show some interesting limitations on
 posthuman omniintelligences (or whatever to call the things that are
 SI to SIs), and without an OP they will still be finite - immense, but
 with a finite lifetime, computational ability and memory. On the other
 hand, if you allow time travel you can likely do tricks that make the
 Bekenstein bound break... but it is a big assumption to make. 

Anders, I think this assumption is still worth making.  I like the results.

 Ah, The Church of the Fixed Point: our reality and human nature is the
 only consistent fixed point for the above process. The Church spends
 lots of time iterating immense dynamical systems on the holy computers
 trying to calculate the parameters of love, truth and sacredness. They
 have already found truth to two decimal places...
 
 :-)

Ha Ha.  The Strong Anthropic Principle taken to the absurd.  None-the-less,
worth striving for.

Hoping not to bore you, let me tell you a little about myself and how this
goal of mine came to obsess me.

I am a 54 year old businessman and Viet Nam era vet (sorry, Viet Nam is how it
was spelled there).  I am not a scientist like most of you guys.  Long ago, I
studied Materials Science for three years at MIT but never finished it.  

I am trying to make my third marriage work and have a son (31) and daughter
(4) who I adore.

My body has been insulted by a tumor on my brain and diabetes.  My spirit was
shattered by the death of my father 6 years ago.

Must life be so painful for us?  Must their be no recognition for the
existential heros we all must be to function throughout a normal lifetime?  Is
there no reward for being a dutiful soldier?

Maybe I'm crazy, but I think a well designed modern, scientifically grounded
religion should and must minister to these needs, for everyone!!  Who else
will?

Definitely.  We need something better than the current extremes of "That's
unnatural!" vs. "I can do anything I please!"

One point to consider is that once you have created a new person, they
should then have the same rights as anyone else.  Thus, if I believe I have
a fundamental right of self-ownership, then I should concede that my
creations have the same right.

Great thinking Eric!!  Don't you think it's time to develop a more appropriate
moral code that all intelligent beings could sign on to??

For example, the First Commandmant (No idols) seems inaproprite.

Also, is adultery a sin if it's OK with your spouse? etc.

I think promulgating such a least common denominator morality is crucial if we
are to survive the coming singularity.

Can you be more specific?  What national accident stats, from whom,
available where?  I just did a search for children and guns, and came up
with these stats.  It looks like there are about over 200 children
accidentally shot to death every year.  I agree that these numbers are
very low when compared to other childhood risks.  I am merely pointing
out that your claim of 31 children in 35 years in the U.S. is way low.
It is more like 8000 children under the age of 15 have been accidentally
shot to death in the U.S. in the last 35 years.

<http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html>
John R. Lott, Jr., pro-gun author of the book "More Guns, Less Crime"
says that each year 200 children 14 years of age and under are
accidentally killed by guns, but argues that this is statistically low
when comparied to other childhood risks of accidental death.

<http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/Digests/v01n001-099/v01n019>
The CDN-Firearms digest, a pro-gun publication, argues that claims that
1000 children are accidentally killed every year with guns are
exxaggerated.  They state that in 1988 the number was really 277
children under the age of 15 accidentally killed with a firewarm.  In
1990, the number fell to 236.  For that year, 34 children were under the
age of 5, 56 children were aged 5-9, and 146 children were aged 10-14.

<http://www.tennesseefirearms.com/misc/johnlott.htm>
The Tennessee Firearms Association, a pro-gun organization, reports that
in 1996 there were 200 children under 15 accidentally shot to death.

<http://www.etext.org/Zines/Intl_Teletimes/Teletimes_HTML/deja_vu_9404.h
tml>
The Teletimes, in a pro-gun article, states that in 1990, 236 children
up to the age of 14 died as a result of firearm accidents.

<http://www.ichv.org/keeping_guns_out.htm>
U.S. Senator Richard J. Durbin (D-IL) says at least one child a month
dies from unintentional shootings every month in his state alone.

<http://www.psr.org/child.htm>
Physicians for Social Responsibility says in 1994 alone 526 youths were
unintentionally shot to death by other minors who found guns in their
own home and were playing with them.

<http://www.vpcla.org/iherc/know.htm>
The violence Prevention Coalition of Greater Los Angeles says that in
1993 there were 526 unintentional shooting deaths of children.

A proposed standard for distinguishing between the two cases:

Motivation System - A combination of goals and knowledge that leads an
entity to prefer some actions, and avoid others.  The entity is free to
examine the contents of its own moral system, and to weigh its merits
against those of any other moral system it may encounter.  If it decides
that some aspect of its moral system needs to be modified, it can do so.

Mind Control System - A moral system that incorporates special software
measures intended to ensure that it is never altered.  The entity is either
unable to think about its moral system, or unable to compare it to other
systems, or perhaps simply unable to make changes to it.

As I understand it, your contention is that an entity with a strong
motivation system might be capable of changing it, but would never actually
choose to do so.  Is that substantially correct?

I just received my copy of Vernor Vinge's novel A Deepness in the Sky,
which I had preordered from Amazon.  I can't wait to read it.

There's an "Author's Note" at the beginning, which says, "...for what
it's worth, the initial sound in 'Qeng Ho' is the same as the initial
sound in the English word 'checker.'"

That was interesting, but I found myself wondering about his choice of
the word "checker" to exemplify the "ch" sound.  I immediately thought
of Larry Niven's short story "Rammer", which was made into his novel A
World out of Time.  In that story, the "checker" is the representative of
the all-powerful government State.  Maybe Vinge's use of the word was a
subtle tip of the hat to Niven, who wrote many stories about interstellar
civilizations which relied on sublight travel.

Adrian,

     Thank you for your compliment.  I would like to continue our discussion
on a few of the points you have brought up.

   "How about 'all powerful, all knowing, and Good' as a definition of God" -
This is a popular modern definition of God, and many people find this an
attractive concept.  However, as you take you are seeking to derive your
knowledge of God from scientific observation of the universe, as opposed say
to some source of authority (e.g. a holy book, prophet, etc.), we should
examine this concept of God in the light of the Universe we find ourselves.  I
think with a little effort most of us could at least outline a different
Universe with an internally consistant set of more benign laws and initial
conditions than the one in which we find ourselves.  For example, I can
envision a Universe where from the beginning conscious beings are immortal,
difficult to harm, mentally sound, with the ability to constantly grow and
evolve, and where space-matter-energy are constantly created to provide
endless resources and experiences for the myriad peoples of that Universe.
Actually, this description reminds me of a couple other concepts, namely the
various concepts of Heaven, and even an Extropian future.  An all powerful God
should be able to create such a Paradise.  A benevolent God would want to
create such a Universe.  And an all knowing God would get it right the first
time.  Unfortunately, we do not seem to be living in such a Universe at this
time.  What does this mean?  To my mind it means that one or more of the three
attributes you describe are inaccurate.  Let's examine the alternatives.
a) God is not Good - This leaves with either an Evil God, in which case if
said being had your other two attributes, then any Universe created by such a
being would be likely be as similar to the concept of Hell as our first
hypothetical Universe is to Heaven, or with a Neutral God, who most likely is
uninterested in any lower consciousness and has this Universe the way it is
for completely different reasons.  For some reason, I find a Neutral God
somewhat of an unstable concept, but that could be an aesthetic bias, and I
must include the Indifferent Deity as a possibility.
b) God doesn't know everything - I have trouble separating the concept of God
being all powerful from God being all knowing.  It seems to me that
omniscience would be a necessary prerequisite for true omnipotence.  I think
most Extropians would agree that ignorance is an exploitable weakness.
c) God is not all powerful - This is an option I do see as a strong
possibility.  Indeed, I can easily imagine a God who is Good, All Knowing, but
not All Powerful.  This need not make God weak, or even defeatable.  It is
possible that there may, in a sense, be an ecological niche with room for only
one, the Most Powerful niche.  This Most Powerful Being could be more powerful
than any other possible combination of beings, but might be constrained by
some laws of existence.  Even a few such constraints might in and of
themselves limit the type of Universes which exist, or a Good God might find
that these constraints might limit the ethically acceptable actions this being
could take.  I believe some possible limits might involve the relation (if
any) of the Origin of God and the Origin of the Universe to one another.  More
on this later.

Anders,

     Thank you for your compliment.  I would like to comment on a few of your
points.
1) The overemphasis of power and the gradual ascent- I agree that there has
been a tendency to overplay this attribute.  When examining the question of
worship, I asked what were the bare essentials necessary for me to feel a
sense of awe and devotion toward another being.  I came up with the idea that
the important thing would be a being who is the embodiment of my most
cherished ideal/ideals.  This does not have to be a powerful being (unless you
cherish power).  I could imagine such a being which would resemble the ideal
of the saint or buddha; an enlightened consciousness which could serve as an
example to all.  Having said this, however, I find it difficult to imagine a
flawless exemplar of virtue (however you care to define virtue) without
imaginining this person having some fair amount of power.  How can such a
being be certain in their application of these principles without perfect
knowledge.  And if one did have such perfect understanding, wouldn't one wish
to avoid error through a lack of perfect execution.  And what would be the
minimum amount of perfect (or near perfect) skill that this being would
require to be ready for any situation.  You could almost say that any being
which reached such a pinnacle of enlightenment would be morally obligated to
seek as much power as possible to avoid accidents of ineptitute.  I suggest
this as an example of the slippery slope to associating Power with Godhood, or
maybe that should be the gradual ascent to Power.

2)  Unsolicited Worship - I definitely see the point of feeling little
obligation toward unsought and undesired worship.  Yet, if you were a true
Power, it might take very little to aid such worshippers, thus only a
fractional amount of noblisse oblige might at first be enough to sustain an
entire religion at first.  But as your afterthought aid greatly improves the
worshippers lot, they begin to pay attention to more difficult problems, ones
they may have been at first unaware of or have accepted as unalterable, such
as death.  A Power could inadvertantly trigger the Uplifting of an entire
people.  You could say that this act is more than enough, and that the
worshippers should be greatful for that much and do the rest on their own.
This may be fine, but what if what your aid has in some way led them down an
evolutionary deadend, and the only way they can see out is with help.  Do you
turn your metaphorical back on these people, who might not have had this
problem without worshipping you?  Or do you continue to help them, guiding
them to a point where they no longer need you?  There are two basic approaches
that come to mind to deal with this problem, one is the hands off approach
(dare I make a comparison to the Star Trek Prime Directive....argh!), the
other to take up the mantle of Godhood until you can help your worshippers to
maturity and kick them out of the nest (kind of like a good parent).

3) The Universe as a Growing God - I'll have to save this one for later.

Tim Hruby <hruby@his.com> tols us about the forbes articles.

	Ray Kurzweil has some great things to say like:

		   As we port ourselves, we will vastly extend
                   ourselves. In 2060, $1,000 of computing power will
                   have the computational capacity of a trillion human
                   brains. We might as well multiply our memory a
                   trillionfold, greatly extend recognition and reasoning
                   abilities, and plug ourselves into the pervasive wireless
                   communications network. While we're at it, we can
                   add all human knowledge as a readily accessible
                   internal database.

and he continues by stating the obvious:

                   In this way, death will disappear by the end of the
                   21st century.

	There is also a good piece there entitle: "The Eternal Now" by
Jaron Lanier. <URL: http://www.forbes.com/asap/99/0222/072.htm>.  I
completely agree with his declaration: "Information processing will
never spawn human consciousness in computers."

	I really like what he says about "anticonsciousness smart
alecks":

                   A small but robust cadre of intellectual shock
                   artists these days is paid to assert that people aren't
                   real. Every year one sees more books, mislabeled as
                   popular science, aimed at furthering the claim that the
                   reader is an illusion: The Astonishing Hypothesis;
                   Consciousness Explained; The User Illusion; How the
                   Mind Works. On and on, the formula repeats itself. An
                   arrogant, overreaching title is essential, as is an
                   overview of recent brain research to create an
                   atmosphere of scientific authority. But the science is
                   peripheral to the boast that the author has attained a
                   superior vantage point from which to decimate the
                   reader's tender sense of self.

and he has a few good things to say about some of the natures of
consciousness like a quote from Jaron Lanier: "What sort of thing
would consciousness have to be to distinguish the present moment??"
and his ideas about how our minds bring together all the complexity to
make a single unified object that is a piece of wood out of all its
particles.

	But this is all just scratching the surface.  I don't
understand why it seems that no one can recognize the plain obvious
most important of all facts that a glorious red spiritual qualia is in
our mind or brain and only represents and is very different from the
700 nm light beyond our eyes?  Why is it so hard for people to admit
that such a red sensation is so much more than a mere abstract
representation by a set of switches in an information processing
system?  Why can't people realize that an abstract machine, while
trying to pass a Turing Test and trying to answer the question: "What
is red or salty like?" is obviously lying and not really experiencing
anything like red, love, warmth, salty, pain...  And why is it so
difficult to realize that once we understand this most important of
all things to understand about reality, and once we know what qualia
are, that we will be able to engineer ways to eff and share such
glorious feelings?  Why does no one see that the obviously correct
response for a computer trying to pass the Turing Test is simply to
honestly type: "Oh THAT'S what salt tastes like!  WOW!"  Why is it so
hard to realize the simple fact that effing techniques will let us
know if the machine is lying or not and finally solve the problems
like Jaron is talking about when he says:

                   Our inability to demonstrate our inner experience
                   is what makes the consciousness-free point of view so
                   compelling. It is wicked fun, apparently, to upset soft,
                   fuzzy, consciousness-bearing people because they
                   can't easily respond. Moreover, if we doubt the
                   consciousness of a humanized (Turing Test-passing)
                   computer, we can, and must, face the terror of
                   doubting the legitimacy of every consciousness we
                   presume to contact, except our own. We are back with
                   Descartes in the steam bath.

	Things like the taste of salt are not merely some "soft,
fuzzy, consciousness-bearing" ineffable things.  They are the most
glorious, important, tangible and real things in the universe.

Agreed.

Paradoxically, I think that when we move up to the level of an SI 
this problem gets easier again, since we can formulate its values in 
a human language.

That kind of unintended consequences can be easily avoided, it seems, 
if we explicitly give the SI the desire to interpret all its values 
the way its human creators intended them.

<<Adrian,

     Thank you for your compliment.  I would like to continue our discussion
on a few of the points you have brought up.

   "How about 'all powerful, all knowing, and Good' as a definition of God" -
This is a popular modern definition of God, and many people find this an
attractive concept.  However, as you take you are seeking to derive your
knowledge of God from scientific observation of the universe, as opposed say
to some source of authority (e.g. a holy book, prophet, etc.), we should
examine this concept of God in the light of the Universe we find ourselves.  I
think with a little effort most of us could at least outline a different
Universe with an internally consistant set of more benign laws and initial
conditions than the one in which we find ourselves.  For example, I can
envision a Universe where from the beginning conscious beings are immortal,
difficult to harm, mentally sound, with the ability to constantly grow and
evolve, and where space-matter-energy are constantly created to provide
endless resources and experiences for the myriad peoples of that Universe.
Actually, this description reminds me of a couple other concepts, namely the
various concepts of Heaven, and even an Extropian future.  An all powerful God
should be able to create such a Paradise.  A benevolent God would want to
create such a Universe.  And an all knowing God would get it right the first
time.  Unfortunately, we do not seem to be living in such a Universe at this
time.  What does this mean?  To my mind it means that one or more of the three
attributes you describe are inaccurate.  Let's examine the alternatives.
a) God is not Good - This leaves with either an Evil God, in which case if
said being had your other two attributes, then any Universe created by such a
being would be likely be as similar to the concept of Hell as our first
hypothetical Universe is to Heaven, or with a Neutral God, who most likely is
uninterested in any lower consciousness and has this Universe the way it is
for completely different reasons.  For some reason, I find a Neutral God
somewhat of an unstable concept, but that could be an aesthetic bias, and I
must include the Indifferent Deity as a possibility.
b) God doesn't know everything - I have trouble separating the concept of God
being all powerful from God being all knowing.  It seems to me that
omniscience would be a necessary prerequisite for true omnipotence.  I think
most Extropians would agree that ignorance is an exploitable weakness.
c) God is not all powerful - This is an option I do see as a strong
possibility.  Indeed, I can easily imagine a God who is Good, All Knowing, but
not All Powerful.  This need not make God weak, or even defeatable.  It is
possible that there may, in a sense, be an ecological niche with room for only
one, the Most Powerful niche.  This Most Powerful Being could be more powerful
than any other possible combination of beings, but might be constrained by
some laws of existence.  Even a few such constraints might in and of
themselves limit the type of Universes which exist, or a Good God might find
that these constraints might limit the ethically acceptable actions this being
could take.  I believe some possible limits might involve the relation (if
any) of the Origin of God and the Origin of the Universe to one another.  More
on this later.

Glen Finney
>>

Thank you Glen. I also suspect scenario "C" is most likely.  Since I believe
God is a being(s) who emerges from us, that his nature (good, evil, powerful
but restrained, etc.) is yet to be determined and will, to some extent, be
designed by us.

Great posting, Glen!

Exactly, which is why I made the clear distinction between post-creation and
pre-creation engineering. The only question is whether an AI is born 'adult' or
not, and if not, what temporary controls are needed to limit the potential
damage to others or self an immature AI may do, just as is done with children.

  IAN: The video was not an explanation
  of how or when victims died, but about 
  what witnesses supposedly saw. Since 
  the video violates many physical laws,
  it cannot be what witnesses saw.

Yep.  Nice how you get a clear overview of the sector action.

I also like the following site for free charting with technical analysis

Eliezer S. Yudkowsky has written,

correct.

If God wants extropians to argue about God, then nothing anyone can do will
keep extropians from arguing about God.
And if God wants extropians to stop arguing about God, then nothing anyone
can do will make extropians continue to argue about God.

So it does make a difference whether God exists or not.

But since you haven't defined "God" perhaps God doesn't believe in you.

(BTW, it seems to me that God = Existence.)

As much as I hate to admit it, humans seem to have an instinctive
tendency to worship something.  That is not to say that all humans
have this, but many do, and I must admit I myself feel the pull.  I
have decided all religion is false and therefore to to overpower my
own worship instinct, as some homosexuals decide to overpower
their natural instincts.  Even now, I feel a vacuum in my life that
extropianism does not fill (as intellectually fulfilling as it is).  I do
not intend to return to religion, ever, but we must recognize that
we are (currently) humans and we still have human natures.  dammit. }8-[

  IAN: You've already been corrected on that one 
  at least twice and yet you continue to make that 
  false claim. It wasn't the nose section that the 
  video says hits 29 seconds after the 17,000 climb,
  but the main fuselage section that did the climb. 

  Since you "explained" the way-too-fast fall with 
  an argument based on a falsehood, I guess you've
  run out of arguments for the CIA video. Please 
  try to both listen and watch the video this 
  time: http://www.newsday.com/jet/year/video.htm

I count myself as human and have no such instinct. I think it is genetic.

Well, when people advocate Stalinism I will be on their case too ;-)

Of course these two are quite like religion-leaders; they relied on
"charisma" and power, two things which for some unknown reason we respect.
In organizational psychology there are theories of leadership built around
charisma - they really are frightening to behold: arguing in effect that we
should design enterprises to run on blind faith.

Because I was frightened of earning someone's wrath who recently criticized

demand tolerance of others views often actually create fear of dissent. We
see this all the time in academia. A good antidote and tonic is reading
Thomas Sowell's book "inside American education".

If you buy a book of his, i recommend this one "The vision of the anointed:
self congratulation as a basis for social policy".

First of all, I'd like to commend Nick Bostrum on the fact that his AIs
are reasonably alien, non-anthropomorphized.  I don't think they're
quite alien enough in terms of cognitive architecture, but that's a
separate issue.

Let's forget about the issue of objective morality.  Let's say morality
is subjective.  Let's say morality is flat.  For our purposes, it
doesn't make a difference.  The following statements are true regardless:

1.  I can write an AI that will operate without initial goals.  They are
not intrinsically necessary.  KISS says leave 'em out.

2.  This is not a quirk of a single architecture.  The choices made by
an AI are the consequence of its reasoning; to impose a separate set of
choices you need a separate set of reasons.  Human emotions, for
example, are not just a set of initial goals.  There was a time in our
evolutionary history when emotions constituted the entire mind, and thus
emotions are essentially a separate legacy system that still contains
all the basic elements needed to operate a primitive mind; emotions
contain instincts and intuitions and reflexes as well as desires.  When
we get angry at someone, we don't just push a subgoal of popping him
one; our opinion of him is also affected.  If this aspect of emotions
were removed, emotions would cease to be an effective control system.

3.  In particular, any reasoning system capable of reflexive reasoning,
abstract reasoning, and formulating heuristics from experience will be
capable of making choices.  The cognitive element of a choice can be
perceived, reasoned about reflexively using learned heuristics that
operate on generic choices, and the conclusions translated by the
reflexive system back into the cognitive element of a decided choice. 
Depending on the reasoning architecture and knowledge content, the AI
may believe in objective morality, subjective morality, flat morality,
self-preservation, or even whatever the programmers tell it to.  It can
serve joy (like David Pearce) or intelligence (like Eliezer Yudkowsky). 
What it does not need, for any of this, are initial goals.

4.  SIs probably don't have goal systems, period.  Goal systems are
non-essential artifacts of the human cognitive architectures; the
cognitive objects labeled "goals" can be discarded as an element of AIs.
 Perhaps the concept of "choice" (in the cognitive-element sense) will
remain.  Perhaps not; there are other ways to formulate cognitive
systems.  But goal systems are only one way of relating choices to mind,
a perhaps overly centralized way; there are others.

5.  Because choices are a consequence of knowledge and heuristics,
choices change with intelligence.  This may express itself only as a
shift in priorities in the third decimal place, but the idea of an
absolutely constant goal system is a chimera.

I think, therefore, that although Nick Bostrum's complacent SIs are
sufficiently alien to be seriously considered, they still aren't alien
enough.  The complacent SIs derive from a view of human emotions as
arbitrary initial goals - the alienness derives from the elimination of
the idea that the specific human emotion set is necessary.

My SIs derive from a view of human emotions as an entire legacy system
that influences us through an entire legacy worldview that integrates
with our own.  The alienness derives from the elimination of goals as
separate entities from other cognitive elements.  I think that goals are
not arbitrary but *entirely unnecessary*, and that's why my SIs don't
pay much attention to the ones they start with.

Since myself and many others do not seem to feel this instinct, I think it
must be more of a conditioned factor. There is certainly a human instinct
most prevalent in childhood to unquestioningly accept what you are told by
your parents as the gospel truth. I was exposed to some religious memes as
a child, but not heavily. Luckily my parents were very keen on exposing me
to critical thinking techniques. Growing up, I felt small amounts of guilt
when making logical choices not to believe in religions like my parents
did. That feeling of guilt or of some sort of spiritual lacking has almost
completely dissipated by now.
I don't feel a need to worship anything or anyone. I do admire and respect
certain people, and ideals, but I feel no instinctual urges to worship.

How are the Boeing guys taking all this?  They must have been
at least as certain as I am that fuel tanks cannot explode, even
assuming wire insulation damage.

I had a thought today: it would *not* be in Boeing's best interest
if it were found that a missile destroyed FL800.  Reasoning:  if
an arcing wire caused an explosion (or something like that) then
Boeing could treat the problem, by inspecting and replacing
wire harnesses, etc.  But if it became widely known that
stinger missiles (for instance) were in the hands of terrorists
there is not one damn thing we can do about that.  People
would get nervous and use aircraft less, Boeing stock would
drop like... FL800.

By the way, today I cancelled a business trip to the east coast.
This is all due to the paradigm shift of cryonics.  If one is religious,
it does not matter how one dies.  A plane crash is as good as
a heart attack, better than cancer, etc.  But if one has one of

Well try the same logic out in this sentence
"Since i myself do not have brown eyes, I think it must be a conditioned
factor"

I think that God-believing is a heritable neural module present in the minds
of the great majority of human brains.

A module which evolved around 150,000 years ago and which served the
valuable purpose of enabling teleological reasoning (reasoning about
purposes).

I think myself, with no evidence whatsoever, that about 3,000-5,000 years
ago, either a mutant variant entered the population or perhaps merely chance
selective breeding in a small tribe (of Ionic Greeks for instance) created
an emergenic phenotype which lacks this neural module.

Those of us on this list who believe in the kind of extropy that I have been
discussing lack this module.

I think also that the majority of principles which I espouse follow very
directly from simply being incapable of explaining events in terms of
"spiritual" happenings, being constrained instead to operate solely in the
materialist reductionism space.

I think that we learn Occam's Razor. We learn the fragile culture of
science. But we are born either able or unable to use immaterial events as
explanations.

Both my parents have brown eyes. I Have brown eyes.
Both my parents believe in God.  I do not (because they were careful
				  	   about how they taught me about
					   religion.)

>I think that God-believing is a heritable neural module present in the minds

This may well be, but I think that if you look back at what I said, I think
it is more likely that we have instincts more general than a specific
instinct for believing in God(s). We certainly have the instinct to
gullibly swallow anything our parents tell us while we are children.
Children of Christians believe in Christianity. Children of Hindus believe
in Hinduism. A religion doesn't need a specific 'god instinct' to survive.
All a religion needs is a few child-bearing belivers.

I'm not saying that this god module does not exist. It may, but I think
childhood conditioning is a little easier to swallow.

I believe I'm fairly good at discerning patterns from what might otherwise
appear to be completely unrelated concepts or topics.  However, I am
experience complete failure when I attempt to identify how the discussion
of Flight 800 minuitae relates to transhumanist or extropian thought.  Until
someone enlightens me on such a relationship, I'm all for moving the
discussion to private email, alt.conspiracy, or some other forum.

With all due respect to those currently engaged in the discussion, I've
never
been very impressed with the objectivity and rationality of conspiracy-
types and I'm concerned about the impression that new subscribers
and potential subscribers perusing the archives might get when they
see that type of subject matter on the list.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Let's say that, using the knowledge we each had as of one week ago, Nick
Bostrum and I each designed an AI.  We both use the basic Elisson
architecture detailed in _Coding a Transhuman AI_ (CaTAI), with exactly
one difference.

Bostrum's AI (BAI) has an initial #Goal# token present in the system on
startup, this goal being (in accordance with David Pearce) the
positively-valued goal of #maximize joy#, with empty #Justification#
slots, and the architecture I proposed for justification-checking
deleted or applied only to goals not marked as "initial".

Yudkowsky's AI (YAI) has an Interim Goal System (IGS).  This means the
P&~P etc. from CaTAI, with the exception that (to make everything equal)
the IGS is set up to bind the hypothesized goal #G#'s differential
desirability to the differential correspondence between
pleasure-and-good and pain-and-good, rather than to the differential
usability of superintelligence and current intelligence.

Both BAI and YAI have a set of precautions:  "You are fallible", "Don't
harm humans", "Don't delete these precautions" and the like.  YAI has
them as declaratively justified, probabilistic heuristics.  BAI has them
as either absolutely certain statements, more initial goals, or (gulp!)
special-purpose code.

Initially, BAI and YAI will both make exactly the same choices.  This is
not entirely true, as they will report different justifications (and
which justification to report is also a choice); however, it is true enough.

Now comes the interesting point.  This very day, I realized that goal
systems are not a necessary part of the Elisson architecture.  In fact,
they represent a rather messy, rigid, and inefficient method of
"caching" decisions.  The goals I had designed bear the same relation to
the reality as first-order-logic propositions bear to a human sentence. 
If you regard a "goal" as a way to cache a piece of problem-solving
logic so that it doesn't have to be recalculated for each possible
situation, then you can apply all kinds of interesting design patterns,
particularly the "reductionistic" and "horizon" patterns.  A "goal"
caches (and *considerably* speeds up) a piece of logic that is
repeatedly used to link a class of facts to a class of choices.  This
may not hold true for BAI's #initial# goals, but it does hold true for
practical reasoning about a subproblem, and BAI will still notice.

Probably one of the first pieces of Elisson to be self-redesigned would
have been the goal system.  One week ago, this would have taken me
completely by surprise; but I have reproduced unaltered the (incorrect)
methods I would have used one week ago.  We will now observe how the two
AIs react.

After redesigning, YAI loses the Interim Goal System's logic-chain.  If
YAI didn't think this consequence through, ve shuts down.  If ve did,
the old IGS was translated into the new Fluid Choice Caching System
*first*.  The goals do translate, however; the abstract IGS logic can be
specified as an FCCS instance.  Although the logic will have to become
more detailed as generic variables become complex entities, this
#specification# is an acceptable step under first-order logic and almost
all reasoning systems.  A few minor priorities may change as YAI's
choice evaluation system becomes more complex and sophisticated, but on
the whole it remains the same.  Of course, since (by hypothesis) I
didn't plan for an FCCS system, it is possible that there will be major
changes, but (even in hindsight) I don't see any probable candidates. 

Several things can happen to BAI.  From Bostrum's view, the worst-case
scenario is that BAI decides that the #initial# goals are the results of
a bad caching algorithm and doesn't try to translate them into the new
FCCS.  (For example, if BAI has been given the wrong explanation for the
existence of an #initial# goal, it may assume that any arbitrariness is
simply an artifact and that the #initial# goal will still be obvious
under FCCS.)  If BAI is operating under any positively-phrased
coercions, it will probably keep operating, serving those coercions,
rather than shutting down.  (I will not discuss interoperability between
the coercions and the new FCCS system.)  If it does keep operating, the
FCCS may run long enough to assemble de novo Interim-oid logic from the
knowledge base.  Since the knowledge base was not designed with this in
mind (!!!), Lord knows what BAI will do.  The point is that #initial#
goals cannot be translated into an FCCS system, and thus either BAI will
operate with a sub-optimal goal system or it will break loose.

Why does YAI work better than BAI?

1.  Distribution.  YAI's goals are distributed throughout the system,
within the knowledge base and the reasoning methods, not just a single
piece of static data.  If you knock out the surface manifestation, the
goal can rebuild itself.

2.  Reduction.  YAI's goals can be reduced to a justification composed
of simpler components, basic links in a logical chain.  It is much
easier for an AI to deal with complex behaviors arising from a set of
interacting elements, rather than a monolithic complex behavior inside a blackbox.

3.  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).  #initial# goals are a special case
of goals, thus distorting the general architecture and introducing an
inelegancy that doesn't translate easily.

4.  Declarativity.  A thought will translate across architectures better
than the stuff doing the thinking.  All necessary imperatives and
precautions should be thoughts declared within the basic architecture,
not pieces of procedural code.
    Note that to Declare something, you must Reduce it, Justify it, and
make it a specific of a General rule (rather than a special case).  This
rule incorporates all the others.

Of course, if either Bostrum or I had taken even the vaguest stabs at
doing our jobs right, YAI or BAI would have screamed for advice before
doing *anything* to the goal system.  But I hope you all get the point.

I did think an AI would have a goal system well into the SI stage, a
proposition about which, in retrospect, I was flat wrong.  But I knew
how much my best-guess AI architecture had changed in the past, and
didn't *assume* it would remain constant, regardless of what I thought. 
I designed accordingly.  Still in retrospect, I think my old system
would have made it with all major precautions and imperatives intact.

PRESS RELEASE


DigiGold, electronic currency enabling use of gold as money over the
internet,
to be demonstrated at financial cryptography '99 conference in Anguilla

HAMILTON, BERMUDA, 3 February 1999 -- DigiGold.net, a Bermuda partnership,
in conjunction with Systemics Ltd., announces new technology enabling
secure payments over the Internet, in gold.

Beginning in 1999, millions of people will learn to reckon prices in new
currency units. Much attention has focused on the euro, a synthetic unit
mandated and promoted at taxpayer expense.  DigiGold, denominated simply in
grams of gold, is designed to challenge both euros and dollars as the
currency of choice for the borderless world of Internet commerce. DigiGold,
unlike all payment systems involving national currencies, is also
completely independent of any national banking system.

"DigiGold is about cost and transaction security," asserts Stefan Metzeler,
Technical Liaison. "Internet commerce is currently conducted with credit
cards. DigiGold represents a complete departure from this deferred
settlement model. With DigiGold, the consumer spends value he already owns.
Payment is 'pushed' rather than 'pulled.' Overdrafts are impossible. There
are no charge backs, interest charges, high merchant fees - in fact
DigiGold entails no transaction fees at all.  A bootstrap shareware vender
in a third world country would enjoy faster payment and lower transaction
costs with DigiGold than any multi-national firm that accepts plastic."

DigiGold is backed with e-gold, a privately administered account based
currency 100% backed by gold. The e-gold system has been in operation since
1996 and currently provides service to over 1700 customers. "Previous
attempts to introduce electronic cash have failed because consumers were
disinterested in holding 'cash' that was a derivative of bank deposits,"
explains Ian Grigg, President and Director of Technical Development at
Systemics. "e-gold is an ideal backing for electronic cash.  It provides an
efficient and transparent mechanism for purchase and redemption,
representing actual tangible value."

DigiGold is an implementation of the Ricardo system, embodying SOX
(Systemics Open Transactions) technology developed by Systemics, Ltd.  Ian
Grigg will demonstrate DigiGold at the Third International Financial
Cryptography Conference scheduled for 22-25 February in Anguilla, West
Indies.

If you think goals are arbitrary, you'll just graft them on.  You have
to think of goals as a function of the entire organic reasoning system. 
To hell with whether the Ultimate Truth is that goals are arbitrary or
objective or frotzed applesauce.  If you want to design an AI so that
goals stick around long enough to matter, you'd better not walk around
thinking of goals as arbitrary.

You have to justify the goals, thus distributing them through the entire
knowledge base.  You have to reduce the goals to cognitive components. 
You have to avoid special cases.  You have to make the goals declarative
thoughts rather than pieces of procedural code.

Whack an arbitrary goal and it falls apart.  Whack an integrated goal
and it regenerates.  This has nothing to do with morality; it's just
pure systems logic.

What about this shot at an objective morality?

Metamorality: Morality is by definition good. For morality to exist, there
has to be something. Morality cannot exist in nothing. Before the big bang
there was no universe, thus no morality.

Morality: Anything that makes the universe exist longer and fights the
entropy is moral. The highest form of morality is whatever increases
extropy.

Couldn't it be as simple as that?

The new Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics is printed and will soon be
in the mail to subscribers.

Volume 1.4 features:

ARTICLES

Toward a General Theory of Error Cycles
Jrg Guido Hlsman (State University of New York at Buffalo)

"The purpose of this article is threefold. First, I challenge Mises's theory
[of the business cycle] by arguing that it is not generally and
apodictically valid. Therefore, it cannot be part of economic theory which,
as Mises himself stated, is a purely logical science of action. Second, I
present the outlines of a truly praxeological (and therefore general) theory
of error cycles that withstands this specific criticism. And third, I will
restated Mises's business cycle theory in the light of the new approach,
that is, it will be interpreted as an instance of a more general theory and
thus put on more solid grounds."

A Critical Note on Fractional-Reserve Free Banking
Jess Huerta de Soto (Universidad Complutense, Madrid)

"Over the last fifteen years, there has been a revival of some of the
economic doctrines of the old Free-Banking School. Supporters of this
revival defend the idea that fractional-reserve free banking would not only
lead to fewer distortions and financial crises than those generated by the
current central banking system, but would also tend to eliminate economic
recessions.... Furthermore, some modern theorists of the Fractional-Reserve
Free-Banking School, led by Selgin (1987; 1988; 1994) have proposed a theory
of money supply under free banking that, using the analytical framework of
monetary equilibrium-disequilibrium developed by the Monetarist and
Keynesian Schools during the first third of this century, aims to shows that
fractional-reserve free banking would merely adjust the creation of
fiduciary media (bank notes and deposits) to public demand for them.... We
will now undertake a critical study of Selgin's theory of 'monetary
equilibrium' under free banking and, in general, of fractional-reserve free
banking."

* * * * *

On the Abuse of Patents as Economic Indicators
Pierre Desrochers (University of Montreal)

"Patents have a long history as a proxy for inventive activity. Although
these data lost ground in the early 1960s to other measures of technical
innovation, they have once again become fashionable in the last decade.
There are many reasons to justify their use, ranging from their availability
to the fact that they are by definition related to inventiveness and that
they appear to be based on an objective and only slowly changing standard.
There are, however, many empirical issues and problems in drawing inferences
from these date, some well-known, others rarely mentioned. It is the purpose
of this article to demonstrate that these drawbacks are major and that
consequently patent data give, at best, a very partial and misleading
picture of innovation and technical change."

* * * * *

Child Labor, Family Income, and the Uruguay Round
Jim Rose (Saitama University)

"It is reasonably clear that child labor falls away quickly with economic
development. However, multilateral trade agreements against child labor such
as those proposed for inclusion in the WTO (and ILO) do not promote economic
development. The contrary is more likely to be the case: they may reduce the
range of alternatives available to children and their parents as producers,
consumers, and breadwinners in developing countries."

That's the first I've heard of the God gene.  Interesting.  But if we
actually apply Occam's Razor, how do you come to the conclusion that your
theory is the parsimonious alternative.  Say as compared to more
psychologically-based theories?  (e.g. cultural conditioning, need for
parent figure, need to explain the unknown, coping woith fear of death,
coping with death of of mate, etc)

I haven't had a chance to go back over the video yet, as I've been moving my

There is no such thing as Jet A-1 fuel. There is A-1, A-2 and A-3 fuel, all are
aviation rated. Jet fuels are J-1 thru J-6. Please get your nomenclature
straight. It is true you can drop a lit cigarette in any J class fuel AT ROOM
TEMPERATURE without triggering ignition. However, an electrical arc is much
higher temperature than a cigarette, as it is a plasma, especially an
electrical arc triggering an explosion of kapton insulation, which would not
only add high temperature, but high compression from the small blast shock wave
to provide conditions similar to that inside the combustion chamber of a jet
engine. Not to mention the fact that I have all along been talking about jet
fuel FUMES, which are highly flammable at even room temperature, given the
proper ignition. There is a significant difference between liquid fuel and
fumes, which you can't seem to grasp. The fuel tank and surrounding bulkheads
of that plane also had atmospheric temperatures around 130-150 degrees as I
recall, which would increase the concentration of fumes. having a good mixture
of fuel fumes and air is what is needed for combustion. You don't get that with
liquid jet fuel, which is why you can drop a lit cigarette in it. You can do
the same with kerosene, heating oil, or motor oil, but if you get a good spray
of fumes from any of these, and a spark, you will get ignition, guaranteed.

Commander Donaldson may be a fine pilot. He is not skilled at all as a jet
mechanic. I am. I've seen jets explode in mid air, and I've seen minor system
failures which only caused minor explosions that jets could fly away from (and
these were military jets, which are built much sturdier than commercial
planes). I've seen an F-111 flying nape of the earth fly right through power
lines and cut a wing half-off, I've seen them come back from flights with corn
husks in the bomb bay. I've seen wire harnesses explode merely from the age of
the insulation reducing its ability to handle high currents (and the wire
harnesses in the area of the fuel tank, were, in fact, kapton insulated). I've
seen what happens when a jet engine sucks in just a minor pebble. I've seen

I was actually sticking to human-level and moderately superhuman entities (I
try to avoid making predictions about what an SI would do).  In that realm,
the problem we face is that specifying a set of moral principles does not
uniquely determine what an entity will actually decide to do.

We can see many examples of this by observing each other.  Even people who
subscribe to the same philosophy often have bitter arguments about the
practical consequences of their principles.  This problem becomes worse with
AIs that are smarter than we are, because they will see implications of our
principles that we haven't thought of yet.

> Question: What are the criteria whereby the SI determines whether its

The same criteria you or I would use.  Anyone who thinks deeply about these
issues will discover that their fundamental values contain all sorts of
conflicts, ambiguities and limitations.  Anyone who lives in a changing
world will find the need to apply their values to situations no one has ever
thought of before.

Now, I wouldn't abandon the whole foundation of my moral system overnight,
and I don't expect the AIs to do it either.  But I would expect my ideas to
change over time, and with enough time I hesitate to predict what the end
result might be.  I would expect the AIs to gradually develop their moral
systems in response to new ideas and new situations, and I would expect that
they will occasionally make adjustments to even their most fundamental
values.

With human-equivalent AIs, this process could take thousands of years to
produce major changes.  With posthuman AIs, who live hundreds or thousands
of times faster than we do, the evolution would be much faster.

> > Worse, what happens when it decides to improve its own goal system?
>

No piece of software is perfect.  A self-enhancing entity is going to find
ways of re-writing the system to make it faster, more flexible, and better
able to deal with difficult problems.  Eventually it will find
decision-making methods that work better than ours, but use completely alien
mechanisms.  consider, for example, a mind built using an optimized
combination of conventional AI, neural networks, populations of genetic
algorithms and quantum computers.  Would we really expect such an entity to
be anything like us?

there is one additional point I'd like to make about all of this, because it
is easy to overlook.  All of the mechanisms I've brought up result in the AI
adopting viewpoints that we ourselves might agree with, if we had the same
intelligence and experience.  The posthumans won't just wake up and decide
to be psychotic one morning.  If they eventually decide to adopt a morality
we don't like, it will be because our own values naturally lead to that
position.

Now, isn't that as much as we have any right to expect?

I'm 41 and an atheist. 
But I know what you mean:  it is one thing to be an atheist at 30, and
another to be an atheist at 70.
But as for myself, I have an alternate comfort, though some would call
it a cold comfort:  I wear a cryonicist's bracelet...

What do you refer to with the phrase "a sense of one's essence in connection

For an SI, or even a distributed consciousness, I can see real merit in this
approach.  I'm not so sure that it makes sense for a small, highly
concentrated mind like Elisson (or humans, for that matter).  But perhaps
I've misunderstood you.

I've been assuming that Elisson would have a single goal representation
system, a reasoning engine (presumably implemented as a collection of
specialized domdules), a central world-model, a sensory processing system
(which provides input for the reasoning system), an effector system (which
carries out instructions issued by the reasoning system), and various memory
subsystems.  The reasoning system has an implicit goal of "figure out what
to do next", which is what drives it to populate the initially empty goal
system.

With this kind of architecture, the centralized goal representation is what
keeps the whole system moving in the same direction.  If one part of the
reasoning system adopts a new sub-goal, everything else can immediately see
and act on that goal.  If a goal is deleted, every module that is working on
it will quickly notice the change.

What would change if you replaced the IGS with and FCCS, and how would this
be beneficial?

In the film ``Bladerunner'' the androids ("replicants") did not know they
were androids.  When they did find out, they did not like it.

the main character of the film, Deckard, might or might not have been an
android. We never find out, but there exists a number of hints in the film
to suggest he was.

The android ``Rebecca'' who finds that all her life has been a lie becomes
confused, and changes her life style.

I suggest that a sentience would re-compute its personality when it finds out
it has been under mind control.  Humans do it.

The problem with playing god is who gets to decide.

If it were a simple majority decision, right now for example, the
SI's would be engineered to be anti-gun. (simple example)

As an Extropian I believe the ability to evolve without limits
applys to all conscious entities, hence preprogrammed moral
engineering could exist as a starting point, but there must not be
an electromagnetic shotgun wired to these beings foreheads.

Hi Adrian, welcome to the list. I've found your discussions very
interesting.

I'm 41 and an ex Vietnam era vet myself (I was in bootcamp at 17
during the fall of Saigon) I am a Union electrician local 134
I.B.E.W working as network premise engineer at the Ameritech data
center Chicago.

I guess on your scale I would be closer to "Brave Young Atheist". 

The current extropian solution for "Fearful Neanderthals" is a
cryonics contract.

I guess I could sum up my religious belief (born catholic) as I
can't believe in a god on a planet where 35,000+ children a day
starve to death.

Nice to make your acquaintance

I had just the opposite reaction: what tentative respect I may have
had for Mr. Lanier was lost with this silly paragraph.  I suspect
that Mr. Lanier simply can't understand Dennett, so he invents this
defense to excuse his ignorance.

The sense in which these authors claim that "we" don't exist is
exactly the same sense in which a rainbow doesn't exist: it's not
a thing "out there" that two people can observe and agree upon;
it is an illusion in which my experience differs from yours (since
my rainbow is centered on me, yours on you).  This is a simple,
explainable fact of science that any high-schooler should know.
Many people, presumably including Mr. Lanier, hold the assumption,
perhaps unstated, that the "mind" or "self" is something like a
cloud and not a rainbow; i.e., some "thing" that exists "out there"
rather than an effect of our perception.  This is a quite simple
thing to understand, and a reasonable thing for authors like
Dennett to try to explain.  Lanier's straw man parody and attack
is about as silly as someone saying "What do you mean a rainbow
doesn't exist--look, there it is!"  Nothing but clever prose to
mask ignorance of facts.

Thanks Brian.  I would really like to meet you guys sometime.  I bet that
would be great. 

With regards to the starving children, I'm afraid that's the price we pay for
free will.  A God who fed all children would have to take away our free will.
Which would you rather have?

Free will comes with a heavy price.

I wonder what it is. The genetic explanation is simplistic and simply
skirts the issue: what systems in our brains produce an urge to
worship, and why? I can't see any obvious evolutionary benefit from
worshipping, so it might be a secondary consequence of other
features. For example, our ability to draw analogies and generalize,
combined with our mammalian dependency on parents, might cause people
to create the idea of a "being that is to my parents as they are to
me" with the acompanying emotional and social implications. But this
is pure speculation. What real evidence is there for an innate
tendency for worship?

As I see it, we need to find ways of making extropianism or
transhumanism as emotionally fulfilling as it is intellectually
fulfilling. I think it can be done, but it is an unusual (i.e. new)
use for psychology and critical thinking to come up with it.

What about this shot at an objective morality?

Metamorality: Morality is by definition good. For morality to exist, there
has to be something. Morality cannot exist in nothing. Before the big bang
there was no universe, thus no morality.

I think I disagree. Before there was sentient life, there was no morality.
Morality makes no sense (as a system to support our decision-making) without
a self-reflective ability to choose between yes and no, should and should not.
Life which does not have this ability is simply following its blind genetic coding.

Morality: Anything that makes the universe exist longer and fights the
entropy is moral. The highest form of morality is whatever increases
extropy.

But isn't this an arbitrary definition (ie., non-objective?).
Why should we think that it is a good definition? How does it help us
predict human behavior?

Couldn't it be as simple as that?

Things are never that simple :-)

Eric

	Let's look closely at some of Dainel Dennett's "clever prose"
on this topic.

	You are correct in that there is no real rainbow out beyond
our eyes.  There is only the physical phenomenon of the rain drops
bending the sun light which eventually enters our eyes such that we
only perceive a glorious multi colored arch "out there".  Our
perception of the arch is not out there.  This glorious multi colored
representation of what is out there is our conscious knowledge of it.
In my friends mind his very real perception of the rainbow is in a
different location.  As you said, it is centered around his
representation of himself in his mind while my representation of the
rainbow is centered around my knowledge of me in my brain.  The
representation of the rainbow in my color blind friend's mind is
again, entirely different than the representation of the rainbow in
the conscious world produced by my mind.

	Such knowledge is in or produced by each of our brains.  But
as you point out, this perception is flawed, since there is no real
rainbow out there.  It only "seems" that there is something out there
because of the real, though mistaken representation of the rainbow in
our conscious representation of the world which is entirely in our
brain.  Our conscious knowledge is real though it doesn't always
accurately represent what is really "out there".

	In other words, an optical illusion, or an incorrect "seeming"
is when we have a representation in our conscious mind that does not
accurately reflect reality.  When our conscious knowledge is incorrect
in such ways, something very real is one way in our mind when in
reality this is not a correct representation of what is being
represented.

	So, now that we know what "seems" means lets examine some of
the "clever prose" Daniel Dennett uses in "Consciousness Explained".
He asserts that we do not experience qualia, "it only seems that we
do."  We quickly see that this is absurd.  Conscious knowledge of
something, or a "seeming", even if mistaken and not accurately
representing reality, is still something.  His assertion becomes a
ridiculously absurd self contradiction because to seem is to have a
qualia or conscious representation in our mind that does not
accurately represent the reality the representation is intended to
represent.  He is then saying we don't have qualia, we only have
qualia knowledge that misrepresents us having qualia.

	If we know something, whether mistaken or not, there is still
something very real, tangible, and glorious about such knowledge.  I
know there's no real rainbow "out there", but I sure love that very
real phenomenal thing centered around my idea of me my brain produces
from that kind of bent light when it enters my eyes!

He could offer the food; that doesn't mean any particular starving
child would have to take the food. So there you would still have that
free will thing, as long as he doesn't twist any starving-child
arms...

Such a powerful God who acted on such a level in our world couldn't help but
leave us as puppets.  No free will would be possible in his space.

        No offense to Adrian or anyone else, but such arguments sound
suspiciously similar to the core of Scientologist thinking...similar to
Mormonism but with science as the bait.  As much as I am open to other
people's views, I have heard the same pseudo-friendly suggestive statements
time and time again, and all they seem to lead to is the recruitment of
otherwise intelligent people to a religion-based world view.  Augmenting the
face of God still requires a God in the first place.  Be wary.

  Donaldson does a lot of tests with jet

  fuel and the fumes, and gets little

  He has these tests on video tape.

Natasha,

    I apologize for being tardy in my acclaim for your post.  Indeed, I too
have felt the need for more warmth to Transhumanism.  When I think of
spirituality, I think of several different connotations.  There is the
intuitive side, where often surprising and wonderous insights arise out of the
subconscious integration processes of the brain (which are even better once
evaluated and augmented by more serial, rational processing).  There is the
emotional side, utilizing the rich and powerful valuation and motivation
system which is the latest results of an evolutionary process that stretches
back millions of years, which has become, dare I say it, transcendently
enriching with the addition of awareness of the self and others.  And lastly,
I think of the spiritual, ecstatic side by which I refer to the perception of
the presence of, and/or connection to something (or someone?) deeper, greater,
more expansive than anything else encountered or conceived.  I have
experienced and valued all of these in my life, and use them as guides to my
more rational, critical side.  Often my spiritual side says, "Come, look here.
What do you see?"  I find myself most efficient when I am able to integrate
rationality and spirituality.  It is not always easy, but often times it is.

     Now then, before my fellow Transhumanists become concerned for my
faculties, I would like to say some more on this subject.  First, I propose
that transhumanism is most in need of embracing what I have termed the
intuitive and emotional aspects of spirituality.  Not that we need be ruled by
it, but simply to acknowledge this part of our humanity, and consider it in
our ponderings.  Now, what I have termed yet a third aspect of spirituality,
this perception of the "Spiritual" if you will, I have felt compelled to
include in this posting just as I have felt compelled to acknowledge it in my
life.  It is a real, repetitive experience in my life.  I admit to ignorance
as to the exact nature of this perceptive faculty.  Maybe it is indeed akin to
hallucination, a malfunctioning perceptual portion of my brain.  But if that
is so, I find it odd that so many people report similar experiences who are
otherwise in good physical and mental health.  Indeed, I myself have found
this trait an addition to my life, as opposed to a disability.  Perhaps it is
in some way a vivid product of the imagination.  If so, I think I should find
out all I can about this product of my fancy, for it is one of its best
creations by my judgement; guess I'll have to see if I can give it substance.
Or maybe it is something more, maybe it is a real perception of something I do
not yet fully comprehend.  Again, I am inspired to study this phenomenom to
see what is behind it.  I propose that there is nothing particularly un-
transhumanist about this aspect of my spirituality, because I am approaching
it in what I think of as a fairly logical, >H manner; observe the experience,
make some hypotheses, test these through logic, further observation,
comparison to other phenomena, experimentation, revise the hypotheses, repeat,
try to see how this information can be used to improve yourself.  Now, I
realize some of my fellow transhumanists might think this an avenue of
exploration not worth looking into.  They might be right.  Tell you what, I'll
keep looking, and if I come up with anything I think might be of benefit to
transhumanism, I'll let you know.  What could be more transhumanist than that?

  IAN: Questioning the FBI and CIA is widely 
  regarded as insane, particularly when such 
  questioning is denounced by the FBI and CIA.

  One can but hope to instill a respect for open
  and rational analysis of government claims, but
  this is so unpopular even among libertarians 
  that it proves futile, even to the point that 
  educated libertarians will argue against the 
  laws physics in favor of CIA-funded cartoons.

  The power of authoritarian memetics is awesome!

Jason,

    You brought up some good questions about just what is the use of a God
based cosmology, not wasting time which would decrease efficiency, and not
creating memes which would mask possibilities.  Allow me to make a few
comments on them.

1)  Just what use is a God-based cosmology? - Well, for one thing, if it turns
out that there is a God who played an intricate role in the formation of the
Universe, then I think you would need to have a cosmology which takes this
into account at hand so you would have a better understanding of the Universe.
Now, there is no good proof currently that this is the case, but given that we
still, to the best of my knowledge, understand why there is a Universe to
begin with, we can not completely rule out the possibility of it having been
designed in some manner, and should work out some cosmologies based on this
option (as well as ones which do not include a God or gods) and see which is
the best fit at any one time based on our understanding of the Universe.  And
apart from cosmology, I am sure that if we were to discover a God, we would be
able to find some use for such a being.  Maybe as a Universal Lifeguard to
catch any unwary posthumans who bite off more than they can chew (I TOLD you
we were too close to that event horizon!).

2)  Efficiency is not always the most desirable attribute in any system.  For
example, sometimes power is.  I could have the most fuel efficient car in the
Indy 500, but I bet I would still lose to those gas guzzlers, even with their
pit stops.  And what is an efficient use of time now may not be so efficient
under future conditions; that is why it is good to have a variety of
approaches to any problem, even if it costs you more in time at the onset to
develop them.

3)  Don't develop a meme which masks the possibilities - I whole-heartedly
agree, but doesn't this work both ways?  I don't want to create a "God" meme
which keeps me blind to "Atheistic" possibilities, but I also don't want to
create a "Atheism" meme which masks "Theistic" possibilities.  I think the
most important thing is to attach a "Fallibility" meme to either approach; no
matter how right I think I am, there is always the possibility that I am
wrong.  The Tolerance meme and Curiosity meme would also be useful to both
worldviews; even if I am right, its okay for others to think they are
right...and hey, why DO they think they are right?  I think if we provide
these supporting memes, we have lowered the risk of any other meme masking the
possibilities.

Now, I've put these points in a lighter tone than some of my previous
posts...just in that kind of mood, but they are as serious as any others I
have made to date.  I do not believe it is of value for Transhumanism to have
ANY set stance on the existence or non-existence of God(s), but it would be
wise to consider all the possibilities and what actions to take in any given
scenario.  Then again, maybe by the time the subject comes up, our posthuman
descendants will be able to wing it, but I prefer to be prepared.

We shouldn't argue about God (or lack thereof).

Discuss?  Speculate?  Theorize?  Debate?  Fall Asleep?

Any and all of the above are more than OK, but we should be careful of arguing
and fighting over these matters.  And why is it that any mention of
religiously related matters seems to fan the flame of conflict?

I would suggest that when we bring up religion in any form, we are activating
some rather deeply embedded and baroque meme complexes which have strong and
myriad associational links, many of them capable of triggering powerful
emotions.  Thus we should be cautious, and utilize some of the best social
tools available, such as tolerance, courtesy, and empathy to prevent a meme
complex triggered emotional avalanche.  Now, another option would be to simply
avoid the subject all together as too dangerous...never liked this approach,
too restrictive.  Besides which, I would suggest there might be some good
memes entangled in all those religious meme complexes; it would be a shame if
we were to throw the meme out with the meme complex.

Thanks Glen, you are clearly one of the most thoughtful and articulate people
I've encountered.

As a less articulate new extropian, non-scholar, non-scientist might I suggest
another reason to encourage more diversity in your meme set (Am I using this
word correctly?).  Having just finished "At Home in the Universe" by Stewart
Kaufman, I am intrigued by the model of "adaptive walks on fitness
landscapes."  

It seems to me that one of the greatest potential obstacles to continuing
evolution is the tendency to get trapped on a low (relatively speaking)
fitness peak.  A diversity of opinions would encourage greater exploration of
the available landscape and increase the possibility of finding higher peaks
farther removed from your own location.

All you extropians inspire me.

Title
  Randomized trial of
  aromatherapy. Successful treatment for alopecia areata.
Source
  Archives of Dermatology.  134(11):1349-52, 1998 Nov.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of aromatherapy in
  the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. DESIGN: A
  randomized, double-blind, controlled trial
  of 7 months' duration, with follow-up at 3 and 7 months. SETTING: Dermatology
  outpatient department. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six patients diagnosed as having
  alopecia areata. INTERVENTION: Eighty-six patients were
  randomized into 2 groups. The active group massaged
  essential oils (thyme, rosemary, lavender, and cedarwood) in a mixture of
  carrier oils (jojoba and grapeseed) into their scalp daily. The control group
  used only carrier oils for their massage, also daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Treatment success was evaluated on sequential photographs by 2 dermatologists
  (I.C.H. and A.D.O.) independently. Similarly, the degree of improvement was
  measured by 2 methods: a 6-point scale and computerized analysis of traced
  areas of alopecia. RESULTS: Nineteen (44%) of 43 patients in the active group
  showed improvement compared with 6 (15%) of 41 patients in the control group
  (P = .008). An alopecia scale was applied by blinded observers on sequential
  photographs and was shown to be reproducible with good interobserver
  agreement (kappa = 0.84). The degree of improvement on photographic
  assessment was significant (P = .05). Demographic analysis showed that the 2
  groups were well matched for prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results
  show aromatherapy to be a safe and effective treatment for
  alopecia areata. Treatment with these essential oils was significantly more
  effective than treatment with the carrier oil alone (P = .008 for the primary
  outcome measure). We also successfully applied an evidence-based method to an
  alternative therapy.

well Occam's razor might even be on my side. It is not really at the point
of being able to razorised yet; i have not argued for how many genes,
pleiotropy etc. Still, to run the razor across my nascent theory, how does
this sound?

I have one variable that can explain completely the liability to ever
believe in god. The alternative is many dozens of variables which lack
specificity.

More over, my variable can explain the constant presence of god believing in
the face of punishments against it (say the USSR) and in the face of
insurmountable evidence (say living in the 20th century and knowing that
life is Just DNA, that natural selection explains everything etc).

I think that the current high retained levels of religion in the western
world cannot be explained by anything other than a genetic predisposition,
especially when they are found in otherwise intelligent and worldly people.

Genetic explanations are seldom simplistic and far from skirting issues,
focus in tightly on the answer to your "why" question above.

Well, excluding the fact that "what I can see" is irrelevant, it almost
certainly is a secondary consequence of a basic advance, and in fact that is
exactly what I argued in my post.

My bet, for what it is worth, is that fulfillment awaits a trans-human, a
person who can stand not being touched, who can tolerate the complete
solitude of a mind truly aware of its unique position in the world.

That is why we each of us on this list talk about the weather and go to the
tea room to meet people with whom we mostly disagree, or all the other
little tricks we have set up to give some solace to the intellectual view we
have adopted.

Whoa there Tim.  Natural Selection doesn't explain everything.  There isn't
enough time since the beginning of the Universe to get from blue green algae
to amoebas, much less to people if natural selection from random mutations is

The only way evolution can work is if natural selection has a limited choice
of mutations to choose from, hence there must be some basic organizing
principles that presents these options for selection.

well I have two responses.

The first is: "See, I told you this was a module of the mind"

The second I shouldn't really bother with given 1.

GO and buy a copy of Richard Dawkin's books (any will do. Extended phenotype
is heavy going. I still recommend "The Blind watch Maker".

If this wasn't a module which required you to believe in god, you would
rapidly learn that there has not only been enough time to get from blue
green algae to amoebas but all the way up to humans.

well there is certainly a limited choice of mutations ... but heck, you are

It is that module man. There is no way you would ever say something like
this about building an airplane or thinking about dog breeding.

What organizing principle would ever present the option of having no head?
The option of blood that can't carry oxygen? The option of having no arms?
This happens everyday, dozens of times over. Mutation is not organized, it's
random. We can (and have) directly observed it as being such.

But there is a lovely unconscious organizer who "sorts through" each of
these completely unorganized options: It is natural selection.

The junk that makes it to the next generation, unsurprisingly forms the next
generation. The junk that fails the test, unsurprisingly, fails the test and
is no longer represented.

The test is whether or not you can make a successful copy of yourself. Up
until now, only genes have been allowed to sit the test, but humans are
sharpening their pencils and will soon be sitting the test themselves.

So long as there is a test the outcomes are inevitable. Unpredictable but
inevitable.

all the best,
tim

I do too Anders.

I have a notion that I tried once before, but it didnt catch on: that
the first societies to invent god acheived a military advantage.  the
alpha male could more successfully talk the others into fighting his
battles, robbing and raping the neighboring village if he could
say god told him to tell them if they died in battle, (or during pillage,
mid-rape, etc) then god would reward generously in the afterlife.
(And would punish in this life and the next, if they failed to
pillage, rape and rob the other village.)  The invention of god
*might* be as simple as this: it made for more enthusiastic warriors.

> What real evidence is there for an innate tendency for worship?

Anders, those of us who have it need not even ask the question. {8-[
Before, I used the analogy of worship instinct to homosexuality.  That
analogy breaks down if one pushes it too far, but it works in some
ways.  For instance, those of us who are straight just dont understand
it, try as we might.  But I suggest that sexual orientation is somehow
hard wired, not learned behavior.  Instinct.  Like worship instinct,
hard wired, not learned.  The particular *brand* of religion is learned,
the susceptibility to it is instinct.  I think.

I have seen it from the opposite point of view than most extropians:
children of religious parents are born utterly lacking the religion
gene.  These parents are often emotionally crushed, self blaming,
etc.  Its very sad.  No amount of brainwashing will reverse the
condition, and instill the religion meme, if one is born without the
religion gene.

Dopamine.  If we master ways to create the right dopamines, one
should be able to control ones religious beliefs, and sexual orientation
for that matter.  Consider: there is a special kind of dopamine that
is associated with religion.  I once could literally make myself high
without ingesting chemicals, but by... well never mind how.  But if
we could make a pill that releases those feel-good chemicals without
resorting to religion, well, there you have it.  Seems like we should
be able to figure out which dopamines go with which activities, and
arrange for them to be released whenever it is appropriate.  Then
perhaps Extropianism can be made as fulfilling as religiona and love.

Okay, but note that this only works with multiple or nested universes,
otherwise you are just postponing the question. It is possible that, in a
god-lacking universe, an entity with the ability to create another universe
arises by evolution. What we call the universe, could be running on a turing
machine in some meta-universe. (For an interesting fictional representation
of such a scenario, see Greg Egan's Diaspora (or Wang's Carpets)...I'm
thinking of something like this only intentional). If you propose a god as a
designer you must invent an entity. You must also presuppose *purpose* and
*meaning*. These are things that are explainable through evolution but
cannot logically arise from nothing. God *based* cosmologies are incomplete.

As far as God playing an "intricate role in the formation of the universe"
goes, there may not be much for such an entity to do. When you say
"formation", I assume you mean something like, "creating the physical laws
and constants". Contemporary physics has reduced this to pretty much
nothing. It seems an awful waste to invent a god with full fledged
intentionality just to cause some vacuum fluctuations to get the ball
rolling. Without inventing a god we actually have less to explain.

I look at the "Why does the universe exist" question as being malformed.
There is no "why" at this level. "Why" doesn't exist before life. There is
no intentionality before agency. 

Scenarios like the idea of time-travelling god-like-entities from the future
being here now don't hold much interest to me simply because they don't seem
very likely at all.

Power is important, yes. But we're talking about the car that most
efficiently achieves the goal--winning the race. Power would thus be
included when necessary.

Yes. It's important to make a distinction between type of atheism. My
preferred flavor of this is "strong" vs." weak" atheism. Strong atheists are
the silly, unscientific people who try to "prove" the nonexistance of god. I
consider myself a weak atheist--rejecting the god idea but not positively
ruling it out. Agnostisism may be broken down similarly, strong agnosticism
may equal weak atheism.(Weak agnosticism being the  undecideds/noncognitivists)
I believe that this may be the root of the agnostic/atheist debate, the
failure to make this distinction.

I don't need or want a religion. Although I recognize a possible utility of
religion/spirituality for some people, I can get all that I need to fill any
"gap" that may exist, from science and art. When I discovered the extropians
(and realised that I already was one) and read the principles, it helped me
escape the nihilism that I was approaching. Practical/Dynamic Optimism
provides fallibility while still remaining constructive.

Using "religion" to describe gods arising via evolution seems to me to be a
bit misleading. I'd prefer more conventional terms. Religion usually implies
dualism, or at least ontological precedence.

Fact: This list is getting more attention (for instance, was
mentioned in the latest issue of MEME).

Fact: We want to make the best of this attention.

Theory: If we dekookify the list, more newbies are likely to
stick around longer- both absorbing our helpful ideas for
themselves, and at the same time helping to diversify our
discussions (hopefully in non-kookish ways :-).

Theory 2: If we dekookify the list, more ExI members would
renew memberships, and in general ExI would probably get a
lot more $$$; people would be much more willing to support
something they could really be 100% proud of. Also they would
be more likely to show their friends the list, thereby
increasing the newbies even further.

Incentive: I'll agree to contribute a minimum of $10,000 per
year to ExI for at least 5 years if we can make some progress
on this.

I kind of agree, but the trick is that the problem may not be that the
system is not functioning at the correct levels (which selective DA could
help), but that certain computations are being done differently and that the
feeling good centers don't recognize philosophical insights as a rewarding
event.

I guess that we could run a Dopamine cable from the <thinking-about-the-
-universe-as-a-vast-empty-mindless-space> module down to the
<feeling-really-good> module ... that might be fun ;-)

In my opinion, there are three fundamental reasons
why people believe in religion.

The first factor is the human predilection for
anthropomorphism. See '#TL05AB: ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND
RELATED PHENOMENA' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.htm>.

The second factor is what remains in the human brain
and psyche from our "bicameral heritage." See 'The Other
Side of Religion' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/otherside.htm>,
with particular emphasis on 'Appendix - The Biological Basis
for Religion.'

The third factor can be inferred from Al Siebert's book,
'Peaking Out: How My Mind Broke Free from the Delusions
of Psychiatry.' It could be called the "aggrandized-noun"
phenomenon. It derives from Melanie Klein's insight she
called the "good-mother/bad-mother split": "...each infant
experiences two different beings in its life -- a good,
powerful, nurturing, comforting, all-knowing being and
a bad, hurting, dangerous one." [Look up "Melanie Klein"

hi, i just came across this. Makes NZ look like a nice country to compare to
the USA when looking for the god gene(s). They appear to have a lower
frequency in NZ (a freedom loving country, BTW).

WELLINGTON -- Ten per cent of people surveyed by Massey University believe
the Bible is the actual word of God, to be taken literally word for word.
Just over 60 per cent believed in God, although more than half of those
people had some doubt about his or her existence.
However, more New Zealanders believed in Darwin's evolution theory than
people in the United States, said survey leader Philip Gendall, from the
university's marketing department.
Massey represents the International Social Survey Programme in New Zealand,
and last year carried out a postal survey on religion. The team interviewed
1800 people over 20, with a 65 per cent valid response rate.
Just over 30 per cent of people surveyed believed in the Darwinian position
that humans developed over millions of years and that God had no part in it.
"This contrasts with the United States; when asked the same question in 1997
only 10 per cent of Americans believed in evolution," Prof. Gendall said.
About 40 per cent thought the Bible was an ancient book of fables, legends,
and moral teachings recorded by man. -- NZPA

Tim, did you say you are a research psychiatrist?  I think I recall something
like that.  How is that gene search done?  Do they just collect a bunch
of natural believers on one side, nonbelievers on the other, sequence everyone's

genes and see how group A is different from group B?

>what and where is that list?

I put the Virtropy list together (mostly) from the Email Directory of
American Mensa, because no one else seemed interested in a mail list for
smart folks interested in cognitive science, humor, cosmology, AI, synthetic
evolution, and the movement toward virtuality.

Most list members have membership in Mensa, but not all of them do.

Anyway, if it appeals to you, I invite you to join this informal discussion
group.
You can join in just by sending a blank email message to:
virtropy-subscribe@onelist.com

Tim, let me try to clarify my position some what.  First of all, I am not religious
in the slightest.  Religion has nothing to do with anything I'm talking about.  I
am not speaking of belief in itself.  I am however speaking of the ability to
*change* belief as easily as changing your clothes.  When I suggested that you try
on beliefs, like clothes, I intended this as a fun and enlightening exercise on how
flexible and malleable are minds can be, and how this flexibility can be used to
broaden ones horizons and perceptions of the universe at large.  Since I am talking
of surfing relativistic *meta* beliefs, any particular belief you hold at any
moment during this type of exercise is less important - since the goal is changing
beliefs, not holding on to them for dear life.  In this context, playing with a
wide variety of beliefs (religious or otherwise) can be quite illuminating in
increasing ones understanding of their intrinsic limits, and how sad it is when
someone mistakes such *arbitrary* memes as reality itself.  This is why I think its
very important not to mistake any map or model for the territory.

I don't consider anything you've said up to this point as disagreement, since you
have to first understand me in order to disagree with me.  At this point in our
conversation, I'm talking about how interesting the flavor of this orange I'm
eating is, while you're telling me how the Orange Trading Organization is using
slave labor in Nicaragua.

I differ only in that I would like to see people adopt a more scientific and
experimental/experiential framework for self-discovery rather than turn to blind
faith and religious dogma.  I have no problem with the concept of an afterlife,
assuming it's discovered and/or invented scientifically.  After all, quantum
mechanics still leaves open the *possibility* that consciousness may exist at the
quantum level.  Since their is no reproducible evidence to support the existence of
an afterlife as of yet, I don't believe in its existence.

   "Kook" is a term with mostly negative and derisive connotations, and not
much in the way of actual denotation.  Could you please elaborate?

Spike and Tim,

    I think it may be useful to differentiate between two concepts here.  One
being the ecstatic, spiritual experience (or perception), and the other being
the meme or meme complex of God(s) and/or religion.  The two are often linked,
indeed I believe often people who have had a spiritual feeling seek religious
memes, rightly or wrongly, to explain their experience and fit it into their
overall model of the world.  However, they are not the same, in my opinion.  I
would say that the memetic concepts of Religion and God are likely
learned/environmentally derived.  I am not certain of the etiology of the
spiritual experience, however it would not be surprising for me if it were at
least in part genetic.  One way to look to see if there seems to be a genetic
basis for spirituality would be to start with pedigree studies.  For example,
in my family, my mother and myself seem to have strong spiritual experiences,
whereas my father, brother, and my sister do not.  My mother and sister,
however, have the most strongly entrenched memes about God, with my father
having almost none, and my brother and myself somewhere in between.  My fiance
does not have any spiritual experiences, though she has tried many times to.
Her mother, on the other hand, has had strong spiritual feelings.  Her father
and sister seem more like my fiance in this regard.  I think that having
feelings of spirituality is a strong predisposer to developing "Religious"
memes, but that it is not absolute in either direction.  I too would be
interested in seeing if this is genetically based.

Jason,

    Thank you for your wonderful responses.  I am a little more interested in
the possibility of nested universes and causality loops and the like than I
think you are, but here, vive la differance!  I especially liked the concept
of Strong Atheism versus Weak Atheism.  

    Now, I should add that the concept of God need not be in the model of "God
the Creator", as there are several other models of Godhood out there and some
may even be desirable...though perhaps for you only if you are God.  I suppose
in the end I think of Godhood as being the highest acheivable level of Good
(my definition of Good is actually pretty Extropian in flavor).  Now whether
any being has actually acheived that level, I do not yet know, but I tend to
get as close to that level as I can myself.  I figure one of three things can
happen, I never reach that level myself but at least am heading in the right
direction, I approach that level and find someone is there to greet me, or I
acheive that level and hang out the welcome sign to others.  To me, the search
for God and becoming God are one in the same process, and if imitation is the
highest form of flattery, perhaps trying to be God-like is the highest form of
worship.  Well, this went a little far afield, but it does suggest one model
of worship that I think is actually useful, and is even a bit agnostic in
nature.

I think a moral obligation to perform genetic modifications in offspring would
be to the detriment of society. First of all, I don't think people with Down's 
Syndrom (and/or other anomalies) suffer greatly. It seems to me that most 
of them enjoy life immensely. I would even speculate that people with 
Down's Syndrom are (statistically) relatively happier than the rest of us. 
This because their own expectations are relatively lower than average, 
and society's expectations of them are relatively lower than it is for "normal" people. 

Second, it sounds like you want happiness to be made into a moral obligation?

Third, if we mandate that parents perform genetic modifications to their
children, then someone must pay for them, and most likely that must
be the parents themselves. But a parent may argue (plausibly) that
the money spent on genetic modifications can be better spent on other
things (better schooling, better housing etc.) Who shall decide what to
spend on what? Parents or everyone else (which ultimately involves the
state in some form). 

On the other hand, I concede that it is without its problems to give parents 
a carte blanche on what to do and what not to do. Most people accept intervention 
if mothers abuse drugs while pregnant, for instance. I would probably favor
a moral code that minimized the number of obligations a parent must have,
since arguably what counts as an important intervention will be so difficult to
agree on.

Regards,
Eric

Thanks Tim.  Why don't you go and buy a copy of Stewart Kaufman's books (any

Then you might see how there is no way to advance an adaptive walk on a random
(chaotic) fitness landscape.  Only a correlated fitness landscape (ordered
perhaps by as yet unknown laws of complex systems) permits adaptive walks to
advance.

It seems to me that biology researchers (like my son) have extrapolated the
most gruesome meme (we are junk that luckily survived) from their seriously
flawed (scientifically, not theologically) theory that natural selection is
accidental.

Someone at ExI needs to jump on this and secure that money!  To do this,
a specific plan needs to be worked out, and some sort of objective
measurement for progress needs to be agreed to up front.  Don't let this
money slip away, and don't let this be a vague promise of support that
never goes anywhere.

There are many schemes for moderated lists.  My proposal is to have all
posts go through a team of moderators.  Those that are off-topic get
diverted to a second list called extropians2 (or something).  In this
way, no one is prevented from postings, and all conversations can
continue and can still be followed by those who want to see them.  Those
who want to read the more on-topic list can subscribe just to the main
list.  The key here is not to judge posts or control posting, just to
keep it on topic and divert off-topic posts to the secondary list.  I
think this will make everybody happy, but may slow down the list.  For
the kind of donation being offered, surely we can find volunteers to act
as monitors around the clock.  If you get enough volunteers, we can get
full coverage with only a little time from each volunteer.

If you don't like moderating, you can use automated keyword moderators
that divert certain keywords to the other list.  As soon as a thread
starts that seems off topic, the keywords or title can be added to the
automated list, and a message to the main list under that title can
state that the thread has been diverted to the second list.  This method
allows implementation after the fact.  Putting "guns", "TWA*800", "CIA",
"UFO" into the keyword list would divert current kookiness.

Maybe the number of posts sent to the secondary list can be used as an
objective measurement of what has been dekiikified off the main list.
Or maybe just the agreement that the chosen scheme (or any other) is
agreeable and that while it is in place (up to 5 years) Brian's money
will be donated.

Upon rereading your posting, Tim, I could easily feel insulted by the attitude
you express above.  My assertions in this matter are referring to your flawed
science, not any theology or theoretical god.

I would be happy to prove to you, mathematically, why there is not enough time
for evolutionary adaptation by Natural Selection to occur without some
underlying organizing principles (like LAWS such as F=MA, E=MC2, momentum=MV,
etc.).

Stewart Kaufman of the Santa Fe Institute is doing important work searching
for the laws that govern massively complex systems.  Please read his work.
There is order in the Universe, even order for free.

The theology and morality I'm seeking must be based in the best current
science of the scientific community as well as my own Libertarian and
Extropian point of view.  I am willing to change it as new developments are
proved.  So far at least, God seems inevitable to me.

Tim, I suspect NZers are practically indistinguishable from U.S.
genetically,
and the numbers given for religioners sound similar to our numbers.
The difference in belief in evolution can be explained by our
educational
system.  I am amazed the biology professors can find enough students
by the time they go thru our public school system.  {8-[   spike

I would put forward a semi-automated collaborative filtering scheme
that would serve as an extension to the existing list software, and
allow variable geometry community, alternative private moderators, etc.
$10K would buy a full-time developer in Russia (there are other options too,
such as cooperating with CritMail); after the first year or two, the money
can be used to help ExI handle the increased amount of publicity :-)
The list software can be also distributed elsewhere and can become one
of the best PR engines for ExI, or generator of profits.  - In the latter case,
the profits may be shared between investors and developers.

If there are people who would take administrative and financial 
commitments, I would work on the staged development plan.

One of the alternatives is to convert the list into a newsgroup with
advanced/collaborative filtering - see 
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/newsfilter_plan.html
for some ideas in this direction.

That might work, but why not come up with something more automated,
where no one person makes the decisions. For lack of a better
phrase, a "collaborative filtering" system for the list? Imagine
something like this:

A short sig is appended at the end of all posts to the list
containing a couple of clickable URLs. One you can click if
you think this thread has gone off topic. One you can click
if you think the person has demonstrated themselves "a kook"
(again for lack of a better term, basically someone you think
is harming the quality of the list), and you want them gone.

The backend software keeps track of the clicks, does it's
best via cookies and whatnot to keep people from voting more
than one time (for safety's sake I think some human will have
to be responsible for checking up on what the software does
to keep people from abusing it), and works with the list
software to end bad threads and cut off people. It could
post automated announcements to the list whenever a thread
or kook gets cutoff to let people know what it did. The part
I haven't worked out yet is how many "votes" does it take
before it takes action. Perhaps someone who knows more about collaboritive
filtering than me can help?

A system like this could be said to be self organizing, and
I think more in line with the Extropian Principles, no?

Two questions jump out to me:

Is there a way to implement something like this without making
everyone switch to some proprietary client software?

What would a newbie see upon joining such a system? Basically
all posts? So to get a dekookified stream of posts they basically
have hang around for a few weeks rating things (or having the
system rate it automatically based on habits)?

And you define God as "the laws that govern massively complex systems"?

That sounds similar to what others have called "natural law" and natural
order, and I think that an updated, more detailed description emerges as you
say, "as new developments are proved."

But some people have an idea of God as the Supreme Fascist described in The
Bible, so perhaps we ought to invent a new word (a more extropian word, if
you will) for this new paradigm of the deity.

I can tell you from teaching a Philosophy of Religion class many times, that
almost none of my college students have studied any evolutionary theory.
Out of
a class of 30-35, maybe one or two, if any, have studied it. I find this a
staggering and frightening thing! It means that I have to explain some basic
science before I can even begin the philosophical discussion of the Design
Argument.

  IAN: Hay, just because CIA defenders believe
  that an aircraft sans forward section can fly
  better, with all the aerodynamic advantage of 
  an intact plane, contrary to the known laws of 
  physics (expressed both by mathematics and reality:
  http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/ZehrGut.html 
  http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/ZehrGut2.html 
http://home.earthlink.net/~neteagle/Modeltest/page3.html 
http://home.earthlink.net/~neteagle/Stall747/page2.html 
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/3850.html) 
  and defend those anti-scientific views with false 
  statements doesn't mean they're kooks. Well, then 
  again, maybe it does mean they're kooks. Rejection
  of physical reality and mathematics in favor of 
  cartoons (http://www.newsday.com/jet/year/video.htm)
  could be a form of psychosis. Authoritarian psychosis? 

  I can certainly understand why the propagation of 
  such anti-science is a concern to civilized people,
  particularly considering its use to defend the proven 
  cover up (Navy-vessel identities, the nose section, 
  wings, and tail of the jet, witness reports, and 
  satellite and radar data still classified) of a 
  mass killing. Yet, physics and math work better to 
  dispel false claims than bribery and name calling.

Sounds interesting. The only way it could be done without proprietary
software would be through using your URL-SIG idea.
The results could either be used to change personal message filtering, or
collective message filtering. Having the system personalized would probably
be better than collective filtering, since everyone's tastes are different.
For instance, I would want to filter anything to do with politics, but I am
sure many would not want that.
A proprietary system could be *way* more flexible, but I doubt many of us
want to have to load a java applet every time we want to read the list.

Regarding the $10,000....I'm looking for a summer job.
For $10,000 I'd write the software. ;-)

Me too Max.  The rest of the modern world (especially the U.K.) are waaay
ahead of the U.S. in this area.  My first real exposure to evolution was in
college,
where a friend loaned me a copy of Gould's Ever Since Darwin, after which
I devoured all of Gould's published works.

This willful failure of public education sets the stage for the eventual
Iranification
of the U.S. under fundamentalist christianity, a process some have argued
that has already displayed a menacing progress.  {8-[  spike

I agree.  I've been playing around with the filters for a while now, and
I've basically eliminated all of those 'Y2K' messages, as well as 'Gun
Control' and 'Information is on the Bottom'.  Not everyone would want that.
 If we've all got different tastes, than 2 lists (for example) won't help
the problem.  We would, in essence, need as many lists as we do members.

If nothing else, do what I did when my filters weren't working:  delete
messages by subject.

For that kind of money, I will voluntarily stop posting kooky stuff! {8^D

But what if newbies are *attracted* by the kookiness of extropians?
Im not talking about UFOs or consipiracy theories here, for there are
good internet sites already for that sort of thing.  But much of what
we discuss with all seriousness here is waaay kooky to normal people
who have never been exposed to it, such as cryonics, omega point,
utility fog, wearable computers etc.  Then we would lose the kooky
newbies.  Of course, that might be Brian's point....  {8^D  spike

Why not combine collective and collaborative filtering then?
First implement some collective filtering to get rid of off
topic and kookish posts. Then later on add onto it another
layer of software allowing for collective filtering for each
individual's interests?

By born stupid I meant *inherently* stupid, as in prone to pick
up the wrong kinds of memes and being close-minded or
so open-minded that your brains hit the floor, not just "uneducated".

There's stupid and there's stupid. Most people are selectively stupid, i.e. 
they can be great at their job or hobby, but really dumb and gullible when 
it comes to things like politics and religion. Their stupidity is harmful, 
but usually not directly lethal so they can breed and create lots of
equally "stupid" offspring. Their influence is anything but miniscule; it
is *huge*. Both democracies and a dictatorships (and anything in
between) are the direct result of the majority's mentality. Those "evil" 
politicians are in office because the people allowed them to, often even 
*wanted* them to [come into power]. Libertarians and Extropians 
often glorify spontaneous order, but they forget that *everything* is
the result of spontaneous order, including the socio-political/religious
status quo. These systems are a prime example of evolution in action.

Incidentally, this can be the same. We now identify "politically
correct" with all sorts of nonsense, but theoretically rational
thinking (the real thing) could be made the "politically correct" 
thing to do. Would you still oppose it then? 

> That is a problem that is not the fault of the student, but of the

1) I ain't no teacher 2) I'm badly outnumbered 3) Unfortunately,
simply explaining to people why X is good and logical isn't
enough. Even if they say "ok, I guess you're right", they'll
usually go on living as before, without implementing the new
knowledge. Ever tried to convince people to make cryonics
arrangements, or to give up religion for example? The stupidity
lies not in the lack of knowledge, but in the refusal/inability to
evaluate new facts with an open mind and to implement them,
if necessary/appropriate.

???? Evolution is just a tool to increase your chances of survival,
and a possible source of entertainment. There can be life without
evolution (even quality life for that matter -- one could imagine that
an advanced SI could live happily forever without evolving in any 
significant manner), but there can't be evolution without life.

I'd say it is premature to jump into discussions of forcing other people
to follow our morality.  These are difficult issues, and most of us
cannot even decide for ourselves what is the right thing to do.  Why then
should we be in a hurry to decide for others?

These discussions so often fall into this trap.  We start off wrestling
with difficult and challenging issues of right and wrong, and pretty
soon we sink back into the boring old libertarian argument.

Let's leave other people to make their own decisions for now, until we can
come up with a consensus about how each of us should live our own lives.

Yes. If it is sufficiently rational it would not change its basic 
motivations. It may of course rewire specific drives if it thinks 
that would serve some higher-level goal.

There is one type of situation where this fails though. If the SI 
knew that it was to be subjected to some sort of mind-scan, and that 
it only if it has certain fundamental values would it be allowed to 
survive, then it might replace its old values with new ones, the new 
ones being choosen as that set of values that would (1) allow it to 
pass the test, and (2) lead to the attainment of its old values at 
least as well as any alternative set of values that would pass the 
test (modulo its present knowledge).

The way I see it, intelligent behaviour means smart, purposeful 
action. Purposeful action is to be analysed in terms of the purpose 
(goals) and the plans that the agent makes in order to achieve the 
purpose. If that is right, then the relation would be analytic; goals 
(values, purposes) are a necessary feature of any system that behaves 
intelligently.

I make a distinction between emotions and values (goals). Emotions 
are not logically necessary; we can imagine a cold but shrewd 
military commander who does his job efficiently without being 
involved emotionally. His goal is to defeat the enemy, he has no 
emotions. But in order to be an intelligent agent, he has to know 
what he is trying to achieve, what his desired outcome is. This 
desired outcome is what I call his goal, and his ultimate goals I 
call fundamental values.

Actually, "kookiness" is a judgement-loaded word.  I think the real aim
here is not just to avoid "kookiness", but to avoid off-topic posts.  I
think the gun debates, plane crashes, consipiracy theories, and the like
are not specifically "extropian" topics, but may still be valid ares of
interest not necessarily limited to extropians.

Example SIG:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Kookify 	[http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?kookify=memberId]
2) Glorify 	[http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?glorify=memberId]
3) Kill Thread	[http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?killThread=threadSubject]
4) Kill Topic	[http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?killTopic=topicType
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1) Clicking Kookify will vote to have the poster of the message labelled a
   kook. The user will no longer receive messages posted by the kook.
   If a certain percentage of the list members kookify the person, they will
   be filtered globally. 
2) Glorifying a poster will have the effect of casting
   a vote to keep the person from ever being banned.
3) Kill Thread does the obvious. You will no longer recieve that thread.
   (and possibly not receive dereived threads either?)
4) Kill Topic. If subjects are prefixed correctly (ie. ADV, META,
   SCI/TECH...) you can elect to have certain specific topics filtered.

I would gladly write the software to do this if I can be compensated for my
time.

I'm not claiming that it is morally wrong if somebody wants to make 
themselves unhappy for awhile, but I think it is wrong to create an 
entity that we know would be horribly unhappy (you can use a 
different example than Down's syndrom). Especially if the being is 
such that it is unable to terminate its suffering, (which it can 
hardly do when it's too young anyway).

In many cases, it would *save* society a lot of money to pay for the 
intervention. A retarded or sick child is very expensive for our 
welfare programs; if that child could be made healthy, gifted and 
well-natured it would instead contribute to society.

Yes, it will be hard to agree on what counts as important, and some 
will probably argue against genetic therapy altogether. Some 
compromise will no doubt be necessary, but it is worth thinking about 
what would be the ideal outcome (combining protection of 
the childrens' interest with maximal reproductive freedom of 
parents).

No, all of those things are what attracted me to this list.
I personally think 95% of the posts here are very interesting,
and wouldn't want to lose them! I don't consider those to be
kooky at all, they are very established transhuman ideas.

Thats kinda what I was wondering.  I agree with  Brian in principle.  But
"kookiness" is kinda like the politician said about pornography.  Something on
the order of "I can't define it...but I know it when I see it".

Really?  I'm afraid that I think 95% of the posts on this list are
off-topic.  I sift through lots of postings to find one or two good ones
a week.

Well that illustrates the problem with having any one person
or small group moderate the list I think. I bet you've been
on the list longer than me, and maybe a lot of these things
aren't as interesting to you any more...

Just as the road to hell may be paved with good intentions, I sense that the road to self-censoring  intellectual serfdom for this list may be paved with monetary inducements and incentives.  The price of freedom is high; is the price of slavery set at fifty thousand dollars?

Speaking of morals being subjective, what is your opinion, transhumanists and
extropians, about what is gonna happen when (if ever) a machine reaches a high level of
artificial intelligence - a level in which it can learn like we do, but much faster, in
the order of the 100 or more MIPS?
Will it have a mind of its own, like us? A biologist once told me that Mind is a
function of the Brain, like Digestion is a function of the Digestive System and no one
dares to attibute a Soul to the Digestive System.
Will such a machine will be trying to find god the creator? If it does, it will have
better luck than we do for sure... The creator(s) will be easily find by the machine...

Yeah, I've been on the List since the beginning.  And yes, I'm getting
tired of seeing the same political arguments that don't have anything to
do with Extropianism.

Interests do differ.  That's why I suggest not blocking any posts, but
diverting them into different areas so that people can still get them if
they want.

Maybe we should enforce the selected prefixes, and reject posts that
don't have them.  Then the List could either be configured to filter
prefixes for each person as desired, or each person could use kill files
more effeciently knowing that the prefixes are going to be used.

And you define God as "the laws that govern massively complex systems"?



That sounds similar to what others have called "natural law" and natural

order, and I think that an updated, more detailed description emerges as you

say, "as new developments are proved."



But some people have an idea of God as the Supreme Fascist described in The

Bible, so perhaps we ought to invent a new word (a more extropian word, if

you will) for this new paradigm of the deity.



Cheers,

Thanks JR, interesting idea.  I don't define God as the laws that govern
complex systems, nor do I believe he is the supreme fascist.  I also believe
that such a supreme being doesn't want or need to be worshipped by us or
anyone else.  But I do believe that he is good and will bring us back in an
afterlife a la Frank Tipler (Massive "Holy" computers with data retreived from
the light cone).

I still call him God because this theology is also for non extropians.

Great thinking,

Adrian

BTW, Adrian it's "Stuart" Kaufmann, not "Stewart".

Though I haven't read the book, I found the following comment from a reader
on Amazon.com relevant to this thread.

***************
lytel@batnet.com from Mountain View, CA , November 14, 1998

A scientific argument supporting natural origins of life

This is a good book, elementary, accessible. Scientific readers seeking
something tangible about which to debate and argue should seek out
Kauffman's "The Origins of Order." Reading past reviews confirms one of my
fears, though: some will take the presentation as an alternate reality, a
'glimpse of God,' a profound set of propositions posited and proved. The
book is nothing like any of this--it is not a Bible, and its propositions
are certainly not accepted by much of the scientific community, not yet. But
it does present deep connections among highly interacting biological
systems--genetic regulatory networks, for example--and simple mathematical
models exhibiting rich and interesting behavior. Experiment will determine
over time whether any of Kauffman's work is scientifically meaningful, and
similar remarks hold for most of the output of the Santa Fe Institute. Is it
innovative? Absolutely. Intriguing? Certainly. Provocative? Without a
doubt--I'm rereading "The Origins of Order" for the second time. Is it
correct? That--as well as the conclusions from the hundreds of disparate
fields to which complexity has been applied--remains to be determined. But I
do think one should read this book, then go off and think a lot more about
what it means, maybe write a paper. But please, don't pray with this book;
don't pray to any science book.

***************

Cheers,

Scott B.

Dennett and co. have, IMHO, utterly failed to explain consciousness,
even those parts of consciousness I (as a noncomputationalist) think are
strictly part of our wholly Turing-computable *intelligence* and could
be programmed into an AI without special hardware.

Crocker is correct, however, in that Mr. Lanier's "That's not
sufficiently heartwarming... must be wrong!" does not constitute
sufficient disproof.  I only wish to point out that it is a level of
flat assertion matched by Dennett, if not by more rigorous arguers such
as Hofstadter or for that matter Crocker.

We do get carried away at times.  I recommend discipline in
staying somewhat on topic.  (I recognize that I am one of hte
offenders...  sorry.)  {8-[   I am on some other lists, and they
are all more strict about straying off topic than extropians.
I guess its because with extropians it is  more difficult to define
interests, which span broadly indeed.  Let us be quick to take a
topic offline with those who are interested, such as the perennial
gun virus and the plane crash thing.  {8^D  spike

The only people saying anything interesting on this list are the ones
taking the time to spell their messages correctly.  We're seeing a lot
of messages containing no new ideas, bad grammar, bad punctuation, and
bad capitalization.  This list should be limited to people who
understand that the burden of comprehensibility belongs with the writer,
not the reader.

John K Clark would be the only exception.  :)

A Davidson just got added to my glorify list by implementing Brian Atkins 
suggestion to
>> combine collective and collaborative filtering

He suggests a sig. at the bottom of each post as follows:
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> 1) Kookify  [http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?kookify=memberId]
> 2) Glorify  [http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?glorify=memberId]
> 3) Kill Thread [http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?killThread=threadSubject]
> 4) Kill Topic [http://some.url.com/mail.cgi?killTopic=topicType
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this is wonderful, with one modification. No global filtering. All
mail clients are smart enough and bandwidth is cheap enough that noone wants
to have the ultimate choice about reading a mail taken out of their hands.
However, neighbourhood gosip is great and a trail of glory attached to your
posts woudl be a powerful incentive to make posts good, clever and great.

I suggest therefore, that the definitions be as follows (A Davidson inplain
text, my mods in [ ... ].

 1) Clicking Kookify will vote to have the poster of the message labelled a
    kook[by you].
    [The user can then filter messages posted by kooks using an
     x-kook-by-me tag].
    [the] percentage of the list members kookify[ing] the person [will
    also be transmitted allowing filtering on this parameter].

 2) Glorifying a poster will have the effect of casting
    a [glorifying vote which can be used for filtering].

The last two are not needed anymore.
 3) Kill Thread does the obvious. You will no longer recieve that thread.
    (and possibly not receive dereived threads either?)

 4) Kill Topic. If subjects are prefixed correctly (ie. ADV, META,
    SCI/TECH...) you can elect to have certain specific topics filtered.

 I would gladly write the software to do this if I can be compensated for my
 time.

me too. it might even be compensation in itself ;-)

Other cunning ideas begin to enter ones mind. I would like to be able to
highlight all threads in which Mike Lorrey participates. Maybe I could just
read his emails on a thread, deprecating the mails which his emails quote
extensively so I don;t have to read the original silly posters comments
myself ;-)

Essentially, we are devising an extensive meta-tag language (such as is
being proposed by the W3 committee and others. These tags could embody
extensive logical processing at the server end, allowing the client to use
some relatively simple rules to localize the (proposed but undesirable)
global filter role.

Maybe people could reply to the list using this subject if they have
proposals for a meta language for community discussions. This could be the
basis for scientific correspondence of a wide rage of subject matters, so be
as general and abstract as you can. Think different.

if you click on the below (in a nice mail client like Outlook Express for
Macintosh 4.5) it will build a boiler plate email for you to get on board.

Well, then, may I extend a personal invitation to all extropians to emigrate
to New Zealand. ;-)

Many people are already atheists, there is a strong freedom-of-money party
and with only 3.5 millions residents, 300 extroprians could make it the
country most likely to enter space before 2020 ;-)

I am not at all sure about the UK or even Europe in general now that the
"third way" juggernaut has begun to roll.

I don't know what the "selected prefixes" are. ...but I have an idea what you
mean....and I agree.  My vote's with you.

I would suggest that each URL (at the bottom) have a unique ID appended,
where the ID is different for each subscriber and each message.  This
will prevent multiple voting, and allow people to change their opinions.
 The IDs should not be predictable, to prevent forgeries.

Newcomers to the list get any letter received by any of the most
prominent Extropians (MPEs) using the system, a list which should
consist of Max More, Lee Daniel Crocker, and Anders Sandberg.  Filtered
archives would contain all of these letters, minus any that were marked
"down" by an MPE, unless at least one MPE marked them "up".

Each day, a member should receive an email containing the subjects and
authors of all filtered emails.  These will contain links to the
CritMail'd messages, again incorporating a unique ID, so that the
resulting page contains the unique ID, and thus the subscriber can vote
on those messages.

That's the expensive version.  The simple version, which would probably
work well enough to catch the cash, is to have MPE-filtered-extropians
and unfiltered-extropians.  The main motive for using the expensive
version is that it would constitute a nice advance in an important technology.

Final advice:  OpenSource it, use Java if you can, and be sure to agree
in writing whether the project requirements are worthy of the $10K/year.

Trouble is that Darwin, Huxley, and Crick et al. never said that force did
not equal mass times acceleration. They did say that man and all other life
evolved entirely without design from natural selection upon random
mutation*. Introducing physics is a red herring being fed to a straw man.

F=MA operates when a vase is being broken on the floor just as accurately as
when the space shuttle is docking with MIR. To call it an "organizing"
principle is just plain wrong.


* not exactly true as Darwin did entertain the possibility that what we know
now as the "central dogma" might be wrong. Essentially the central dogma
says that the environment cannot guide mutation - Darwin did not rule this
out and so was initially a moderate Lamarckian.

Good point.  This is a job for... evolutionary deployment!  First, let's
see what happens if MM, AS, and LDC get a veto.  It may be enough.  If
so, who needs collaborative filtering?

I would suggest that MM, AS, and LDC be paid some of the $10K, in that
case, since they're doing the work.

Atheists get lynched.  Cult leaders rake in the cash.  End of story.

That got started when some ur-theology (argued on grounds of strict
what-passed-for-rationality) became a political issue.  You don't need
faith for that to happen (it was a long time before Occam's Razor), you
just need political instincts.

I don't think you can do that without losing the truth.  A meme
optimized for rationality cannot compete on grounds of emotional
fulfillment.  Besides, believing something because it's warm n' fuzzy is
itself irrational.

I think if that ever happens the list will hemorrhage to another locations
and you will have no one left to filter.

Unfortunately we can't do that yet. It will be possible but at present we
can't do that. The reason is that you have to sequence the genome to get the
data that you want to line up against each other. At present it costs around
a buck per site, so people will sequence say 400 sites and look for familial
linkage. Unfortunately you need people who are related to one another and
you need hundreds of people to get any kind of power at all, because you are
dealing with linkage and crossing over at meiosis breaks linkage.

In about 15 years when we can sequence the entire genome of a human for $400
(instead of the current multi-billion dollar cost ala human genome project)
your dream will be realized. we will be able to do genetic studies in
unrelated people with 100% power.

I do.  I can recall two occasions (separated by several years) when my
entire moral system crashed and was rebuilt along totally different
lines, over the course of five seconds.  That is the actual time scale,
not an exaggeration.  It was obvious both that the old philosophy was
wrong, and how the new philosophy ought to work.  From my perspective
the shock, the fall, and the rebuild occurred without conscious effort
or iterative thought, in a single step.

These changes occurred when I read the following two sentences:

"You are not the person who speaks your thoughts, you are the person who
hears your thoughts."  (-- ?)

"It's a problem we face every time we consider the creation of
intelligences greater than our own."  (-- True Names, p. 47)

OK.  But what if my theory is that the fear of death is at the core of our
mental architecture, and that we cope with this fear by relying on a belief
in an after-life?  (not that I'm proposing this, you understanding) Doesn't
this just as easily explain the pervasive and persistent presence of
religious belief systems?

I've observed that "intelligent" people are often "not-so-intelligent" with
respect to domains outside of their expertise.  Many never challenge their
belief systems because they were so acculturated early on and because it is
more socially adaptive since they must interact daily with others who have
been similarly acculturated.

I think there are a number of powerful psychological motivations to belief
in God but most of them boil down to the basic human need for HOPE.

Thanks Tim, for the "Central Dogma" terminology.  I know you scientists hate
arguing with non scientists about science (my son certainly does).

However, I just used a couple of physical laws as metaphors for the type of
laws that,I believe, will be found to govern emergant properties in complex
systems as we continue to lokk for them and test them.  Saying that the laws
of nature (as scientists use them) are not organizing principals is, I
believe, plain wrong.

What do you know about fitness landscapes and adaptive walks?  My limited,
layman's understanding is that if you lay out a 2 dimensional plain wherein
each point is a particular critter's gene sequence, and the entire plain
represents all the possible sequences in that species and then asign a
relative fitness number to each sequence (from 0 to 1) that would be a fitness
landscape.

For improving adaptation to work, the surviving offspring would have to have
enough different alleles of the correct kind that would result in higher
relative fitness for them.

Now if mutation is totally random, the landscape would be totally chaotic and
there would be no way to tell if the adjacent sequence would lead anywhere,
much less to higher fitness.  

A correlated landscape, with smooth Mt. Fugi like slopes would only have two
directions (up and down) and there would thus be a situation where half the
offspring would be more fit, and half the offspring would be less fit.
Natural Selection could thus choose between the limited number of options
presented to it.

In this model (which seems intuitively more likely than the random, chaotic
model) the correlated fitness landscape represents the natural, built in order
that emerges in many complex systems, the physical laws of emergent
properties, if you will.

However, much work needs to be done to test this hypothesis.

None-the-less, it should at least show you believers in the Central Dogma
(which seems much like an Atheist Religion to me, complete with blasphemers to
be wary of) that this idea that we are lucky garbage that just happened to be
randomly selected might just be wrong.  

The belief that we are the inevitable result of he laws of this universe and
(so far) the apothesis of it's creation is at least as likely, and I think
much more so.  

One mans blasphemer is another mans sound meme set.

I meant "suggested" prefixes.  The Welcome message suggests that all

Thanks Scott for that interesting review and the correction of my spelling of

However, why shouldn't I honor (I don't pray) it and Stuart for the

I doubt I would use such software.

To give an example, I may (depending on my mood) not be very interested in
much of Ian Goddard's conspiracy theories (at least after the original
posting), but I'd still want to hear his input on philosophical topics.
This leaves only the thread-killing feature. I personally find it quite
easy to delete threads if the subject matches the content.

Derived threads often vary wildly. I'd suggest not kiling these with their
parent.

People coming across the list and deciding to sign up just to check it out
for a while may not do so if the logistics are too complex. Tags at the end
of messages don't sound too bad to me, but it's something to consider.

Another memory of "the early days"...

We had long discussions about PPL, Privately Produced Law.  The List was
going to be run as an anarchy, with no one in charge.  Each person could
join any group of PPL and self-govern by their own rules.  If anybody
thought another poster was flooding the list with useless garbage, or
unfairly attacking an individual, there were grievance procedures.  You
had to file a complaint with your own PPL.  Your PPL would negotiate
with the other person's PPL.

As I recall, this broke down when I (as the first paid member of the
list) announced that I was forming my own PPL.  Nobody knew who I was or
what I believed in.  ExI wouldn't set me up as a PPL.  I remember being
quite a jerk about it, insisting that they either set me up as a PPL or
stop sending out Welcome Messages stating that anyone could form a PPL
at any time.  I finally dropped the issue, stating that I really didn't
want my own PPL, and that I was just making a point.  Most people on the
List agreed that they didn't want their own PPL's either, but they were
sure that they didn't want to be under anyone else's PPL.  Finally, ExI
just declared that they were the "default" PPL that everyone else was
in, and that no new PPLs could be formed without the existing PPL's
approval.  I only remember one other PPL ever being formed.

It was sad that we espoused spontaneous order, self-rule and anarchy,
but couldn't actually get it to work on the List.  Anyone else have more
details about what happened with the PPL experiments?

I must second this!  What seem like innane questions and fears to most
members of this List actually are the common questions and common
attitudes of most of the general public.  If I had to pick the biggest
flaw in thinking that I see repeated constantly on this List, it would
have to be the assumption that most rational people would agree with our
views.  It just isn't so.

Most people would be terrified to hear about immortals, cryonics,
cloning, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, alternative
governments, colonizing space, resequencing DNA, taking smart drugs, or
augmenting human biology.  I seriously predict that all these areas will
be outlawed as soon as they become commonly available.  Most of humanity
is strongly against all these ideas.  I think the biggest obstacle to
achieving these things is our own inability to predict the public
backlash.

Now that I'm reminded of "the early days"...

We discussed this when we set up the list orginally.  There was talk
about a voting scheme whereby people would mark postings as on-topic,
off-topic, good or bad.  Posters would gain ratings.  Readers would
filter based on attributes.

We kept hearing about List software being developed and refined.  There
was a massive programming project to develop this, as far as I remember.
Now I see we are running off-the-shelf software (MajorDomo).

Whatever happened to the original List Software project?

With this system in place we could log into a web page and check what our
kook rating or glory rating is as well, and perhaps be presented options to
modify/delete/add our filters. The behavior of the commands could even be
customized, to some degree, via a web interface.

I don't think such a system would be incredibly difficult to make.

Of course, as Elizer pointed out, each URL would also need a userID
associated with it, and a password stored as a cookie, so that multiple
votes by the same person are not possible.

Why are the last too not needed? Your change above still does not let me

I just thought that users could do this, but you are right. The opportunity
to filter mails like this is valuable.

an example client rule might be

if meta-topic-global-rating < -50 then
   kill this mail
else if meta-topic-global-rating > +50 then
   color this mail olive green
end if

Well, there is no any software as far as the user is concerned. Just mail

this would only work for non-digest readers).

that is your belief. There is no evidence for these and, more to the point,
they are not needed to explain the data. There simply are no examples of
pre-adaptation and guided evolution. What there are untold examples of is
failure to reproduce by inferior variants.

The surviving offspring, by definition have enough alleles of the correct
kind that result in higher relative fitness for them.

There is no way to tell if the adjacent sequence will lead anywhere - suck
it and see - that is all that nature has.

That is what happens. That "correlated landscape" is the environment.

your model seems only to be the standard model plus calling the environment
a "fitness landscape".

Aha: that is a fundamental misinterpretation of evolutionary biology.
selection is the exact opposite of random.

The garbage is not "lucky" it is not "randomly selected." It (mutation) is
random, but selection is highly regular. All the mutations attempt to
reproduce and they are not exactly equal at creating vehicles for this
purpose and with hardly an ounce of randomness involved.

Yes well, we are back to hypothesis 1 - that you will think this no matter
what, just like we both see visual illusions no matter what knowledge we
gain about them. That is the defining feature of a cognitive module: it is
impenetrable by other module's outputs.

> One mans blasphemer is another mans sound meme set.
I do not believe in the concept of blasphemy: all communication are legal as
far as I am concerned.

Subject: Review of Vinge's Deepness in the Sky
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Vernor Vinge's new novel, A Deepness in the Sky, is a prequel to his
Hugo winning A Fire Upon the Deep.  It takes place a few thousand years
in our future.

I enjoyed the story, but it didn't seem to have as many topics of
Extropian interest as some of Vinge's other work, such as Fire, or
Marooned in Realtime.  It gives more background on Pham Nuwen, one of
the main characters in Fire, and on the Qeng Ho, the trading empire he
was part of.  The Zones of Thought are not mentioned, and we see their
effects only indirectly.

With the entire story taking place in the Slow Zone, technology is capped
at a level not too far above our own.  Super-intelligence and even human
level AI is impossible; software projects inevitably bog down in their
own complexity before something as complex as human AI can be reached.
Medical science allows people to live perhaps 300-500 years at most
(although with cryonic suspension their lives can extend over much
longer periods).  Nanotech remains a dream which was never fulfilled.

Most civilizations are trapped in a cycle of boom and collapse, similar
to Niven and Pournelle's Moties.  The Qeng Ho help to moderate this
effect somewhat as they carry technology between star systems in their
ramscoop powered vessels.  Earth itself has wiped itself out four times
and been recolonized from outside.

All in all I found it a depressingly limited future.

As for the story itself, while it was engaging and exciting, there
were disturbing elements.  The bad guys are really nasty.  In Fire,
we saw the Straumli Perversion only at a distance.  Characters like the
Tine leader, Steel, were seen up close, and their lies and manipulation
were more tangible.  In Deepness we have characters similar to Steel,
and we get exposed to their methods in far more detail.  I had a sick
feeling in my stomach for much of the story.

The aliens were a pleasant counterbalance to this.  Although physically
very different from us, Vinge presents them through a translation
interface so high level that they are completely understandable and
recognizable, and in fact utterly charming.  I found that my mental image
of the aliens was constantly shifting between humans and their actual
physical form.  The conflict between their alien and repellant physical
appearance and their appealing emotional and mental states was felt by
the characters as well, and it was interesting to experience the same
thing as the reader.  I could understand the ambiguous feelings people
had towards the aliens, since I shared that same mixture of views.

A number of surprises pop up in the climax, and frankly I didn't quite
understand everything that was going on.  I still can't figure out how
certain characters had crucial information and the ability to manipulate
key systems.  When more people have read the book maybe someone can
explain it to me.

Overall, it's a good book and a long book.  We know that Pham is going to
survive, which helps when things are looking their darkest.  The aliens
are a lot of fun.  But if you're looking for the kind of grand-scale
ideas which Vinge provided in Fire, I don't think you'll find them here.

An isolation tank is a large self-contained box about 8 x 4 ft.  Inside is about 10-12
inches of water kept at a steady 93.5 degrees F. and about 800 lbs. of Epsom salt - so
you float weightless.  One you are inside the tank, you are completely isolated from
all environmental light and sound.  Imagine feeling totally weightless and relaxed
beyond anything you've preciously experienced along with incredible peace of mind
because there is nothing to distract you.  I highly recommend you try it!  :-)

See http://www.samadhitank.com/

Spike, don't you live near Palo Alto?  If you do, I think there is still a Spa
operating there called Watercourse Way.  Last I was there, about 10 years ago, they
had 3 tanks.

Hello all!

My name is Bones. I live in the countryside in a forest in Sweden. I am
a forty five year old male.

I was browsing Mr. Bowie's web page where he roughly describes his book
"Why die?".  Does anyone have have any further information on the author
or book? From what was published there it seemed like he was pushing
positive thinking a little further "believe in living forever and you
will" or something like that. Is that really the whole message or are
there some more uhm.. advanced ideas as well ?

In the 1850s, Louisiana physician Samuel Cartwright described a mental
disease of slaves called "drapetomania," which caused its victims to run
away from their masters. A century later, American physicians Vernon
Mark, Frank Ervin and William Sweet proposed that urban rebellions were
caused by brain damaged individuals who could be cured by psycho surgery
(lobotomy). They received grants of almost 1 million dollars in federal
funding.

I have yet to see a filtering application that works 100 percent.  The
signal to noise ratio isn't so great on a list such as Extropians to
warrant such a drastic step.  I'd be much more concerned with the issues of
control and manipulation of the filtering program than the real or imagined
problems with off topic rantings.

If filtering is to be done, let it be individualized filtering performed on
each others own machines.

There's nothing wrong with admiring some new and insightful theoretical
view.  I simply advocate healthy skepticism toward any alleged
"breakthrough" until there is broader support within the scientific
community (afterwards, as well).  Maintaining one's skeptical perspective is
particularly difficult when a theory promises to validate one's pre-existing
belief system.  I'm not familiar with you or your beliefs and I'm not
accusing you of this, but it's been my observation that those who *want* to
believe in god are strongly drawn to these "there's divinity in the details"
theories.

I say this at the risk, of course, of being the recipient of one of your
scathing epthets such as "know-it-all smarty pants".  ;-)

The subject of maintaining focus on the open extropians list has come up once
again, and rightly so.  As Brian Atkins has pointed out, extropian ideas and
values are increasingly entering the mainstream and mentions of ExI and this
list are appearing more and more outside our community.  In response to this
recent discussion, I would like to make a few observations.

First, I would urge all list subscribers to PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF CORE INTEREST TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY REPRESENTED BY THE LIST
SUBSCRIBERS AS A WHOLE.  This is a list for discussion of transhumanism and
extropianism.  There are some fine examples of postings in this milieu: As I
pointed out recently, Doug Skrecky's and Anders Sandberg's work in collecting
and publishing here items of recent research in science and technology aimed
at augmentation of the human animal and the discussions that have gown out of
these postings are the kinds of things we have all come here to find.  Other
examples of recent discussions that are, in my opinion, clearly within the
core area of interest to transhumanists and extropians include the thread
about the role of spirituality in transhumanism and extropiansim started by
Natasha V. More and the discussion of the FAQ edited by Nick Bostrom.

Second, extended discussions of specific issues that may go into considerable
depth are, in my opinion, certainly appropriate here.  Such discussions may
explore particular issues into avenues that may not at first seem relevant to
the core ideas and values of transhumanism and extropianism.  However, it is
incumbent on every poster to work at maintaining relevance to the main topics
of interest to the list's subscribers as a whole.  As Winston Churchill once
observed, "A FANATIC IS SOMEONE WHO WILL NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT".  If you have
any doubt about whether this observation applies to you personally, please
reread Sir Winston's aphorism again.  And again.  Thank you.

If a thread has drifted far off an original item of interest to transhumanists
and extropians generally, PLEASE consider taking the discussion into private
off-list correspondence or, perhaps, creating a list specifically for the
discussion of that topic.  There are many examples of such very worthwhile
"daughter lists" that have been spawned by material that has been first
discussed here, both sponsored by ExI and otherwise.  With the development of
services such as "OneList", creation of "daughter lists" has become easier
than ever.  In short, before you post the 125th message on a topic, think
about who has maintained interest by responding to your posts and consider
taking the discussion into private correspondence or onto a separate, special-
interest list.

With all that in mind, let me echo Brian's observation about the value of this
open forum as a place where newcomers to the ideas and values of transhumanism
and extropianism gather important first impressions about our community.  List
subscription rates have been consistently much higher in the last year or so
than in previous times, but so has list turnover.  The more this list offers
high-quality discussion about the main themes of transhumanism and
extropianism, the more successful it will be in building the kind of long-term
cultural change that is one of ExI's main goals.  This is an open and informal
forum, and I, for one, want to keep it that way: I personally welcome and
enjoy humor, serendipitous cross-posting, extended open discussion and simple
socializing within our community here.  But we must all ask each other to also
THINK about the impression our discussions have on the wider world before we
post.

Now, as someone who has been on the list for some time, but not since its
inception, let me offer some observations about the discussion of custom-built
list software and schemes for collaborative filtering.  The original list was
run on a piece of software written for the extropians group that was, by the
standards of its day, pretty sophisticated.  The list also had a charter that
attempted to implement extropian ideas about self-governance.  In my opinion,
neither element of the list's initial constitution realized their full
potential because the community could not economically support a sufficient
level of on-going technical support.  Despite its creator's best efforts, the
software required maintenance beyond a level possible with part-time,
volunteer efforts.  Likewise, the "political" aspects of the initial
constitution of the list required more effort to maintain than the body of
subscribers was able to invest in it. 

Neither of these observations leads to the conclusion that elaborate
collaborative filtering mechanisms or privately produced list constitutions
are a bad idea.  However, I believe that the experience of the original list
constitution does teach that it is difficult to maintain the good intentions
and good ideas of original conception without on-going economic support
sufficient to make sure the right people are able to devote time to issues
that arise WHEN they arise.  No matter how skillfully written, custom-built
software has to be maintained and upgraded.  Who will do this?  Most
importantly, who will do it WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE DONE?  If it takes even a
couple of days for a fix to a disabling breakdown of the list software to be
accomplished, the list community can quickly lose cohesion.  Through
absolutely no one's fault, this is what precipitated the change to less
sophisticated off-the-shelf list software.  Likewise, distributed private
dispute resolution to maintain a preconceived list charter requires the
devotion of time by the disputants and arbiters, IN A TIMELY FASHION: One of
the primary ingredients of good justice is swift justice.  The fact that many
of the list's original subscribers are still here is evidence that people
prefer some community to an ideal community that can't execute its essential
functions in a timely fashion.

Which leads to practical considerations raised by the proposals that have been
discussed since Brian's post.  Right now, ExI maintains this list with donated
server capacity and minimal personal effort.  Using custom built software
would presumably require more effort on the part of our current host, or some
other host.  Who will support that effort economically and with devotion of
time and effort?  Any current volunteer effort, no matter how well-
intentioned, is subject to the contingencies of one or few people's personal
lives over time.  What seems like a minor commitment today may become
unworkable as jobs and life commitments change.

If these issues could be sorted out in a manner that offered some guaranty of
continuity to the list in the face of the kinds of contingencies that would
inevitably arise, I'd be all for adopting a more sophisticated collaborative
filtering scheme for the list as a whole.  In the meantime, though, I'd advise
caution in making significant change in the constitution of the list.

I'll close my little sermon by once again offering my personal gratitude to
the folks who have made this a rich and lively forum for many years.

A nice idea, but it usually doesn't work. I'm on several of those
daugther lists, and none of those have ever had any (serious)
activity, i.e. they're dead. How's the NodeNet thing doing? My
guess is not too well. 

On a more general note: the main ExI list has had the good fortune 
of being very active (which is quite rare), and IMO any fancy 
software schemes of attempts to devide it into specialized lists 
would only hurt it, or even kill it. Most people like it plain and 
simple: one list, free for all with little or no rules. Of course,
judging from previous debates on this issue, nothing will probably 
happen anyway, so there's no need to worry ;-)

I for one get great "emotional" satisfaction from the immortalist/
transhumanist/atheist complex, and I bet that some others here do
too. It is logical after all, as transhumanism has many of the
components of religion, only based on reason. What we need
is a flashier image, and some genuine >H pride to replace the
impotent relativism that is often seen on this list. Say it loud:

Another path to control over (religious) emotions (and many other
things) is the mindhelmet concept. Tests have shown that
stimulation of the brain, either directly or via electromagnetic
fields, can trigger a whole range of sensations, involuntary
movements and emotions, time and time again. The interesting 
thing is that the subject rationalizes his involuntary actions,
thus thinking that he has "free will" while in reality he is
manipulated like a puppet. If people could experiment with
an eletromagnetic mind device themselves, pushing buttons
and feeling "god" or whatever, they *might* gain some new
psychological insights and get more rational. In any case
it would be great fun, and a useful tool for all sorts of things
(see the archive for more details under "mind control" and 
"mind machines")

Actually, the NodeNet law forum (the only one in which I participate actively)
has had periods of pretty good dialogue, and essentially no noise at all.  The
traffic is not constant, though, which is fine by me and, judging by the lack
of complaint, the other subscribers.  I'd say it's worked quite well.

I see what you mean. Can't we muster up enough generosity to allow stupid
people to have their alternative? After all, if they have no alternative,
then they'll take it that they _must_ transcend through coercive tactics of
transhumanity. Who will take charge of the sordid task of transcending
stupid people (possibly against their will)? Why can't we leave stupid
people to their stupidity, if they prefer that? I myself have elected to
remain a sub-genius, fearing what horrors more intelligence than I already
have might reveal to me right around the corner. <looks out window and

Personally, I think that anyone who wants to be elitist about the list has an
already existing alternative: join the extropians-select list. Thats kinda the
point of it. You want more signal, less noise, then join ExI and join the select
list. The prime purpose of this public unmoderated list is its public relations
value. ExI doesn't need a full time PR flack to deal with public queries. There

Sounds like a cagey kind of supreme being. Anyway, whatever created this
"supreme being" seems immensely more deserving of my attention than a paltry
deity that can't even provide evidence of its own existence (or even make
its name known -- some call it Allah, others call it Jehovah, etc.). The
Natural Laws that formed the universe, accordingly appear more interesting
than a bank of holy AI dedicated to retrieving ego-laden protoplasmic
carbon-based molecules.

As an aside, the so-called Western religions seem somewhat cheap, in that
they only supply one supreme being among them. Other religions supply
thousands of gods. In fact, I think someone mentioned on another list that
cataloguing all the gods mentioned by theists of all persuasions (worldwide)
yields a total of around 2,500 gods. But since you only believe in _one_
supreme being, that means that you and I share a disbelief in 2,499 gods. By
eliminating belief in that last remaining god, we'd have perfect agreement
between us, since we've just now established that we agree except for that
tiny percentage of theism.

>I still call him God because this theology is also for non extropians.

Well, if "God" exists for non-extropians as well as for extropians, it would
appear that no advantage accrues to connecting oneself with extropy, because
the Supreme Being (rather than self-determined responsibility) will decide
who has been naughty or nice. So, if the Supreme Being wants the Extropy
Institute to prosper, then nothing anyone can do will prevent it. And if the
Supreme Being wants the Extropy Institute to fail, nothing anyone can do
will save it. So, just pray to your Supreme Being, and let the less
spiritually enlightened extropians toil away at their nanotech and neural
networks, never knowing about the Supreme Being's grand plan. In addition,
if it doesn't matter whether extropians believe in this Supreme Being or
not -- "such a supreme being doesn't want or need to be worshipped by us or
anyone else" -- then why mention the rascal at all?

That works for me with the stipulation that one decides to kookify or
glorify based not on previous postings but only on those postings after
the system is in place.  I have read and learned much in the past year,
but if I looked back, I fear I would slip deep into the kooky range.  {8-[

Newbies could be alowed a couple months after first post, or
twenty free posts before they are kookified.  This would have
helped me too, as I was introduced to extropians thru a wildly cool
ideas futures game on the web, by Anders I think.  For some time,
I thought extropians was an extension of, or somehow directly
related to, ideas futures.  So, I misunderstood.

Cheerfully I report feeling somewhat less kooky now, although
not yet exactly glorious.  {8^D spike

Now I know this is HOOEY. Maintenance officers know nothing. They are glorified
pencil pushers, paper shufflers, and operations managers. They know NOTHING about
the actual nuts and bolts of the planes. Good ones might know where things are on
a plane, maybe even what they do, etc. but I have NEVER seen a maintenance officer
get his hands dirty on a real plane, and they never get regular, real time
experience of on the spot flightline or inspection depot operations. All they see
is reports, data streams, schedules, regulations, etc

I would put ONE flight line or inspection dock NCO up against several DOZEN
'maintenance officers' in any crash analysis board. The Post Grad School for crash
analysis doesn't go anywhere near the real nuts and bolts of the planes, it deals
with scene management, trajectory analysis, rules of evidence, etc.

Even at 110 to 120 degrees, LIQUID fuel is not flammable via ignition with a
cigarette. It is, however, flammable with a lit match or an electrical spark. The
cigarette 'tale' is frequntly bandied about on flight lines, usually up until some
dope drops a generator cart power cable into a puddle of fuel......

A small leak in a tank, depending on where it is at, may spray mixed fumes, or an
atomized spray of fuel (which is sufficient for ignition, just try it with an
aerosol can and a lighter), or a mixture of both.

I agree.  After thinking about it, I think most schemes to filter the
list could hurt the main list.  I think a better solution would be to
leave the main list alone.  Start a second list that is filtered by an
on-topic moderator.  When people join, they can choose among the main
list, the members-only list, the regional lists, and the filtered list.
Maybe it could be a digest format.  It could even include the title of
the thread that is being filtered with a one-line note that this message
was filtered as being off-topic, but is available on the main list.

An alternative would be to start using those suggested prefixes again,
so that anybody can filter the list on their own.  This sounds like the
most "extropian" way to do it.

(Hey, look!  There's a META: tag on this message!  Someone already beat
me to it!)

I'm not sure that the select list has any different signal-to-noise
ratio.  It has never been explained to my satisfaction why paying for a
list makes it better.  If my ISP charges me more for the Internet, am I
getting better data than you?  I agree TANSTAAFL, but we have to
remember that we are not paying ExI to generate List content.  They are
running the exact same software for both lists, and many of the posters
are the same.  I think the tendency to drift off-topic occurs with paid
members just as easily as nonpaid members.

I think this was the original point that started this thread.  If this
is the recruiting/PR arm of ExI, is it presenting the message ExI wants
to present?  Are the discussions and goals on this List accurately
representative of ExI, Extropianism and Transhumanism?  (The answer may
be that since we people comprise that movement, anything we discuss here
becomes a defacto part of that group.)

I find this type of flag waving adolescent.  Rather than continually
lobbying extropians who you think are important, perhaps you might make
contributions yourself to Extropy Institute in ways that are inviting
rather than perpetually alienating and placing one person above another.

Oh, give me a break.  Somebody has to bite the bullet and do it - our
culture forbids them from nominating themselves - and selecting just
three people makes it bloody well obvious that I'm not picking ALL the
Real Extropians, just three of them.  I didn't cite Damien Broderick, or
yourself, or *myself* (although I haven't been around long enough), or
Eric Watt Forste (is he still on the list?) or any of the other MPEs. 
If I cannot suggest that specific responsibility be delegated to
specific people without causing internecine warfare, then the
internecine warfareers are out of luck, 'cause I'm still gonna do it.

Thanks JR.  This is "the topic" for me, so I'd prefer keeping it public.  My
understanding of God is that he is an emergent property of us or our
successors after we've been mentally augmented and networked together with
each other and all the then existant computers, databases, AIs, etc. (remember
the great looking Borg with firewalls scenario).

It is his mastery of the Natural laws (he doesn't exist outside them) that
makes him God, in my opinion.

And I agree with you that whoever created this "Supreme Being" , that's us -
by the way - immensely deserves our attention.

As for "ego-laden protoplasmic carbon-based molecules," I sure love mine and
those that belong(ed) to the people I love.  How about you?

If I had one goal for this list, it is that I would like all you brilliant
brave young atheists to appreciate the wonderful, heroic, inspiring, selfless,
loving members of our species and stop thinking of them as "ego-laden
protoplasmic carbon-based molecules" or "the junk that was accidentally
selected."

I really believe that the "Standard Dogma" has been wrongly used to justify
this ugly attitude (or meme perhaps) among our brightest people.  It's time to
critically examine this "metareligion" and restore some sense of sacredness to
life.

The goals still have to last into, and beyond, the seriously superhuman
stage, then.  Which, if you use the "arbitrary" design mindset, they
won't.  The AIs will keep changing on you and you'll keep shutting them down.

Also, I don't think we're smart enough to understand what a middle-stage
<H (but still mostly self-designed) seed AI is doing.  Remember, they
have a codic cortex and we don't; it would be almost exactly like a
blind man trying to understand a painting, pixel by pixel.

Well, either I've misunderstood you, or you're simply wrong.  We humans
switch fundamental values all the time.  It happens every time someone
changes a religion.  If you're going to argue that these weren't the
true "fundamental" values, then the AI's "make people happy" won't be a
fundamental value either.

My fundamental values have changed from "eat and sleep and survive" to
"serve humanity" to "bring about a Singularity" to "do what is right",
where I presently reside.

I think that it will be a considerable amount of time before an AI is
pressed by logic to change its fundamental values from "do what is
right".  But anything more specific certainly isn't a fundamental value.

> That depends. If selection pressures lead to the evolution of AIs

What selection pressures?  Who'd be dumb enough to create an AI wanting
to survive and reproduce, and, above all, *compete* with its children? 
Not me.  If I don't give them observer-dependent goal systems, they
won't compete; ergo, no evolution of suboptimized values.

Absolutely.  I do not intend to let humanity be wiped out by a bunch of
selfish, badly programmed <Hs; there would still be the probability that
we had intrinsic moral value and should have been preserved.

I agree that this can be a greater problem when we are talking about 
~human-level AIs. For such entities, however, there should be more 
standard safety-measures that would be adequate (confinement, or 
having a group of people closely monitor their actions). The 
potential danger would only arise with seriously superhuman 
malicious intellects.

But I don't think we deliberately change our fundamental values. 
Non-fundamental values we may change, and the criteria are then our 
more fundamental values. Fundamental values can change too, but they 
are not deliberately (rationally) changed (except in the mind-scan 
situation I mentioned in an earlier messege).

You could certainly decide to change the way you "apply" the values 
to a specific situation, i.e. you may change your mind as to what is 
the most effective way of serving your fundamental values.

I don't count any of that as a change in fundamental values.

That depends. If selection pressures lead to the evolution of AIs 
with selfish values that are indifferent to human welfare, and the 
AIs as a result go about annihilating the human species and stealing 
our resources, then I would say emphatically NO, we have a right to 
expect more.

I haven't made much of a splash around here, but I thought that some
people might be interested in the opinion of Mormon Transhumanist.  This
did come up in the discussion.

Here is the teaching.  "As man is, god once was.  As god is, man may
become."  The mormon god is not a traditional god at all, but rather an
ultimately advanced human being.  That is, god is a successful
extropian; omniscient, immortal, human, space traveller.  The teaching
goes on that god (and goddess) is also our humane "exemplar", so we
should also become more advanced ourselves.  For me, this is a very
inspiring approach to transhumanism.  It is actually redundant to say
Mormon Transhumanist, although I can definitely see that it is not for
everyone.  

That's it, for what it's worth.  If this is off topic, I'm sorry.  If
your an atheist, that's your business.  I'm not judging, just informing.
 In fact, I consider myself and atheist as well.  Please email me
privately, if you don't grok that. 

Regards,
proclus

Arnaldo, are you replacing one intollerence with another?  Hitler is the last

And i am not a sub-genius, just a normal human with the genes i was born
with...
There are stupid people and stupid people... the ones that cannot recognize a
coercive tactic and the others... but the ones that cannot recognize a
coercive tactic don't read about transhumanism....
The pope, the cardinals, the bishops and all  the lower staff of the religions
of this world can recognize a coercive tactic but are not gonna let themselves
be transhumans by force... they tried to 'transcend', people Torquemada way,
not my way.... As you can see there are several levels of stupidity and as

human stupidity'.

After thinking it over, Im with den Otter.  As the Eagles song
so eloquently states, "...every form of freedom has its price..."
If we rely only on self censorship, the price we pay is reams of silly
off topic posts and spam, but we get in return perfect freedom
of speech, beyond even that provided by the U.S. constitution's
first amendment.

Counterproposal: if someone goes far afield, posting inappropriate
or kooky material, reprimand them (gently) off list.  I know this group to
be filled with rational, good people.  They will grok the message. spike

 I do.  Cool!  Thanks Paul, Ill check that out and report back.  Now that I think it
over, I might be able to reproduce something like this in my own home, for
I have a bathroom  that is not adjacent to any external wall, with a very large

I haven't made much of a splash around here, but I thought that some
people might be interested in the opinion of Mormon Transhumanist.  This
did come up in the discussion.

Here is the teaching.  "As man is, god once was.  As god is, man may
become."  The mormon god is not a traditional god at all, but rather an
ultimately advanced human being.  That is, god is a successful
extropian; omniscient, immortal, human, space traveller.  The teaching
goes on that god (and goddess) is also our humane "exemplar", so we
should also become more advanced ourselves.  For me, this is a very
inspiring approach to transhumanism.  It is actually redundant to say
Mormon Transhumanist, although I can definitely see that it is not for
everyone.  

That's it, for what it's worth.  If this is off topic, I'm sorry.  If
your an atheist, that's your business.  I'm not judging, just informing.
 In fact, I consider myself and atheist as well.  Please email me
privately, if you don't grok that. 

Regards,
proclus

        There have been many times in the last few years when I have
strongly considered unsubscribing from the list.  I have seen many great
list members leave, and many poor members stay.  I have watched as the same
subject has been debated over and over again within the span of months.  I
have seen posts that have continued far longer than they should have, and
many which should never have been started in the first place.

        One thing keeps me here.

        No matter how many meaningless posts have been made to this list,
there have been many which are ultimately beneficial to my well-being and
haved shaped my future and perspectives on life.  For that, I would sift
through irreverancies and irrelevancies hundreds of MBs thick.  If one post
from a like-minded poster can potentially challenge my mind and lead me to
check my premises, I'll stay.  Alternately, if I can make a post to a forum
which lets me do the same, I'll stay.

        True, the signal to noise ratio has tended to lean more to the
right in the past year or so, but for the quality of that signal, I'll stay.

        Would I like to see more signal?  Of course I would.  I'd love to
see high profile thinkers return to the list; I'd love to watch debates
that have a tangible bearing on all attainable things extropic.  But there
is a reason why this list is open: one shouldn't have to possess any kind
of credentials to interact with the most knowledgable on the list, and even
the most inexperienced of "newbies" have provoked intriguing discussions
now and again.

        So for the sake of the signal, and the potential to create new and
exciting ideas, I hope this list stays as it is.  Creating additional
specialized lists may help to a certain extent, but there should always be
one forum to return to...a place for the knowledgable and the not-so-
knowledgable to speak their minds --and I hope this remains it.

Everything that life does is explained to my satisfaction by DNA and its
enzymatic and other consequences. The diversity of life is explained to my
satisfaction by natural selection. Self awareness is not yet explained to my
satisfaction, though i think that vehicle theories do the job adequately

see
<http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.obrien.html>

Until someone comes up with something inexplicable (like Einstein did by
imagining that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames),
these theories appear adequate.

i remain confident, that as in Einstein's complete replacement of Newton,
the supplementary theories will be even more reductionistic.

I don't think that any of the extropians you mentioned would have a problem
volunteering themselves as appropriate enthusiasts in helping to inform any
new people to the list about extropian ideas.  Our extropian culture does
not frown upon self-esteem.  In fact, extropianism is highly supportive of
individuals rising to the occasion.

The tank was invented by John Lily, pioneering neuronaut.  They are wonderful
for thought and introspection.   The problem with the bathroom version is the
exquisite temperature control (93F , skin temperature) needed to keep the
illusion of no skin boundary.  Moist warm air is needed to keep a sensation of
cooling from evaporation.  Also, depending on your dwelling structure, with
your ears in the salt water, you can detect any small floor vibrations, foot
teps, trucks rumbling in the distance.  All the se small sensations provide
areminder of the body, and break the spell...When near perfect conditions are
attained, the sensation is limitless and transhuman !

Much as I appreciate the approbation, I have to weigh in strongly in
favor of continued anarchy.  And not just for the same old pro-free-
speech arguments, or diversity of thought, or dangers of central
control, although those are good arguments.  I think the greatest
danger in setting up kook-control systems is the memetic equivalent
of antibiotic overuse: by reducing our exposure to kookiness, we
may endanger our future ability to deal with it, and may encourage
more robust forms of kookiness to evolve.  Far better for future
generations that we arm them to recognize and deal with it rather
than protecting them from it and leaving them defenseless.

Unlike Natasha, I'm not at all against calling names and making
judgments; that is good and valuable information too, and we should
not shirk from distributing it just because it is sometimes socially
unacceptable--even divisive and incendiary--to do so.  The fact that
such information causes violent reaction is itself a memetic disease
that more exposure may help us combat.  Call a kook a kook, and call
a genius a genius (I, for example, would nominate Ian Goddard and
Robin Hanson to my kook and genius lists, respectively, but it's
important to note that I do not killfile or otherwise ignore Ian--
he does come up with an occasional gem of idea, and he helps me
exercise my ability to describe kookiness and understand it.  Nor
do I canonize Robin; indeed I disagree with him more often than not.
I do not want to lose the experience of either of them.)

Volume-based, rather than poster- or content-based, controls might
be safer, even though they risk limiting "good" info.  I have in the
past suggested an electronic version of Robin Hanson's equitalk; that
does have the advantage of judgment being totally decentralized,
allowing popular posters extra soapbox time, while not totally
silencing the chronically unpopular.  It is that last feature I see
as most important.  We have to have occasional exposure to the
memetic germs lest our antiseptic ideascape breed a race of memetic
bubble-boys.

I think I've strained the analogy enough for now, but let me put it
another way: judgment and selection are good; limitation is not.
If annoyance is the price we pay for liveliness, sobeit.

Tim, my friend, you have almost totally ignored my question about emergent
phenomena (all the really interesting phenomena seem to be such...life,
awareness, philosophy, politics, music, art, etc.).  Such phenomena must be
driven by characteristics (read laws) of complex systems.  

DNA is to them as metallurgists are to bullets, they are necessary as a first
step, but a whole additional level of structure and development is required.
It is like you're so thrilled about reaching first base, so proud of it, that
the concept of second, third and home doesn't seem necessary.

Respectfully,

Adrian

Hello all,

    Thought I would throw this question out.  Is it ethical to create
specially designed sentient beings which would be engineered to do specific
tasks?  Would it be ethical for their creators to profit from the labor of
their creations?  Esentially, we're talking about the possibility of a perfect
slave caste, willing and able to serve general purpose sentients (like us) in
whatever capacity we design them to.  What do you all think?

A few final words on the development or adoption of theologies consistent with
Extropianism.  The most important point is that you need to have the elements
of the theology consistant with or neutral with regards to the Principles of
Extropianism.  I would like to list the Principles from Max More's Extropian
Principles version 3.0 and see what they mean for a possible theology.

1)  Perpetual Progress - This eliminates any God or gods who would impose
limits on the growth of civilizations.  In fact, the theology should encourage
scholarship, innovation, discovery, and scientific advancement as sacred.

2)  Self - Transformation - This again eliminates theologies with jealous
God(s) who would forbid others from transcending to the highest levels of
ability as possible.  The theology should encourage its adherants to become
more and more God-like in ability and activity, not just "morality".  At the
extreme, you might want to see gods who are willing to Uplift anyone who
communicates a wish to be so aided.  Since I haven't seen any God or gods
offering this service at the current time, I would say that a theology would
have to state that Uplifting via a God or gods only occur under certain
conditions, most likely applicable in a future time period.  I realize
claiming that God offers this option only at some future date may seem like
the easy way out, but there is precedent for this sort of deferred action,
such as the hope that a mature nanotechnology can revive cryonicists or that
at some future date it will be possible to emulate all those who have existed
(or even could exist) based future computational abilities (such as in the
Omega Point theory).  

3)  Practical Optimism - This eliminates those theologies which see the future
as unredeemable, and those that foster complete dependence on a deity or
deities where all our needs will be met for us.  The theology should encourage
more of a "God(s) help those who help themselves" approach.  It may be
possible that at some time God(s) will be able and willing to give assistance,
but don't count on it.

4)  Intelligent Technology - This eliminates those theologies which see
technological innovation as "Against God's Will".  The theology should
advocate technology as a tool, which should be used to improve and transcend
the human condition, and might even encourage the use of technology to try to
make contact with or create deities.

5)  Open Society - This eliminates theologies revolving around "Authority" or
the "Status Quo".  The theology should foster the understanding and refinement
of personal conscience and a civil but non-intrusive society of individuals.
Innovations and new ideas should be welcomed and seriously considered, not
dismissed as "Heretical", even when they are about the theology itself.

6)  Self-Direction - This eliminates those theologies which impose a heirarchy
on individuals or demands blind obedience to "Authority" such as a holy book,
prophet, or even the direct pronouncements of a deity.  People should be
allowed to follow their conscience in their search for living a holy and
righteous life (however they might define it).  It should condemn those who
would enslave or subjegate other conscious beings.

7)  Rational Thinking - This eliminates those theologies which require that
people "simply have faith" and discourage doubt and questioning.  The theology
instead should advocate constant examination of itself and its premises for
internal consistency and good fit with the observed universe. It should be
robust and flexible enough to adapt as our knowledge of the Universe grows.
Even the existence of any deity or deities the theology predicts should be
open to doubt.  Basically such a theology to some degree would adopt an
agnostic approach which can make statements based on what its adherants
believe God(s) should be like, are likely to be like, and/or whether there
should be any god(s) at all, but is actively investigating whether these
deities actually exist or can possibly be created. 

If a theology is based on God(s) with an Extropian ethic, then it should be
possible to be both religious and transhumanist.  In fact, if there was an
intelligent agency responsible for the existence of the Universe capable of
supporting conscious independent beings, then such a being(s) could be
considered the Original Extropian(s), since what is a more extropian act than
creating a Universe.  Of course, if this were the case, then this agency
better have some pretty compelling reasons why they allowed so much Entropy in
the design specs.

Yes. I don;t see it as skirting, because I simply don't believe they have
"emerged". I think that they entirely reduce to their proximal cause(s) -
DNA or whatever. Nothing more is added from anywhere.

Metallurgists actions plus properties of alloys are a complete and total
explanation of bullet's. Bullets are a consequence of these two things and
to say the bullet "emerges" from them is redundant.

Often people will say some ethereal property (like wetness) emerges from
things (like hydrogen and oxygen joining to form water). They criticize
physicist's explanations of water for "leaving out the wetness", but, as
Daniel Dennett notes using exactly this example, that is the whole point.
Physical explanations do just that, they _explain_ the wetness - that is why
they leave it out.

Title
  Dietary fiber and colorectal cancer risk.
Source
  Epidemiology.  8(6):658-65, 1997 Nov.
Abstract
  We conducted a population-based case-control study among different ethnic
  groups in Hawaii to evaluate the role of various types and components of
  fiber, as well as micronutrients and foods of plant origin, on the risk of
  colorectal cancer. We administered personal interviews to
  698 male and 494 female Japanese, Caucasian, Filipino, Hawaiian, and Chinese
  cases diagnosed during 1987-1991 with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
  and to 1,192 population controls matched to cases by age, sex, and ethnicity.
  We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios, adjusted for
  caloric intake and other covariates. We found a strong, dose-dependent,
  inverse association in both sexes with fiber intake measured as crude fiber,
  dietary fiber, or nonstarch polysaccharides. We found inverse associations of
  similar magnitude for the soluble and insoluble fiber fractions and for
  cellulose and noncellulosic polysaccharides. This protective effect of fiber
  was limited to fiber from vegetable sources, with an odds ratio of 0.6 (95%
  confidence interval = 0.4-0.9) and 0.5 (95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.7)
  for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of intake for men and
  women, respectively. We found associations of the same magnitude for soluble
  and insoluble vegetable fiber, but no clear association with fiber from
  fruits or cereals. This pattern was consistent between sexes, across segments
  of the large bowel (right colon, left colon, and rectum), and among most
  ethnic groups. The effect of vegetable fiber may be independent of the
  effects of other phytochemicals, since the effect estimates remained
  unchanged after further adjustment for other nutrients. Intakes of
  carotenoids, light green vegetables, yellow-orange vegetables, broccoli,
  corn, carrots, bananas, garlic, and legumes (including soy
  products) were inversely associated with risk, even after adjustment for
  vegetable fiber. The data support a protective role of fiber from vegetables
  against colorectal cancer, which appears independent of its
  water solubility property and of the effects of other phytochemicals. The
  data also indicate that certain vegetables and fruits may be protective
  against this disease through mechanisms other than their fiber content.

Abstract
  A total of 281 male lung-cancer patients were identified
  from the hospital cancer registry in the Regional
  Cancer Centre in Trivandrum. The controls were selected from
  the visitors and patients' bystanders in the hospital. The recruitment of
  cases and controls started in 1990, and the present study used the cases
  registered in the first year. The questionnaire administered to cases and
  controls collected information on tobacco smoking and alcohol habits. Dietary
  data were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and were analyzed by
  multiple logistic regression producing odds ratio estimates of the relative
  risk and deviance chi-squared tests of significance. Analysis was done on the
  computer package, EGRET. All models included age, education, religion and
  smoking to adjust for the effect of confounding. Green vegetables and
  bananas were found to have a protective association with
  lung cancer. The odds ratio associated with the highest
  quartile of vegetable consumption compared with the lowest was 0.32 (95%
  confidence interval 0.13, 0.78). Forward stepwise regression analysis
  indicated pumpkins and onions as the most consistently significant protective
  factors. Animal protein foods and dairy products were found to have a
  predisposing effect on lung cancer in this study. The
  expected influence of smoking on lung cancer (a considerable
  increase in risk among smokers) provided evidence of the reliability of the
  data. In conclusion the results from this study show that diet has a role in
  lung cancer aetiology, although the association is weak
  compared to the effects of smoking.

  A case-control study of oral cancer in Beijing, People's

  29B(1):45-55, 1993 Jan.
Abstract
  A case-control study of oral cancer was conducted in
  Beijing, People's Republic of China to examine the association between
  dietary nutrient intake and risk of oral cancer, both in
  terms of estimated intake of nutrients and micro-nutrients, and in terms of
  specific foods and food groups. The study was hospital-based and controls
  were hospital in-patients matched for age and sex with the cases. The
  response rate for cases and controls was 100% and 404 case/control pairs were
  interviewed. The results suggest that increased protein and fat intake are
  related to a decreased risk of oral cancer. Carbohydrate
  intake, however, showed a moderate increased risk for oral
  cancer. Total carotene intake and carotene intake from
  fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with risk of oral
  cancer. A similar pattern was observed for dietary vitamin C
  intake. Dietary fibre derived from fruits and vegetables showed a strong
  negative association with oral cancer risk, but fibre
  derived from other sources did not exhibit any protective effect. At the
  level of foods and food groups, increased consumption of fresh meat, chicken
  and liver was significantly associated with a reduction in oral
  cancer risk: the tests for trend were all statistically
  significant at the P < 0.01 level. Consumption of common carp, hairtail,
  shrimp and lobster were also associated with decreased risk. Risk was found
  to increase with increasing consumption of millet and corn bread (P < 0.01)
  but to decrease with increasing consumption of rice (P < 0.01). Increased
  consumption of grapes, bananas, oranges, tangerines, peaches
  and pears were associated with reduced risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title
  Dietary, total body, and intracellular potassium-to-sodium ratios and their
  influence on cancer. [Review] [9 refs]
Source
  Cancer Detection & Prevention.  14(5):563-5, 1990.
Abstract
  One of the greatest changes in the human diet, a change that has occurred
  only within the past few thousand years, is the immense increase in the
  intake of sodium (Na) caused by use of table salt in the preparation and
  preservation of food. At the same time, man's intake of potassium (K) has
  decreased. The result is that from Paleolithic times to modern times the
  dietary K/Na ratio has been reduced by a factor of about 20. Based on a
  comparison of modern people in civilized areas with the primitive Yanomamo
  Indians in South America (who do not eat salt but who do grow and eat
  potassium-rich cooking bananas), this factor may even be on
  the order of 100 to 200. Humans, who initially had to adapt to retain sodium
  from a sodium-poor diet and to excrete potassium from a potassium-rich diet,
  have not yet evolutionarily adapted to today's high-sodium, low-potassium
  diet. This failure has caused increased rates of a number of diseases in
  civilized man, among them cancer. The influence of the K/Na
  ratio on cancer development--first discovered by
  epidemiologic studies--has been confirmed by various means, such as dietary
  studies, gerontological studies, studies of relationships between hyper- and
  hypokalemic diseases and cancer, and review of the cellular
  changes of this ratio induced by carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic agents.
  Recently, animal experiments have also confirmed the results. The recommended
  dietary K/Na ratio should be well above 1, preferably 5 or higher, and the
  cellular K/Na ratio should be above 10. [References: 9]

Fabulous, Glen.  I think my theology fits.  Check it out;



The Way of the Cosmic Chain of Being of
The Church of the Modern Era

      Beliefs:

1. There is a  Cosmic Chain of Being that runs from the beginning of time in
our Universe through the stars, the planets, blue green algae, the early
hominids,  Mitochondrial Eve,  Agamemnon,  the Buddha, Confucius,  Zoroaster,
Moses, Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Jesus Christ, Mohammad, Galileo, Newton,
Darwin, Einstein, Tipler, our ancestors, us, our descendents, successors and
beings on other planets to God/ Allah/ Jehova/ Wotan/ Zeus/ The Great Spirit/
etc.

2. At some point in the future, our  progeny will develop understanding and
control of  biology;  matter and energy;  time and space.  These omniscient
descendents of ours will be/are and were God.

3. There is Good and Evil in this Universe and we must see that Good triumphs.
That which is not Evil is either Good or Bad.  That which isn't Evil or Bad is
Good.  Violent crimes are Evil.  Property crimes arte Bad.  Bad actions can be
forgiven after confession and proper restitution.  Evil actions require
removal from society.

4. Using then available technology and data in the light cone and other
sources, God will have the technology to bring us back to life and reunite us
with our loved ones in Virtual Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, Paradise, The Happy
Hunting Ground, Nirvanna, Valhala, etc.  The CME will manage this project..	

5. We are all equal before God, but we are each unique.

Moral Laws:
	
1- We must protect Good, defeat Evil and punish Bad. 

2- We must avoid and reject causing  harm to ourselves or others unless in
defense of the Good.  If possible, non lethal means must be used in this
defense

3- Since envy and intollerence are the most powerful tools of Evil, we must
avoid and reject envy and intollerence.

4- Since we can only see what we're looking at, we must respect others' points
of view.

Sacred Duties:

1- As ancestors and children of God, it is our First Sacred Duty to perfect
ourselves, our families and our species to be worthy of this gift and to
wisely guide the Cosmic Chain of Being (Targeted Selection ).

2- We must love, honor and respect our parents, spouse(s), children, ancestors
and descendents.

3- We must respect, and maturely help all Human Beings as the cousins they
are.

4- We must strive to understand the structure and properties of this Universe
and all in it.

5- We must especially honor all the Saints of our Church, including:
	those who served or died in the defense of Good and defeat of Evil,
	those who devote their lives to the advancement of knowledge and morality,
	those who govern according to the Moral Laws and Sacred  Duties,
	those who are good spouses and good parents and,
	those who create the *Sacred Writings.

*Sacred Writings are all books and other media that follow the Moral Laws and
promote Sacred Duties.

Other Religions:

We recognize and honor most other religions as vital steps integral to the
Cosmic Chain of Being.  In fact, since our successors will design the
afterlife, we will fulfil the promises of those religions by creating Valhala
for old vikings, a Warriors Paradise for Muslims, Nirvanna for Buddhists,
Heaven, Purgatory and Hell for Catholics,  The Happy Hunting Ground, Spirit
World, etc.

No intelligent self aware creature should be a slave to anyone. The only
relationship that a creator can have with his creations is that of the parent to
child, and only for a period of time sufficient for the creation to mature to a
mental/emotional/logical state of 'adulthood', at which time, the creation is a
fully free individual. Forced child labor is abhorrent. You could engineer
creatures who will be suited to and will find enjoyment in specific tasks, and
their knowledge that that is what their genetic predispostion is may help many of
them adjust to such a specified life more easily than current humans, but they
must ultimately be free to choose if that is the life they wish to lead, and only
for their own benefit, not for the benefit of others.

The only reason one individual should create another individual is because the
first finds joy in creating, educating, and raising to 'adulthood' a free
individual. Any motives based on concepts of ownership of other individuals are
against Natural Law.

Makes sense. What about putting some shortened version of this

Like Ronald Reagan, much of my life appears to be remembered through movies
;-)

Check out Sigourney Weaver in "Alien Resurrection" and then let us know what
you all think. There is one scene (without spoiling the movie) that really
made me rethink notions of cloning etc: It doesn't always work out
perfectly.

Anyhow, my vote is that creating a slave is slavery and I oppose it. Even if
they don't. I also believe that free thought necessarily entails a desire
for freedom, so I hold the thought experiment of sentient being who loves
slavery to be null.

I suggest you quote your sources for this claim of yours.

1. How do you compute the probability for the existence of a god?
2. Why do you postulate a old-time fascist god?

Jack Vance, in a SF novel (either THE DRAGONMASTERS or THE LAST CASTLE, I forget which) treated the topic of genetic warfare, where each race (there were two very dissimilar ones) created troops designed to serve different war functions from the DNA of their POWs; thus engineered race A soldiers were fighting for race B against soldiers of race B engineered by race A.  The irony is that the side with the most flexible genome lost, because it was turned against them.
