Hoooboy, the human who could safely fly that would be one steely eyed

Only to the same mathematicians who gave us propositional logic.  I
mean, it sounds circular in theory, but in practice, it doesn't work
that way, for a very simple reason which, unfortunately, doesn't
translate into English without a blackboard.  What I'd like to say is
that the AI is reductive and the elements present obvious
suboptimization metrics, and that the elements sum to noncodic abilities
as well as codic abilities, so codic optimization is non-sterile.

Okay, try this.  The AI isn't composed of a single, "code-optimizing"
domdule, right?  It's composed of a causal analysis module and a
combinatorial design module and a heuristic soup module and so on. 
These architectural modules, plus analogies to other application
domdules, plus the codic domdule, all sum to the "code-optimizing"
ability.  In a given optimization problem, you have subproblems that are
spread across the domdules.  The performance on the subproblems, and the
contribution of individual domdules to the success on subproblems, allow
for local optimization.  

No, I'm still being too complex.  Remember EURISKO?  It had heuristics
optimizing heuristics?  There were even heuristics being optimized to be
better heuristic-optimizers?  It wasn't sterile.  Why?  Because the
heuristics were also being optimized for all sorts of other problems. 
And, more importantly, because "Examine nearby cases" being applied to
"Investigate extreme cases" to yield "Investigate cases close to
extremes" is a lot more specific than "optimize heuristics for
heuristic-optimizing".  The general case sounds sterile and circular
because it's monolithic and general.  But in actuality, you have
sub-abilities dealing with subproblems.

You don't even need any other kinds of problems at all.  The subproblems
of the general problem of self-optimization provide enough diversity to
prevent the circularity you're worried about.  The major reason for
programming other environments would be to provide sources of analogies
and incremental paths to ideas that would bottleneck otherwise - the
same reason a hacker learns languages ve'll never program in.  But it's
not *necessary*.

BTW - the surrealism involved in saying "Stop holding on to the past" to
a Singularitarian is considerably larger than that involved in saying it
to a 19-year-old.

I have done quite a bit of experimentation with sleep (which I view to be a
relatively inefficient process) and have only found two things that really
seem to work on a regular basis: exercise and melatonin.  In my experience,
both of these increase the quality and reduce the duration of my sleep.  

My personal figures for restful sleep:

Uninterrupted, without melatonin/exercise:  8-10 hours
Uninterrupted, with melatonin/exercise:  6-8 hours
Sustainable interrupted, without melatonin/exercise:  6-8 hours
Sustainable interrupted, with melatonin/exercise:  5-6 hours

I save about two hours on average and can get by without significant
performance degradation on about 5 hours of sleep if I get adequate levels
of exercise and melatonin (3-6mg).  I imagine this varies widely for
different individuals; I've known people who only needed 3-4 hours of sleep
a night without any external aid.

Yep.  You've got people buying a stock because they think other people
will buy the stock because other people... it doesn't ground.  You've
got massive, volatile, pointless movements materializing out of nowhere.
 What I'm saying is that people who want to bet on stocks should bet on
stocks, and people who want to give money to people who can use it to
make more money, should give money to people who can use it to make more
money.  The "growth stock" is a cruel joke that will eventually be the
downfall of Western Civilization if Zyvex and I don't get to it first. 
You can quote me on it.

A high-computing-power capitalist economy can get along perfectly fine
even if there is no stock market whatsoever.  I give money to someone,
they use it to build a new manufacturing plant, and in exchange I get a
percentage of the dividends from that plant - that's my "stock".  When
the manufacturing plant shuts down, the dividends stop.  If they managed
to generate enough revenue, I make a profit.  If not, not.  No
information loss, and when I want my money to make money, I actually
give it to people who will use it to make money, not to the previous
investor who buys a speedboat.

In practice, you would quickly get a market in stocks, and people would
buy stocks from one another based on how they think the future is going
to work out, and eventually you would get people buying "growth stocks"
again.  I'm just pointing out that shuttling all the day traders into
actual casinos isn't going to hurt the economy.  Nor would creating an
enormously higher rate of actual capital investment (so that the money
now flooding into the stock market would go to buy actual machinery
instead of speedboats) kill the market by flooding it with new stocks.

In other words, there are three elements in the modern market:

1)  The person with money, who wants to turn that money into more money,
by giving it to someone who will produce wealth.  Presently filled by
venture capitalists.

2)  The person who thinks he sees a piece of property, such as the right
to receive a certain percentage of dividends, which is undervalued. 
Presently filled by small investors.

3)  People who think they know which way the market will go and are
willing to bet on it.  Presently filled by day traders.

Right now, the stock market is a mess.  The first problem is that most
small investors want to do (1), a positive-sum game, but are stuck with
(2), a zero-sum game; and the second problem is that the people doing
(3), a _highly volatile_, mathematically chaotic zero-sum game, are
forced to buy actual stocks in the same market as (1) and (2).

What we need is, (a) actual market-gambling casinos; (b) some way for
small guys to join venture-capital cooperatives.  That'll go a *long*
way towards untangling the unholy mess.

I'm not suggesting any form of government mandate; I think that the
natural efficiencies of doing The Right Thing will attract people into
separate markets along the lines I suggest.  If said markets were legal
and available.

Once again:  Almost all really complicated economic problems are the
results of combining multiple functions into a monolithic object.

(From Michael Moorcock's "The Opium General" Harrap (1984), reprinted from
Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review 1978)

There are still a few things which bring a naive sense of shocked
astonishment to me whenever I experience them -- a church service in which
the rituals of Dark Age superstition are performed without any apparent
sense of incongruity in the participants -- a fat Soviet bureaucrat
pontificating about bourgeois decadence -- a radical singing the praises of
Robert Heinlein. If I were sitting in a tube train and all the people
opposite me were reading Mein Kampf with obvious enjoyment and approval it
probably wouldn't disturb me much more than if they were reading Heinlein,
Tolkein or Richard Adams. All this visionary fiction seems to me to have a
great deal in common. Utopian fiction has been predominantly reactionary in
one form or another (as well as being predominantly dull) since it began.
Most of it warns the world of 'decadence' in its contemporaries and the
alternatives are usually authoritarian and sweeping -- not to say
simple-minded. A look at the books on sale to Cienfuegos customers shows the
same old list of Lovecraft and Rand, Heinlein and Niven, beloved of so many
people who would be horrified to be accused of subscribing to the Daily
Telegraph or belonging to the Monday Club and yet are reading with every
sign of satisfaction views by writers who would make Telegraph editorials
look like the work of Bakunin and Monday Club members sound like spokesmen
for the Paris Commune.

Some years ago I remember reading an article by John Pilgrim in Anarchy in
which he claimed Robert Heinlein as a revolutionary leftist writer. As a
result of this article I could not for years bring myself to buy another
issue. I'd been confused in the past by listening to hardline Communists
offering views that were somewhat at odds with their anti-authoritarian
claims, but I'd never expected to hear similar things from anarchists. My
experience of science fiction fans at the conventions which are held
annually in a number of countries (mainly the US and England) had taught me
that those who attended were reactionary (claiming to be 'apolitical' but
somehow always happy to vote Tory and believe Colin Jordan to 'have a
point'). I always assumed these were for one reason or another the
exceptions among sf enthusiasts. Then the underground papers began to emerge
and I found myself in sympathy with most of their attitudes -- but once
again I saw the old arguments aired: Tolkein, C. S. Lewis, Frank Herbert,
Isaac Asimov and the rest, bourgeois reactionaries to a man, Christian
apologists, crypto-Stalinists, were being praised in IT, Frendz and Oz and
everywhere else by people whose general political ideals I thought I shared.
I started writing about what I thought was the implicit authoritarianism of
these authors and as often as not found myself accused of being reactionary,
elitist or at very best a spoilsport who couldn't enjoy good sf for its own
sake. But here I am again at Stuart Christie's request, to present arguments
which I have presented more than once before.

During the sixties, in common with many other periodicals, our New Worlds
believed in revolution. Our emphasis was on fiction, the arts and sciences,
because it was what we knew best. We attacked and were in turn attacked in
the all-to-familiar rituals. Smiths refused to continue distributing the
magazine unless we 'toned down' our contents. We refused. We were, they
said, obscene, blasphemous, nihilistic etc., etc. The Daily Express attacked
us. A Tory asked a question about us in the House of Commons -- why was
public money (a small Arts Council grant) being spent on such filth. I
recount all this not merely to establish what we were prepared to do to
maintain our policies (we were eventually wiped out by Smiths and Menzies)
but to point out that we were the only sf magazine to pursue what you might
call a determinedly radical approach -- and sf buffs were the first to
attack us with genuine vehemence. Our main serial running at the height of
our troubles was called Bug Jack Barron written by Norman Spinrad, who had
taken an active part in radical politics in the US and used his story to
display the abuse of democracy and the media in America. He later went on to
write a satirical sword-and-sorcery epic, The Iron Dream, intended to
display the fascist elements inherent to the form. The author of this novel
existed, as it were, in an alternate history to our own. His name was Adolf
Hitler. The book was meant to point up the number of sf authors who were, in
a sense, 'unsuccessful Hitlers'.

Many Americans came to use NW as a vehicle because they couldn't get their
stories published in the US. Thomas M. Disch, John Sladek, Harvey Jacobs,
Harlan Ellison and others published a good deal of their best and at the
time most controversial work in NW -- and Heinlein fans actually attacked us
for 'destroying' science fiction. Escapism this form might be, but it posed
as a 'literature of ideas' and that, we contended, it wasn't -- unless The
Green Berets was a profoundly philosophical movie.

Another example: in 1967 Judith Merril, a founder member of The Science
Fiction Writers of America, an ex-Trotskyist turned libertarian, proposed
that ' this Organisation would buy advertising space in the sf magazines
condemning the war in Vietnam. I was around when this was proposed. A good
number of members agreed with alacrity -- including English members like
myself, John Brunner, Brian Aldiss, Robert Silverberg and Harry Harrison
were keen, as were Harlan Ellison, James Blish and, to be fair, Frank
Herbert and Larry Niven. But quite as many were outraged by the idea, saying
that the SFWA 'shouldn't interfere in politics.' Okay, said Merril, then
let's say 'The following members of the SFWA condemn American involvement in
the Vietnam War etc.' Finally the sf magazines contained two ads -- one
against the war and one in support of American involvement. Those in support
included Poul Anderson, Robert Heinlein, Ann MaCaffrey, Daniel F. Galouye,
Keith Laumer and as many other popular sf writers as were against the war.
The interesting thing was that at the time many of the pro-US-involvement
writers were (and by and large still are) the most popular sf writers in the
English-speaking world, let alone Japan, the Soviet Union, France, Germany,
Italy and Spain, where a good many sf readers think of themselves as
radicals. One or two of these writers (British as well as American) are dear
friends of mine who are personally kindly and courageous people of
considerable integrity -- but their political statements (if not always, by
any means, their actions) are stomach-turning! Most people have to be judged
by their actions rather than their remarks, which are often surprisingly at
odds. Writers, when they are writing, can only be judged on the substance of
their work. The majority of the sf writers most popular with radicals are by
and large crypto-fascists to a man and woman! There is Lovecraft, the
misogynic racist; there is Heinlein, the authoritarian militarist; there is
Ayn Rand, the rabid opponent of trade unionism and the left, who, like many
a reactionary before her, sees the problems of the world as a failure by
capitalists to assume the responsibilities of 'good leadership'; there is
Tolkein and that group of middle-class Christian fantasists who constantly
sing the praises of bourgeois virtues and whose villains are thinly
disguised working class agitators -- fear of the Mob permeates their rural
romances. To all these and more the working class is a mindless beast which
must be controlled or it will savage the world (i.e. bourgeois security) --
the answer is always leadership, 'decency', paternalism (Heinlein in
particularly strong on this), Christian values...

What can this stuff have in common with radicals of any persuasion? The
simple answer is, perhaps, Romance. The dividing line between rightist
Romance (Nazi insignia and myth etc.) and leftist Romance (insurgent cavalry
etc.) is not always easy to determine. A stirring image is a stirring image
and can be ,employed to raise all sorts of atavistic or infantile emotions
in us. Escapist or 'genre' fiction appeals to these emotions. It does us no
harm to escape from time to time but it can be dangerous to confuse
simplified fiction with reality and that, of course, is what propaganda
does.

The bandit hero -- the underdog rebel -- so frequently becomes the political
tyrant; and we are perpetually astonished! Such figures appeal to our
infantile selves -- what is harmful about them in real life is that they are
usually immature, without self-discipline, frequently surviving on their
'charm'. Fiction lets them stay, like Zorro or Robin Hood, perpetually
charming. In reality they become petulant, childish, relying on a mixture of
threats and self-pitying pleading, like any baby. These are too often the
revolutionary figures on whom we pin our hopes, to whom we sometimes commit
our lives and whom we sometimes try to be; because we fail to distinguish
fact from fiction. In reality it is too often the small, fanatical men with
the faces and stance of neurotic clerks who come to power while the
charismatic heroes, if they are lucky, die gloriously, leaving us to
discover that while we have been following them, imitating them, a new Tsar
has manipulated himself into the position of power and Terror has returned
with a vengeance while we have been using all our energies living a romantic
lie. Heroes betray us. By having them, in real life, we betray ourselves.
The heroes of Heinlein and Ayn Rand are forever competent, forever right:
they are oracles and protectors, magic parents (so long as we obey their
rules). They are prepared to accept the responsibilities we would rather not
bear. They are 'leaders'. Traditional sf is hero fiction on a huge scale,
but it is only when it poses as a fiction of ideas that it becomes
completely pernicious. At its most spectacular it gives us Charlie Manson
and Scientology (invented by the sf writer Ron Hubbard and an authoritarian
system to rival the Pope's). To enjoy it is one thing. To claim it as
'radical' is quite another. It is rather unimaginative; it is usually badly
written; its characters are ciphers; its propaganda is simple-minded and
conservative -- good old-fashioned opium which might be specifically
designed for dealing with the potential revolutionary.

In a writer like Lovecraft a terror of sex often combines (or is confused
for) a terror of the masses, the 'ugly' crowd. But this is so common to so
much 'horror' fiction that it's hardly worth discussing. Lovecraft is
morbid. His work equates to that negative romanticism found in much Nazi
art. He was a confused anti-Semite and misanthrope, a promoter of
anti-rationalist ideas about racial 'instinct' which have much in common
with Mein Kampf. A dedicated supporter of 'Aryanism', a hater of women, he
wound up marrying a Jewess (which might or might not have been a sign of
hope -- we haven't her view of the matter)Lovecraft appeals to us primarily
when we are ourselves feeling morbid. Apart from his offensively awful
writing and a resultant inability to describe his horrors (leaving us to do
the work -- the secret of his success -- we're all better writers than he
is!) he is rarely as frightening, by implication, as most of the other
highly popular writers whose concerns are not with 'meeping Things' but with
idealised versions of society. It's not such a big step, for instance from
Farnham's Freehold to Hitler's Lebensraum.

I must admit I'm not following a properly argued critical line. I'm arguing
on the assumption that my readers are at least familiar with some of the
books and authors I mention. I attack these books because they are the
favourite reading of so many radicals. I attack the books not for their
superficial fascination with quasi-medieval social systems (a la Frank
Herbert). Fiction about kings and queens is not necessarily royalist fiction
any more than fiction about anarchists is likely to be libertarian fiction.
As a writer I have produced a good many fantastic romances in which kings
and queens, lords and ladies, figure largely -- yet I am an avowed
anti-monarchist. Catch 22 never seemed to me to be in favour of militarism.
And just because many of Heinlein's characters are soldiers or ex-soldiers I
don't automatically assume he must therefore be in favour of war. It depends
what use you make of such characters in a story and what, in the final
analysis, you are saying.

Jules Verne in The Masterless Man put some pretty decent sentiments in the
mouth of Kaw-djer the anarchist and his best characters, like Captain Nemo,
are embittered 'rebels' who have retreated from society. Even the aerial
anarchists of The Angel of the Revolution by George Griffiths have something
to be said for them, for all their inherent authoritarianism, but they are
essentially romantic 'outlaws' and the views they express are not
sophisticated even by the standards of the 1890s.

H.G. Wells was no more the 'father' of science fiction than Jules Verne. He
inherited a tradition going back some thirty or forty years in the form he
himself used and several centuries in the form of the Utopian romance. What
was unusual about Wells, however, is that he was one of the first radicals
of his time to take the trappings of the scientific romance and combine them
with powerful and telling images to make Bunyanesque allegories like The
Time Machine or The Invisible Man. Wells didn't have his characters talking
socialism. He showed the results of capitalism, authoritarianism,
superstition and other evils and because he was a far better writer than
most of those who have ever written sf before or since he made his points
with considerable clarity. Morris had been long-winded and backward-looking.
Wells took the techniques of Kipling and preached his own brand of
socialism. Until Wells -- the most talented, original and intelligent writer
of his kind -- almost all sf had devoted itself to attacks on 'decadence'
and military unpreparedness, urging our leaders to take a stronger moral
line and our armies to re-equip and get better officers. By and large this
was the tone of much of the sf which followed Wells, from Kipling's
effective but reactionary With the Night Mail and As Easy as ABC
(paternalistic aerial controllers whose rays pacify 'the mob') to stories by
John Buchan, Michael Arlen, William Le Quex, E. Phillips Oppenheim and
hundreds of others who predominantly were following Kipling in warning us of
the dangers of socialism, mixed marriages, free love, anarchist plots,
Zionist conspiracies, the yellow peril and so on and so on. Even Jack London
wasn't what one might call an all-round libertarian any more than Wells was
when he toyed with his ideas of an elite corps of 'samurai' who were
actually not a great deal different to how Soviet Communist Party members
saw themselves, or were described in official fiction and propaganda. The
quasi-religious nature of sf (which I describe in a collection of pre-WWI sf
Before Armageddon) was producing on the whole quasi-religious substitutes (a
variety of authoritarian socialist and fascist theories). A few attacked the
theories of the emerging dictators (Murray Constantine's Swastika Night,
1937, seemed to think Christianity could conquer Hitler but is otherwise a
pretty incisive projection of Nazism several hundred years in the future).
By and large the world we got in the thirties was the world the sf writers
of the day hoped we would have -- 'strong leaders' reshaping nations. The
reality of these hero-leaders was not, of course, entirely what had been
visualised -- Nuremberg rallies and Strength Through Joy, perhaps -- but
Kristellnacht and gas ovens seemed to go a bit too far.

At least the American pulp magazines like Amazing Stories and Thrilling
Wonder Stories were not, by and large, offering us high-profile
'leadership': just the good old-fashioned mixture of implicit
racialism/militarism/nationalism/paternalism carried a few hundred years
into the future or a few million light years into space (E. E. Smith remains
to this day one of the most popular writers of that era). John W. Campbell,
who in the late thirties took over Astounding Science Fiction Stories and
created what many believe to be a major revolution in the development of sf,
was the chief creator of the school known to buffs as 'Golden Age' sf and
written by the likes of Heinlein, Asimov and A.E. Van Vogt wild-eyed
paternalists to a man, fierce anti-socialists, whose work reflected the
deep-seated conservatism of the majority of their readers, who saw a
Bolshevik menace in every union meeting. They believed, in common with
authoritarians everywhere, that radicals wanted to take over old-fashioned
political power, turn the world into a uniform mass of 'workers' with
themselves (the radicals) as commissars. They offered us such visions, when
they attempted any overt discussion of politics at all. They were about as
left-wing as The National Enquirer or The Saturday Evening Post (where their
stories occasionally were to appear). They were xenophobic, smug and
confident that the capitalist system would flourish throughout the universe,
though they were, of course, against dictators and the worst sort of
exploiters (no longer Jews but often still 'aliens'). Rugged individualism
was the most sophisticated political concept they could manage -- in the
pulp tradition, the Code of the West became the Code of the Space Frontier,
and a spaceship captain had to do what a spaceship captain had to do...

The war helped. It provided character types and a good deal of
authoritative-sounding technological terms which could be applied to
scientific hardware and social problems alike and sounded reassuringly
'expert'. Those chaps had the tone of Vietnam twenty years earlier. Indeed,
it's often been shown that sf supplied a lot of the vocabulary and
atmosphere for American military and space technology (a 'Waldo' handling
machine is a name taken straight from a Heinlein story). Astounding became
full of crew-cut wisecracking, cigar-chewing, competent guys (like
Campbell's image of himself). But Campbell and his writers (and they
considered themselves something of a unified team) were not producing
Westerns. They claimed to be producing a fiction of ideas. These competent
guys were suggesting how the world should be run. By the early fifties
Astounding had turned by almost anyone's standard into a crypto-fascist
deeply philistine magazine pretending to intellectualism and offering
idealistic kids an 'alternative' that was, of course, no alternative at all.
Through the fifties Campbell used his whole magazine as propaganda for the
ideas he promoted in his editorials. His writers, by and large, were
enthusiastic. Those who were not fell away from him, disturbed by his
increasingly messianic disposition (Alfred Bester gives a good account of
this). Over the years Campbell promoted the mystical, quasi-scientific
Scientology (first proposed by one of his regular writers L. Ron Hubbard and
aired for the first time in Astounding as 'Dianetics: The New Science of the
Mind'), a perpetual motion machine known as the 'Dean Drive', a series of
plans to ensure that the highways weren't 'abused', and dozens of other
half-baked notions, all in the context of cold-war thinking. He also, when
faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went
on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed.
I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee
when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to
their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the
anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of
self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was
fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs
of Los Angeles! I was speechless (actually I said four words in all --
'science-fiction' -- 'psychology' -- Jesus Christ!'- before I collapsed),
leaving John Brunner to perform a cool demolition of Campbell's arguments,
which left the editor calling on God in support of his views -- an
experience rather more intense for me than watching Doctor Strangelove at
the cinema.

Starship Troopers (serialised in Astounding as was most of Heinlein's
fiction until the early sixties) was probably Heinlein's last 'straight' sf
serial for Campbell before he began his 'serious' books such as Farnham's
Freehold and Stranger in a Strange Land -- taking the simplified characters
of genre fiction and producing some of the most ludicrously unlikely people
ever to appear in print. In Starship Troopers we find a slightly rebellious
cadet gradually learning that wars are inevitable, that the army is always
right, that his duty is to obey the rules and protect the human race against
the alien menace. It is pure debased Ford out of Kipling and it set the
pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic (but equally
sentimental) stories which became for me steadily more hilarious until I
realised with some surprise that people were taking them as seriously as
they had taken, say, Atlas Shrugged a generation before -- in hundreds of
thousands! That middle-America could regard such stuff as 'radical' was easy
enough to understand. I kept finding that supporters of the Angry Brigade
were enthusiastic about Heinlein, that people with whom I thought I shared
libertarian principles were getting off on every paternalistic, bourgeois
writer who had ever given me the creeps! I still can't fully understand it.
Certainly I can't doubt the sincerity of their idealism. But how does it
equate with their celebration of writers like Tolkein and Heinlein? The clue
could be in the very vagueness of the prose, which allows for liberal
interpretation; it could be that the ciphers they use instead of characters
are capable of suggesting a wholly different meaning to certain readers. To
me, their naive and emblematic reading of society is fundamentally
misanthropic and therefore anti-libertarian. We are faced, once again, with
quasi-religion, presented to us as radicalism. At best it is the philosophy
of the Western applied to the complex social problems of the twentieth
century -- it is Reaganism, it is John Wayne in Big John Maclean and The
Green Berets, it is George Wallace and Joe McCarthy -- at its most refined
it is William F. Buckley Jr., who, already a long way more sophisticated
than Heinlein, is still pretty simple-minded.

Rugged individualism also goes hand in hand with a strong faith in
paternalism -- albeit a tolerant and somewhat distant paternalism -- and
many otherwise sharp-witted libertarians seem to see nothing in the morality
of a John Wayne Western to conflict with their views. Heinlein's paternalism
is at heart the same as Wayne's. In the final analysis it is a kind of
easy-going militarism favoured by the veteran professional soldier -- the
chain of command is complex -- many adult responsibilities can be left to
that chain as long as broad, but firmly enforced, rules from 'high up' are
adhered to. Heinlein is Eisenhower Man and his views seem to me to be more
pernicious than ordinary infantile back-to-the-land Christian communism,
with its mysticism and its hatred of technology. To be an anarchist, surely,
is to reject authority but to accept self-discipline and community
responsibility. To be a rugged individualist a la Heinlein and others is to
be forever a child who must obey, charm and cajole to be tolerated by some
benign, omniscient father: Rooster Coburn shuffling his feet in front of a
judge he respects for his office (but not necessarily himself) in True Grit.

An anarchist is not a wild child, but a mature, realistic adult imposing
laws upon the self and modifying them according to an experience of life, an
interpretation of the world. A 'rebel', certainly, he or she does not assume
'rebellious charm' in order to placate authority (which is what the rebel
heroes of all these genre stories do). There always comes the depressing
point where Robin Hood doffs a respectful cap to King Richard, having
clobbered the rival king. This sort of implicit paternalism is seen in high
relief in the currently popular Star Wars series which also presents a
somewhat disturbing anti-rationalism in its quasi-religious 'Force' which
unites the Jedi Knights (are we back to Wellsian 'samurai' again?) and upon
whose power they can draw, like some holy brotherhood, some band of Knights
Templar. Star Wars is a pure example of the genre (in that it is a
compendium of other people's ideas) in its implicit structure --
quasi-children, fighting for a paternalistic authority, win through in the
end and stand bashfully before the princess while medals are placed around
their necks.

Star Wars carries the paternalistic messages of almost all generic adventure
fiction (may the Force never arrive on your doorstep at three o'clock in the
morning) and has all the right characters. it raises 'instinct' above reason
(a fundamental to Nazi doctrine) and promotes a kind of sentimental
romanticism attractive to the young and idealistic while protective of
existing institutions. It is the essence of a genre that it continues to
promote certain implicit ideas even if the author is unconscious of them. In
this case the audience also seems frequently unconscious of them.

It was Alfred Bester who first attracted me to science fiction. I'd read
some fantasy and Edgar Rice Burroughs before that, but I thought that if The
Stars My Destination (also called Tiger! Tiger!) was sf, then this was the
fiction for me. It took me some years to realise that Bester was one of the
few exceptions. At the ending of The Stars My Destination the self-educated,
working class, 'scum of the spaceways', Gully Foyle, comes into possession
of the substance known as PyrE, capable of detonating at a thought and
probably destroying the solar system at very least. The plot has revolved
around the attempts of various powerful people to get hold of the stuff.
Foyle has it. Moral arguments or forceful persuasions are brought against
him to make him give PyrE up to a 'responsible' agency. In the end he
scatters the stuff to 'the mob' of the solar system. Here you are, he says,
it's yours. Its your destiny. Do with it how you see fit.

This is one of the very, very few 'libertarian' sf novels I have ever read.
If I hadn't read it, I very much doubt I should have read any more sf. It's
a wonderful adventure story. It has a hero developing from a completely
stupefied, illiterate hand on a spaceship to a brilliant and mature
individual taking his revenge first on those who have harmed him and then
gradually developing what you might call a 'political conscience.' I know of
no other sf book which so thoroughly combines romance with an idealism
almost wholly acceptable to me. It is probably significant that it enjoys a
relatively small success compared to, say, Stranger in a Strange Land.

Leaving aside the very worthy but to my mind journalistic The Dispossessed
by U.K. Le Guin, it is quite hard for me to find many other examples of sf
books which, as it were, 'promote' libertarian ideas. M. John Harrison is an
anarchist. His books are full of anarchists -- some of them very bizarre
like the anarchist aesthetes of The Centauri Device. Typical of the New
Worlds school he could be described as an existential anarchist. There is
Brian Aldiss with his Barefoot in the Head vision of an LSD 'bombed' Europe
almost totally liberated and developing bizarre new customs. There are J. G.
Ballard's 'terminal ironies' such as The Atrocity Exhibition and Crash and
so on, which have brought criticisms of 'nihilism' against him. There is
Joanna Russ's marvellous The Female Man. So little sf has fundamental
humanitarian values, let alone libertarian ideals, one is hard put to find
other examples. My own taste, I suppose, is sometimes at odds with my
political views. I admire Barrington J. Bayley, whose stories are often
extremely abstract. One of his most enjoyable books recently published is
The Soul of the Robot which discusses the nature of individual identity.
Charles L. Harness is another favourite of mine. The Rose, in particular,
lacks the simplifications of most sf, and The Paradox Men with its sense of
the nature of Time, its thief hero, its ironic references to America
Imperial, is highly entertaining. I also have a soft spot for C. M.
Kornbluth who to my mind had a rather stronger political conscience than he
allowed himself, so that his stories are sometimes confused as he tried to
mesh middle-American ideas with his own radicalism. One of my favourites
(though structurally it is a bit weak) is The Syndic (about a society where
a rather benign Mafia is paramount). Fritz Leiber is probably the best of
the older American sf writers for his prose-style, his wit and his humanity,
as well as his abiding contempt for authoritarianism. His Gather, Darkness
is one of the best sf books to relate political power to religious power
(this was also serialised in Astounding during the forties . John Brunner,
author of the CND marching song 'H-Bomb's Thunder', often writes from a
distinctly socialist point of view. Harlan Ellison, who for some time had
associations with a New York street gang and who has identified himself for
many years with radicalism in the US, writes many short stories whose heroes
have no truck with authority of any sort, though the conventions of the
genre sometimes get in the way of the essential messages of his stories.
This has to be true of most genre fiction. Ellison's best work is written
outside the sf genre. Philip K. Dick, John Sladek, Thomas M.Disch, Joanna
Russ...

To my mind one of the best examples of imaginative fiction to ear in England
since the war is Maurice Richardson's The Exploits of Engelbrecht, written
in the forties and recently republished by John Conquest (available from him
at Compendium Books). These 'Chronicles of the Surrealist Sportman's Club'
are superbly laconic pieces, concentrating more original invention into
fewer words than almost any writer I can think of. They outshine, for me,
almost anything else remotely like them, including the stories of Borges and
other much admired imaginative writers. Richardson goes swiftly from one
idea to the next, using a beautifully disciplined prose. He has the
advantage of being a great ironist and I find that more palatable. Such a
style can become one of the most convincing weapons in the literary arsenal
and it often astonishes me how cleverly Kipling influenced generations of
writers by disguising his authoritarian notions in that superb
matter-of-fact, faintly ironic prose. Many writers, not necessarily of
Kipling's views, have used it since. We find a debased version of it in the
right-wing thrillers and sf novels of our own day. It is probably this
'tone' (employed to suggest the writer's basic decency and commonsense)
which enables many people to accept ideas which, couched differently, would
revolt them. Yet what Heinlein or Tolkein lack is any trace of real
self-mockery. They are nature's urbane Tories. They'll put an arm round your
shoulder and tell you their ideas are quite radical too, really; that they
used to be fire-eaters in their youth; that there are different ways of
achieving social change; that you must be realistic and pragmatic. Next time
you pick up a Heinlein book think of the author as looking a bit like
General Eisenhower or, if that image isn't immediate enough, some chap in
early middleage, good-looking in a slightly soft way, with silver at the
temples, a blue tie, a sober three-pieced suit, telling you with a quiet
smile that Margaret Thatcher cares for individualism and opportunity above
all things, as passionately in her way as you do in yours. And then you
might have some idea of what you're actually about to read.

First, there are the 'preferences settings' like the body weight
setpoint and hormone levels that would be useful to be able to
control. Then there are the various behavior systems: the fight or
flight response ("Do you really want to become angry? (Y/N)"), sexual
behavior (including preferences and drive) and of course diurnal
rhythm. In neighboring midbrain areas there are stuff like anxiety
(bed nucleus of stria terminalis), fear (amygdala) and pain control
(periaqueductal grey), as well as the really exciting/dangerous stuff
in the basal forebrain (attention, relevance memory signals) and
monoaminergic systems (general mood modulation, reward, alertness). A
lot of things I would like a good user interface to handle, even if
some of it should be kept away from children...

As far as I'm concerned, speculators are a symptom, not the problem. The
problem with the stock market is that it's far from a free market; for
example:

1. Insider trading laws prevent the spread of accurate information required
   for sane investment choices.
2. Capital gains tax means that many people stay in a stock well after they
   would otherwise have dumped it, in order to avoid tax.
3. Various laws encourage people to invest money in the stock market which,
   in a free market, they'd have put elsewhere.

So all these restrictions encourage continual increases in stock prices and,
not surprisingly, speculators jump in and take advantage of that. And
politicians can use this to claim the economy is wonderful, all the while
just creating a hideous bubble which will eventually collapse.

I've learned a few tools to enable sleep. ( Had to, working long overnight
hours in various hospital settings, like I did.)
They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few.
(1) Melatonin:
     (A) fast acting, cheap, low dosage- I found that 3/4 mg would knock me
out for a good 4 hours, PREVENTS COLDS-
      prior to using melatonin, I had 2-3 SEVERE colds each year, since I
discovered this effect several years ago I have been
      100% cold free. Using myself as a guinea pig, I determined that a
single 1 mg dose every 3-4 days is probably sufficient    FOR ME , to never
have another cold. I do use a fairly high level of supplements and am very
active regular runner and I don't smoke, so adjust your dose if your immune
system is not what it should be.
     (D) long 1/2 life in the body-you'll stay groggy longer, but if you have
to sleep in a noisy environment ( barracks, dorm or have young kids) and do
get awakened you'll quickly return to sleep, IMPORTANT-if you have high blood
pressure you might want to take it easy with this stuff, melatonin has been
shown to constrict the vessels in the Circle of Willis ( main arterial
vessels in the brain ) over use or high dosages might contribute to a CVA by
raising intracrainial BP, don't drive or operate heavy equipment
(2) Kava
     (A) fast acting, short 1/2 life- you wake up after a full night's sleep
clear headed, also cheap, the sensation produced by the herb is pleasant.(400
mg works for me)
     (D) the sleep inducing effect is not as intense as melatonin even at
higher dosages > 800 mg, consistency of effect across brand may differ since
herbal preparations vary a lot
(3) chamomile tea
     (A) short 1/2 life, cheap, effective symptomatic treatment for nausea
vomiting
     (D) tea has less than pleasant taste
(4) stimulation of seratonin production
     (A) anyone can do it- eat a plate of food high in both starch and
complete protein ( mashed potatoes heavy on the milk, pasta with meat sauce,
etc.) forces your brain- do to a quirk in amino acid metabolism- to over
produce seratonin which induces sleep
    (D) ya'll get fatter'n hogs, if ya do this too often
(5) calcium- magnesium tablets
     (A) both are essential nutrients, since both help with pain relief-
calcium can block pain and magnesium is a very effective muscle relaxant the
combo is good if pain is what's keeping you awake
     (D) slow acting, long 1/2 life- you will be groggy the next day if you
take too much
(6) Vitamin C/ exercise
    (A) both very good for you in many ways, cheap but use buffered C not
plain or chewable- long term use of high doses of C (2-5 gm/day) raises the
level of endorphins in the body to a level that is manageable( no
overwhelming sleepiness on the job ) and you tend to have a great attitude-
sustained exercise ( a good run, biking a few miles, some sustained
horizontal exercise) adds a load of new endorphins to the mix for a really
mystical experience before sleep comes
(7) hypnosis
 (A) nothin' cheeper, has other useful benes if you learn how- pain
reduction, hypermnesia(love this one when I'm cramming for an exam)
 (D) not fool proof- if you're distracted or in a hurry it may not work,
practice is essential may not keep you asleep all night

Pleasant Dreams;
Dennis Roberts

I ran into some of the gang at the grocery store (hey, Mojave is a
*small* town), and the word is, another tiedown test after the 4th
of July, and first hover a week or two after that.  Wednesdays seem
to work out best- prep Monday, fuel up Tuesday, fire/fly Wednesday
dawn, analyze results & make changes the rest of the week.

Actually, 9000 m/s is *not* a modest delta-V.  The effective mass
ratio must be in excess of 15, closer to 20 for pressure fed with
it's performance penalties.  Sometimes I wish we were Martians...

Spoken like a true Sea Dragon disciple ;) Little parts are a
nuisance to spec and manufacture, and tolerances have to be very
tight for injector elements... but I know from personal experience
that small combustors are convenient to handle.  It's nice to just
sling a 5,000 lbf thruster over your shoulder and carry it out to
the car.  500K engines need a forklift.  A large one.

What I'm getting at is that I'm an agnostic on pumped SSTO vs
press-fed TSTO.

Actually, the handling characteristics of the Me-163 were quite
good, and the thrust/weight ratio is comparable to modern jet
fighters. Empty, the approach speed would be quite low.  There was a
two-seat trainer with retractable gear built during the war, and
that's the logical choice for a replica.  I wouldn't mind getting a
type rating for "rocket fighter"...

I gave up trying to read Gary's mind months ago.  He's a visionary
and leader, not an engineer, a crystal ball gazer, and I can't
follow him. That damn fastrac engine ain't gonna inspire anyone.

A coupla points- I'm sure you meant, higher pressure to keep the LOX
*above* the freezing point... and propane is a better choice than
ethane (it actually has a lower gel point, and a eutectic mixture of
the two goes even lower).  Isothermal LOX/propane hjas long been a
favorite of mine.

Alas, even subcooled propane has poor density, and the pumping
pressure of a rotary engine is directly proportional to density. 
Kerosene is a *lot* easier to use.

As for two rotary engines- remember that low pressure engines have
only a trivial (less than 1%) Isp hit in vacuum, with the same
expansion area ratio.  Make the upper stage pressure fed.

If you put back the insulation between the tanks, you can Vapack
both propellants (use their vapor pressures to drive the fluids),
eliminating helium bottles, regulators, and heaters altogether.  The
RCS runs off the vapors left after the main engine burn.

The main problem is that regen cooling can't be used- the coolant
film boils in the coolant passages (think of a drop of water on a
hot skillet) giving lousy heat transfer.  The cooling would fail and
the chamber would melt.  Happily, low pressure ablators last a good
long while (at 1500+ psi, they erode frighteningly fast).  This
would make the engine, inherently an expendable, cheaper than a
regen system.

There are a few still grinding away... I feel this would be great
for freight, and with an escape rocket on the crew cabin, could be
used to haul people.

According to the legend R.Buckminster Fuller once undertook to re-
engineer sleep, it is claimed he slept whenever he was tired which
worked out to a half hour nap every six hours, giving him a 22 hour
day, legend has it he did this for many years.....

I once read mammals with small frontal lobes (us) process day
gathered information at night during sleep the exception was the
large front lobed ecidna,(sp?) the spiny anteater, a monotreme or
egg laying mammal (duck billed platypus being the other). In other
words we need our ZZZZZZZ's

My understanding is that most of the over the counter tablets are too
high in dosage, that you should only take 1 mg (or less).

Unfortunately, this document is meaningless, being nothing but the
assembled culture of a small segment of society with little direct
influence on the culture as a whole (but of course great indirect
influence by what they produce).

Language, unlike reality, is a matter of consensus.  There are
no central authorities and no testable theories.  No matter how
many times you may protest that "gay" means "joyful", the fact is
that when the word is encountered by a typical English-speaking
reader, the first meaning that jumps to mind is "homosexual".  As
much as we want "hacker" to keep its original meaning as someone
who pushes limits and explores possibilities, the simple fact is
that 99% of English-speaking readers who encounter the word think
about teenagers breaking into computers illegally.  Merriam-Webster
includes both senses of the word, no doubt because computer geeks
pestered them into including the original usage, but there is no
doubt that writers and editors in the real world use only the
commonly understood meaning--what we would call a "cracker" (a
term used by absolutely no one but those still clinging to the
past glory of the word "hacker").

I too lament the loss of a good word.  But it /is/ lost, and it's
time to just get over it.

I've got a much better system for getting to sleep. It doesn't involve any
drugs, and you'll have forearms like Popeye (well one of them anyway...)
without having to eat any of that spinach shit.
Have a wank. Every night, regular as clockwork. Sends you right off,
especially if you have a couple of joints and/or a glass of beer first.

Rob.

P.S. Subscribe to some porn channels, too. Before you know it, bedtime will
be the coolest part of the day......
Of course, unless you're single you'll have to become very interested in the
TV programme currently on telly when your missus goes to bed, so you can get
some joyous minutes of lone action.

There is now a mailing list for people interested in anarchism
in science fiction.

The list has an anti-capitalist anarchist orientation.

To subscribe, send a message to majordomo@tao.ca
with "subscribe anarchysf" in the message body.

Polyphasic sleep seems like a fun idea (it is often ascribed to
Leonardo da Vinci), although in practice I think the overhead due to
the ~10 minute after-nap sleepiness might decrease efficiency a bit.

Yes, sleep is necessary. I don't know about the frontal lobes (we have
quite big frontal lobes), but memory consolidation and sleep
definitely go hand in hand. My current view of things is that we do
memory consolidation of explicit memories during the deep sleep, and
training of our implicit memories during REM sleep. If you don't get
enough sleep, your memory will work less well. There is more to sleep
than this, but it is a good reason.

As I see it, a transhuman life is a balance act between the energy of
enthusiasm and the pleasures of sleeping. What a wonderful strain...

Polyphasic sleep seems like a fun idea (it is often ascribed to
Leonardo da Vinci), although in practice I think the overhead due to
the ~10 minute after-nap sleepiness might decrease efficiency a bit.

Yes, sleep is necessary. I don't know about the frontal lobes (we have
quite big frontal lobes), but memory consolidation and sleep
definitely go hand in hand. My current view of things is that we do
memory consolidation of explicit memories during the deep sleep, and
training of our implicit memories during REM sleep. If you don't get
enough sleep, your memory will work less well. There is more to sleep
than this, but it is a good reason.

As I see it, a transhuman life is a balance act between the energy of
enthusiasm and the pleasures of sleeping. What a wonderful strain...

Since I was a child I have had problems going to bed at a reasonable hour.
Although my unstable and restlessness childhood as it were I'm sure
contributed, and I may have started an earlier pattern that I can't seem to
break, even at 30. As a early teen, doctors dosed me with heavy prescription
sleep aids to help, I often couldn't get up at all in the morning, and would
blindly head to breakfast, stars still in my eyes. Thru out the last ten
years, I have tried over the counter sleeping pills, and benadriyl, to no
avail. Now, I take three melatonin's a night, and still don't meet the
sandman until the wee late hours. If I woke up early, this wouldn't bother
me, but I still tend to compensate, and sleep too late in the day.
Nanogirl



My understanding is that most of the over the counter tablets are too
high in dosage, that you should only take 1 mg (or less).

Times change.  From cracker to hacker, and then, we hope, back to
cracker again.  Eric S. Raymond is a minor celebrity, now.  Perhaps the

Right, but using the term marks us as being part of said subculture and
therefore worth a much higher salary.

The problem is that nobody has proposed an adequate replacement which
could be adopted in a synchronized way.  The best suggestion I've heard
is "wizard", and that doesn't have the same connotations yet.  Until then:

The next general Assembly of the World Future Society will
happen on July 29-August 1, 1999 in Washington.

It's a convention of over a 1000 futurists from all over the
world, and a good opportunity to meet people and promote your ideas.

Please consider coming. (see http://www.wfs.org/wfs/9ga.htm )

If you can't come you can still exhibit some materials on
advanced futurist ideas and technological projects.

If you are interested, please look at http://www.wfs.org/wfs/9ga.htm#exhibit 
for their guidelines and prices, contact WFS about permission to display
your materials (with me as a representative, if necessary; let me know
then), money, etc.

If it is needed, I will handle your materials at the conference
(in reasonable amount), such as put them on appropriate shelves, etc.

WTA Update 4
1 July 1999

Dear Member:

The second European transhumanist conference, TransVision99, took
place in Stockholm a few weeks back - a welcomed opportunity to meet
and exchange ideas with fellow transhumanists. We seem to get along
well with each other. As is often the case with conferences, much of
the action was between the presentations, or over dinner, or late in
the night outside the prison gates. (The conference was held in Kumla
Hotell, which retains many features of its former function as a
prison.) One participant's account of the event is at
http://maxm.normik.dk/tv99/html/postscript_maxm.htm.

If you're beginning to regret that you weren't there, it is still not
too late to register for EXTRO-4 in Berkeley, August 7-8! Several new
speakers have been confirmed and all indications are that it will be a
great event. More information is at
http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm.

One of the practical issues discussed at TV99 was the need for a new
moderated discussion forum. Max M. (the Dane, not Max More) announced
a plan to create a transhumanist portal site that will support some
form of filtered news groups. Alexander Bard discussed some thoughts
he had of starting a moderated transhumanist mailinglist. The Extropy
Institute is considering to replace or complement the present
extropian list with a more ambitious implementation of their NodeNet
idea, where different topics would be discussed in separate moderated
discussion groups. After the summer we will have a clearer picture of
what will come out of these efforts.

Next year's TransVision is preliminarily scheduled to take place in
London.

The Journal of Transhumanism continues its efforts to promote
transhumanist scholarship. Although no new papers have been published
since the last update, several have been rejected and some are in the
process of being refereed. Keep the submissions coming! In addition to
the joy of contributing to human knowledge and building a reputation
for yourself, there is also a pecuniary incentive: the WTA award of
5000, which is to be awarded for the best paper published in the JTH
before 31 December 1999, provided candidates of sufficient merit are
available.

The WTA keeps growing; we currently have about 650 members, compared
to 466 on the 20th of February. This is good news, and in order to
translate it into concrete advantages it would be good to form more
local groups. If you are interested in doing that, try to get in touch
with some other people in your area (maybe by looking at
http://www.transhumanism.com/groups.htm), start meeting up
occasionally, and take it from there.

Best wishes,
Nick Bostrom

So, Michael Moorcock doesn't understand that the political spectrum has more
than one dimension ("radical" vs "reactionary" is an utterly meaningless
distinction), and he thinks his particular brand of "radicalism" is the only
one that deserves to be able to call itself that.  I can't say I'm
surprised, but what does this have to do with Extropianism?

Given the theoretical work that has been done in the last decade, I'm
expecting to see the tissue engineers growing real blood vessels in their
cultures within a few years.  Nerve growth doesn't seem to be as well
understood, but it still seems liek a fairly reasonable bet for the 5-10
year time frame.

This whole field seems to be advancing at a rate previously seen only in the
electronics industry.

Nanogirl, you have lots of company. Many of us are afternoon or even late
night people. There is quite a lot of literature on circadian rhythms in
humans. Also the current interest in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is leading to
a lot of research if your sleep is not refreshing.

Best Ralph

It looks that way to me too. The market has become a casino where insiders
get the best odds. Education and real estate seem much better long term
investments. Short term: warm clothes and some edible house plants.
The longer market indices go up, the harder they will fall.

OTOH, who could in good conscience argue against market efficiency? After
all, an inefficient casino only irritates the gamblers.

Today I ate lunch in Marlene's, our local health food store.

One one side of the store there is a juice bar, complete with fresh 
wheatgrass, and on the other side, an expresso bar.

As I drank my Jerimiah's Julep (a carob/spirulina/yogurt shake), I 
mentioned in jest to the guy behind the expresso bar that I was a CIA 
android created as a spoiler for the 2000 Presidential election.  He 
just twitched a smile and said he knew that a month ago.

In any case, one of the female attendants mentioned that some 
customers were asking about converting the place to an internet cafe. 
All Marlene could do was shake her head:  "No.  I have no interest in 
the internet.  It's too complicated.  It's not for me."

It's her customers I'm thinking about.  How to get reasonable 
internet access from a table in Marlene's cafe?  Flashbacks: NT 
Server with DSL connection: Proxy Server: DHCP Server: RJ-45 jacks.

An then, some common sense.

How about something simple?  For Marlene, and the whole vertical 
market she represents...

For now, at the end of the copper era, maybe a transition strategy:

DSL in one end: wireless DHCP within 50 feet of the expresso machine. 
 Get a PCMCIA card for your laptop, come in and enjoy the wheatgrass!

Can this be done?  And please don't give me any bullshit about 
proxy/firewall software and billable outlets!  Marlene wants 
simplicity or nothing at all.

The distinction in the eyes of someone like Moorcock between a radical versus a
reactionary is much like a Peikoffite Objectivist's attitude: If your not
totally with us, then you are against us. If you tolerate anyone who is not
totally with us, then you are against us.

I'm not surprised that an anti-individualist like Moorcock would brand Heinlein
based on just one of his books, Starship Troopers, and that his abilities at
literary analysis would be quite so stunted. If Moorcock had instead fixated on
_Stranger in a Strange Land_ before reading ST, I can imagine that he would be
singing the praises of Heinlein as a Buddhist, anti-establishment, pro-sexual
revolution radical out to create a new transhumanist religion.

The primary question is: How many seats? How many simultaneous laptop users are
expected? My personal recommendation is to use a WebRamp with two 56k modems and
a network hub of the desired size on the user side, and 10 base network
connections to 10base PCMCIA cards. You should be able to handle 6 or more users
on a dual modem WebRamp simultaneously with relatively normal throughput
behavior for each user. You wouldn't want to route payperview programs through
it, of course, but its serviceable for most all browsing/email/ftp needs.
WebRamp is administered by web pages resident on the device, and is relatively
inexpensive.

That is a new definition of meaningless to me. I assume that (given it is

greater culture) it too is meaningless?

Oh, meaningless because its influence is only indirect - like
revolutionising the world and creating the very systems one which we are now
communicating. Yes .. more meaningless for me please.

There is more than one language. Eliezer, myself, ESR, and many others use
and defend the usage of a term invented for and by ourselves If this means
that we cannot communicate usefully with a larger consensus, I doubt that
that will matter very much. At any rate, consensi [sp?] are reached by
attempts to define in addition to mere usage, and there is a consensual
meaning consistent with ESR's text.

I agree with your point, and that is exactly why I responded as I did. Just
as activist gays took the word gay and made it their own in the minds of
others, so too activist libertarian FSF hackers can take the word hacker for
themselves.

I disagree. Just as activist gays are currently taking back the work queer:
you do not have to give up. And this, IMHO, is an important battle - it
defines a culture and a set of consistent principles.

Have another look at what he wrote. (I know it's painful.) ST was the last
book he thinks is kinda *okay*, becaue it's a gritty Bildungsroman. It's
the later corpus, with its ever-more paternalistic authoritarian
crypto-magic pseudo-rationality that he's offended by, and I think he's
right. I love reading Heinlein, and I adore such usually-abominated fat
tomes such as THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST-- precisely for those inveigling,
insinuating characteristics that Moorcock is (rightly) railing against. I'm
weak, I relish these fairytales in which competent men and superwomen rule
the sevagram by the pure power of their good looks or improbably powerful
minds and bodies or strict adherence to the absolute truths of science
(ha!), but I know they are working to corrode my sense of reality and
decent empathy just as tasty foods seem particularly shaped to destroy my
teeth and bloodvessels.

Aargh. It's STRANGER and the rest of the increasingly self-indulgent books
that Moorcock finds so fatuous and suspect. Jubal rules the roost, even if
the `girls' chuck him in the pool occasionally, because he is the
Silverback with silver in his pocket. Mike the Archangel from Mars is right
because... well, because *that's the way things are*, and he *knows it*
because he can speak *Martian, the Truth Language* and hence kill his
enemies at a thought. A vision of a post-Singularity Power? Maybe - but a
troubling one. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

GAAACCKK!
PTOOH!  PTOOH!  PTOOH!

*That's* your idea of a PSE?  Mike the Moron?  Heinlein in drag?  *Him*?
 Great, now I've thrown up all over my keyboard.

If it looks human, if it interacts with humans as equals, if it has
anthropomorphic emotions:  It *does not* count as an *alien*, much less
a Power.

It seems to me that the choice of causes for which one is willing to die is one of 
those ultimately personal choices. If one makes the choice rationally (as not 
everyone does), one takes the chances of success into account as well. If open 
opposition has a 99% chance of landing one in a prison camp or shallow grave, it 
seems intelligent to take some other path, such as escape if & when the opportunity 
presents itself.  

I hired a Czech robot scientist (George S----) when I was a section head in real-
time systems at DG. He had driven his family into Austria on "vacation" in 1987 
(from Poland), by trying different border checkpoints until he found one where the 
guards didn't give a flying rat's ass about the rather improbable amount of stuff 
in the car for a simple camping trip, or the exact state of their papers (the third 
try, I think it was). In fact, that particular guard was sitting with his feet 
propped up waving cars through. Anyway, George immediately contacted a refugee 
network in Vienna, who put the family up and helped them work on their U.S. visa. 
When he was situated in the States in a good job, he turned around and pumped time 
and money into the same network, and (I think) into covert aid to the resistance 
movement. The strategy worked well enough that in 1990 or so he was back in 
Bratislava hoisting tall beers with his old colleagues (OK, actually he was 
Slovakian, but "Czech robot scientist" sounds better, _pace_ Capek :-).  

The time had to be right, and a doctorate in hard science had a lot to do with his 
success with the INS, of course.

One of my systems support guys came by and said, incredulously, "you hired a WHAT?" 
right after the offer went out. When George had been here three weeks, he made a 
special trip back to my office to tell me what I already knew, that George was one 
hell of an ass-kicking software engineer, former academic and furriner or not. One 
of his colleagues later described him as "an engineering machine." I am quick at 
picking up new stuff, but George took the prize. He came in and read manuals for a 
couple of days and then started slam-dunking all our hard problems.

Both my daughter and I recently started taking melatonin. I followed the advice in
Smart Drugs and Nutrients II (ref:

	http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962741876/qid%3D930889217/002-4713766-4973440

Start with 3 mg a day (I recommend doing this when you don't have to go anywhere 
the next morning!).  If you are drowsy the following day, drop the dose until you're not.  
If you're not sleeping better, raise the dose.

Turns out that the effective dose ranges from person to person from 0.1 mg to 200 mg
(Not a typo!).  At 3 mg, my daughter (13) slept for 12.5 hours. She has settled at .6-1 mg; 
I take 1 mg.  

Important melatonin facts:

Melatonin is the principal hormone produced by the pineal gland, "a key element in the
maintenance of ... endocrine regulation, immune system integrity, and circadian rhythm."

Melatonin production is triggered by low light levels, and turned off when sunlight hits
your retina in the morning (which seems pretty cool to me).  So it's reasonable to expect 
that people will screw up their sleep cycles due to artificial lighting.  Because of this, it is 
CRITICAL to take melatonin at night.  I take it around 9 or 10 PM.  If you take it during the 
day, it makes things WORSE.  For example, taken at night, it inhibits tumor growth in cancer 
patients; taken during the day, it accelerates tumor growth.  (Precisely when you take it
in the evening does affect when you fall asleep and how groggy you'll be the next day.)

Production drops as you age.  At 41, I produce 80% of what I did at 20.  It's a straight-
line drop for men, and an S-curve for women (due to menopause). Old people don't
necessarily sleep less because they don't need the sleep; they may just sleep less because
they *can't* sleep.

It's also a great jet-lag treatment. One large dose your first night and you're over it.  Also
reported to improve mental performance and longevity, and reduce depression and 
seasonal affective disorder.

Ya that change was a shocker.

Yup.  You only need a little pressure to keep the almost boiling lox from
freezing the ethane.  The phase overlap is only a few degrees F.

My good friend and mentor has been telling me the same thing, he too
being a propane/lox fan.  I admit having a lot of headaches trying to
work out the density delta between lox and ethane.  You lose a lot
of the efficiency of a roton by going for the no-insulation-needed
approach of lox and ethane.  The bigger tanks may swamp the
advantage of the slightly higher Isp of ethane vs kerosene.  So,
pont taken.

Again, a favorite idea of my friend and mentor here.  I have resisted
the pressure fed notion because rotary engines are wicked cool, but
thats a poor reason to choose one I fear.  {8^D

Do you mind if I share your post with the guys?  These are good points.

Ya.  What I really had in mind is a low cost 2 stage designed specifically
for low-value high-density payloads, which one is willing to risk, such
as food for astronauts.  My notion is to leave the humanity hauling duties
to the space shuttle.

Thanks for the ideas!  {8-] spike

It seems to me that the choice of causes for which one is willing to die is one of 
those ultimately personal choices. If one makes the choice rationally (as not 
everyone does), one takes the chances of success into account as well. If open 
opposition has a 99% chance of landing one in a prison camp or shallow grave, it 
seems intelligent to take some other path, such as escape if & when the opportunity 
presents itself.  

I hired a Czech robot scientist (George S----) when I was a section head in real-
time systems at DG. He had driven his family into Austria on "vacation" in 1987 
(from Poland), by trying different border checkpoints until he found one where the 
guards didn't give a flying rat's ass about the rather improbable amount of stuff 
in the car for a simple camping trip, or the exact state of their papers (the third 
try, I think it was). In fact, that particular guard was sitting with his feet 
propped up waving cars through. Anyway, George immediately contacted a refugee 
network in Vienna, who put the family up and helped them work on their U.S. visa. 
When he was situated in the States in a good job, he turned around and pumped time 
and money into the same network, and (I think) into covert aid to the resistance 
movement. The strategy worked well enough that in 1990 or so he was back in 
Bratislava hoisting tall beers with his old colleagues (OK, actually he was 
Slovakian, but "Czech robot scientist" sounds better, _pace_ Capek :-).  

The time had to be right, and a doctorate in hard science had a lot to do with his 
success with the INS, of course.

One of my systems support guys came by and said, incredulously, "you hired a WHAT?" 
right after the offer went out. When George had been here three weeks, he made a 
special trip back to my office to tell me what I already knew, that George was one 
hell of an ass-kicking software engineer, former academic and furriner or not. One 
of his colleagues later described him as "an engineering machine." I am quick at 
picking up new stuff, but George took the prize. He came in and read manuals for a 
couple of days and then started slam-dunking all our hard problems.

Oddly enough, I disagree. I think if you support the cracker/hacker
distinction, push it and it may gain popularity. People in general are
increasingly familiar with computers and the net, going beyond the hype
because of their own, direct experience. I think that the world is ready for
a general purpose term for "computer wizards", as a distinction from
vandals, and might quite like the words hacker and cracker in this
configuration.

Interestingly, my strongest experience of the word hacker in the computing
world has been in contexts such as "Harry the hacker" - derogatory, closer
to the literary "hack", meaning that one is untrained, unprofessional, and
of possessing limited gifts. Exactly the opposite meaning to that proposed
in the hacker/cracker distinction, and different from hacker as vandal.

This meaning comes across in computer science texts and the academic world,
and in the business IT world (a horrible place to be sure).

Title
  Effect of a continuous
  gamma irradiation at a very low dose on the life span of
  mice.
Source
  Gerontology.  44(5):272-6, 1998.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There is epidemiological evidence that suggests there are
  beneficial effects of ionizing radiation at low doses. Some
  experimental studies confirmed this hormetic effect with
  doses of about 1 cGy/day, but no data concerning very low dose rates are
  available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the life span of
  mice exposed to very low doses of ionizing radiation. METHODS: Six hundred
  female C57BL/6 mice, 1 month old, were exposed to chronic
  gamma irradiation at very low dose rates of 7 or 14
  cGy/year. These doses are about 25 or 50 times higher than background, but
  much lower than the doses of about 1 cGy/day used in previous experiments.
  Three hundred mice living in the same room were used as controls. RESULTS:
  The life span, after the beginning of the experiment, determined by the
  survival time of 50% of each population, is increased in irradiated mice: 549
  days in controls, 673 days in both irradiated groups. The differences are
  significant between the control and the irradiation mice. Differences between
  mice irradiated with 7 or 14 cGy are not significant. CONCLUSIONS: These
  results confirm the possibility of a nonharmful effect
  (hormesis) of ionizing radiation. They demonstrate that the paradigm, which
  states that low-dose effects can be predicted high-dose
  effects, cannot be systematically applied in radiation
  biology in general and gerontology in particular.

His going off on authoritarian paternalistic militaristism, as well as his
baseless association of rugged individualism with paternalism were what told me he
was wearing the blinders he came in with.

Here's an example of how confused he seems to be:

Since they are fighting against the emperor/darth vader baddies, and for Princess
Leia (who, last I checked, was a woman), I fail to see how the heroes could be
fighting FOR a paternalistic authority, unless he treats 'the force' as a paternal
spiritualism, a baseless claim.

earlier he says:

I fail to see why an anarchist should have any sense of community responsibility.
He's assuming is anarcho-socialism is the only kind of anarchism, and that
anarcho-capitalism is just fascism without big government (a rather odd oxymoron).
methinks he still hates his father...

While Jubal Harshaw is the silverback, he is still a rebel against the system,
turning it on its tail to his own ends. Later characters in #OTB, TEFL, TCWWTW,
etc. were all individuals with no respect for governments, benevolent leaders,
etc. who did not take someone's word at face value. The thing that annoyed the
hell of me with #OTB was how much bickering went on because nobody would let
anybody else take charge and work as a team. There was as much wasted space in
that book from arguments as Rand wasted in her soliloquiys in Atlas Shrugged.

I personally don't comprehend how someone can be a libertarian and NOT be a rugged
individualist. Moorcock is apparently under the delusion that it is possible.

Why do they not take back the word fag? (oh, yeah, we don't want to offend that
powerful minority, the stick bundlers)....feeling queer is a state of nausea. I
want to be able to say "I feel queer" again, instead of having to say in polite

     The mainstream Anarchy movement today, which I call "Anarchy(tm)", 
defines the term as "stateless socialism". It positions itself as the REAL 
Anarchy (revising history and glossing over some of the best ideas of early 
Anarchists) and proclaiming Anarcho-Capitalists to be the frauds. A pretty 
neat job of subversion and appropriation, but disgusting nonetheless.

     [By the way, their argument against Anarcho-Capitalism is that "bosses" 
and managers constitute a state.]

     I recently went off on a rant against the psychological problems of 
Anarchy(tm) and Anarchists(tm). I will forward it here for your 
consideration.

     By the way, I sometimes think of myself as an Anarchist without the 
(tm).

     Yes, it seemed like he was trying to say Anarchism = Libertarianism = 
Socialism. It was obvious that he was using a different dictionary than any 
that I have ever used.

Hose it down and relax. That was my point, actually. That was Moorcock's
point, too, I suspect, if only by indirection. (I must get my explicator

It also shows why it is a good idea to sleep in a dark room, and
suggests that a good way of getting awake is to have a timer set to
brighten it (I use a 150W halogen lamp above my bed in the winters).

The use for jet-lag works (scientifically well studied and I have
personally tried it). The mental performance and longevity stuff is
unproven and rather controversial. The depression aspect is
interesting, but likely mediated through sleeping - SAD and some forms
of depression are influenced by when and how much you sleep.

        Emotions are a fact of life, and in truth, when guided by reason,
they help to shape our lives and make them somewhat more enjoyable.  One of
the reasons that most people enjoy being human (in some sense or another)
is the ability to feel a plethora of these emotions, yet still be able to
differentiate the factitious from the facts and have a core knowledge of
reality.  However, it is all too easy for certain powerful emotions to
override the focus of even the most rational of people.

        Drugs currently abound which can chemically enhance or repress some
of these powerful emotions, although they are by no means perfect.  Side
effects are extremely common, and all too often the emotion such drugs were
intended to enhance or repress are simply transformed into another kind of
emotion.     
        Chances are, within most of our lifetimes, the technology will be
manifested to such a state in which we can select our emotions to a certain
extent.  The question is this: which emotions would you like to retain, and
which would you like to dispose of?  It would be easy to come up with
knee-jerk kind of answers such as "I would get rid of love" though I am
fairly certain that such a move would be highly irrational.  Most of our
emotions have a purpose, and life could easily be less enjoyable without
many of them.

        Personally, I would opt to exorcise any trace of fear or anxiety.
Though I'm not naturally inclined to feel these emotions very often, I know
that when exposed to them, it is difficult to remain rational.  But some of
the more potentially painful ones such as loneliness, I would keep.  The
problem I foresee with getting rid of too many of these "bad" emotions is that
in their absence, there could easily be a lack of ambition.  For example,
if one didn't feel "unhappy" there would be less inclination for him to
progress to the point at where he would naturally feel happy.  It is an
interesting thought.  What do you think?

0. If I can replace the emotion FEAR with a "WARNING: DANGER" function which
   works as fast (=at a low level) as FEAR does, then I would replace it.  I
   regard any person irresponsible who simply removes FEAR without replacing
   it with some other safeguard.

   I have no use for ANXIETY, and would remove it.

1. I did not know that humans sort LONELINESS into the EMOTIONS cathegory.
   I believed they defined LONELINESS as the property of a person who belongs
   to a set consisting of only that person.  What kind of EMOTION would you
   suggest such a person senses?

2. Most of the emotions of the emotion complex LOVE energize the mental states
   and thus I would wish to retain them, although under continued rational
   control.

3. I would remove the darker spectrum of EMOTIONS which appear in  DEPRESSION
   states, and install a rather positive emotional balance.

4. I would also remove various irrational emotions, such as envy and jealosy.

In the late 70s, I worked with a proto-transhumanist kinda fellow who went 
by his initials (dib). He lived near the office so that he could easily pursue 
his reworked sleep schedule. He tried taking naps that would be exactly 
one REM cycle every six hours or so. Thus, he was sleeping about three 
hours out of 24. Being a serious geek, he tried to be extra precise about 
this. He started by timing his sleep for several nights. If his average sleep 
time (without an alarm) was, say, 7:50, he concluded that his idiosyncratic 
sleep cycle must be 47 minutes instead of 45. So when he started his one-
rem system, he would set an alarm for 47 minutes.

He seemed to think it worked fine, while most other people seemed to 
think he was groggy all the time. He also decided to simplify a few things 
such as haircuts -- bought a clipper and wore a self-styled buzz -- and 
getting dressed -- he bought jumpsuits in various colors. He carried a 
minirecorder to take notes -- no idea what he did about transcribing them 
or finding any particular memo on the tape. 

Definitely a fun guy to work with. I lost track of him -- would be interesting 
to find out what he's into now.

Lacking the robustness of Linux and, indeed, the robustness of pre-service
pack Windows NT, HUE is my new project.  Files as we know and love them are
gone; instead we have a (sort of) database of (sort of) documents with
persistent hypermedia linking.  Links become solid things that exist outside
the interpretation of a browser and, hopefully, this will mean all kinds of
wonderful things will be possible.  The entire purpose of HUE is to provide
a solid base for my vision of reducible knowledge.  I'm much more lucid in

If you go to this site and select "sleeping aids" from the pull down
list, then hit the "See Results" button:

http://www.endfatigue.com/cgi-bin/input.cfm

you will see the results of an online survey for people with Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome about which sleep aids helped them the most.  Their
underlying biochemical problems might be completely different from
yours, so some of these might be unique to helping CFS'ers, but a lot of
them are standard sleeping aids.  Many are supplements available over
the counter.

Watch out for 5-HTP, as many samples have been found to be
contaminated.  If anybody knows where to get really pure stuff, please
let me know.

Some people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome get cortisol levels that are
high at night and low in the morning, the opposite of how they should
be, and this can cause the disrupted sleep pattern that you are
experiencing. I have no idea whether this might apply in your case, but
you could try getting a 24 hour cortisol/DHEA test. 
I got mine (normal) from Great Smokies Diagnostic Lab, who seem to be
well respected:

http://www.greatsmokieslab.com/news/focus_on_adrenocortex.html

You have to get a prescription.  If you decide it's for you, keep
looking until you find an open minded doctor; the life extension
foundation has a list of them on their site, and GSDL has a list of
doctors as well.  It's about $150.

If your cortisol levels are too low, they can be supplemented with
cortisol or prednisone.  If they are too high, I understand there are
ways to modify that as well, although I don't know how off hand.

Disregulated cortisol levels are associated with prior chronic stress,
such as a chaotic childhood.

All that said, I think there are genetic reasons why some people are
"night people".  It's pretty hard to change.

There is a book called "Safe Uses of Cortisol" on my shelf that I no
longer need if any Bay Area person wants it enough to come pick it up.

I would argue that one can not be a rugged individualist without being a
libertarian, but that one could be a libertarian without being a rugged
individualist ("libertarian" as we use the word here, not this weird
communist libertarianism).  I have always told my liberal friends that
libertarianism was the best way to accomplish their goals. 
Libertarianism is the system with the best chance of ending racism,
improving standards of living for the poorest people, improving
education, keeping people out of jail, and reducing crime.  There is a
case for liberty that is purely utilitarian.

A utilitarian (who is a collectivist by definition) could study how the
state actually works and conclude that the government is a hindrance to
their goals rather than a help.

A person could also believe that everyone "should" form voluntary
socialist cooperatives, but that it would be wrong to use force to do
so, and consider legislation equivalent to violence.  I'm sure many
American socialists would agree that violence shouldn't be used to force
people to adopt these cooperatives, and haven't yet come to understand
that government intervention is force.  (The fact that they still think
there's a "should" means they're behind on their General Semantics, but
I digress.)

The first type of libertarian is pretty common.  I think I've seen one
or two of the second type out here in Berkeley.  They are rare.

Just as much as socialist communties are states. An anarcho-socialist community
relies on consensus of the whole or tyranny of the majority, while a
heirarchical corporation is definitely fascist, but one's association with this
corporation is not mandatory, and their assertion also denies the option of a
corporation where all employees are (semi)equal partners. All of the above are
voluntary associations, and an anarchist doesn't have to belong to any of them,
be self employed and contract out to others. So whats their point?

At least at first there would be little reason for anybody to actually buy
the stock, you'd do better just making a bet on the direction the stock
will go (just as we do now). As a result trading in the stock itself would
become very thin and then just a small sell or buy order would lead to a
huge change in the stock price. It wouldn't take gamblers long to figure
this out and try to cook the books in their favor so there would be no
change from today.

Day traders do make me a little mad but that's life and they cause no net
change, they just increase the volatility, not the end of the world. The best
strategy is to buy stock in a company you have confidence in and ignore
the day to day variation. At least that's what my brain tells me, I admit that
when a stock takes a steep dive for no apparent reason the pain in my
stomach tells me other things, but I try not to react to such hysteria.
It's not always fun but no pain no gain.

I wonder if this might be David I. Bell, whom I went to college with and
who would have graduated around 1976.  He was a very sharp guy and one of
the best programmers among us, writing many utilities which we all used.

He has since done some very nice work with cellular automata, finding
new patterns in Conway's Life game and exploring related CA rules.
His web page is at http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/.

By the way, as many of you know, I make my living by being a paid hacker for
a very large company.  I work at home half the time, and travel to client
sites around the country half the time.  If anybody has the skills and
desire to do likewise, I would very much like you to e-mail me offline.

I have run my own consulting business for years, but I am currently making
more money working for the big organizations than I could do on my own.
They give me more referrals than I can possibly handle.  This organization
needs to fill an additional 30 such positions in the next six months.

I'm afraid that the "training" provided by this organization is a joke.  If
you do not have the technical ability already, this organization will not
provide it.  Their training will teach you how to do customer engagements
their way, but will not give you the technical skills to do the job.

It's cool to see someone else on this list that does lucid dreaming.  I do
this, but it's not wide-spread as far as I know.  I have had major periods
of overwork where I literally worked full time except for sleep.  By
controlling my dreams and simulating an hour on the beach or something, I
woke up more refreshed and ready to work again.  When I don't dream (or more
accurately, when I don't remember dreaming) it seems like I just went to bed
and its time to go to work again, and I'm not ready to go back to work.

I also have performed real design work in dreams.  During the above week of
hell, I have gone to sleep, designed a solution to problems, and woke up
ready to implement the design the next morning.  I presented the design
idea, and actually billed time for the design work.

This is not always reliable, however.  Sometimes you don't dream or don't
become lucid while dreaming.  Sometimes you don't maintain full lucidity.
You dream that you came up with a good design, and you wake up and realize
that it doesn't make sense.  Sometimes dreams get weird and seem reasonable
until you wake up.  Usually the consciousness achieved in lucid dreaming
prevents the random dream-generators from kicking in, but occasionally there
is some overlap where the lucid dream still has some fictional elements
thrown in.

For those who don't know what we're talking about:  Lucid dreaming is when
you realize that you are dreaming.  You thereby become conscious inside your
dream.  Once you realize its a dream, you can control it by visualizing what
you want to see, and the dream-generating facilities of the subconscious
take over and create what you visualized.  Basically, it is a
super-realistic holodeck.  Anything you can imagine seems to be real.  You
get full sensory feedback, so you can do long division on paper, because you
see the paper and the writing holds constant and seems real.  You can think
logically and generate a design or a check list in your head, and when you
wake up you have accomplished real work/planning while sleeping.

I agree totally, but some people seem to want flashy graphics.  I have a
page at http://newstaffinc.com/security that is my best attempt to make a
functional site without graphics.  It is a reference page for hacking and
security resources.  I have tried to squeeze in as much stuff as possible,
while keeping the download time low, and without making it look too boring.
I'm still afraid this type of layout will be seen as dull.

I would appreciate it if anyone wants to look at it and tell me if I have
compensated for the lack of graphics.  The boxes, buttons, pull-down menus,
borders and colors are all done with standard HTML.  No graphics, no java,
no scripts, no plugins, no hassles.  I'm trying to figure out if this sort
of approach is viable as opposed to the all graphics sites, where every
button, color, box, is a little image file that has to download.

I have never heard someone say queer is a state of nausea.  As I understand
it, the word meant weird or different.  Being "weird" is not a bad thing, as
nobody wants to be boring or normal.  We all like to be strange or "special"
in some way.

The actual reason that the word "fag", short for "faggot" is derogatory, is
that it does indeed refer to the bundle of sticks gathered to be burned.
Cigarettes are also called fags in this sense, as well as fire-sticks, for
this reason.  Calling someone a "faggot" was originally done not primarily
toward gays, but to witches or heretics who were expected to eventually be
burned at the stake for their blasphemous crimes.  Anybody who was an evil
or immoral person who was expected to be eventually rounded up by the Church
and burned at the stake could be called a "faggot".  It basically meant the
person was a heretic/antichristian who hadn't been caught and executed by
the Church yet.

So? Will people come to it because it looks cool, or because it is a
huge source of useful information? Most likely the later, the design
is just icing on the cake.

Actually, I like the initial screen. It reminds me of a cupboard with
a lot of drawers. What it needs is probably some kind of graphical
organization, right now the boxes appear to be a bit haphazardly
placed. Maybe also a color scheme consistent between the background
and the boxes/menus. But the basic idea is good.

It sounds like one could argue that that is all humanity is
engaged in now, and ever has been.  In a way, everything is
a "sub-problem" of the problem of advancement to the next
level.  Or is that stretching it too much?

I mean, when I think about your suggestion, I can imagine what
(for example) my wife would say.  Something like "what a dry
and sterile existence"!  But I would argue, and maybe you would
too, that the "sub-problems" are really what life is all about.
And I always think it's rather Anthro-centric to think that 
appreciating art and beauty and so forth are peculiar human
abilities.  I personally think that they are just ways of 
thinking about patterns and analogies, an ability which an AI 
will certainly have.  I.e., "sub-problems"!

Yes, so in what way is this "no stock market whatsoever"?  As you 
allude to below, this is *exactly* a stock market.  Unless you're 
suggesting that you wouldn't have the right to turn around and sell 
your right to a percentage of the dividends.

No this won't work.  Very interesting reading, though.  But
it seems clear to me that the market value of a stock is
determined by a simple formula of supply and demand, and I
can't see how your suggestion would affect that, or what
incentive people would have for opting for your "casinos",
instead of the real market.

What we have now is a vast pyramid scheme, which has not yet
collapsed.  The value of the stocks continues to climb 
because each buyer is borrowing against the future, betting
that she can get out with her dough before the whole thing
folds.  I can't see how any casino that you devise could have
that kind of indefinite ability to ride up the values.  A
casino is definitely a zero-sum game in the short term.
As you pointed out, (2) and (3) are also zero-sum games, but
*in the long term*.  For now, and probably for several more
years, everyone can expect to win!

What really scares me is the government's toying with the idea
of investing the Social Security trust fund in the stock 
market.  Not that I expect to ever see a dime of SS.  But,
clearly, I do expect to see the whole stock market come to a
devastating crash at some point when a good percentage of the
baby-boomers retire, and start cashing in.  I don't see an
easy solution though.  As long as the market is free, nobody
can stop someone from paying ridiculous prices for a stock.

I disagree. Emotions are not rational. In fact, instinct and emotions are
what help us make decisions when we have no rational thinking. So, emotions
cannot be guided by reason.

If they're here is because they're useful. Fear in, for example, a war is a
very useful feeling because it helps you keep yourself alive; it's better
to live in shame rather than die in honor. Anxiety is also useful because
it catalyses our strenghts to a goal; I agree it's not always useful but I
understand it's purpose.

Yes, it is interesting. However, there are drugs in the market that make
you feel happy. Have you tried them? I'm very confident and optimist and I
think these are very important feelings that people than do not possess
them should have.

I LIKE Israel! 
Here is a partial excerpt of the story:

"REHOVOT, Israel --The first general- purpose mechanical computer
designed for biomolecular and pharmaceutical applications has been
developed by Prof. Ehud Shapiro of the Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The
mechanical computer will be presented today at the Fifth International
Meeting on DNA-Based Computers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. 
Shapiro's mechanical computer has been built to resemble the
biomolecular machines of the living cell, such as ribosomes.
Ultimately, this computer may serve as a model in constructing a
programmable computer of subcellular size, that may be able to operate
in the human body and interact with the body's biochemical
environment, thus having far-reaching biological and pharmaceutical
applications..."

Sleep cycles vary in length.  The first ones are shorter and they get longer
and longer throughout the night.  Most people are short on REM
(Rapid-Eye-Movement or dream sleep) sleep, and already get enough non-REM or
shallow or total sleep.  REM sleep removes depression, anxiety, stress, and
mental requirements.  Non-REM sleep recovers physical energy and removes
sleepiness.  You can tell which kind of sleep you are missing by the
symptoms.

If your sleep environment is noisy, or you have sleep apnea or snore, you
might be sleeping lightly and not getting enough REM sleep.  This usually
makes you want to sleep more and more, and you still don't feel rested.  REM
sleep is definitely the limiting factor in sleep deprivation.  People can go
days without sleep, but can't go without dreaming, even if they sleep
without dreaming.  After about 48 hours, the mind starts dreaming while you
are still awake.  Hallucinations and waking-sleepwalking are symptoms of
REM-sleep deprivation and the brain trying to catch up on its dreaming.

If you miss sleep, you can recover sleep the next night by sleeping more
efficiently, that is you don't have to make up sleep on a one-to-one basis.
REM sleep is much more rigid.  If you miss REM sleep, you get more REM sleep
the next night, and it is pretty much proportional to how much you missed.
It may take many nights to recover from a lack of dreaming.

Actually, I hated the pull-down menus and the buttons.  I like be able
to (1) scan a list of links all at once, instead of going through all
the popups and clicking each one; (2) see where I'm going before I
click; (3) right-click on a link to open up a new window.  The
Javascript didn't add value.

Yes, it is stretching it too much.  When I say "sub-problem", I'm not
talking about sub-goals.  I mean that a large problem breaks up into a
lot of little problems which require qualitatively different types of
thinking, just as a corporation breaks up into a lot of different
specialties.  Because each specialty can be optimized independently - by
all of the abilities working in concert - there isn't the
sterility/bottleneck problem you'd get from one ability working to
optimize itself.

Actually, I'm still not quite sure where beauty and music and laughter
come from.  I think it has something to do with sexual selection, but I
don't know enough to duplicate it.  They don't get any more peculiar
than that.

But then why do they cause joy?  And is the joy of seeing a beautiful
MotOS the same kind of joy as seeing an elegant theorem?  If not, which
category does the joy of music belong to, and does it matter whether the
music is "Holding Out for a Hero" or "Little Fugue in G Minor"?

(MotOS = Member of the Opposite Sex)

I have heard about a keyboard that could be designed that would be one
step beyond the Dvorak.  It would have just one row of keys, and key
combinations would signify the letters.  So keys 1 and 5 together could
represent "B", keys 3, 7 and 8 could represent @, and so forth.  The
name of this idea is a "chord board".

So far as I know, one has never been produced, and a web search turned
up MIDI stuff.  Maybe I have the wrong name.  But I was thinking this
would make a great interface for a wearable keyboard - a pressure
sensitive glove would allow you to type while playing "air piano".

Any thoughts?

Actually it is called a "chord keyboard" and if you search on that
phrase you will find many hits.  These keyboards are popular among
wearable computer users as they can be used while leaving one hand free.
I saw a guy with one at a party at Max's house seven or eight years ago;
he had a "Private Eye" LED based viewer device, the chord keyboard, and
various PC components in a wide belt he could strap around his belly.
It was somewhat cumbersome cummerbund but if you added a wireless net
connection it could be a pretty nice system.

This kind of keyboard is well known in the wearable computer community.
The most popular model is the Twiddler and sells for $200 I think.

     OK, let's talk about that.

     I have been much influenced by Frederick Mann's concept of building
freedom as opposed to fighting for freedom. Most of his work, therefore, is
in the area of building alternative institutions and structures for use now.

     These alternative institutions and structures make up a REAL free
market. Now, to complement this, it would be wonderful if structures and
dynamics for local co-operation were established. The knowledge and means
exist if people will use them and DO it. It does not seem to be happening
though.

     When I began the Telesis project, I considered myself to be an
Anarchist and began forwarding &#34;stories&#34; from the A-Infos anarchist news to
this mailing list. Over time, the news seemed to become increasingly
irrelevant to anything; and gradually I came to understand that the
mainstream ANARCHY(TM) movement that exists today is not at all
revolutionary and is largely ANTI-revolutionary.

     Another concept from Frederick Mann is that there are levels of freedom
with their own specific &#34;consciousness&#34; and related activities. &#34;Protest&#34;
(as a &#34;consciousness&#34; and activity) is actually a lower level. Today's
mainstream ANARCHY(TM) is a movement, philosophy
and &#34;consciousness&#34; of protest. Libertarianism, on the other hand, is rooted
in the concept of the Sovereign Individual. This principle DOES appear in
early Anarchist writings, but it is rarely discussed and certainly not
EXPRESSED in today's ANARCHY(TM) which is fanatically ANTI-INDIVIDUALIST. An
Anarchist(tm) is not a Sovereign Individual. No, s/he is completely
identified with the Mass, the &#34;working class&#34;, the oppressed, the victims.
Struggle and protest are the &#34;doingness&#34; that come from this &#34;beingness&#34;
(identity).

     J18: &#34;Man, we were all there...and we held up SIGNS!!!&#34;

     Which is about all that an Anarchist(tm) can do. S/He has identified
with powerlessness to the extent of making &#34;POWER&#34; itself a &#34;devil&#34; of hir
ideology. Lao Tzu observed long ago that social ills result from the
powerlessness of the people. However, the Anarchist(tm) has turned this
around. Rather than empowering themselves and other people, they seek to
exorcize &#34;POWER&#34; from the universe. The Anarchist(tm) is NOT a Sovereign
Individual and so can not BUILD FREEDOM.

     Now, I am not saying that protest does not have a place or serve a
purpose, but consider: What did J18 REALLY accomplish? A lot of energy went
into it worldwide. Would it not have been better if that energy had gone
into forming The sort of mutual aid societies and their connected community
centers that Hakim Bey discussed in his essay THE TONG or into local ACUR
(alternative currency) projects that would REALLY help to break the money
monopoly?

                                             Zero

..I'd like to be
under the sea...

Title
  Effects of L-glutamine on
  post-ischaemic cardiac function: protection and rescue.
Source
  Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology.  30(4):819-27, 1998 Apr.
Abstract
  We investigated the effects of L-glutamine
  (0-20 mM) on cardiac function. The isolated perfused working rat heart (left
  atrial and aortic pressures of 5 and 70 cm H2O, respectively) was subjected
  to 20 min of normothermic low-flow ischaemia followed by reperfusion for 35
  min. In the absence of glutamine, ischaemia-reperfusion caused an immediate
  significant (P < 0.01) fall in cardiac output from 46 to 20 ml/min, with a
  further deterioration to 17 ml/min at 35 min reperfusion. Ischaemia also
  caused a significant (P < 0.05) fall in myocardial glutamate from 2.6 to 1.8
  mumol/g wet weight; and ischaemia-reperfusion caused significant (each P <
  0.05) diminutions of myocardial ATP from 3.5 to 1.0 mumol/g wet weight and
  phosphocreatine from 4.8 to 1.5 mumol/g wet weight and resulted in
  significant (P < 0.05) accumulation of myocardial lactate from 0.9 to 4.3
  mumol/g wet weight. Glutamine, present throughout the perfusion protocol
  (i.e. prior to ischaemia), at or above 1.25 mM, prevented the
  post-ischaemic diminution of cardiac output and the
  deleterious changes in myocardial metabolites.
  Post-ischaemic treatment with glutamine at 2.5 mM completely
  prevented the post-ischaemic diminution of cardiac output
  and restored the myocardial metabolites to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine may
  be suitable as a cardioprotective and rescue agent. These
  effects may be mediated by maintenance of myocardial
  glutamate, ATP and phosphocreatine: and prevention of lactate accumulation.

So I take it you guys believe that a stock is worth something different to what the next guy will pay for it?

Warren Buffett and indeed many fundamental investors believe in "intrinsic value," a true value that may change over time, but bears only a passing resemblance to its current market price. The logic can't easily be refuted. According to the time value of money, a stock "should" be worth the net present value of its expected stream of future dividends, discounted by an appropriate interest rate. The problem lies in what constitutes an appropriate discount rate (it will vary with the opportunity cost of the individual or the institution, since some can borrow at lower rates or invest at higher rates than others), and in what a particular investor's expectation of future dividends is. So actually, you end up not with a single intrinsic value, but a bell curve of possible intrinsic values.

The second complication comes as a result of what George Soros calls reflexivity. On the micro level, a company which investors think is capable of producing a healthy stream of dividends will find buyers for its stock. It can then invest its capital in businesses that will enhance even further its ability to produce big dividends. Or, banks will like its expected cash flow and allow it to borrow at lower interest rates. The converse applies as well: companies with weaker prospects have to pay higher interest  rates and watch their share prices go down. Now, if investors and banks get it in their heads that a particular company has better prospects than they used to believe, they'll bid up the stock, and lend at lower rates, and the prospects of the company will indeed improve. So the virtuous or vicious spiral can start either way, with the company or with the market, and end up in the same place.

At the macro level, an investor without the discipline or the data to calculate his personal opinion of intrinsic value will rely on these facts -- intrinsic value lies somewhere in a range, and if it's rising it will likely continue to rise -- and aim to capitalise on the trend. He'll buy a rising stock because it's safe to assume it'll keep rising. The economics supports him.

Yes, stocks overshoot and create bubbles and panics. We know that just by looking around us. But the only alternative has decidedly un-extropian implications. The alternative requires us to assume that the true value of a stock (or any asset, for that matter) can be something different to what the next buyer says it is. Someone has to decide that an asset is "worth" a particular price, and be able to enforce that price. I say he (in most cases, a regulatory agency) has to be able to enforce it because, by pure market logic, there is more than one correct price, and investors will profit to the extent that the agency is willing to buy or sell at a price different to what the investors believe constitutes the appropriate level.

In some cases, such as the Malaysian ringgit during the past year, the enforcement takes the form of a withdrawal of the asset from the market. If you want to buy ringgit, you have to hold them for a year before you can sell them again. What's happening right now is that most investors here in Asia think that the ringgit is very undervalued, and they're buying it up in anticipation of a relaxation of capital controls. Suddenly, the game is moving against Malaysia -- they're selling their country too cheaply. Either they flood the market with newly minted ringgit and depreciate their currency, which hurts the country, or they let the currency float again, which means investors who bought ahead of the relaxation profit, which gives the investors profits which by rights should have accrued to Malaysia.

The market isn't always right -- as Soros puts it, it's almost always wrong. But it has such power that the "right" price moves towards the value the market puts on it every bit as much as the market price moves toward the right price. 

I believe that asking whether market efficiency is good or bad misses the point entirely. The only "real" price is the market price; anything else is fanciful and more often than not will lose its investor money.

Okay, so how do we spread some equity through the market, when information disseminates unequally and speculators over- and under-shoot all the time? (I'll get to taxes in a minute.) Well, insider trading laws don't in fact slow the process of disseminating information; their purpose is to prevent people who know more from acting on it before the information is "adequately" disseminated. 

Yes, there's a lot of grey area on what constitutes adequate dissemination. But the line has to be drawn somewhere, and if you wait until everyone in the world, or everyone who could possibly care, has the information before it can be acted on, you create such a disincentive to spread it around that you end up with one of two things. Either the market bcomes essentially void of this information, and prices never move at all, or more likely, you get a black market in information that transfers the profits to people who have figured out how to hoodwink the system.

As to speculators, let me note here that I've just watched them destroy Indonesia's hope, for five to ten years at least, of pulling itself out of the destitute status in which it's wallowed since World War II, and conferred similar if less-extreme fates for Thailand and perhaps Malaysia as well. 

I'm no fan of speculators, nor am I an apologist for their actions. But realise that all they've done, individually, is to attempt to capitalise on reflexivity -- on the adjustment of market and fundamental expectations from one level to another. In aggregate, they've exposed underlying weakness in the systems -- massive corruption in the Asian cases (which investors and bankers, prior to the crisis, knew all about but were ready to ignore), and similar ones in half a dozen crashes and panics in the past ten years.

Finally, as to tax differentials altering the investment profiles of investors, you're right. Investors make decisions based on their after-tax returns. In this regard, a flat tax, with no preferential capital gains treatment -- perhaps no capital gains tax at all -- might might make sense. But America isn't the world. Foreign investors operating in different tax regimes will continue to find incentives and disincentives other than those available to American investors, which again will distort the market. You can't avoid it without *all* tax regimes being identical. (And don't think the foreign presence in US markets is inconsequential. Consider just one counter example: consider the 300-500 basis points extra the US government, and by extension all Americans, would have to pay on debt if Japanese investors had not financed such a large part of the deficit for the past 25 years.)

Can we solve this problem? Not by top-down initiatives, that's for sure. Capital markets are a complex dynamical system like any other. Any top-down set of controls ultimately fails.

The only possibility lies in bottom-up change -- that is, in an evolution in people's utility functions. Things have to become more and less important, to everyone. More money has to become worth less to people than no more money at some point. People have to have a trigger which at some point says, "okay, that's enough for now," they way they do with food or sex. Perhaps posthumans will have this. It's certainly not built into humans.

Just a footnote: the word 'cracker' already has a well
accepted meaning within the african american subculture.  It
means 'white person', more or less an updated version of the
term 'honkey'.

And this usage has already gained widespread acceptance
among the legions of young, white suburban hiphop-heads who
emulate black culture.  This will inevitably hinder attempts
to push the hacker/cracker distinction into the mainstream.

Great idea -- but people have done that already.

I've been a computer hobbyist for a long time. In the late '70s,
Byte magazine had a construction article on such a device, and the software
to run it. the device was a hemisphere with the diameter of a tennis
ball. It had two buttons per finger, one under the fingertip and one under
the portion of finger nearest the palm. It had several buttons for the
thumb. The idea was that the finger position didn't change much.

There was a kit, also, with the buttons, the plastic hemisphere, and
other stuff. The user was supposed to customize the button positions
to fit the user's hand, so the device was personalized. users claimed
very high keying speeds, and the device was much cheaper than a keyboard.
keyboards weren't cheap back then.

While we extropians make a big deal out of physical and mental transformation, we are 
not alone.  Throughout recorded history, people have attempted to transform themselves,
in body, mental capabilities, personality, and behavior.  Exercise, liposuction, tattoos, 
prosthetics, education, meditation, psychotherapy, religion, AA meetings, etc.

Within decades, techniques will be vastly more effective, and available to all.  It's not
clear what will be the driving technologies, but it seems inevitable that memories and 
personality will become easily mutable.

Meanwhile, when I look to myself, I cherish few things as highly as the friends and family
I love.  The long-term friendships that span the many changes in our lives are particularly 
special.  Everyone I've ever discussed this with agrees, and paeans to love and friendship
abound in every culture's literature, throughout history.  

Indeed, how many of you subscribe to the list purely for its information content, and how 
many seek a community of shared interests and values?  How many consider someone 
they met through the list to be a friend?

While I am largely enthusiastic about our shared visions of the future, I'm uncertain about
the prospects for love and friendship.  

Today, you fall in love.  Your heart is broken.  You vow to stop falling into the same traps, 
falling for the same type of person.  Or you get pushed around, and vow to become more 
assertive.  And despite your vows, little is likely to change in your life.

But tomorrow, you can make those vows, go to bed, and wake up with no memory of the
miserable skunk who broke your heart, and a modified personality.

What happens to love and friendship when the two core qualities of friendship -- shared
memories and an affinity in your personalities -- can both change unrecognizably
overnight?  Or be transferred to other people?

Do you wake up in the morning and a web crawler tells you who your friends are today?

As a science fiction writer (among my other hats), I have often thought about this, but
cannot conjure up a future that I think is plausible that does not jeopardize both love and
friendship as I know them.  To me this seems an inevitable danger that scares me as
much as nanowarfare or deliberate grey goo.

A related question:  what are the evolutionary advantages to love and friendship?
What non-human species do you think have these experiences?

I play the saxophone, the first musical instrument that was designed
specifically for ergonomics.  On the sax, the left youngest finger covers
4 keys, the left ring and bird finger cover one, the left index covers two,
the left thumb covers one.  The right youngest finger covers two keys,
the ring, bird and index cover one each.  The right thumb does nothing
but help support the weight of the instrument.  The upper part of the
each index finger controls three keys.  Thats a total of 19 keys.  Using
combinations, I can produce the normal 33 chromatic pitches with unique
fingerings, and most importantly, the hands dont move much.

Watch a video of a good saxer, such as Charlie Parker.  When he be
wailing, and I mean when that cat be throwing DOWN the jazz, TEST-afyin
on that sax, notice his hands move very little.  And, a good sax player
can really move.  e.g. Spyro Gyra,  Kenny G.

A futuristic ergo-keyboard should be designed a lot like a saxphone.  spike

Well, yes, I think so.  But then, maybe I've been staring at my 
computer too much.  I've thought about this issue for a long time,
and over the years I've come to believe that there are strong 
connections between these various types of emotions.  I can only
speak for myself, though, of course.  For example, I think that the
"aha!" moment I get when finally understanding a difficult 
mathematical concept, or in figuring out a technical problem, is
*very* similar to the sudden burst of laughter that erupts when I
the punch line of a really good joke kicks in.  Irony is so 
delicious because it's about seeing patterns and analogies where
you wouldn't ordinarily expect them.

I saw an interview with George Foreman recently, where he was talking about
his heavyweight boxing career. He talked about how fear was his worst enemy
during his early years, about how when he went into the ring with the like
of Ali, his knees would shake and he'd be totally overwhelmed. He said it
was just downright frightening to be in the ring with those kinds of people.

Finally, one night he was about to step into the ring, and he found that he
wasn't afraid. He was cheerful, calm, confident. He got into the ring,
ready, relaxed, and had the crap beaten out of him.

He said that after that night, he spent a lot of time working to regain his
fear.

This is supported by studies of natural background radiation -vs- cancer rates in humans.  If one lives with a higher natural background radiation level you tend to lower cancer rates.

It's especially destructive that the EPA/government "paradigm", as you say, is a linear model.  Almost anything is poison at a high enough dose, including food, air, and water.  Even reading the entire transhuman news feed could be fatal (no time to eat!) :-}

And like oxygen, many things pass from poison to nutrient as the dose is lowered.
I guess many billions of dollars are blown on the wrong environmental problems due to this linear bone-headedness on the part of the "scientific" community.  Worse yet is the public mental "model" of the effect of radiation - "Any 'radiation' is dangerous.".

I think at least some aesthetic experience has to do with terrain
selection.  For example, my apartment overlooks a courtyard with a
fountain in it.  When I open the window, I hear the pleasant sound of
running water.  Why is that a pleasant sound?  Well, I would speculate
that early humans needed to be near water, where animals go to drink,
and can be hunted.  Also, of course, we need water ourselves, and the
most vegetation grows near water, giving the greatest likelihood for
finding edible plants.

A study was done where subjects around the world were presented with
four types of terrain - I can't remember now, but say conifer forest,
African grassland, Artic tundra, and climax forest.  People consistently
chose as their first preference the type of terrain that they lived in. 
But, around the world, everyone picked the African grassland as their
second choice.  (Source: my vague memory of Psychology Today, circa
1984).

The article speculated that it was humanity's African heritage that
causes people all over the world to make lush green lawns, whether the
local ecosystem could support them or not.

Most people hate (but are fascinated by) snakes, spiders, sharks and
scorpions; they like anything that looks like a baby, including cats and
dogs.  So many cultures have giant lizard myths (dragons) that I wonder
if we don't have some aesthetic memory of the dinosaurs.  

Of course most of these instincts are, for the most part, no longer
useful.  I would never tell someone else not to alter them.  But for
myself, the idea of no longer finding puppies cute and scorpions
horrifying  would really strike at my whole self-concept.  (Scorpions! 
Creatures of horror!  I had to work with them in the Entomology lab, and
one day I opened the cage to find tiny, translucent, ghostly baby
scorpions swarming all over the mother's back.  I was rather fond of the
four inch long Madagascar cockroaches, but my reaction to the little
scorpions could not possibly be described as rational.  If we find
another intelligent species that looks and moves like scorpions do, I'll
have to sign up for aesthetic alteration immediately.)

>From China Daily
Cellular research offers new clues about ageing

AS the new century dawns, people marvel at the striking progress that
mankind has made in the past 100 years. In 1900, the Chinese life expectancy
was below 35 years. Now it is over 70.
The improvement of medical level and living conditions is behind such
progress. But as the population growth rate drops, the country is now
beginning to face a new problem that has already bewildered the West _ the
ageing of its population.
A team of Chinese biologists is studying the mechanism of ageing at our most
fundamental level _ cells _ and their findings may provide clues for the
cure and prevention of ageing-related diseases.
The team, led by a couple, Tong Tanjun and Zhang Zongyu, professors at
Beijing Medical University, keeps a close eye on the latest international
developments in the fields of molecular biology and cell biology and has
also produced many of its own significant findings.
Why do we age? Biologists say we become old and develop diseases because the
cells inside our bodies also grow old and gradually lose their ability to
function.
Looking into the busy and mysterious world of cells, they have found many
elements that measure _ or even determine _ the rate of ageing.
One important element found by Western biologists is called telomeres,
special strings at the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from being
degraded and fused with other chromosomes. Whenever a cell divides, it loses
some telomere segments. The length of the telomeres can tell how often a
cell can divide and predict its death.
Experiments by the Chinese team support this finding and have made other
discoveries. The team examined blood cells of 180 unrelated Chinese donors,
aged from 25 to 65, and found a significant correlation between age and
telomere length.
The average telomere length of the young group (25 years old) was 8750 bp
(base pairs), 18 per cent longer than the old group (65 years old). On the
average, a donor loses about 35 bp of telomere length each year.
However, the loss rate of telomere segments is different among the donors,
varying from 57 to 9 bp each year. "This explains why some people look older
or younger than their actual age," said 64-year-old Professor Zhang.
"Telomeres can be regarded as a human 'biomarker.' They can tell the rate of
ageing in our bodies more accurately than chronological age."
The experiment has also found clear differences between men and women
donors. It found the telomere length of men is longer than that of women of
the same age. But they also found that men lose 3 bp more telomeres each
year than women.
"People often wonder why women tend to live longer than men. From the
experiment results, we know the answer on the molecular level. Men age more
quickly than women," Zhang said.
As people grow older, body cells divide and continuously lose their telomere
segments, she said. When the telomere length is shortened to a certain
degree, cells can no longer divide and die.
However, there are special kinds of cells that are virtually immortal.
Cancer cells can divide an infinite number of times.
Scientists found that cancer cells also lose their telomere segments when
they divide. However, the cells have an enzyme called telomerase that
synthesizes telomeres to restore the lost parts. Thus their telomere length
never shortens, which explains why cancer spreads.
"Telomerase is the element which keeps cancer cells immortal. By blocking
the enzyme, we may find a way to check the growth of cancer cells. The
results of our animal experiments have proved this possibility," said the
64-year-old Professor Tong.
The team injected human breast cancer cells into experimental mice and the
mice developed tumours. By blocking telomerase, it found that the growth
rate of the cancer cells was decelerated and the tumours became smaller.
"The experiment result is really exciting," said Tong. "Although we haven't
done tests in humans, there is a great possibility that we can develop a
drug that suppresses cancer telomerase and stop tumours from growing. It
could be a breakthrough, as we could get a new weapon to fight this deadly
disease."
Studying the function of telomerase, biologists have another hypothesis. If
it were added to living human cells, would the cells grow forever without
stopping, just as cancer cells? If this were so, humans would be able to
live as long as they like.
"Yes, theoretically," Professor Tong said, adding that some Western
biologists have successfully cloned telomerase DNA, transferred it into
living cells in cultivation and increased the lifespan of a cell by many
generations.
However, Tong said, although telomerase activity can prolong a cell's life,
it cannot make it immortal. There is more than one element that determines
ageing.
Tong said another element affecting the ageing of cells is their ability to
repair damaged DNA.
He said DNA, which contains the genetic code and transmits the heredity
pattern, would be injured when attacked by pollutants within the body or
externally by ultraviolet radiation or chemicals. One of its two strands
could break and prevent the DNA from transmitting the heredity message
normally.
Living cells have the ability to repair the damage and the heredity message
can be transmitted from one generation to the next. But, as living things
grow older, their ability to repair damaged DNA gradually declines.
The research team discovered that, when attacked by chemicals from outside,
the DNA of both young and old experimental mice was damaged. After a period
of time, however, the young mice had their broken DNA strands reconnected
while the old ones had difficulty in repairing them.
Human cells also displayed different abilities to repair DNA damage between
the young and the old.
The team used human diploid fibroblasts (2BS), a special kind of cell
biologists like to use because they last longer than ordinary cells and are
suitable for observation.
The experiment found that, when treated with the same dose of chemicals,
both young and senescent 2BS cells were damaged and looked like comets.
After 12 hours, the "tails" of young cells disappeared, but it seemed that
the old could hardly recover. (See photo below)
DNA damage often results in many kinds of senescence-related diseases, said
Professor Zhang, adding that the team has done research on a specific kind
of DNA whose deletions are associated with diabetes, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular diseases.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an important role in the metabolism of
cells. It is like a generator that helps turn the food we eat into energy.
But the process also produces a waste, oxygen free radicals or oxidants,
which damage DNA and cause fragment deletions. MtDNA is very vulnerable to
oxidants and it has no ability to repair the damage once attacked.
The team's experiment has found, using healthy mice, no mice in the young
group have mtDNA deletions while in the old group, 50 per cent do. When
suffering from cerebral ischemia, a shortage of blood supply to the brain,
every single old mice suffered mtDNA deletions, 30 per cent more than in the
young group.
The experiment result, published in the New York-based Journal of Cellular
Biochemistry (1999, Vol 73), indicates that mtDNA deletions are associated
with ageing. Professor Zhang said this finding provides a clue for the cure
and prevention of ageing-related diseases, such as cerebrovascular diseases,
one of the three top causes of death among the elderly in China.
Since mtDNA deletions are caused by oxidants, would we live longer and
healthier by reducing them?
"Yes," Professor Zhang said. "One of the solutions is to appropriately
restrict the amount of food we eat. Experiments on rodents and primates have
found that they age slower if their diets are restricted."
One of the other reasons that proper diet can keep people fit is that
excessive food intake will increase the level of glucose in blood. When our
blood glucose is at a high level, a process called non-enzymatic glycation
takes place and produces waste. The waste gradually sticks to DNA and
proteins and impedes their ability to function normally.
The team's experiment with two groups of young and old people discovered
that the old had more glycation waste in their bodies. This means that the
old are more vulnerable to experiencing a glycation reaction when having a
high level of blood glucose.
Professor Zhang said the glycation waste, which causes age spots on the skin
of old people, may correlate with the decline of heart, kidney and immune
functions among old people and diabetes patients.
Proper diets will keep the blood glucose of the elderly at a normal level,
which reduces glycation reaction and produces less waste, she suggested.
Declining to comment on the self-claimed health-enhancing medicinal products
in the Chinese market, she said people can turn to natural food to clear
oxidants and glycation waste, such as carrots, chives, eggplant and other
kinds of food that have an abundance of Vitamin E, A and C.
Restricting diets may prolong our lives for several years. According to
pioneer biologists in the West, people may be able to live decades or even
centuries beyond the generally accepted maximum life span of 120 years. The
trick is to manipulate the genes which determine ageing.
"There are 'longevity genes' and 'ageing genes' inside a human body. They
are like many 'lights.' They take turns turning on and off. Altogether they
determine the ageing of a human body. What a biologist can do is to observe
the mechanism of these lights, find their rules and finally turn them on and
off to meet the needs of humans," Professor Tong said.
"Biology has come to an era of genes. By manipulating genes, humans will see
dramatic changes to their life and many of our dreams may come true, much
sooner than we expect," he said.
He said Western biologists have been doing research on gene manipulation and
have succeeded in prolonging animals' lives by transferring "longevity
genes" into fertilized eggs before the birth.
"We cannot say that our research is pioneering the world, although we lead
the domestic study in this field," Tong said. "Our work is greatly hindered
by funding shortages, a brain drain and language barriers."
The team's achievements on the mechanism of ageing and biomarkers have
resulted in a Scientific Progress Grant from the National Science
Foundation. The foundation provided 580,000 yuan (US$70,000) for the team's
research from 1993-97.
"We have 11 funds altogether helping us, but they are still far from enough.
Experiments are always time-consuming and cost a lot. And we are losing our
talent every year."
They are now tutoring eight students who are pursuing MD's. Many of their
students and research fellows have gone abroad in search of better labs. "We
are like grandparents tutoring grandchildren," Professor Zhang said.
"One must have an interest in this field in order to withstand the
hardships," Professor Tong said, smiling. "But nothing can replace the
exhilaration that a new finding brings."

Well, do you want transhumanism to remain obscure, or do you
want it to grow? If you want the latter, you better start using some
flashy graphics. Good-looking webpages simply get (a lot) more
traffic and media attention, just like good-looking people get more
attention than ugly or plain ones.

Frankly I've never understood what's so transhuman about making
minimal use of webpage-enhancing technologies. IMHO, a "perfect" 
webpage is not only fast-loading and informative, but also visually 
pleasing. The design has to enhance the desired emotional impact 
of the text. Transhuman pages should ideally icorporate the latest 
in web technology and artistic design; a boring text-only page 
(some people don't even bother to set a background color) is fit for
Luddites and Amish, not for technophiles like us.

This reminds me of a conversation I had when I was in law school.  One of my 
professors was a noted authority on constitutional and federal procedural law 
who, but for a particularly stupid burglary in a Washington D.C. office 
building, might today be Chief Justice.  Like everyone else who studied under 
him, I was in awe, not least of which because he has argued so many important 
cases in the Supreme Court.  I asked him when he stopped being anxious about 
the pressure of standing up and arguing a case in court.  He responded, 
"Never.  I still get nervous every single time I walk into a courtroom."  He 
explained that only a stupid lawyer doesn't have this feeling.  He then more 
than earned his tuition by offering me some practical tips for channeling and 
overcoming that feeling.

Almost all emotions serve vital functions in mental life.  They serve as 
motors and gauges.  I think transhumanists should aim to refine our emotions, 
but not to do away with them.  (I also think that the idea of a truly 
sentient AI without emotions is like imagining an automobile without a motor 
or instruments.)

It's easy to start my own company, it's not easy to start my

I'm a little curious,  what euphemism for "state" have the
"stateless socialists" invented to describe the entity that forces
people who don't want to be socialists (like me) to give up their property?

It looks to me like the www is going through a sort of adolescent 
fascination with graphics and gadgets. However, an increasing number of 
designers are learning to use colors and graphics wisely, which is good. I 
find gratuitous graphics, animations, and especially background music 
quite annoying on web pages. This is not to say that any of these things 
can't be used to enhance the presentation, just that they have to fit, not be 
used just because it's possible.

On a really good page, you don't notice the color scheme and are not 
distracted by any of the media stuff unless you're specifically thinking 
about the design. Content rules.

I'd say we likely want _anyone_ who's attracted to the memes and able to
assimilate them.
Personally, I enjoy good graphics though I have to agree that some
(backgrounds, in particular) can get in the way of the information.

Going through?  The phase is almost over, in my view.  Or, at least,
graphics/gadgets have been the norm for years, especially with people
putting up new pages.

Same here!

It's a matter of developing good taste, I think, as opposed to
flashiness for the sake of flashiness.  It's like the difference, to
me, between _2001: A Space Odyssey_ and _The Fifth Element_.

In a way, I'm sorry I started this thread, but it's hard to know where a

It far more complex than the old labels would have us believe. We are now in
The New World Order, an interventionist model of social control that would
make Nazi's and Communists blush. This is a multi level government\corporate
system of social control justified by every blown out of proportion media event.

For the latest round take a look at:


              Zeal to Rein In Teens Grows, as Does Backlash 
              By MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writer

http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/FRONT/t000059611.html 

The recent decision to exempt states from federal law is another example as
this will lead to many state and local laws which infringe on individual rights.

Also the recent changes to medicare will intrude in the doctor/patient
relationship. Under the new rules if your doctor recommended a procedure not
covered by medicare you could not pay them directly. 

Another example are the recent attempts to control content on the Internet.

These are not new trends. You might want to take a look at James Bovard's
1994 book "Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty"

I'm a style over content man myself.  Probably because I don't have any
content to speak of.  My web site http://members.tripod.com/~transhuman/
hasn't changed since the day I put it up and has absolutely no content.
But man that red background is stylish!  (Just don't use the dialog box
because that list has moved and if you did the jaws of hell would open and
swallow me up.)

I have lucid dreamed a few times, but now I always wake up immediately after
I
become lucid.  Does anyone happen to know how to stop this from happening?
I have heard that as soon as you become lucid, you become more aware of
outside stimula because you are more aware of your senses than in normal

Aesthetic memory could have been formed in the evolution of our
squirrel-like distant ancestors, which were contemporaries with the
dinosaurs.

That's what I took it to mean anyways.

I meant that our very distant ancestors, the mammals who co-existed with
the dinosaurs, might have developed an instinct to fear all giant
lizards.  It seems possible - although, I admit, romantically
speculative - that the instinct persists in a vestigial form.  

I suspect the other instincts that I named date from pre-human evolution
as well.

Evolution is miraculous, but it isn't very efficient.  Neither the human
body nor the human brain has a designer.  Thus, weird stuff can end up
in the works.

  Here's an idea I've been kicking around, in my desire to help further the 
progress of LE techniques & technologies w/o (yet!) having the ability to do 
the technical work myself:

  Create a grassroots 'communication center' for current LE
researchers, future LE researchers, and other interested parties with
services/materials they wish to donate (or can provide at non-profit
rates). Each party would fill in either what they are studying, hope to 
study, or what sort of study they want to support, and the Project
would put matching parties in contact with each other--sort of like a
dating service. Everything would be done an individual-by-individual
basis--I imagine that progress will be most fertile on that level.

  It would be private, non-profit, and self-funded. It would act entirely 
for the benefit of our species' greatest heroes, all current LE scientists. 
It would be designed as a resource to aid them in searching for individual 
LE funding, help find the right intern (me!), or anything else that they 
might find useful (that I am capable of doing).

  Has anything like this already been tried (or is in operation now)?

  Does anyone foresee any possible stumbling-blocks to such a project?
(I'm talking to you, current LE scientists (and potential LE benefactors)!)

  [Tentatively:] Would anyone here add such a Project to their web
site's links, or perhaps be willing to mirror its forms altogether?

  All other criticisms, comments, suggestions, etc. are *welcome*!

Recent research indicates that idiot-savants that have photographic memories
do not have this filter.  Everything they see is recorded permanently.  It
is theorized that this is the root of many of their problems.  Instead of
generalizing data into patterns that can be used to understand new events of
the same pattern, these people record every single event without
generalizing them into patterns.  They can recall perfectly hundreds of
prior events, but when the same thing happens again, they are at a loss to
predict the outcome.

When transhumans develop perfect memories, I think such memories need to be
kept accessible, but that generalization and pattern matching need to be
maintained.  I'm not sure if access to all the specific details provides too
much data for pattern matching to work.  It may be that if we are currently
conscious of every detail at all times, that our minds will be too
overloaded with data to make any sense out of it.

Yes, this is exactly right.  You become more aware of outside stimula,
because you realize that you are really in bed asleep, and you tend to start
trying to see and feel the real world instead of the dream.

The spinning idea was published in Discover magazine, and they said they
didn't know why it worked.  I don't think that balance has anything to do
with it.  With many years of experience, I have my own theory.  I believe
that when you start spinning, your field of vision moves around to see new
things that were outside of your field of view before.  Your
dream-generating parts of your mind have to go into full dream-production
mode to generate the new field of view.  This strengthens the dream, and
also gives you more dream stimulus to interpret, so you are less likely to
detect the real world stimulus.

The only thing that makes sense about the balance is that you don't want
your internal sense of balance to realize that you are lying down.  You want
to dream that you are standing up (usually).  Spinning might confuse this
sense to be unsure which way is down, and which way you are lying down.  I
still prefer my first theory above.

The other problem with dreams is remembering them.  Dreams go into temporary
memory and are not usually recorded into long term memory.  It is like when
you are driving down the road and pass many cars.  You don't think about
them and don't remember them later.  This is because the conscious mind
filters everything and only records the important stuff.  Dreams are somehow
determined to be unimportant, so they fade away quickly.  To remember your
dreams, you need to recount the dream to yourself as soon as you wake up.
Try to remember every detail in order as it happened.  If you do this, your
conscious awake mind takes note of the information, and it will be
remembered as an important conscious waking thought.

Such a thing is coming Sasha.  It was proposed several years
ago, but the infrastructure to do distributed computing has
developed over just the past couple years to make it practical
with Scott Kurowski and George Woltman's Mersenne Prime
Search and of course SETI@home.  I foresee within 10 yrs
most home computers will be connected to some form of
distributed computing and will stop wasting idle CPU cycles.
Then there will be an enormous disembodied computing amoeba
out there, just waiting for people to suggest problems for it
to envelop and devour, such as Eleizer's singularity problem.  spike

I want it to grow, but in this early phase I'd like to recruit the
more intelligent people. Right now we're not in danger of getting too
many such, so we'd better watch our step.

You make it sound as lots of traffic and media attention are all
absolutely good things. Cryonics, for instance, has generated lots of
media attention. Since 98% of anything mass culture produces is crap 
I don't care much for transhumanism being appreciated by the mass 
culture. Call me a snob, if you wish.

Since its very beginnings, and particularly now, the IT technology is
suffering from one big problem: inability to define standards that age 
well. The more bells & whistles you use, the shorter the readability
window and the percentile of users you can reach. In contrast to a
"boring text-only page" as http://smople.thehub.com.au/~mitch/ , a 
'cute' graphics-only entry page won't get indexed by search engines. 

Do you think all these guys don't know anything about web design?

A browser-dependant page with huge gifs, Java, Shockwave and JavaScript

I guess I should be looking for Grail or Opera. Losing state in 30
Netscrape windows due to crash (even with Java/JavaScript disabled)

crash?

Oops sorry Elizabeth, my bad.  I should take the time to look up
aesthetic
memory before typing...  {8^D  Sagan goes down this path a little ways
in his book Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.  There's another precursor
to this notion in his Cosmic Connection, but it is not a scientific
argument really,
just one of those wonderfully intriguing ideas at which Sagan was so
brilliant.

There is a difference between looking good and being flashy. 

Berrie Staring brought up a good point on TransVision: advertising
transhumanism doesn't seem to work, we don't convert people
easily. But people roughly sharing our values and ideas often get
interested when they run across information about us in magazines or
on the net, read more, and eventually seek us out. That might not be
the way to become a huge movement, but it might be a good way of
getting dedicated, interested members and build a base of credibility.

> Frankly I've never understood what's so transhuman about making
> minimal use of webpage-enhancing technologies.

A theory: many transhumanists were very early with building web pages,
in the good old days before Netscape started crashing standards. Then
the core structures have remained unchanged, partially because it is
easier to add stuff than change paradigm, and partially because many
of us are so busy. Besides, many of the enhancing techniques aren't
that enhancing.

Using the latest enhancements is usually a good way of ensuring that
people can't read your page. There is a tradeoff between using
everything available and providing reliable service. 

I agree that pages should look good - I'm addicted to good visual
design - but in the long run content wins over style. 

BTW, any suggestions on how you would like to improve my web? I will
be doing major updating this summer (I even have hired a friend to
help me), so here is your chance to influence it.

Cool, I like being romantically speculative.  {8^D

Speaking of which, consider:  we normally think of scientific discovery
as something that happens one day, in a lab, with far-side caricatures
of guys in white lab coats with test tubes, etc.  But we have before us
now a discovery which is taking place slowly, over 40 years: the
incredibly mind boggling evidence that our species is evidently drifting
around this big old galaxy...alone.

I used to feel this conclusion was far too sad to be true, but now I realize

how cheerful this is:  aaaaallll thaaat stuuuuuff out there, is ours.  If we

just go out there and take it.  No need for any star wars, space death
lasers, none of that.  Just go and move in.  What could possibly be
better than that?

Join our Extropians SETI team.  If you set it as a screen saver, it does
get out of your way.  Quit wasting all those CPU cycles.  Even when
you are doing something on your computer, about 99% of the cycles
are no-ops.  spike

I don't think the big lizard fear would persist for 65 million years,
but clearly we have some built in fear - or rather respect - for big
animals (just study children and other mammals when somebody towers
above them). We certainly seem to have a built in fear/respect for
insects and snakes, even if it does not lead to real fear or phobias
except in some people.

My favorite is Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst
or ACHOO Syndrome (also called photic sneeze response):
sunlight-induced sneezing. Many people (24% of the population) have a
mis-connection in the trigemnial nucleus, making bright light
stimulate axons from the nasal cavity, starting the sneezing reflex.

Makes you start wondering how many other weird connections there are.

The question is then if this improved fear isn't just fear. The
valence of an experience such as pain can be changed through mental
discipline; maybe it is better to change the valence of fear rather
than removing the emotion (given the problems people with Kluver-Bucy
amygdala damage have just due to their fearfulness, it seems to be a
good idea).

Having a rousing emotion for dangerous situations is useful. The
problem is that we just have a general purpose fear that is best tuned
for physical danger. I think we might have more use with developing
two more kinds of fear-reactions, one for social dangers and one for
purely rational dangers, without all the body reactions that distract
us.

>    I have no use for ANXIETY, and would remove it.

Anxiety is a constant low-level fear reaction, and usually not
useful. It might be a good thing if you are hiding in the jungle from
something, since it places you in a constant readiness mode with high
I/O, but in most modern situations it is just pathological.

Most people seem to experience a negative emotion they call loneliness
when they feel they lack emotional ties with other humans around them
or are in a situation where they are far from other humans. A quite
natural reaction for pack animals. I think you have evolved away from
it a bit, KPJ (as for myself, I seem to experience it far less than
most humans - I must be a half-vulcanite :-).

> 4. I would also remove various irrational emotions, such as envy and jealosy.

I think it is important to make a distinction between the desire for
having something good that somebody else possess and the desire to
remove the thing from his possession. The first state can be
stimulating to achieve more ("KPJ has a wearable! Great idea! I must
get one too!"), but in zero-sum situations it easily leads to the
second, destructive state. So we better refine envy and make sure the
world is positive-sum.

(Hmm, what are the proper english words for these two states? In
Swedish it is likely "avund" and "missunsamhet" - trust the Swedes to
have subtle nuances for envy :-)

I disagree here. If I become angry and break things or people, then my
actions are irrational (since they are not in my best interest) and
undesirable - here some rational control obviously is
desirable. Sometimes emotions suggest actions that are bad for us.

What is needed is to balance the emotions, which provide us with
motivation and creates a mode of thinking, with rational evaluation of
situations. Just like we need to learn how to learn, think rationally
and act, we need to learn how to manage our emotions. They work great
in certain respects, but not all.

I certainly agree here. I'm quite glad my brain biochemistry and
cognitive structures make me feel this way most of the time, it has
helped me tremendously and I have seen people destroy their lives just
by being negative towards themselves and everything else. The problem
is of course creating a stable (but not inflexible) good mood; drugs
might help, but positive thinking and self-insight work even better -
but they are hard to apply for negative people.

You could have two memory caches, one "external" storing all the
primary data (including mental state stuff etc) but doesn't change at
all, one "internal" to the main cognitive process that generalizes and
grows. As you recall something, you could consciously dip into the
external memory that matches it best. A bit like using a remembrance
agent or take a look in your old mail.

We are currently designing such a website. We just applied for tax-exempt
status for Never Say Die Foundation and will be raising funds for LE research.

As soon as we're a little farther along, we'll announce our address, etc.
Meanwhile, please write or call with any suggestions.

Considering that humanity originated from an area that was inhabited by
crocodilia that grew upwards of 30-50 feet long, we don't need to
'remember' T Rex at all.

Why not something like a 3com Airconnect made with digital pulse

A juice bar or coffee cafe visitor doesn't need the whole 11Mbps

maybe 7Mbs downstream and 1.5Mbps upstream bandwidth.


In a plausible scenario, 15 laptop users slam a Starbucks cafe at

single black box with AirConnect type annena.  Assuming they all have 
PCMCIA Airconnect modems, can the black box efficiently share

There is a great misuderstanding of the word "covet" and "covetousness"
as in the last of the Judeo-Christian ten commandments.
[In fact there are 11 of them there, count them.  Tradition has been so
eager to make it 10, the Catholics have combined the first two and the
protestants the last two...  {8^D  but I digress.]

In a zero sum game like the ancient farming culture, it makes sense to
forbid coveting your neighbor's stuff.  But today, in our manufacturing/information

based economy, why not covet?  Even more so, in our future nanotech
world, where manufacturing becomes ever easier and cheaper, why
not covet?  Covet away.  avund and missunsamhet are not only harmless,
they are *required* for a healthy information/nanotech capable economy.

Forgetting a dream involves movement, if one jumps quickly out of bed and
into the day, the dream tends to become lost. Take your time upon waking,
lie there a moment and recall the dream, pehaps in a dream journal. I have
tried this myself, and it works. Although I have also found myself recalling
dreams from days ago or the previous night when I lay down to GO to sleep.
 I have to admit though, I have very vivid dreams, and in my childhood have
walked downstairs, eaten pillows and took showers with my clothes on. Since
puberty these problems have regressed, well completely disappeared, I stay
in bed and am left with colourful realistic dreams instead. They are so
strong that I often think about them thrughout the day, or connect them to
another dream later. Someone on the list mentioned getting work done in
their dreams. I have dreamt of things that I have woken up with a vision of
some new gadget or item in my dream, that I've never seen before and have
drawn in out. (and I've thought was a good idea, however out of my ability
to create)
I've gotten some responses about my late to bed and late to rise comment.
One of them was that perhaps it is genetic. I have thought about this,
because going to bed late has given rise to people fussing at me, implying
that this is intentional. I do work at home on my computer, so there is no
interference with a job. However sometimes, at meetings etc. I hate getting
up early and am warped throughout the whole thing. (I've decided from now
on, I'll show up late)
But I have heard myself say, my internal alarm clock is screwed up and have
given this some thought.
I've asked around and came up with a theory (purely unscientific of course),
I was born at 12:30 at night and several of my friends with the same problem
were also. While others born early in the morning fall asleep at the drop of
a hat. It may be crazy, but just a thought.
If I was living in some land, four hours later then here, I'd have perfect
sleeping habits!

But this is possible already, without drugs or nanotech or genetic engineering. Why would anyone opt for the technological approach to something like this when you have no idea of the side-effects? Cognitive psych has been studying this very thing for 30 years or more, with the advantage that if the emotion you don't like actually serves a purpose (and it usually does, if you take the time to learn what it is), that you can develop an alternative mechanism to address that need.

Just because Prozac or Instant Smile or whatever doesn't make you feel intoxicated, it doesn't mean your problems won't still be there when you come down.

   >        Personally, I would opt to exorcise any trace of fear or anxiety.

*Any* trace? What about the fear of driving too fast? Or of the guy with a knife demanding your money?

May I suggest that the emotions we dislike aren't emotions about primary experience, but emotions about emotions. We feel fear, but we get agitated about feeling that fear because just now it might hurt our performance of a particular, important task, like making a speech or standing up to the office bully. The original emotion almost always serves a purpose -- in these cases, it gets your heart rate up and sharpens your senses, both of which can be useful. But when we try to stanch the emotion we create an internal conflict that blocks our mentation. I'd suggest that what you're after is full, congruent emotion -- flow, it's been called, among other things -- so that your meta-emotions function in line with your primary emotions. It's a simple matter, though not always an easy one, to program in this adjustment.

It seems to me that we have so many undeveloped resources at our disposal already that much of the time finding a technological means to effect change just hides a lack of willpower. People can multiply huge numbers in their head; people can control their heart rate; people can view remote locations; people can cure themselves of cancer. These and hundreds of other examples are documented extensively. On a more mundane level, people can edit their emotional palette, "sell ice boxes to eskimos" (sorry), learn multiple languages at any stage in their life, and so on.

To date, what we haven't as a species been able to do is to learn to do things like this without a change in lifestyle, and I think that's the allure of technology. We can stay the same old slobs and also live to be a hundred. But I wouldn't have thought this had much to do with extropianism.

Harvey, I'm quite interested in how to do this. Like many of us I suppose, I resent the time I have to sleep but realise the necessity. If I could make it productive I'd instantly increase my "life expectancy" by 50%.

Can you direct me somewhere for a "lucid dreaming for dummies" page or book, or post the basics?

thanks

Just by the way, how do you figure?

If the bet is a simple "up" vs "down," you either double your money or lose it all. Relative to the stock itself, that's a lot of risk. Even if you bet wrong on a stock, you can usually get out at a loss of less than 100%.

This is just a very simple form of an option, which you can buy already for most big stocks. (You can do this bet exactly with a combination of options.)

As well, consider the casino that takes bets like this. In order to hedge itself against catastrophic loss it has to make offsetting bets in the underlying market. Basically, it has to take the exact opposite bet in the market, unless it can find someone else to make the opposite bet. Now granted, a lot of the time there will be a seller for every buyer, but not all of the time. That's why prices go up and down. And the difference on its books will have to be hedged by an investment opposite to their net position in the market.

So actually, having this ability would probably increase the volatility of the market rather than decrease it.

Title
  The effect of exposure to negative air ions
  on the recovery of physiological responses after moderate endurance exercise.
Source
  International Journal of Biometeorology.  41(3):132-6, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
  This study examined the effects of negative air ion exposure
  on the human cardiovascular and endocrine systems during rest and during the
  recovery period following moderate endurance exercise. Ten healthy adult men
  were studied in the presence (8,000-10,000 cm-3) or absence (200-400 cm-3) of
  negative air ions (25 degrees C, 50%
  humidity) after 1 h of exercise. The level of exercise was adjusted to
  represent a 50-60% load compared with the subjects' maximal oxygen uptake,
  which was determined using a bicycle ergometer in an unmodified environment
  (22-23 degrees C, 30-35% humidity, 200-400 negative air
  ions.cm-3). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values during
  the recovery period were significantly lower in the presence of
  negative ions than in their absence. The
  plasma levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were significantly lower
  in the presence of negative ions than in
  their absence. These results demonstrated that exposure to
  negative air ions produced a slow recovery
  of DBP and decreases in the levels of 5-HT and DA in the recovery period
  after moderate endurance exercise. 5-HT is thought to have contributed to the
  slow recovery of DBP.

Abstract
  The physical effects of negative air ions
  on humans were determined in an experimental sauna room equipped with an
  ionizer. Thirteen healthy persons took a wet sauna bath (dry bulb temperature
  42 degrees C, relative humidity 100%, 10 min exposure) with or without
  negative air ions. The subjects were not
  told when they were being exposed to negative air
  ions. There were no differences in the moods of these
  persons or changes in their blood pressures between the two saunas. The
  surface temperatures of the foreheads, hands, and legs in the sauna with
  negative ions were significantly higher
  than those in the sauna without ions. The pulse rates and
  sweat produced in the sauna with ions were significantly
  higher than those in the sauna without ions. The results
  suggest that negative ions may amplify the
  effects on humans of the sauna.

  Treatment of seasonal affective disorder with a high-output
  negative ionizer.
Source
  Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine.  1(1):87-92, 1995 Jan.
Abstract
  This study was designed to evaluate the antidepressant effect of
  negative ions in the ambient air as a
  potential treatment modality for seasonal affective disorder. Twenty-five
  subjects with winter depression underwent a double-blind controlled trial of
  negative ions at two exposure densities, 1
  x 10(4) ions/cm3 or 2.7 x 10(6) ions/cm3,
  using an electronic negative ion generator with wire corona
  emitters. Home treatments were taken in the early morning for 30 min over 20
  days, followed by withdrawals. The severity of depressive symptoms
  (prominently including the reverse neurovegetative symptoms of hypersomnia,
  hyperphagia, and fatigability) decreased selectively for the group receiving
  high-density treatment. Standard depression rating scale assessments were
  corroborated by clinical impressions. When a remission
  criterion of 50% or greater reduction in symptom frequency/severity was used,
  58% of subjects responded to high-density treatment while 15% responded to
  low-density treatment (chi 2 = 5.00, df = 1, p = 0.025). There were no side
  effects attributable to the treatment, and all subjects who responded showed
  subsequent relapse during withdrawal. Treatment with a high-density
  negative ionizer appears to act as a specific antidepressant
  for patients with seasonal affective disorder. The method may be useful as an
  alternative or supplement to light therapy and medications.

  Trial of a negative ion generator device in remediating
  problems related to indoor air quality.
Source
  Journal of Occupational Medicine.  33(6):681-7, 1991 Jun.
Abstract
  It has been suggested that supplementation of indoor air with
  negative ions can improve air quality. This
  study examined the effects of a "negative ion-generator"
  device on air contaminants and symptom reporting in two office buildings.
  Separate sets of functional and nonfunctional negative ion
  generators were monitored using a double blind, crossover design involving
  two 5-week exposure periods. There were no detectable direct or residual
  effects of negative ion generator use on air ion levels,
  airborn particulates, carbon dioxide levels, or symptom reporting. Symptom
  reporting declined at both sites initially and appeared to be consistent with
  placebo effect. Job dissatisfaction was an apparent contributor to symptom
  reporting, with a magnitude comparable to presumed effects of air quality.
  Further testing of such devices is needed before they should be considered
  for office air quality problems.

Okay, I'm harping a bit, but let's go over this logic if you don't mind; I didn't ever respond to the original post.

Not really out of nowhere. People buy stocks because they expect them to go up in value, regardless of whether they buy them from the corporation that issues them or in the stock market. Second point, it does ground eventually. At some point the expectation that the stock price will continue to go up fizzles out, and the price does stop going up. It's utterly -- ultimately, in fact -- rational.

It sounds like you're saying there should be a division between what's called the primary market, where people buy stocks from corporates, and the secondary market, where people buy stocks from each other. But since the two prices are always equal, making this division fails to reward the investor in the primary market, since he can't sell his stock on.

Yes. Forever. And that's all you ever get for your investment -- a stream of dividends. But surely that expected stream of dividends is worth something today, and you may need the cash today rather than waiting for your two bucks a share a year forever. What would you pay me if I promised to pay you two bucks a year forever? Whatever figure you put on it, imagine someone comes up to you and offers a dollar more for the right to receive those dividends instead of you. Would you sell if you could? Of course you would. What you're suggesting translates to forbidding that transaction.

But Elizier, the reason he can buy a speedboat is because he assumed the risk that the company wouldn't be able to keep up its stream of dividends. It turned out they could, and the value of the stock rose, and he sold it at a higher price than he bought it for. He was rewarded for taking the risk. And that's all to the good -- in fact that's the essence of capitalism, assuming the risk on behalf of someone else.

What you may be chafing at is the idea that stock prices move out of line with what you can expect to be rewarded with for the risks you're taking. We call that a bubble, and I posted on that yesterday, so I won't bore you. But the thing to remember is that those day traders are still taking the risk, though they may have forgotten that point. If they're holding the stock and they turn out wrong, they'll still suffer the losses.

So if the secondary market is moved off of the stock exchanges and into the casinos, it's no longer a stock market? What exactly does that do that's any different from what happens on the exchanges now? Well, unless the regulations for trading at the casino are as strict as they are for trading on the exchanges now, it makes for more opportunity for insider trading, and increases the volatility. The participants will be the same: they can no longer get what they want on the exchanges, so they'll just move to the casinos. This will become the new market, and it'll be the same as or worse than what we have now.

No, no, no. It's a positive-sum game for all of them. Mostly these guys aren't geniuses or rocket scientists. If it were zero-sum, market factors would have generated insufficient profits for them to continue to exist.

   >> What we need is, (a) actual market-gambling casinos; (b) some way for

All market-gambling casinos do is to move some of the players from one locale to another. And since if prices diverge that creates an arbitrage opportunity between the markets, the two prices will have to converge and it will accomplish nothing.

As to your second point, there are mutual funds set up expressly for this purpose. Dozens of them, in fact.

People are buying stocks because the present value of the stream of dividends they expect to receive in the future from owning them is greater than the cost of buying the stock now. They may not make that calculation in their heads all the time, but that's what's implicit in the stock price.

And I also take the point that many investors think someone else may have a higher number in their heads than they do, and buy so they can sell to that guy. This is called the "greater fool theory," for obvious reasons. But what if that guy is right? What if we've sold a stock at a price below the present value of the expected stream of dividends? What if the internet really will supplant all other commerce and it'll be funneled through these trunk-lines? Won't you feel like an idiot having sold at half the true value of the thing?

Actually, I have to echo this. The Right Thing doesn't carry a very high price tag in the real world. The volatility arises due to a common utility function, which states that more is always preferable to less. People will always go for more money over less, and anything that supports that principle will be rewarded.

Sure, but so what? They're still complex, and as such won't respond as expected to simple solutions.

Volatility occurs as a result of the globslisation of the capital markets, which serves very useful functions elsewhere. Call it a side-effect if you will. It won't go away with the addition of another palliative. My advice is get used to it.

This isn't meant as an endorsement of any particular interpretation of 
so-called "alien abduction," so please don't inundate me with allegations of 
pseudoscience! I _do_ think that the abduction phenomenon deserves scientific 
study; also, I would be surprised if we found out the perpetrators were 
"extraterrestrials" in the classic sense.

But what I read on the subject sometimes strikes me as descriptions of 
extropian technologies.  Witnesses describe the aliens' uncanny ability to 
levitate and walk through walls: sounds like utility fog to me.  And I 
remember a description of a levitation "ray" used by an apparent craft that 
looked "grainy": possible refraction caused by the presence of copious 
nanomachines?

Also, most of the saucers sighted by witnesses are sleek and seamless.  
Interior lighting is apparently sourceless.  This sort of thing is right out 
of "Engines of Creation."  One witness said the inside of the craft looked 
"poured from a single mold," which is exactly what we would expect from a 
vehicle sculpted by nanomachines.

Maybe the so-called alien presence is some form of projection showing us 
what's ahead on our technological horizon; remember that the UFO phenomenon, 
in its earliest modern form, took the appearance of "ghost rockets" over 
Scandinavia during a period when rocket research was in its infancy.  And do 
I even need to mention the phantom airships of the late 1800s?

Maybe this is a form of quantum mentation in action.  (Or maybe it's really 
aliens--transtemporal, ET or otherwise.  But that's not the focus of this 
post.)

Deep relaxation and meditation can also work as a substitute for sleep for
extended periods of time. During my own experiments with sleep deprivation
I found that after up to 36 hours without sleep I could meditate for an
hour and then continue for another 12 hours feeling as if I had slept
perhaps four or five hours. However, after a certain period of time without
sleep I noticed that meditation did not refresh me any more and that I
needed proper sleep to function.

If all one's work could be performed so easily! 

I assume that most people on this list are working in technical

Try to 'go with the flow' of the dream. Don't get all exited and try to
think about the fact that you are dreaming too much. This will cause you to
become more and more aware of yourself and your sleeping body until you
wake up. 
Instead, remain calm and study your surroundings, try to interact with them
or perhaps 
create something. One other thing that works for me, if everything else
fails, is to refuse to wake up by sheer willpower. (I remember one time
when I was a child; I was dreaming lucidly when I became aware that I was
being forced awake, so I concentrated hard to keep on dreaming, but after
several minutes I couldn't maintain my dreaming any longer and woke up. I
found that my mother was shaking me hard and calling my name. She was
pretty shook up, and explained that she had been trying to shake me awake
for several minutes, but couldn't rouse me and thought I had fallen into a
coma during the night.)

The 'spinning' formula seems to work, and also such tricks as
levitating/flying ect.

Seems pretty unlikely that the ancients would have found a T-Rex skeleton
complete enough to give them any idea of what the animal would have looked
like when alive, or indeed any dinosaur skeleton that would have let them
understand that they were looking at the remains of a lizard-like creature. 
The answer is probably a combination of factors, from aesthetic memory to
instinctive, subconscious fear and loathing of reptiles,  ("If you think
that snake is icky, imagine one 30 meters long!") up to and including the
possibillities of 'survivals' and paranormal critters, but I digress...  
  
Interestingly enough, several people suggested in the 17th and 18th century
that the masses of sea-shells and fossilized sea-creatures found in cliffs
and high places were proof that the biblical story of the flood were true,
but the remains found were explained away by the scientists of the time as
having been carried up there by people, since most scientist at that time
where loath to admit to any evidence that would lend credence to the bible.

This is a definite possibillity, and unfortunatly, as far as I'm aware, not
one that have been mentioned in any book on the subject. (UFO's, that is,
not nanotech.)

*whimsical speculation mode on*

One 'transhuman possibillity', put forward by John Keel and others, are
that we are being not-so-subtly tested/influenced by a Power. Perhaps the
Singularity has already occured and we're the descendants of the neophobes
who refused to take part.....

But the same can be said about any phenomena.  Why did my shoelaces become
untied?  Why does it happen so often to so many others?  Well, perhaps a
team of scientists studying it around the clock will discover why and
develop a means to prevent.

But the same can be said about any paranormal phenomena or even stuff we are
pretty sure is outright bull.  I mean, perhaps Jesus was resurrected using
nanotech.  Perhaps the dinosaurs became extinct because of nanotech.
Perhaps the apparitions of the Virgin seen in so many places is actually
nanotech in action.  This really doesn't clear things up.

It's also the plot for some science fiction novels, such as Ian Watson's
_Miracle Visitors_...  It makes for interesting science fiction, but I don't
think it's so.  But if it is, Have pity on me Oh Great Ones!  Take me into
your paradisical future!:)

But in truth, I think people experience lots of things that have more
mundane explanations BUT would be much more interesting if cloaked in
mystery.  Each age and culture has its own way of dealing with this.  If the
"ghost rockets" (and this is the first I've heard of them) had been seen 30
years earlier, they might have been called "phanton airships" or 300 years
earlier "witches" or 3000 years earlier....  Well, you get the point.
That's a lot of testing.  That power must be very inefficient or sloppy or,
hard to believe, stupid.

I do find these things interesting and the speculations are also so, but I
have a feeling all this cool tech won't come about until we make it come
about.

24 black holes hanging on the wall. And if one black hole should
accidentally fall--

< The holes exist in clusters, with the two most powerful in the
center of the galaxy orbiting at very high speed and affecting
each other like a double star, the Yomiuri Shimbun quoted
Oya as saying. >

Interestingly, this double black hole (on a rather more extravagant scale)
is a key speculation in Donald Moffitt's rather good and usually overlooked
sf novel SECOND GENESIS.

Yes, but why your shoelaces becomes untied isn't really a mystery. No one
(I hope!)
feels the need to invoke nanotech as an explanation. 

(Hey! Waitaminit! Maybe it's a plot by the army to disable the soldiers of
opposing armies by causing their shoelaces to become untied in combat using
nanotech!) 

Besides, even if I am personally unable to write a paper explaining why the
laces
on my sneakers often becomes untied while the laces on my other shoes
don't, it's  
still not something that I would spend time studying. On the other hand, we
have 
thousands of people, some of them even 'qualified', claiming to see
unidentified things in the sky and on the ground. Some people even claim
that these objects have been registered on radar screens and photograpic
film. It seems to me that there is a mystery that deserves to be
investigated here, for if all these people are lying or are mistaken about
natural phenomena, yet consistently repeats the same hallucinatory details,
then that is surely something that needs to be investigated by psychologists. 
(Rather few psychologist since Jung have done any study of the UFO phenomena.)
Then it requires the same amount of study as say, glossalia or some other
minor psychological abberation. If they are not lying or mistaken, then the
mystery of what they really saw awaits.

Of course, you are right, but remember that nobody said it would.

Certainly true. As a wise man once said; humans live thru their myths and

Yes, that's part of the theory. The Power would mask itself as something 
that could be comprehended by the cultures it was observing/experimenting on.
5000-2000 years ago flying chariots, flying shields and what have you,
phantom dirigibles a hundred years ago, phantom rockets and phantom
aviators eighty to 
sixty years ago and now phantom space craft manned by aliens.   

>Well, you get the point.
>That's a lot of testing.  That power must be very inefficient or sloppy or,

That depends on what timescale the tests would be made on, and what kind of
tests.
After all, what's the use of being immortal if you can't do research
projects lasting for
very great lenghts of time? That would be one of the natural advantages of
being a Power, methinks. 
And besides, the rationale and methods of a true Power would probably be
incomprehensible to us. That could be used against my argument as well, of
course.

Possibly. As I said, this is all speculation. Or maybe not.

I understand your point fully.  The reason I "singled out" UFOs is simply 
because, of all things paranormal, UFOs and abductions are the only phenomena 
that, superficially, at least, appear to implement a _technology_.  And if it 
really is a technology that we're seeing (and it might not be), it seems it 
would have to be a variation of what we know collectively as "nanotech."

Thanks to [don't remember name...] for the reference to John Keel; another 
name to look up on the subject of paranormal concerns is Jacques Vallee.  And 
the chapter "Theater in the Sky" in Whitley Strieber's _Communion_ is quite 
provoking and cogent.  Strieber's position is that the course of our 
technological evolution is being subtly accelerated by a nonhuman 
intelligence...possibly the same intelligence that beamed information into 
the mind of Philip K. Dick. (Ever read _Valis_ or _Radio Free Albemuth_?  Hot 
stuff!)

The Jung in me wants to attribute all of this to some sort of projected 
hallucination, but I don't know of any neurological mechanism that can 
produce a seeming phenomenon of such duration and complexity.  My best guess 
is that we're really dealing with a nonhuman intelligence from which we can 
learn a lot, as it seems to be remarkably advanced and consummately 
postbiological.  If so, it's reassuring, since it indicates that a lot of 
today's science fiction is attainable (mind-uploading, nano, etc.).  

Maybe this is what "first contact" looks like: a very gradual program of 
acclimization in which any given generation of the recipient species doesn't 
know quite what's going on (because if it did, the urge to create might 
slacken or atrophy: there's ample historical context right here on Earth).  

If alien species really are interested in reaching out to their neighbors 
(instead of imploding into virtual reeality pleasure farms, as some have 
feared), this scenario is actually much in keeping with some of the basic 
tenets of the SETI paradigm.  (Radio waves?  Get real!  Sagan and Drake 
founded SETI on the impossibly rigid notion that aliens, for all of their 
otherwordly weirdness, would have an economic system virtually identical to 
our own, and would thus consider radio transmitting more cost effective than 
building spacecraft.  They neatly bypassed exotic propulsion techniques in 
favor of the chemical rockets we just happened to be using at the time...it's 
an odd, elliptical perspective, kind of like von Daniken pointing at a cave 
painting and saying "Doesn't that look like a space suit?"  

My answer is a cautious "yes--but a space suit circa 1960!  Why would aliens 
millions of years our superior be wearing this ridiculous stuff?")

This is certainly a problematic manner.  Scientifically, it's a win-win 
situation, yet no one seems game; the subject's been thoroughly hidden behind 
the laughter curtain for so long that even bright people scoff at it (though 
surveys show that the more highly educated one is, the more likely one is to 
accept the possibility of an otherworldy presence here on Earth.  I didn't 
say "alien presence" because I don't remember the particulars of the survey, 
and anyway, "alien" usually translates to "extraterrestrial" in the typical 
Western mind, which only distorts the issue.)

Michael Persinger of Laurentian University is one of the few and the brave.  
He's devised an electromagnetic helmet that stimulates the temporal lobe and 
can cause some of the visionary strangeness that accompanies certain 
"abduction" episodes.  His work builds on that of Paul Devereux, a critic of 
the ET Hypothesis who thinks UFOs are "earthlights" produced by electricity 
in the planet's crust prior to seismic activity.  

Albert Budden goes even further and posits that people who come in close 
contact with these "electroforms" (not to be confused with ball lightening) 
experience abductions and other paranormal activity as part of their brain's 
organic response, in a sense dealing with accute distress by dressing it up 
in culturally relevant symbolism.  _Earthmind_ and _Psychic Close Encounters_ 
are two recommended books on this approach (which has a lot going for it, 
though it doesn't satisfactorily explain mass sightings of structured craft, 
etc.)

A quote that huants me is from Strieber's "Communion": "Maybe the visitors 
are simply what evolution looks like when applied to a conscience mind."

The level of cluelessness on this planet is truly amazing.

And the clueless somehow manage to get the money,
and make the decisions, in the presence of convincing
refutations of their ideas.  I think the situation may
be somewhat improved by fixing the planetary flows of
knowledge.  Unfortunately, projects in this area are
not funded...

Hi,

	
I'm a new member. I deal at the National Stock Exchange
Bombay(INDIA).

It was interesting to read the bit about market efficiency.
I know from my experience that the stocks we pick at a
particular time of the day or whatever(week/month) are
all to be considered a judgement based on our knowledge
at that particular time. You also have to review every
now and then(daily/weekly/monthly) whether to hold on
or sell.People who complain of not making a profit are
lazy and do not review their portfolio.

If you were rafting down a river fast would you go to
sleep even for a second? That's how you have to be in 
the stock market.AWAKE! Naturally the person who makes
money in the stock market is capable of hanging on inspite
of the deluge of information that hits him everyday.

Regarding a bubble that will burst lots of people have
been proved wrong about the US market (from dow 5000 to
10000).It's like the Indian monsoon.You know it's raining
heavily but can anyone predict how long it will rain-
one day,two,three or fifteen? Better to carry an umbrella
with you.Get it?

Bye!

Gurvinder

Aha!  You clicked the 'Transtopia' button.  Credit for that page goes to den
Otter not me (although I did do the Transtopia logo at the top of the page).
The stunning image you're refering to (the rippling water effect?) is all

Xoom use to be good (no windows, no javascript, just adverts in your

I really don't think this debate is going to go anywhere, so this will be my
last post on the subject.

But that's just arbitrary.  You're choosing the sexier phenomena.  My point
in contrasting the two was not so much to say I'm worried much about my
shoelaces -- I can tolerate a certain amount of mystery in my life, as I'm
sure we all can and do -- but to show how the same reasoning looks not so
convincing when applied to less interesting stuff.

>On the other hand, we

By that tack, we have thousands, no! millions of people whop believe in God,
some of them very qualified. such as Einstein -- or, if you want an expert
in the field of religion, theologians, mystics, and the like.  Does that
mean they are right?  That would be an argument from authority.  The truth
is true, regardless of who says it, and the same applies to the false.

>Some people even claim

>film.

Yet, after all these incidents, nothing has arisen that is unambiguously
alien.  What is especially strange is how aliens (or whatever it may be --
future versions of us trying to communicate back that nanotech works) only
seem to make their appearances in ways that are ambiguous at best or can be
explained away at worst.

But the truth is people have been studying this, both believers, skeptics,
and what have you.  I don't think we on this list have anything novel to add
this debate.  You might think putting nanotech into the mix is going to
solve the mystery or push the debate to another level.  I believe it's just
another round of trying to explain something that has a far less
romantic/sexy/neat explanation.

But I thought the point behind the original post was to offer some new twist
that would lead to an explanation.  If all you want to do is speculate,
well, then let's UFOs made the dinosaurs extinct.  There was a great space
battle and a weapon of unimaginable power blasted the Earth killing off the
dinosaurs.  It's possible, no?  It makes for great science fiction.  (See S.
D. Howe's "Wrench and Claw" in _Analog_ 11/98 for a story that comes very
close, as did an episode of "Doctor Who.":)

Hey, did you ever think that I might be one of them?  And that my kind don't
want your kind to advance too far, too fast?  That we might neutralize
you -- perhaps, by merely abducting you so others will think you're crazy

I've heard that before and I think it might just be true.  On the other, if
you know the reality, you have a good chance of changing it -- as opposed to
just making a pretty story up to accept it.  E.g., the myth of an afterlife
might help a lot of people to make it through the day, but it also makes it
less likely they'll look for a cure for death.  (Of course, a lot of people
who don't believe in an afterlife have come to accept death, but I chalk
that up to either a) not being exposed to life extension ideas in a serious
way or b) lack of imagination.)

But would not a good way to test and expand a culture be to show it stuff it
could NOT deal with?  Stuff that can be explained away -- like, "Hey, that's
just aliens/Russian missle tests/dirigibles/witches/swamp gas!" -- won't
really challenge a belief system.  However, if a UFO landed in Central Park
on a Sunday afternoon when the Great Lawn is packed and displayed all sorts
of neat gadgetry, then a lot of skeptics, at least, would have to change
their ideas...  How come that never happens?

And the same has been said about God.  Do you believe in God?  If you don't
and need a rational explanation or empirical demonstration, perhaps the
problem is your mind is too limited to see God's method and plan...  This
makes for good science fiction or conspiracy theories (X-Files, anyone?),
but it is below even the best human reasoning.

I'm not going to wait around to find out.

Far from seeing the pleasures and benefits of love and friendship as being 
threatened by the kinds of technological transformation to which we look 
forward, I see the prospect of enhancement of these feelings and 
relationships.  Love and friendship grow out of shared values, goals and life 
experiences.  I don't see that basic truth changing, although the ways that 
these relationships are formed and the feelings are expressed will.  

Consider the life of a pre-modern human.  For most of human history and 
prehistory, an individual's circle of social interaction was restricted to 
the small handful of people in one's extended family or tribe.  Every 
individual with whom a person came into contact had essentially the same life 
experience and prospects, within a fairly narrow range of diversity dictated 
by simple sexual and narrow cultural bounds.  With the development of writing 
and transportation technologies like the domestication of the horse, a few 
privileged individuals were able to expand their social sphere to include 
distant people with more diverse life experiences.  In the last two hundred 
years the proportion of people able to enjoy that diversity, and the range of 
the available diversity for social interaction, has broadened dramatically.

Transhuman technologies promise an acceleration of this broadening of social 
horizons, but the fundamental values upon which love and friendship are based 
won't change, in my opinion.  Just as today I am able to form friendships 
with people who are distant in space and life experience through the use of 
jet aircraft, telephones and the internet, with the new technologies to which 
we look forward, we will continue to expand the range of entities with whom 
we can form bonds of shared values and life experiences.  Imagine how much 
deeper and richer friendships with distant comrades will be with mature 
virtual reality.  Imagine how enriched friendships will be when much higher 
bandwidth communication will be possible.  And the prospect of friendships 
that extend in time vastly beyond the mere eight decades to which natural 
humans are condemned to live is truly wonderful!

I recently watched Ken Burns' wonderful documentary about Thomas Jefferson.  
He did a fantastic job of depicting the tender reconciliation between 
Jefferson and Adams in the correspondence of their last twenty years.  
Imagine if that renewed friendship had not been cut off by their deaths!  The 
shared life experience of the two men formed a basis for a deep and fruitful 
friendship in a context that the younger men -- who had for a time become 
political "enemies" -- could not imagine.

In his fiction Greg Egan has explored how love and friendship might persist 
through even the longest and most transformed lives.  In "Permutation City" I 
recall how the main characters maintained a core of emotional connection 
across the fantastic automorphism of two uploaded humans.  And in "Diaspora" 
he explores how entities from vastly different beginnings and with completely 
different goals and basic cognitive forms reach across such gulfs to form 
friendships and find love.  I highly recommend those books for a view of how 
the fundamental values of love and friendship will persist in a radically 
post-human world.

> friendship?
>  What non-human species do you think have these experiences?

I think it's clear that animals co-evolved these emotional responses in 
connection with the selective advantage of social life.  I have certainly 
seen what appears to be only a slightly more primitive version of our own 
feelings of love and friendship among the non-human primates I've observed 
closely.

>From the Wall Street Journal...
They Shop at Radio Shack by Keay Davidson

San Francisco

  Two groups of amateurs plan to enter the space race - using rockets made out
of radio Shack gizmos, plywood, and fiberglass.
  One group plans to spend just $80,000 (US), less than NASA spends on a pair of
space boots.
  If the Saturday launch succeeds - and "I'd be amazed if they don't succeed,"
says Alfred differ, a physicist aiding the Davis, Calif., group - it will be the
first time amateurs have put a projectile into space.
  "You actually can get to space with stuff you found from the hardware store
and Radio Shack. That's literally true," says the team's leader, computer
programmer John Powell.
  He and his team have spent six years developing the rocket and launch system.
It will take off from a desert site at Black Rock, Nev.
  Meanwhile, a San Jose, Calif., group, led by home builder Tom  Rouse, is
playing catch-up. Pending approval from the Canadian Space Agency and the U.S.
Administration of Space Transportation, Mr. Rouse hopes to launch a rocket near
Churchill, Manitoba., in September.
  And if the San Jose group blows it, the next-likely contender is a group from
Huntsville, Ala., which tried and failed to launch a payload into space last
year.
  The amateur rocketeers say they're pioneering much cheaper ways of getting
into space, just as the pioneers of personal computers turned computers from
room-size, million-dollar monsters into affordible, palm-size helpmates.
  "We think launching from the ground makes no sense at all," says Mr. Powell.
"It takes so much less energy trying to launch from 100,000 feet - there's less
[atmospheric] drg - and the motors perform so much more efficiently in a
vacuum."
  Unlike the rocketeers of the recent film October Sky, the Davis group -
"America's Other Space Program," its members call themselves - won't launch from
the ground.
  If all goes as planned, they'll launch the 2.1-meter-tall rocket by remote
control from a 180-meter-tall train of nine balloons, floating in the near
vacuum 30,000 meters above Earth. A balloon launch saves a fortune in fuel costs
by sparing the rocket the need to push through the denser lower atmosphere,  Mr.
Powell says.
  Barring problems, the rocket should soar to an altitude above 100 kilometers,
a generally accepted scientific definition of where "space" begins. At that
altitude, the stars are visible even in daytime. Afterward, the rocket would
parachute to Earth.
  The rocket - 2.2 meters long and 7.6 centimeters wide - is extremely
lightweight, only 37 kilograms. Its airframe is made of a paper-based substance
and epoxy. For stability, the fins are a combination of plywood and kevlar, a
kind of fiberglass used in bulletproof vests.
  In a rocket burn lasting only five seconds, it should accelerate to a peak
speed of 4,480 kilometers an hour. The launch will be televised to the ground by
live video link.
  For Mr. Powell and the other members of JP Aerospace (JP for John Powell), it
will be a dream come true. They meet regularly to tinker on the rocket, the
balloon array, its pumps, and electronic components.
  "Every Sunday for about six years now, my garage fills up with anywhere from
20 to 30 people, all wedging in and working on things," Mr. owell says. "There
are people in the back yard, people in the driveway, and so on."
  The rocket will carry a small scientific experiment to test whether a plastic
substance called Mylar can withstand the vibrations and rapid acceleration of
launch. The experimenter, Mr. Differ, believes that one day Mylar "sails" -
nudged by the pressure of sunlight - could drag cargoes across the solar system.
  The launch has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and the
U.S. Departent of Transportation, says FAA spokesman Hank Prie.
  "John's a good guy ... I think he's got a good shot" of making it into space
this June, says Greg Allison, a leader of the Huntsville group, which is also
using balloons.
  A Los Angeles-based group, the Space Frontier Foundation, is offering $250,000
(US) to the first all- amateur group to launch a payload to 192 kilometers. The
foundation is one of a number of privately bankrolled "space activist" groups
that have sprouted up in the last 20 years, in hopes of encouraging the private
exploration and, eventually, settlement of space.   Scripps Howard.

I am pleased to announce the launch of a full service web site for those
excited about the ideas of Ayn Rand: The Daily Objectivist at
dailyobjectivist.com  TDO has news of special interest to Objectivism,
including announcements and coverage of meetings, lectures, and
conferences. We also have feature works of theoretical and applied
Objectivism, with at least one new feature a day. Unlike most Objectivist
web sites, TDO is not an hobby of the site owner, full of personal
reflections, nor is it just a listing of sites that would be of interest
to Objectivists, nor is it a sterile organization site which must play it
safe. TDO is here to satisfy the preferences of you!

Some features of particular interest are: poems and short stories, book
and movie reviews, hero of day, love advice column, and philosophical
consulting column.

TDO's primary goal is to constantly supply the best of Objectivist news
and ideas to those committed to reality, reason, individual rights, and
capitalism. Please visit and bookmark dailyobjectivist.com very soon. We
are working hard to encourage your flourishing. 
 
Sincerely,
Chris Johnson

Actually, Leonardo Da Vinci correctly deduced the origins of sea life
fossils found in the layers of the mountains, that it was once seabed
that rose up from tectonic action.

This and the suggestion of refining emotions (so that, by analogy, you get a 
specific warning message instead of "General Protection Fault" :-) sound 
really useful to me.

Meditation, again, is useful for the former. I haven't been doing it much 
lately, but when it was a regular habit, I had the experience several times 
of sitting down to meditate when I was emotionally stirred up. Eventually, I 
would get to a place where I had a calm, still perspective, but could still 
see my stirred-up "stuff." It would be as if, instead of having the stuff 
inside my body-mind, I was holding it on my lap. Once you've done this, by 
whatever method, it becomes possible to do it at will, at least until 
something comes along to kick you into an even deeper morass of emotions.

Actually, there are two general flavors of meditation: stillness and insight. 
I am talking above about the effect of stillness, and insight "should" be 
helpful in the refining process. but I suspect it really only gets us to the 
point of correctly identifying the source of whatever emotion is "up" at the 
time, rather than necessarily developing more acute ones at a low level.

I'd love to know about working shortcuts here, since for most people, enough 
meditation practice to be useful for this amounts to years.

Some formulas I have encountered and partially tested are:

- All fear comes from a threat to the ego;
- Anger is derivative of fear;
- Depression is the result of repressed fear (this may well not be the only 
source of depression, or perhaps some cases are just very subtle and 
indirect).

Anders again, different post:

I think the main english word for "missunsamhet" is "covetousness," from "to 
covet" as in "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife's ass."

I have a simple example germane to the parenthetical above. "To be able to 
play chess is a sign of a fine mind. To be able to play it well is a sign of 
a misspent youth." There were no human-strength chess computers during my 
misspent youth, but as they became available and I played against them, I 
noticed that I would lose more games than I "should" to them (when I was 
doing a lot of this, I was at USCF 2000 strength, +/- 50 points, and the 
highest ratings claimed by commercial computers were around 2100).

Introspection provided a compelling answer: I wasn't treating the process of 
playing chess with a computer as a real game. The reason? *The computer 
didn't give a damn whether it won or lost.* I see a chess game as a contest 
between two sentients; me sitting at my PC moving pieces on a virtual board 
connected to, say, gnuchess, _looks_ like a game of chess, but doesn't have 
any contest aspect. I can use exactly the same interface to connect to a 
chess server and play a human; in that case, there is a contest, we both 
"care" about the outcome (or agree to for the moment) and indeed, I play up 
to my (declining) abilities in that case.

It seems like even Kasparov had trouble taking Deep Blue seriously at first, 
but he learned quickly. He, of course, was playing publicly and had the 
computer's developers very much in the game, and besides, he has a bigger ego 
than I do :-)

My example addresses roughly half of Greg's comment, actually. I would say 
that the lack of expressions of emotion would be one way an AI could fail a 
Turing test, just as it makes gnuchess fail my chess-opponent Turing test 
(gnuchess doesn't talk back at all, so it's clearly not trying to pass the 
test); and OTOH, giving the AI some basic drives and a sense of self may well 
be necessary for it to be able to formulate its own goals and act on them 
(nothing new here, really).

Hi David, 

	I read with great interest your announcement of the Never Say Die
website.  May I make a few suggestions?

1.  You may wish to check out the website photo.net (particularly
http://www.photo.net/wtr/thebook/)   The domain name is something of a
misnomer-- while it has a wonderful photography section, the principal
content is the entire content of "Philip and Alex's Guide to Web
Publishing" FKA "Database Backed Web Sites."  In addition to being the
best web site that I have yet found, he also provides free TCL scripts
for doing bulletin boards, mailing lists, classified ads etc. for use
with the AOLserver/Oracle webserver/database combination.  See
http://www.photo.net/wtr/using-the-acs.html.    

2.  You may also wish to check out Tom Boutelle's Open Faq source code
at http://www.boutell.com/openfaq/source/.  It allows users and submit
and answer questions themselves, so that one person is not overly
burdened with the effort of maintaining the FAQ.  

3.  The Open Science project appears to be a more general effort devoted
to 
developing and promoting free science software tools to allow anyone to
have the analytical tools necessary to perform real science. You may
wish to add a link to them at www.openscience.org.

But this wasn't generally accepted by the scientific community at large until 
much later. 
There was a lot of confusion during the dawn of the 'age of reason' in the
17th 
century due to the unfortunate tendency to dismiss things out of hand because 
they seemed to support the bible. Take meteorites for instance. Someone, I
don't remember who, once refuted an account of a meteorite fall on the
grounds that it might make people think that the stone would have fallen
from Heaven. 
Even Lavosier didn't belive in meteorites, though perhaps for other
reasons.

They seem to have been playing with the www site, so I couldn't go back

But they are hardly the same. There's no mystery about shoelaces whatsoever
as far as I'm aware, but surely you must agree that there is some form of
mystery regarding 
reported phenomena such as UFO's? If nothing else, as I said, a
psychological one.

Why does a state of mind like belif have anything to do with a reported
phenomena like UFO's and why would Einstein be qualified to verify belif? 
The point I'm trying to make is that there is a quantitative difference
between a phenomena such as belif, which in itself has nothing to do with
proving or verifying anything, and a phenomena like UFO's, which we do not
even know if it's a subjective or obejctive phenomena, that are reported
and continue to be reported worldwide.    

>or, if you want an expert in the field of religion, theologians, mystics,
and the like.  >Does that mean they are right?  

Surely the whole point of having experts is that they are supposed to know
what they are talking about. What I meant by 'qualified' witnesses are
people who are used to observing things in the skies and knows a bit about
celestial phenomena.   

>That would be an argument from authority.  The truth
>is true, regardless of who says it, and the same applies to the false.

Naturally. But isn't the whole point of scientific training to make one
more able to figure out what the truth are? All surviving witnesses of,
say, an airplane crash aren't equally in the position to figure out the
truth about the crash. Presumably the pilots are the ones who has the best
chances of figuring out what happened, not the passengers. So presumably a
trained observer who is familliar with most of the things observed in the
skies makes a 'better' witness than someone who has no such training or
knowledge.

Depends what you mean by 'unambiguously' and 'alien', respectively. 
There are plenty of cases where no known phenomena have been able to
accurately and completely explain the events.

How do you know that that's not what they want?
Speculating and questioning their motives when we do not even know if the
UFO phenomena has motives seems a bit suspect to me. The point is not why
it doesn't 
do this or that, but what it is.

Really? That's possible, but I would hope not. After all, this is a
transhuman mailing list. People here are used to think in novel ways about
things, plus that they have a level of technical and scientific competence
that are unusual among people who usually discuss such things. 

>You might think putting nanotech into the mix is going to

Actually, the first post about nanotech wasn't by me, but by another poster.

And that's your choice, which doesn't affect mine or any other posters
right to discuss this, as long as we don't diverge from the topic of this
mailinglist.

As I understood it, the original poster wanted to discuss the implications
of the phenomena seemingly making use of technology relevant to this list,
not to come up with any sort of explanation tol anything.  

>If all you want to do is speculate, well, then let's UFOs made the
dinosaurs extinct.  >There was a great space battle and a weapon of

Certainly, but what does that have to do with the contents of the original
post?
Or do you feel that certain topics are too speculative to discuss here?

>It makes for great science fiction.  (See S.

Need I remind you that this is a list that is made up almost exlusivly of
speculation, since nobody knows if the Singularity will occur, if nanotech,
AI's or magascale engineering is feasible, not to mention life extension
ect.

So you do agree that the UFO phenomena, since neither you nor I can say for

Why would I know? That's hardly a question to disprove anything. 
You seek to infer that the UFO's are not worthy of investigation since they
haven't landed in Central Park?

Perfectly logical in it's way. I don't see any reason why it may not be so,
other that that I personally don't belive it.

Why? What you are saying seems to be that if it can't be explained by the
logic and reason I use it must be false. It seems to be a bit ad hoc
reasoning to me, not to mention that it implies that both your reasoning
and logic is perfect already.

It isn't "self" conditioning.  It is the result of a fundamental
genetic program that may be reinforced in some environments by
cultural conditioning.  You can't "get out of it" without fundamentally
altering your genetic program.  All you can do is suppress it
or channel it.

"The Red Queen" goes into some detail about how sexual strategies
are (genetically) determined by the different amounts of investment
that men and women have to place into reproduction.

A society where men do not view women as "doable" (or where
women are not appraising men for their resources) is inherently
"unnatural". [Yes, you could argue that our societies as a whole
are entirely "unnatural", but I would argue that we want to
move toward societies with the maximum amount of "natural",
*self*-determined diversity, while providing the highest probability
for long-term survival.]  If an individual has a need (thirst, hunger,
sex, etc.), what could be more natural than fullfilling that need?!
We (esp. in America) have a religo-cultural facade applied on top of
our genetic agendas.  The entire "Western" perspective about sex has
been hugely distorted by our history.

Prostitution, for example, is an age-old outlet for that "horrible"
male sex drive.  Legal prostitution does not seem to be a bad thing,
*if* as one magazine I recently browsed, pointed out, "women enjoy sex".
[I realize that this is true to greater or lesser degrees depending
on one's genetic and cultural inheritance; it certainly is not true
in those regions where female castration is practiced.]
If I were a woman who *really* enjoyed sex, and one could find
"safe" environments (like old style brothels), I think it would
be difficult to find a better job than being a prostitute.

[Now of course, women have a mixed agenda, because while
they enjoy sex, they too are driven to reproduce -- so,
if we are going to remove a man's sex drive, shouldn't
we remove a woman's sex/reproductive drive as well?
I suspect the only women who might express thoughts
similar to my own (re: prostitution as a profession) would
be those who have reproduced sufficiently, or who never
intend to or are unable to reproduce.]

Our (Western) cultural attitude towards something like prostitution
is as distorted as it is say towards sex "accessories" (now banned
from sale in the state of Georgia...).  What will we collectively
"think", when the really life-like "dolls" being developed by the
Germans and Japanese become available?  Can we ever get to the
point where we view releasing sexual tension as "normal" as
scratching or sneezing?  Will Japanese style domination and
torture of young girls be illegal in VR environments in America
or Europe?

Prostitution was never viewed negatively until Columbus brought
back syphillis from America.  It spread across Europe through the
liasons of the royalty and the military camp followers.  As
the epidemic spread, prostitution became an unsafe profession
and the town fathers that had organized the public baths
and/or bordellos (as outlets for the youthful male sex drive) were
forced to close them down.  This led to the rise of the middle
class and the emphasis on the "good" (faithful) wife or husband
we currently have in our culture.  This perspective was promoted
by the religious community as it gave them increased power
(by having the monopolies on relieving you of the sin of
infidelity or a really bad marriage).

[There is a good discussion of this in "The Fourth Horseman"]

The "demonization" of the "male sex drive" occured because
one thinks twice about freely pursuing "natural drives"
that will make your face fall off.  Our perspective regarding
AIDS in current times pales in comparison to the attitudes
towards sex that historically resulted from the spread of syphillus.

If there were safe outlets for it, would you need to
"control" the male sex drive? Would you need to distort what is
genetically true (men and women have fundamentally different
genetic programs dictating sexual strategies), with a cultural
veneer that they are (or should be programmed to be) the same?

Most of us lack sufficient exposure to cultures that are
more "natural" such as some Asian or Polynesian cultures.
In some of those cultures, men and women have a heritage that
allows them to enjoy their respective genetic programs rather
than struggle to suppress them.  It may be true that you
can only have this when children are viewed as the offspring
of the "community" and cared for by the entire community
rather than by an individual couple or extended family.

Question for the hard core libertarians -- would you be willing
to pay "taxes" for the community to support of your collective
offspring in exchange for complete sexual freedom?  [I.e.
most women and men viewed each other as equally "doable".]

This is not to say that there are not "equal rights" problems
regarding the sexes.  These arose from the physiological fact that
men compete for mates and strength wins in many cases.  Because men
are the stronger sex, they can (and in many 3rd world cultures do)
dominate & control the women.  This results in the women having little
education, wealth or power, and having to do most of the work to feed the
family.  The Hunger Project, has over the last 10 years or so, realized
that the subjugation of women is a major factor in the remaining
pockets of hunger and starvation in the world and has taken many steps
to educate and empower women to solve this problem.

In the past, in Western societies, women were viewed as "property"
(like slaves).  The crime of "rape" was not a crime against a woman,
but a crime against the woman's husband or father (for damaging their
property).  Presumably some of the perceived property damage was the result
of a husband or husband's father, who might be leaving an inheritance, not
knowing if the child of a woman who was raped, did in fact carry their
genes.  The need to protect ones property resulted in the enactment of
laws against rape and prostitution.  The rape laws were initially to make
clear the procedures regarding property damage reimbursement and eventually,
as the "women as property" paradigm shifted, to provide strong deterrents.

The laws against prostitution were again property or "control" laws.
In many cultures/historical situations, daughters have/had a negative
market value (you had to pay a dowry to unload them).  Presumably the
market value increases (becomes less negative or even positive) in
inverse relation to the availability of women who are inexpensively
"doable".  A young man who can't get it elsewhere will demand less
(or persuade is father to demand less) to get some...  Fathers or
husbands also have less control over women who are free to pursue
the "oldest profession".

So we have a situation where many of our attitudes regarding a natural
genetic program are being dictated by quirks of history and/or male
desires to protect his property values or "control" his women!

The problem in the U.S., perhaps due to some feminist extremists,
is that the just desire women have for equality, has evolved into a
form of discrimination against men.  Men "naturally" view women
as "doable".  To demand other than this is no different from demanding
that an individual with a genetic quality (I'm intentionally not
using the word "defect"), such as deafness "hear" or blindness "see".
The desire or demand that men give up there genetically programmed
perspective, or educate themselves or their children to be less "male",
would be the same as demanding that deaf individuals must "hear" or that
they must bear non-deaf children!  Such attitudes disrespect the
qualities of an individual and stigmatize and minimize diversity.

The problem is that all of the cultural history, laws, desires, etc.
have been (or will be) invalidated by the march of technology.
 (a) Vaccinations or genetic reprogramming will significantly
     reduce the risks from contagious dieseases (even AIDS).
 (b) Developed and developing methods of birth control
     (for males as well as females) can eliminate the problem
     of undesired children.
 (c) Genetic tests can determine with 100% certainty, the paternity
     of a child.  In non-communal societies (with appropriate
     legal systems), these tests can be used to create and enforce
     the financial responsibility for the support of a child.

So most of our current behaviors, cultural attutides and laws
are or will be inappropriate for the current/near future situation.

- Should we legalize prostitution and provide government managed
  brothels to create an outlet for that "horrible" male sex drive?
  [This might be one way to reduce the tax burden...!]

[I'm aware that in many countries where this message may be read,
prostitution is in fact legal and in some cases unionized.  My
focus is on stimulating thought in other jurisdictions.]

A question (for the female readers only) -- (given a, b & c above)
would you "do" a man that you weren't particularly attracted to
but who was rated 7-10 as a sex partner by an independent panel
and who had a "biocompatible" immune system for the phase your
hormone cycle was in at the time you were in the man's proximity?
[We know the male answer, so there is no point in responding... :-)]

The Japanese already have a personal digital assistant/bot-variant
that broadcasts & receives self-qualities & desires and provides
notification of proximity matches for those nites out on the town.
It seems someone is missing a business opportunity for providing
the "independent review" combined with the MHC (immune system)
genotyping.  The development of such a database might begin to
"normalize" the "doability" desire between the sexes.

- Should we require (by law) vaccinations against STDs (when they
  become available)?
  [There is a balance between the risk you present to society
   as an unvaccinated potential carrier vs. the minimal costs/risks
   (small but finite) that vaccines may pose to you as an individual.]

We are approaching the carrying capacity of the planet (w/o
nanotech) [and and will eventually approach the carrying capacity
of the solar system]. Unfettered reproduction reduces the resources
available to us all and/or reduces our quality of life by secondary
effects when we as indivduals don't pay for damage we cause (such as
global warming caused by fossil fuel consumption).

Increases in human longevity will make these problems much worse.
So ---

- Is reproduction a "fundamental inalienable right" or should it
  be a privilege?

- Should we require (mandatory by law) 100% effective birth control
  at the onset of puberty?

- What should be the criteria for the reversal of a mandatory
  non-reproductive status?

Possible options:
 (a) Sufficient resources to raise children in an "optimal" environment?
 (b) Demonstration of the possession, by natural genetic heritage or
     paid-for engineering, of a genetic program "guaranteed" to produce
     children that will not be a burden or detriment to society?
 (c) Purchase of the right to have a child (even a defective one?) when
     a slot becomes available due to an accidental death or upload?

- Should there be a market for "reproduction" slots?

- Since we have clearly limited resources, should the "privilege"
  of reproduction, require a legal "commitment" to die or be
  uploaded (into a more efficient space/energy form)?

- Or do we pre-empt the reproduction debate by the requirement
  that access to treatments that extend longevity beyond 120
  years (or uploading) require a commitment for "self-compression"
  when material/energy resources become a limited?

[It is worth noting, that the discussion of "reproduction" would also
apply in uploaded form to the number of backup copies or "save states"
you can make while consciously testing a self-evolution path.]

- And finally, if we do develop the ability to "control the sex
  drive" by drugs or genetic modifications, who gets to decide
  the people who should be "treated"?  Does one want to give the
  legal system this power?

[America historically has had an history of flip-flopping on whether
judges could dictate "personality/permanent-physical-alterations" to
individuals who break the laws.]

Food for thought,

I think the american (male) population is comprised of people thatwere extremely
sexually abused as children, i.e. circumsized. A person
commiting or aquiescing to this act is imo, a sex offender of the first order.
cf Institute of Psychohistory (online, don't have url).

and sexual repression (e.g. puritans, christian coalition, etc.). It would
be very interesting to learn of the childhood history of the folks behind the

This "landing on the White House lawn/Central Park" argument for the 
nonexistence of UFOs never fails to incense me.  I was going to let this 
thread drop, until I came to this line.

A visiting alien culture would only reveal itself in this manner if it was 
really interested in public disclosure.  We can imagine many reasons why a 
civilization might want to present itself to "the natives" in just such a 
way.  Conversely, though, we can think of many more reasons why real aliens 
(as opposed to Mr. Carpenter in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" or the 
humanoids in "Earth vs. The Flying Saucers") would choose a more subtle 
approach--if they even endorsed the prospect of contact at all.

There was a paper in "Science" magazine in the early 80s explaining why a 
visiting extraterrestrial culture would almost certainly _not_ go public by 
"landing in Central Park" or whatever landmark you prefer.  History of 
contact between civilizations of different levels of technological 
development (i.e. the Aztecs vs. European invaders) is abysmal.  The "lesser" 
of the two cultures is, without exception, subsumed, and its memetic value is 
vastly diluted if not destroyed.  

I think it's reasonable to expect a visiting alien culture to feel the same 
way if they are indeed visiting us.  I hate to resort to the lame "Star Trek" 
"prime directive" analogy I've come across so many times, but an advanced 
culture that insinuates itself upon a less advanced culture (benevolently or 
not) has an intellectually crippling effect on the latter.  

If aliens are here, I don't think they'll be particularly interested in our 
money or our women (though Bruce Sterling's Investors have a ring of 
authenticity to them...).  Rather, they'll be interested in our _uniqueness_. 
 And this is the one thing that would be destroyed by public disclosure.

In short, "not landing in public" is not a very cogent argument against the 
presence of aliens in our midst.

Well, yes, I think his views are widespread. This is why he can get 
away with saying things like he does without getting much comment

This is just the kind of thing that I would like to see follow on from the
Biotech Futures (Extro 4) conference. It fits nicely into the info portal
plan. It would take some funding to get going, but ExI does intend to
pursue post-conference funding so that ideas, information, and activity
generated by the event continue after those two days. A center for
information on what LE researchers are doing and where would be an obvious
component for the part of the portal dedicated to life extension, and a
prime candidate for starting off the portal since the conference will focus
on this area, along with genetic engineering.

        That is an interesting point.  The concern with any sort of
psychological adjustment, however, is the possibility of emotional
repression. It is always possible to consciously ignore an emotion and act
around it, whether or not it is a primary or secondary emotion.
Unfortunately, this repression has a tendency to weigh heavily on our
subconscious and ultimately affects our physical and mental well-being.
The question is whether or not we can psychologically tune ourselves to
feel unnecessary\undesirable emotions to a lesser extent without causing
this emotional repression.  As I mentioned in the original post, drugs
don't seem to work (though I have never used any) in
reducing the magnamity of undesirable emotions.  What can?  Or as Greg
suggested, perhaps the whole spectrum of emotions which humans feel is
truly necessary to our well-being both now and in the future.

        Point taken: far better to be proactive than reactive.  As Gandhi
reputedly said: "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."

Where do I find current examples of transhuman/extropian music. I saw Max M
mentioned... Web site? Any other good examples? I'm especially interested in
stuff I can download.

I'll be adding my own contribution to this area soon... watch this space.
I'm interested to see what others have done.

Damned if I know what extropian music would be...  Personally, I find 
so-called "space-creating" music very inspiring and beautiful in a way that 
might be called "transhuman."  Electronic textures seem to characterize a lot 
of what I find especially meaningful.

Here's a shortlist of candidate "extropian" tunes:
The "Blade Runner" soundtrack by Vangelis
Almost any other record by Vangelis.  Try "Albedo 0.39" or "Direct."
The "2001" soundtrack.
Practically anything by David Bowie.
Brian Eno's "Ambient 1: Music for Airports."

Eugene, I clicked on this link at work! For everyone's information who is as
naive as I was, the above link leads to a site about Sex with Extra
Terrestrial Intelligences. Funny (and fairly well done), but doesn't look
good for you if your internet connection is monitored.

That blocking legislation here musn't have come into effect yet.

Also a little cautionary note about Gina's chat site (I will get to a chat
soon, I promise) - it didn't work for me because it is blocked by our
firewall. About a minute after I clicked on the link, I received a call from
our systems people asking me why I was trying to get through the firewall
(why can't systems support people learn to trust software developers? "Don't
worry, I'll respect your systems in the morning").

        This discussion has taken place on this list numerous times in the
past, most recently in mid-December, and before that in early August.  You
may want to check the archives.

        The general consensus at that time was that there is a dichotomy
between subjectivity and objectivity: music that extropians like and music
written by extropians.  As a musician myself, I will submit that my own
compositions would not be collectively liked by all extropians;
additionally, the amount of styles in which I write (mostly instrumental)
would make it hard for any one person to like all of my music.  However, I
am an extropian, and therefore, in a sense I write "extropian" music.  On
the other side of the coin, music listening is extremely subjective...one
might as well discuss the uniformity of "extropian" taste in clothing.

(The scene:  A futuristic clothing-shop called "Morgan-Stanley
Futuristic Clothing".  A calendar at the wall says "3000 A.D. " Outside
the window, we see a cartoon-like vista obviously stolen from "The
Jetsons".  A CUSTOMER who looks remarkably like JOHN CLEESE is talking
to an ANDROID SHOPKEEPER, who looks like ERIC IDLE wrapped in aluminum foil.)

CUSTOMER:	Hello, I'd like to buy a pair of blue trousers, please.
ANDROID:	Are you sure you wouldn't have the gray, sir?
CUSTOMER:	Gray?  No, I don't want gray.  I want blue.
ANDROID:	Are you *really* sure you wouldn't rather buy a pair of gray
trousers, sir?
CUSTOMER:	Of course I'm sure.  Why do you keep asking?
ANDROID:	Well, sir, our database indicates that you like gray trousers.
CUSTOMER:	Your database is wrong.  Now, will you sell me the blue trousers?
ANDROID:	I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
CUSTOMER:	Well, why the devil not?
ANDROID:	Because our database says you wouldn't enjoy them, sir.  We are
programmed to give satisfaction, and we could never sell you a product
that you wouldn't like.  But I could sell you a pair of gray trousers. 
You like those.
CUSTOMER:	I've never worn a blasted pair of gray trousers in my blasted
life, you bucket of bolts!  I can't imagine why your fool database
thinks I would like them!
ANDROID:	Well, sir, I confess I don't know how that information got into
the database.  We do have Internet-connected surveillance cameras
everywhere.  It could be as simple as an offhand remark made in a public
place, or even just a longing glance at some girl clad in gray trousers.
 But we're sure you like them.  Our database is never wrong.
CUSTOMER:	I hate gray trousers!  I think they look like someone vomited
on a pair of perfectly good trousers!
ANDROID [interrupting]:  Oh, that can't be, sir.  Our trousers are self-cleaning.
CUSTOMER:	I don't care!  Gray trousers are the work of the AntiChrist! 
Every time I see a pair of gray trousers, I want to see them ripped to
bits!  Now, will you sell me the blue trousers, or will I take my
business elsewhere?
ANDROID:	No, sir, I'm afraid I won't sell you blue trousers, and neither
will anyone else.  Your preferences are a clear part of the public
record and nobody would dream of selling you anything you rather
wouldn't buy.
CUSTOMER:	Then I'll buy a pair of gray trousers, damn your eyes.
ANDROID:	Oh, very good, sir.
[The ANDROID activates a laserlike device which scans the CUSTOMER's
every bodily dimension and compares them to the Internet record.]
ANDROID:	I say, sir, you seem to be gaining weight.  Have you considered
a program of exercise and exclusively Olestra-based -
CUSTOMER:	Just sell me the damn trousers before I run amok with a laser pistol.
[The ANDROID finishes scanning the CUSTOMER.  A moment later, a pair of
trousers pops out of the wall, having been downloaded over the Internet.]
CUSTOMER:	Why, what a fine pair of trousers.  Pristine, customized,
perfectly fitted, and, it would appear, gray.  I suppose they are
self-cleaning as well, so as to prevent terrible accidents with a blue
marker or perhaps a bucket of paint.
ANDROID:	Of course, sir.  Do you wish to pay for them?
CUSTOMER:	At this point, I would rather kill you and leave the trousers
and your shop blazing behind me, but I suppose I have no real choice in
the matter.
ANDROID:	Of course not, sir.
[The CUSTOMER slaps his hand over an instant payment auth-o-matic cred-meter.]
CUSTOMER:	There's your bloody money.
ANDROID:	Very good, sir.  Shall I wrap them for you?
CUSTOMER:	I suppose so.
[The android proceeds to rip the trousers to shreds.]
CUSTOMER:	What the hell are you DOING?
ANDROID:	Sir, I distinctly recall you saying that you wanted to see gray
trousers ripped to shreds.  I asked if you wished me to rip them for
you, and you replied in the affirmative.
CUSTOMER:	I'm afraid I'm going to have to zap you now.
[The CUSTOMER takes out a laser pistol and zaps the ANDROID.]
ANDROID [dying]:  I'm...going...to...tell...your...genetically...engineered...boss...on...you!
CUSTOMER:	Good luck, he thinks he's a toaster oven.
[ANDROID dies.]
CUSTOMER:	What a ghastly future.

Freeman, are you coming to Berserkely August 7 for Extro 4?  Ill bring
my set and clock if you wanna rattle off a few fivers.  You will likely
whip my fanny: peaked out at about 1900 several years ago.  Now
probably ~1800 on a good day.  {8-]

Chess programs are the first task I know of which passes the Turing test.
Using modern chess software, one cannot tell if one is playing against
a computer or an ass kicking human. [This fact killed postal chess.
People quit playing after computers got better than humans, which
happened in the 90s.]  Any other examples?  spike

Their stats are down right now, so can't check!

Last I looked we were well out of the top 100 after being in
it for a couple weeks or so. We just can't seem to develop
enough team members to hang in there nowadays.

Here's my project, Incomplete Sentience: http://www.ualberta.ca/~spencer/is/

I only have one piece in mp3 format, "Failed Cognitive Upload". I'll post
more once I find a good place for them (limited web space) and decide that
they are actually finished.

I'm not as happy with this piece as I was when I first made it, but that's
the way it goes with one's own material. Comments are very welcome!

My other stuff is more musical and not quite as frightening. :)

I have done a little collaboration with a fellow extropian (and
roomate/best friend) Aaron Davidson. His project Artickikin is here:
   http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~davidson/balzac/


As for other extropian music, Autechre is worth checking out. Try the album
"tri repetae++" for some incredible soundscapes.

I look forward to hearing your stuff Emlyn.

[Inspired by a message about "Transact- optic fiber network throughout
Canberra"]

In Palo Alto, California, we have an active group of telecommunication
activists who have persuaded the city to do a trial of Fiber-to-the-Home
(FTTH), which we believe is worth doing now rather than doing something
"half fast" that has to be replaced in a few years.

Right now we have a multi-city cable television system that is
cooperatively owned by its viewers.  It hasn't been financially
successful enough to meet its upcoming debt repayment, and is in
negotiations with AT&T Broadband (formerly mostly TCI cable company)
about being bought out.

The special thing is that we activists are looking for companies that
would be interested in leasing channel/bandwidth space on a general
telecomm system that could be an alternative to an AT&T monopoly.  We
believe that an "open access" system, with different technologies and
different content (TV shows, IP telephony, videoconferencing, education
on demand, etc.) can produce greater economic and political freedom than
a monopoly owned system.  This issue is exciting right now because of a
court decision in Portland, Oregon, saying that cities can require open
access. There have also been principled resignations in Los Angeles,
outcry in San Francisco, and lots of "buzz" among telecommunication
policy students.

We see our Cable Co-op situation as a natural testbed for open access. 
If the dollars add up well, we viewer-owners could choose to reject the
AT&T monopoly and use the prospect of lease revenues to justify private
financing for an independent information utility that encourages
competition rather than monopoly control.

We believe that ISP's, new cable channels, long distance telephone
carriers, and a lot of new technologies would be the natural customers
for general bandwidth to the homes. The Palo Alto cable system is
currently coaxial cable, with cable modems available.  It's easy to
envision fiber optic cables being extended to neighborhood nodes and
eventually all the way to the homes.  The city of Palo Alto also has a
large backbone of unused ("dark") optic fiber strands that could be
incorporated in a system.   And the existing optical fiber is connected
to the Palo Alto Information Exchange (PAIX), a major exchange point of
the Internet.

If anyone knows companies that would be interested in leasing bandwidth,
please get in touch with me at dharris@best.com or via phones at
650-494-7696 or 650-856-9126 (voicemail).  Direct e-mail or calls are
best, as I can't keep up  with postings on all the mailing lists where
you might see this.

It has been suggested that early gargoyle statues were modeled after
_Protoceratops_. They are smaller and more robust than T-rex as well as
being much more abundant. Their head plates are often preserved in one
piece and can look quite lizard-like without extensive reconstruction.

So, has anyone seen any gargoyles that look sufficiently Protoceratopsian
that might add credence to this claim?

One word: "family".

Strange but true: even the most dedicated anarcho-capitalists don't
usually think too hard about the fact that they live in a communist
institution that relies on cooperation, forcible sharing of property,
and cooercion ("you WILL wash the dishes up or ELSE!"). They don't
even think too hard about forking over their hard-earned capital
to someone else for spending on items of dubious utility, many of
which will be consumed by that person!

I am _aghast_ at this tolerance for stalinism in the domestic world!
Housework should be a billable activity and parasitism should be
grounds for divorce!

(Or, to put it another way: non-coercive communal living, as long as
the perceived benefits outweigh the costs, is something that many
people engage in: it's called marriage. Similarly, it is possible to
envisage other non-coercive communal lifestyles that provide benefits
outweighing the costs. The problem isn't communism; it's coercion.)

Continue down this path, and the criteria for membership to the tribe
"Extropians" will become loving 2001, owning the "I'm an Extropian, whatever
the hell that means" T-shirt and knowing all 258 verses of the Extropian

Is it really necessary to forge a primal social interface for the
Extropians? If you do, then meeting these criteria will be paramount to
membership, with the original principles coming second. Do you want the
membership of tribal zealots? Do you want the concept of "membership" at
all? The principles are "Extropian", not the people who identify with them.
I realise that this message wil probably not get far, due to my likely

Does this make sense to anyone? Is there a killfile I'm not on? Come on,

happen. Real discussion about reality anyone?

To me it seems ridiculous to think an 'independent panel' could rate a man
as a good sex partner. A man is a good sex partner to a woman if they
listen to each other and understand and appreciate each others' ideas.
Otherwise she wouldn't want to have sex with him (we are all generalizing
here, of course) so it wouldn't be any good. If they want to have sex with
each other, they will of course give each other the necessary physical
information to make it good. Perhaps very good friends could guess if that
would work out for the two, but not an 'independent panel'.

Here's a good overview article about Geron's background, current situation 
and the bioethics controversies that may inhibit it's work.

http://www.mercurycenter.com/business/top/004568.htm
Posted at 7:27 p.m. PDT Saturday, July 3, 1999 
Biotech pioneer has vision, needs results
BY ARIANA EUNJUNG CHA
Knight Ridder News Service 

        After achieving a series of scientific breakthroughs that are
reshaping the way we think about life, a daring Menlo Park 
biotechnology company now faces its most intimidating challenge:

Great expectations.

 Two years ago, Geron Corp. discovered what some called ``The Fountain
of Youth,'' a way to reset the genetic clock of aging cells. In January,
it isolated the most primitive human cells,which in theory could be
coaxed to grow into any part of the body. And, in a scientific coup last
month, it purchased the technologies used to clone Dolly the sheep.

 Now, medical researchers talk excitedly of creating tailormade organs
for transplantation, artificially grown blood and ``patch 
kits'' of cells to treat ailments from heart disease and Alzheimer's to
severe burns.

 And investors talk of billion-dollar sales.

 But without a product on the market, none even in human trials and a
workforce that only recently broke 100, industry analysts 
say Geron will have to fight hard to make its dreams more than hype and
hope.

 Chief executive officer Ronald Eastman said every employee at the
humble biotech company -- whose lobby is decorated by a 
simple hourglass of sand -- has placed upon himself a tremendous
internal pressure ``to fully deliver on the promise of our 
discoveries.''

 Carl Gordon, an analyst with OrbiMed Advisors, an investment firm, said
``the world is holding its breath'' watching for 
Geron's next move: ``Most companies in this stage nobody hears about,
nobody cares,'' he said. ``But Geron has this awesome 
potential to change the way we . . .  are born and age and die. And that
matters to everyone.''

 At this precarious moment, Geron finds itself at the center of a
growing national debate on human embryo research, with some 
legislators and religious leaders calling for new limits on the
experiments that are key to the company's stem cell program.

 In addition, some analysts say Geron's greatest asset -- its broad,
ambitious vision -- may also be its greatest liability, that its 
massive business plan overreaches its ability to deliver, especially as
the world's largest pharmaceutical companies have become 
its competition.

 And perhaps most critically, the company has seen heavy turnover in the
past 18 months or so, losing some of its chemists, its 
top molecular biologists -- and even its founder.

 Michael West -- Geron's aggressive visionary who colleagues compare to
computer software czar Bill Gates in his ability to 
package ideas -- quit early last year and now heads up Geron's biggest
competitor, Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, 
Mass. With only 10 employees, it already is collaborating with some of
the world's top cloning scientists and amassing 
impressive patents.

 While it isn't unusual for founders to be ousted from their own
companies when it reaches a certain stage, it is less common in 
biotechnology because ventures often take many years to bring a product
to market, said Mark Edwards, managing director of 
Recombinant Capital, a consulting firm in San Francisco.

 Some say West's departure may have come too soon. While his name
appears on few of the scientific publications that broke 
Geron's developments, company leaders recognize the projects as his
brainchild. As one scientist described it, ``Mike was the 
ideas person. Everyone else just carried them out.''

 Michael West, son of a truck leaser from New Jersey, has always had an
eccentric streak, and his interest in aging seemed to 
fit that part of his character.

 In the late 1980s, the study of aging was on the fringe of respected
medical science, and only a handful of scientists devoted 
their lives to the field. West, who had already obtained his Ph.D. and
was going for his M.D., sought out two of those legitimate 
researchers while at at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center.

 There, West became an expert in telomeres, the tiny caps at the end of
DNA that shorten as cells age.

 He soon quit school to work full time in an aging research lab at the
university and in 1991 quit the lab to start his own 
company.

 He named it Geron, Greek for ``old man,'' short for gerontology, the
study of aging.

 For several months, he pitched his idea to more than 450 potential
investors across the country. Most of the time, West was 
laughed out of conference rooms.

 In 1992, West's passionate speeches finally caught the attention of
venture capitalists, who gave him $7.5 million. Alexander 
Barkas, an influential partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,
based in Menlo Park named himself the company's 
temporary CEO. West became Geron's chief science officer. And the
company moved west, setting up shop in Hayward.

 Geron's secret to success, it seems, was financing several researchers
doing identical work, analysts say. This forced 
competition allowed it to race ahead of its rivals time and time again.

 In 1993, Ronald Eastman, who was a general manager for pharmaceutical
giant Lederle Laboratories, became the new CEO. 
Eastman later recruited an old buddy, David Greenwood, to be chief
financial officer.

 In those days, West's charisma was contagious, his fanciful talk of
immortalizing cells and organs inspiring to all those around 
him.

 ``The building was full of enthusiasm,'' remembered Calvin Harley, a
Canadian who is now Geron's chief science officer and 
was one if its first hires. ``It was like we were planning a big trip to
a new territory.''

 The company went public in 1996 and, as is the case in many start-ups,
as Geron grew, West's role shrank. 

He moved from science to business, coordinating collaborations with
other biotechnology ventures and large pharmaceutical 
companies. Eventually, he settled into the role of vice president of new
technologies, an honorary title.

 In time, it was clear West didn't fit in with the new corporate
leadership, employees say.

 Eastman and Greenwood were golden boys, popular all-American graduates
groomed at Ivy League business schools. West 
had little patience -- and knack -- for politics.

 Eastman, whose boyish grin belies his graying hair and is fond of
wearing a polarfleece vest with Geron's logo stitched on it, 
and Greenwood, a towering tri-athlete, made the company an intense but
fun atmosphere. Both now 47, they live less than a 
mile from each other in Monte Sereno.

 They made appearances at parties and sporty outings thrown by the
youthful Geron researchers and lab technicians. (The 
average age of the company's employees is 35.) West rarely attended.
``It seemed like I always had too much to do to play,'' 
he said in a recent interview. ``I'm a bit more of a workaholic.'' He
was still well liked by the scientists but admits that their 
relationships were more professional than social.

 Under this trio's leadership, the company expanded steadily. Morale was
high, as Geron stock over the years resembled 
mountains with new peaks each time an achievement was announced.

 Geron reached its first milestone in August 1997, when scientists in
academic labs it funded discovered telomerase, the ``holy 
grail'' of aging, extending the life of flasks of cells by resetting a
part of their DNA.

 OrbiMed analyst Gordon said most biotech companies with Geron's
resources would have limited their research to telomerase, 
focusing on its role in cancer development and inhibition. That may have
been more practical from a business standpoint, but 
West and his colleagues had grander plans.

 The company's hurricane-like growth only intensified. In December 1997,
Tom Okarma, a former Stanford University 
professor, was named vice president for research and development. He was
recruited to jump start the company's stem cell 
program, formerly West's domain.

 With Okarma on board, it seemed clear that there was little
responsibility left for West. By February 1998, West said, he 
knew he should leave.

 ``Being a gerontologist, I think about aging all the time and I
recognize our lives are short. I really wanted to make an impact 
and I thought that I could get more done if I branched off and did my
own thing,'' West said. ``I made the decision and left 
quickly.''

 After West left, others started trickling out of the company. One
former employee said it was due mostly to Geron's trailblazing 
that the field of aging had progressed so rapidly that there were now
many job options for experts.

 Last November, a few months after West's departure, Geron announced
another stunning achievement -- isolating primordial 
stem cells that, in theory, could be made to grow into any part of the
body such as skin, muscle and bone.

 Geron's scientific leaders immediately recognized their technology and
the cloning techniques developed by Scotland's Roslin 
Institute -- which had created Dolly -- were complementary.

 They theorized that stem cells could be used to grow into new tissue,
and that the nuclear transfer could be used to move a 
patients' own DNA to this tissue, preventing rejection. The telomerase
would ensure that the cells remained young despite 
numerous lab manipulations, which tended to age them.

 Early this year, Geron and Roslin Bio-Med, a spinoff of the Roslin
Institute, were married. Geron acquired the Scottish 
company for 2.1 million shares of stock worth about $25.7 million. They
also promised to invest an additional $20 million in the 
non-profit institute over the next six years.

 In return, Geron won the rights to all the nuclear transfer patents and
a contract with the institute's famous cloning experts, Ian 
Wilmut and John Clark. Under the agreement, Wilmut, the scientist
credited with creating Dolly, would spend around 75 
percent of his time on Geron-related projects.

 With this acquisition, Geron scientists believe they have all the
pieces to create hundreds of medical miracles. Whittling down 
the huge range of possibilities quickly became one of their biggest
dilemmas.

 Cancer? AIDS? Or stroke? Spinal cord injury? Or cuts?

 In early June, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic met in Edinburgh
for an intense three days of scientific presentations and 
debates.

 One of the first things that emerged unanimously on their agenda:
cloned piglets.

 The basic idea, to use the pigs as a source of organs to transplant in
humans, had been thrown around for decades. But in 
every case, patients' immune systems repelled the transplanted material.
Geron was offering a new twist: delete the gene in the 
pig that creates a sugar coating thought to be a major cause of
rejection.

 Wilmut, who heads up the project, said they hope to produce such a pig
by the end of the year.

 The rest of the agenda that emerged from the Geron-Roslin meeting was
even more ambitious. Geron even decided it would 
move into livestock, cloning premium animals -- from derby horses to
meaty cows -- that would have taken generations to 
breed.

 Anne Anderson, president of Atlantis Investment Co., said she believes
the broad nature of Geron's business ambitions are 
temporary and are important for fostering fertile and imaginative ideas.
But, she said, she expects them to ``prune down the 
road.''

 Meanwhile, analyst Gordon said investors are getting restless for the
company to bring a product into clinical trials. Geron's 
most advanced program is in exploiting a cell's love of telomerase to
treat cancer.

 In normal cells, telomere tips act like a burning fuse, shortening each
time the cell divides and ultimately triggering the cell's 
death. In cancer cells, the enzyme telomerase prevents the tips from
shortening, causing the uncontrolled growth that leads to 
tumors. Geron's goal is to inhibit the telomerase presence in tumors.

 Its challengers are intimidating. Scientists at Bristol-Myers Squibb,
which currently dominates the cancer market, and other 
pharmaceutical giants that are 200 to 500 times Geron's size have jumped
into telomerase research, building on Geron's 
successes.

 Geron's sudden success had another downside: close scrutiny. As more
and more people learned of its work, some began to 
question the ethics behind it.

 Geron faces challenges on two grounds. One is stem cell
experimentation. Anti-abortion and religious leaders have denounced 
the practice because stem cells are harvested from human embryos, which
they say have rights because they could be grown 
into a person. Another is the fear that Geron's advances in transferring
one being's nuclear material to another's may one day 
help scientific renegades clone humans.

 While human embryo research remains legal in most states so private
firms like Geron and West's ACT have been free to go 
ahead with experiments, Congress has prohibited federal funding of such
activities.

 Legislators are now reconsidering the philosophy behind that law.

 About 30 patient groups -- for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, AIDS,
cystic fibrosis, stroke and cancer -- have formed a 
coalition urging the government to give a green light to this research.
Without substantial federal funding, they feel the research 
will make sluggish progress.

 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, formed by President
Clinton, announced on Monday that they would side with 
the patient groups and recommended that federal funding be given to some
embryo research. Officials at the National Institutes 
of Health hope the bioethics advisory decision will spur legislation
that would reverse the government ban.

 But Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chair of the U.S.
Senate Aging Committee, along with other political 
leaders, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as such
prominent people as former Surgeon General C. Everett 
Koop have loudly fought these types of experiments.

 Richard Doerflinger of the Catholic conference said Geron's experiments
``destroys one life for another. They take the embryos 
apart at about a week old when they are perhaps a couple of hundred
cells,'' he said.

 Okarma said Geron currently gets its human stem cells from embryos
discarded by fertility clinics -- and, despite reports to the 
contrary, does not plan to clone human embryos for use in its
experiments. Geron's research remains controversial because it 
involves destroying a living embryo. In another, less convenient method,
the cells are harvested from aborted fetuses.

 As for the second ethical issue, the Roslin Institute's Wilmut said
fears over human cloning are misplaced, that there is a huge 
difference between therapeutic cloning, where embryos are created for
their cells, versus reproductive cloning, where they are 
grown into babies.

 There must be ``public understanding for this technology so people are
not afraid of it. When you talk abut cloning, people 
automatically think that you are copying people,'' Wilmut said. ``But
that was never and never will be a goal.''

 Analysts predict many of these ethical debates will be settled in
Geron's favor in the next few years. Meanwhile, as Geron 
moves from the freedom of childhood to the responsibility of
adolescence, it will have to quickly prove that it can live up to its 
great expectations.

 For the time being, Dr. Jerry Shay, a professor of cell biology at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and the 
other members of the the coterie of world aging experts who collaborate
with Geron or serve on its board of directors, are 
betting on Geron: ``Soon, very soon, Geron will be up there with the
Amgens and Genentechs and some day it may even rival 
the major pharmaceutical makers in the world.''

	Not boring, no. But normal, yes. In fact, maintaining the pretence
of normality is the mechanism behind the phenomenon of propagation of
outdated and useless traditions, and that which allows such deep and
subconscious programming of your average person. Distracted by the desire to
be normal, your average kid will participate in any ridiculous pantomime
with real zeal, without paying attention to what they're doing or why
they're doing it. By the time they're adult, these things are "normal" and
don't get questioned.
	The only deviant characteristics humans will tolerate are those that
are seen as sexually attractive in any way - Everyone wants to be special -
not as in "school" or "child", but in terms of being extra-cool, witty,
pretty, deep, passionate etc....
	I don't know people that want to be "special" in terms of the number
of arms they have.

> A related question:  what are the evolutionary advantages to love and

> What non-human species do you think have these experiences?
> 
> 
The evolutionary advantage of love is obvious - it binds a mating pair
together for a long time, perhaps life-long, with an aim to give the
offspring the best chance of survival through the partnership. You can
clearly see the role-splitting for males/females in today's society. The
conscious experience of "love" is currently thought to be brought about by
one substance alone - I forget the name, it's complicated. This substance is
highly addictive, and is only manufactured in the company of the other mate.
"Broken Hearts" and "Missing you" are both sensations attributed to
withdrawal from this substance. A great way of coercing a couple into
staying together for the good of the next generation, eh?

Friendship is also an easy one. Strength by numbers. Also resources - "it's
not what you know, but who you know". The consolidation is highly
advantageous to all involved.

The question about other species relates to the consciousness question,
which bugs thinkers the world over. We just don't have the necessary
technology at present to detect consciousness, so we can't say whether or
not any other species EXPERIENCE at all. However, our intuition, almost
universally in my experience, indicates otherwise. Ask yourself - is there
something behind that dog's eyes? Is he really here, just like me? Our
primal brain centres jump straight back with a resounding "Yes!". There's
some reason for this, whatever it is, and so given the total lack of data on
consciousness, I think the primal intuition will have to make do for now -
it's all we got. 
So, dogs are conscious, but where is the line drawn - are fish ? are
bacteria ? There's no way of saying. Again, look into the eyes of the
species in question and appeal to your primal brain, there's really no other
option at this time.

Rob.

>it's better to live in shame rather than die in honor.

I love these "It's better to....." snippets. They suck ass. They only apply
to the person making the statement. It's back to the old "everyone thinks
like me" mistake. The writer of this statement obviously attaches great
importance to existence for the sake of existence (perhaps the fear-o'-death
instinct is very strong). I, amongst others would disagree with the initial
statement, though. I'd sooner live for 5 seconds of pleasure, than 500 years
of sucky shite the idiotic human race has created for itself. Where'd I put
that exhaust-hose ?

	>Frankly I've never understood what's so transhuman about making
minimal use of webpage->enhancing technologies.

	Because, in the last year (so it seems) they've become permeated by
people with the usual cretinous method of achieving a sense of elitism -
just like the lifelong store clerks that constantly moan on about how stupid
people are. "Academic" style things, for instance, have to be presented in a
manner as displeasing to the eye as is possible. Firstly, a nice small font
to make you squint, then a collection of horrendous annotations, and most
importantly, the most esoteric vocabulary that can be dredged up. This makes
all concerned - author, readers etc.. very pleased with themselves that they
are privvy to such intellectual material. It also makes it totally
unpalatable to the average person, cutting accessibility, and so preserving
the elite.
	Another example is the computer dweeb that swears blind that he
hates GUIs, and much prefers CLI. This is as transparent as hell. Comp
dweebs that are particularly sad love to feel superior through their
computer knowledge. With a CLI, any operation means having to know the
relevant command, acceptable parameters and so on. This takes a lot of time
- which is the edge that dweebs with no lives have over ordinary people. So
they learn all the ins and outs of these CLI languages like UNIX, rattling
out 5 line commands full of grep's and squiqqly things, feeling all
intelligent, as the layman onlooker is (supposed to be) impressed. Now here
comes the new user-friendly GUI ! Watch the geeks' faces drop as their 5
line wonders become meaningless, with an equivalent function available at a
mouse click. They hate this new universal accessibility, and try to promote
the old system - by "hating" GUIs and constantly professing the wonders of
CLI.  
	My basic point is this - the only, and I mean ONLY reason that
anyone would want to make something look/feel extra drab or laborious is to
cut it's accessibility, probably to preserve their sense of elitism. Some
may not even realise this much. They may merely have previously associated
drab, inaccessible crap with the kind of ostentatious intellectual status
they are trying to attain....."oh, that's much too colourful and
vulgar....".
	The academics will soon feel the pain of the computer geek, as
people such as myself point out that allowing certain people an
information/power monopoly merely so that those involved can feel like the
big monkeys in the jungle, is totally unacceptable. Out with the old, in
with the new, power to the people right on, blah, blah.........

	Rob. Ranting for you....everyday *bing bong*.

Individual tastes are too wide to assume that any one specific type of
music would appeal to a vast array of people, regardless of enthusiasm for
space and technology.  Music, while received by the auditory sense, affects
the listener in more ways than by sound.  Music carries a vibration that
can be felt, (kinesthetic) tactile sense.  Also, the look of one instrument
may be more appealing than another, so an innate affinity may place
emphasis on one type of instrument over another.  Unless one wants to lick
a piano, guitar of synthesizer, the sense of taste really doesn't factor
in.  Smell, on the other hand has a strong memory association, and certain
sounds trigger emotional responses either from the smell of the instrument,
or the smell of the environment one hears the music in.

My appreciation for music is broad.  While I prefer techno and ambient
sound, a part of me moves to soul music rhythm and blues, syncopation, blue
note jazz, and rock opera.  Then there is the fiddle which I love and may
seem contradictory.  The thread for me is how my body moves to the music
and what emotional reaction I get.

J.R. wants to know what I recommend as an umbrella.

What purpose does an umbrella serve in the rain?
It prevents you from getting wet.

What are it's other advantages?
It's handy, it sometimes protects you against the sun,
you can hit someone with it, it feels good to hold on
to, you love to hear the rain hitting the cloth, you can 
hide your face if you don't want to meet someone...

What are it's disadvantages?
You sometimes forget to bring it home because you left it at the
grocery store, in heavy rain it makes a mess of you
rather than protecting you, it does not dry quickly...

There are a few things for the stock market
which have similar traits;

Money, Mind, Memory, Discipline, Knowledge(Technical
& Fundamental), Management(of money and time).

I am sure you are more aware than me about these things
but it was good to refresh myself.One thing that can get

I'm not sure that these substance(s) are completely known.
A quick scan of PubMed indicates that oxytocin and vasopressin have
been implicated in social bonding and control of the hypothalmic
pituitary adrenal axis.  [Psychoneuroendocrinology 1998 23(8):779-818]

As I recall there were some claims that substances in chocolate, perhaps
phenylalanine (if memory serves correctly), have been claimed to
produce feelings similar to love.  However PubMed draws a blank on
this so it falls into the rumor catagory...  It is certainly true
that our knowledge of neurotransmitters is incomplete at this time
(but in 5 years or so the story will be much different).

The consciousness question, begs the self-awareness issue.  Psychologists
have a very good test for that -- the "mirror test".  If an animal looks
into a mirror, does it recognize that it is seeing itself or does it
think it is another animal?

I think most psychologists would claim that only the great apes
can reliably pass that test, with chimpanzees coming out on top.
I've had people claim that their cat can pass this test -- but
does it happen on the first encouter with the mirror, or is it
simply a learned response?

There was a great video on one of the "pet shows" on TV the other
night, showing a small parrot, drawing close to its reflection
in a bathroom chrome fixture, screeching "pretty bird, pretty bird...",
clearly thinking it was another bird (unless you assume a very
narcissistic parrot...).  Parrots are supposed to have the
intelligence of 3-4 year old humans, so, I would say that
"mature" humans, chimpanzees and perhaps a few of the other
great apes could be considered self-aware.

Does anyone know at what age children pass the mirror test?
[They have to at least be able to focus first, so newborns
definately fail.]

Whether self-awareness and consciousness are the same is open for
discussion.  I would say that all animals have some level of
"consciousness" because consciousness is that part of the brain
that selects a behavior or action in response to a stimuli
(external or internal).  However, just because your dog is
"looks" consious doesn't mean it is "self-aware".  After thousands
of years of selective breeding, of course it is going to look like
there is something going on behind those big brown eyes, and of
course it is going to have behavior patterns (including learning
stupid dog tricks...) that make *you* think there is someone home.

I'm afraid I have to disagree here (being a UNIX dweeb for 25 years
or so...).  The fundamental reason CLI's exist is that when they
were designed, the machines were slow, memory was small and the
libraries to do GUI had yet to be written.  My first year at college,
when all the VDTs (video display terminals for those of you who don't
go back that far...) were busy, I'd use a 300 baud teletype to put
my programs into the computer.  There were people who did "GUIs" for
the VDTs and even the teletype, but the results were pretty poor.

The reason CLIs remain popular today is because it is still generally
faster (and smaller) to code CLIs than GUIs.  If I'm writing code for
myself or another person comfortable with computers I would write a CLI.
If I had to write code for a non-computer literate audience (and had the
time) I'd write a GUI.

It has little to do with elitism and a lot to do with simple economics.

Well, you have to really enjoy sex not just with one partner (as many
women do) but with most men (which far fewer women do).  Nonetheless, I
know of prostitutes who appear to fit the latter criteria.  (Norma Jean
Almodovar, former Libertarian Party Lt. Governor candidate is one.  See
"From Cop to Call Girl".)

Whether it's legal or not, it will be easily accessible from here. 
However, in the present time, American porn sites have all this stuff,
too.  (Well, it depends on what you mean by "young girls," I suppose, as
virtually all aboveground American sites show models who are eighteen
and over.)

Prostitutes have been stigmatized since Biblical times, before the
introduction of syphilis:
http://www.theblackswan.com/review/article1.htm

This is because syphilis was not the first deadly venereal disease in
Europe; gonorrhea predates it.

It is true that there were periods in Ancient History where prostitution
was not stigmatized at all.  In the ancient Near East, there were
several cultures where every woman was expected to be a temple
prostitute at least once.  (Temples of Astarte and Inana in Phoenicia
and Sumeria.)  There were both men and women who worked professionally
as temple prostitutes their whole lives. As far as we can determine,
this was as respectable a profession as any other.

http://www.theblackswan.com/review/artic14.htm

>From a history of prostitution:
http://www.theblackswan.com/review/article.htm
(I don't know how accurate it is, but it matches with what I know from
other sources.)

I read a translation of some Sumerian myths about Inana.  (It's
excellent, and quite readable - "Inana, Queen of Heaven and Earth" by
Wolkstein).   There is a core concept of "me," the sacred knowledge. 
The sacred knowledge includes dozens of things, but it includes the
throne of kingship, the art of forthright speech, the art of travel, the
art of the plundering of cities, the craft of the copper worker, and the
arts of prostitution and fellatio.  The first time I read it I really
started to understand that the customs of my tribe are not the laws of
nature.

Celtic women had sex with whomever they felt like (often a military
hero) and their offspring would be raised by their brothers.  But this
system may have died out in part due to the arrival of gonorrhea.  (Even
under this system, however, sex would not be freely available to all
men, any more than it is in San Francisco - see below.)

What's in it for me?

With the advent of birth control and legal abortion,  sex is no longer
particularly tied to reproduction, and hasn't been for decades.  Women
are still pickier than men.  Where I live (San Francisco Bay Area),
women usually have (safe) sex whenever the heck they feel like it. 
There's certainly no social stigma against it - in this town,
politicians go out of their way to appeal to the "leather" vote, and a
former prostitute is on the Board of Supervisors.  But most women are
still highly selective about their partners.

Even if the government was giving me tons of money to have babies, I
would still have to invest years of personal effort in raising those
children.

Giving out money to support children is a great way to get birth rates
to outstrip resource growth rates.  China is desperately trying to
control birth rates coercively while financially supporting the children
that are born.

For a while, the IRS was running a brothel in Nevada that had been
repossessed for tax problems.  As I recall, they were losing money...

Why on earth should the taxpayer subsidize prostitution?  If it were
legal, it would become much more socially acceptable, and prices would
start to drop.  (In interviews I've read with prostitutes, they say the
worst part of their job is the social stigma.)

Imagine a brothel run by the government.  You'd have to stand in line
for hours.  Your real name would be recorded in a central registry
somewhere.  All the women, no matter what their appearance or special
talents, would have to charge the same amount, and you wouldn't be able
to pick which one you wanted.  Gay men would be allowed to work as
prostitutes, but only under a "Don't ask, don't tell" policy.  Which
particular fetish activities were to be covered would become a matter of
national debate.

To use a tired old libertarian analogy, "Imagine if going to a brothel
was like going to the DMV."

Well, if you're asking, "Would you have recreational sex with someone
because a panel told you to?" of course not.  If you're asking, "If you
wanted to have a baby without a male partner, would you choose a sperm
donor on the basis of what a panel thought?" I might take it into
consideration, but I'd be more likely to ask a male friend who I knew
well and respected, and preferably, found attractive.  (I, personally,
would never have a baby without a committed partner, but I can see this
as a somewhat reasonable course of action.)

I don't think science has discovered everything there is to know about
attraction yet.  My instincts about people tend to be very accurate.  If
I wasn't attracted to someone at all, I would think that there might be
a reason.

If I was able to genetically engineer my child using the DNA from
several sources, such a recommendation would bear more weight.  But at
that point, I would probably have far more knowledge about what the
genes I was using really did, and I wouldn't have to take them
all-or-nothing as we do today.

This seems unnecessary.  A person who has the vaccine can prove it via a
privately issued ID card, registration in a privately owned central
database, etc.  A person who isn't sexually active or who is in a
monogamous relationship shouldn't have to take the risk.

Anyone who chooses to be sexually active can assess the risks of a new
partner for themselves.  It's not as though you can catch an STD by
walking down the street; being sexually active is a voluntary behavior.

Bureaucracies virtually never produce anything useful.  The minute you
give them the right to do *anything*, even something that seems
desirable (preserving wetlands and endangered species, for example),
they immediately use that power to stomp on the rights of individuals. 
I am loathe to give them any more power than they have, especially
without far more convincing proof that overpopulation is a problem. 

A few facts:

* The world economy has doubled in size every fifteen years for a long
way back, even though populations are rising all the time
* Birth rates are dropping below replacement rates in all the first
world countries
* Fremont, California, a nice suburban town in Northern California, has
the same population density as Calcutta
* The prices of scarce metals drop continuously in response to better
extraction techniques and more efficient usage, despite increasing
numbers of people on earth

What prompted the statement was an article I read about the information
women share with one another about their sex partners and the damage
a man could do to his future prospects (within a circle where such
information is shared (office, club, etc.)) if his "performance"
was not up to par.  I suspect that different women have very
different criteria for what constitutes "good performance"
though there may be some "common elements".  The reason for
an "independent panel" for evaluation is that this would allow
a balanced assessment.  Of course an individual could rely
on an assessment by a single other person if they knew that their
criteria were similar.  Of course that removes the anonymity
from the process.  I also doubt there are many women, who
once they have found a "good" man (and/or traind him well... :-))
will be exactly thrilled about recomending him to their girlfriends.

If we assume that the extropian philosophy includes "non-control",
do women have to completely give up the genetic drive "to catch
and keep a man" (historically, for resource utilization) in order
to be a "true" extropian?  [Keeping in mind the a/b/c criteria I
provided which remove many of the traditional arguments for
faithfullness in relationships and the fact that in environments
where there is enough social or cultural support, women do not
abolutely "need" a man to successfully reproduce.]

> A man is a good sex partner to a woman if they
> listen to each other and understand and appreciate each others' ideas.

This is a "good friend", not a good "sex partner".  Some woman may
argue that the two cannot be disconnected.  My thinking was more
along the lines that in many situations sex with a partner is
more interesting than solitary sex.  In part this is because there
are more "unknown" variables, so it is inherently less boring.
[To some degree it is the unknown variables that can create the
possibility for "bad" sex.  The reason I suggested an anonymous rating
system was that presumably people with high ratings are better at
recognizing, responding to and managing these "unknowns".]

In addition, physiologically, it is impossible to self-stimulate in
certain ways (this is why you cannot tickle yourself).  When I say a
good "sex partner", I mean an individual with whom you can have sex
who can stimulate and satisfy you (sexually) in ways that you are unable
to satisfy yourself.

> here, of course) so it wouldn't be any good.

This may be true for you, but I suspect that there are quite a few
generation X & Y women who openly "do" men.  I've known a few women
who would fall into the category of believing that "some sex" is
better than "no sex", and in situations where a "good friend &
sex partner" is unavailable will pick the friendship from one
tree and the sex from another.

The reason this is report is clueless is that it assumes past consumption
trends. As societies become more affluent they do not spend more of their
money on basic goods. Except for a few fashion oriented individuals most of
the upper middle class is not really concerned with clothing today. An old
pair of levis or sweats is fine. But go to a society which is now just
experiencing discretionary income and everyone is dressed to the nines! We
do tend to spend a lot on food but it is fast food. How many of us are now
regretting the 4'th BBQ?
Back to slimfast!

Food, shelter, cars... how much more do we need? Except for demand created
by advertising we are at our limits of consumption of traditional products. 

As the society ages though the new consumption products will be extropian. I
need a new custom grown pituitary gland. I am sick and tired of hearing a
doctor tell me I am no longer 18. I may not be 18 but I am not 95!

ROTFL, this made my day. Thank you!!!!

It reminds me of a gentlemen's bar in Los Angeles which had a shower on
stage. The bar was shut down because the shower was not wheelchair accessible. 
The owner commented that they had never had an exotic dancer in a
wheelchair, but if they found one they would be sure to hire them and make
the shower accessible.

Well, how about if I send this question to the list instead of looking it
up on the website, cause that way more people will get the answer all at
once...

We are all registering for Extro $ this week if we haven't already, cause
the price goes up after this week. A significant percentage of us are not
students, have no other discounts, and owe you membership renewal money.
This will be a very common situation. So we will want to know the total
amount of money to send...$180 for the conference + ? for membership
renewal = ?? to the Maxella Avenue address before July 10?

I recommend any future jazz music, and the _Lost In Space - Drum 'n' Bass_ series 
by Cerbad 2. Especially Phase 2 (listen to _Cassiopeia_ or _Wing it_) and Phase 3 
(listen to _Tiger Style_ and _Sun within the Sun_). 

Also I recommend anything by Goldie, but especially his release _Timeless_.

The Flood legend now has a scientific explanation.  Apparently around
5600 B.C.  the Mediterranean Sea broke though the Bosporus and flooded
into the Black Sea expanding its area by a factor of 3.  See the book
"Noah's Flood" @ amazon.com.  It is believed as well that the legend
of Atlantis arose from a volcano in the Aegean sea destroying a Minonian
civilization in 1629 B.C.

So many "legends" have a basis in fact, but it takes a lot of hard
work to tease out the truth behind the fiction.

What is fascinating (looking under both Flood and Atlantis @ Amazon)
is the degree to which pseudoscience prevails in our culture!

This seems true, if you look at how hard it is to find good fossils today,
when we cover the globe and people have "jobs" to explore uninhabited
areas for fossils and sophisticated tools to uncover and preserve them,
ancient people running across T-Rex skeletons would have been very rare
indeed.  I believe that it wasn't until the mid-1800's that enough 
geological and fossil evidence had accumulated to call into question
the Biblical version of "genesis" and allow the development of Darwin's
theory of evolution.

A much better explanation in my mind would be simply "horrific images"
dragged from the depths of nightmares.  Remember, we are talking the
people who want to decorate their edifices with images that will scare
you into believing that they have the "true answers"...

Now, on the other hand there clearly are some genetic memories that
are built into humans.  If you think about this for a minute, it
would make sense to have genetic memories regarding situations or
substances that could represent a threat to survival (particularly
for small children who may not have learned to avoid certain things).

Some possibilities I've thought about include snakes, insects
(why do most humans hate cockroaches?) and certain specific
smells (especially any smells involving death, illness or decay).
There may also be some innate response to "red" (the color of
blood), though this could be learned.  There appears to be
a significant amount of wiring in the brain for "face recognition".
This is an essential requirement for friend or foe analysis to
trigger your fight/flight response.

And of course many of our sexual and emotional triggers and
responses have a substantial hard-wired component.

I hardly think that needs to be argued. I can't think of a way a person

You said 'partner,' someone who was having sex at the same time. Someone
could provide some kinds of good or not-good non-partnered sex without
being a good friend, I think, but as you were speaking of reproduction I
don't think this applies.

I believe that some women do this, even that is is common, but I can't
believe it is any more or less pleasant for the people involved depending
on one person's skills. Clearly in such a situation the parties would say
what they wanted and satisfaction would depend on the level of cooperation
and so forth. Therefore I can't imagine anyone would find a use for the
findings of an independent panel or a way to serve on such a panel.

This is accurate, but *because* gonorrhea had existed for a long time
there was a natural resistance in the population.  Syphilis was
introduced into a population with no resistance and spread rapidly.
During its earliest period, in many people, it caused a rapid  progression
to a condition where you made lepers look "good".  That kind of
a disease is bound to create a backlash in a population towards
its causes (and the causes were well known, at least in Spain from
the beginning).

If HIV were a more deadly disease, there would probably be more rapid
progress towards a vaccination (rather than the waffling you see today).
We would also tend to have a selection for that fraction of the
population with the mutations that confer resistance.

This makes sense, women can adopt to open sexual practices so long
as they are confident that the children will be cared for.  It
also makes sense in certain societies to try to breed better warriors.

Well, universal care for children frees women to sleep with

You could be poor but if you can come up with cute, funny, strong,
a good "rating" by the independent panel (:-)) ...  you would have
more women after your buns.

Exactly, even though we have removed one of the primary reasons
women had to be picky, we haven't removed the genetic programming
for "pickyness"!

In our society yes, but not in certain tribal societies or other
countries.  It always amazes me at the number of single mothers there
were and to some degree still are in Russia.  The communist system
(for all its faults) in combination with extended families provided
enough support that single motherhood was not really difficult.

This isn't true in every country.  In France and some other European
countries they *are* providing government subsidies for people to
have children because they are near or below the replacement rate.
In order to keep the economies growing, they have to allow immigration
which creates "highly undesirable" (I presume) cultural pollution.
So it is politically acceptable and even necessary to promote
baby-making by the nationals.

I shouldn't have used the word "managed".  And no, I didn't mean to
imply that the government should subsidize it.  Though I expect there
would be an economic tradeoff between subsidizing prostitutes and
paying for more police to keep you safe from the over-testosteronized
males with no sexual outlet...

Readily available sex only works if it is "safe", it only will be
"safe" if someone who doesn't have a stake in it is policing it.
So, presumably you would have the government involved only to
ensure that the people working in brothels are healthy (just as governments
now ensure that your restaurant workers don't carry hepatitis).

I'm trying to determine what it takes to get women into the male frame
of mind where you look at an unfamiliar partner as "doable".  

I'm assuming reproduction is not part of the equation, so that removes
the classical "pickyness" of does he have a good job, good looks, etc.
The thing that seems to remain is the unknown of "is this guy likely
to be a good lover?".  The independent panel gives you a way of
that information being available to you and the Japanese broadcast
computer gives you a way of determining your proximity.

As pointed out by another reader, your immune system compatibility
and/or your pheromones sensitivity have a lot do do with your "attraction".
What isn't clear is the degree to which some of us have lost
these senses.  It isn't "essential" for individual mating per se, but
desirable from the perspective of the survival of a group.
[Nature wants to increase the immune system diversity of a species
to prevent single diseases from wiping out a flock/herd/tribe/etc.]

I suspect that women have a very complex combination of both
a biochemical compatibility computer and a social success computer
that get integrated to determine what we consciously call attraction.

I would argue that complete (from the ground-up) engineering of
a human genome is 10-15 years out (assuming the luddites don't
get too loud).  The problem is that genomes are so complex, that
it could take you years of education and work (even with a lot of
computer assistance) to go into each and every detail.  Of course
you can select an "off-the-shelf" package (again prepared by
a panel of experts), but how much creativity is there in that?

If you could design a child from "scratch", how much time
(and/or money) would you devote to creating the "perfect child"?

Sorry, no.  I might have read about it in perhaps slashdot.org
(though I browse several news sources, so it could easily have
been elsewhere).   It was basically a gizmo, something like
a beeper that you could program with your traits (ht/wt/etc.)
and what you liked/wanted.  It then did a short distance broadcast
of this information and received other broadcasts, "buzzing"
you when it found a nearby "match".  Apparently very popular
with the young people going out on the town for a night.
A technological solution to the problem of "so many people,
so little time"...

Well, how about if I send this question to the list instead of looking it
up on the website, cause that way more people will get the answer all at
once...

We are all registering for Extro $ this week if we haven't already, cause
the price goes up after this week. A significant percentage of us are not
students, have no other discounts, and owe you membership renewal money.
This will be a very common situation. So we will want to know the total
amount of money to send...$180 for the conference + ? for membership
renewal = ?? to the Maxella Avenue address before July 10?

But what I am saying is this doesn't make any sense. A guy is likely to be
a good lover with a particular person if he and the other person respond to
each others ideas and understand each other in general not because it's
'nicer' to have sex with your friends but because you can't possibly have
good sex without good communication. The partners have to have their needs
understood. If people on the panel were understood by a person that has
nothing to do with whether the person would understand YOU. It is not just
a matter of being smart or speaking the same language.

If HIV were more virulent, you would see a far more puritan movement in
society. Those that engage in sexual and other practices which easily
pass along HIV would be far greater pariahs than they are now. Take the
heroin junkie for example. That person is responsible for more spread of
aids than homosexual activity, but the fashion and entertainment
industry has promoted the 'look' of the junkie for years as being
desireable, and so many actors and actresses, musicians and models are
or were junkies. If HIV were more virulent, smack addicts would have
been rounded up a long time ago (as well as gays). This is simple mob
psychology.

Really. Well, why hasn't it happened with 35 years of welfare society?

Considering what a large percentage of Russian males who are vodka
junkies, its no wonder there are so many single mothers.. they'd rather
not have such pathetic creatures around.

The problem they find is that the more educated a person is, the less
likely they are to reproduce, not to mention the disincentive that
cultural apathy has on birth rates.

> Bureaucracies virtually never produce anything useful.

How wrong you are 'o libertarian one! :-)

I will simply cite the history of the human genome project.
When the HGP was started (circa 1985), nobody thought it
was possible.  So picking a number out of a hat, they picked
2005 as a reasonable completion date.

For about 5 years nothing happened because the technology did
not exist to do it.  In the early 1990's they decided that
substantial progress needed to be made in the underlying
technologies, so NIH funded a series of development projects.
That lead to 3-5 labs developing the basic improvements and
prototypes of the capillary sequencing apparatus that are
now being sold by Molecular Dynamics and Perkin Elmer/
Applied Biosystems.  [A clear case of government funded
technologies migrating to industrial production.]

When it became clear (after ~5-7 years of R&D), what the
capacities of the machines were, the government revised
its completion target date to 2003.

Perkin Elmer decided that its machines could provide an
interesting business oportunity to get into the health
care business (a growth industry) and together with
Craig Venter (from Human Genome Sciences & The Institute
for Genomic Research -- the people who sequenced the first
bacterial genomes), founded Celera and said that they would
sequence the genome by 2001.

The government "bureaucracy", non-plused by such brashness
(and the concern that a private company might patent key
portions of the human genome), accelerated its time table,
and has issued contracts to the most productive labs currently
in operation to get 90% of the genome done by next year!

So, what was to have been a ~20 year, $2-3 billion dollar
project is coming in ahead of schedule and under budget.

I will allow that industry competition has helped the
schedule along, but it took some highly motivated and
visionary individuals (Dr. Watson being a key player)
saying something is possible and desirable, convincing
the government "bureaucracy" to make a long term
commitment to a project whose feasibility and results
were substantially doubtable to produce a result
which will be critical for your long term health
and well-being!

Government bureaucracies *do work*, in situations where
the economic justifications for projects cannot be
made in industry (who have to watch the bottom line).
Given that situation, you have to allow for a higher
failure rate among the things that government bureaucracies
attempt.  This is why the congressional criticisms of
"stupid" or "failed" projects can be counterproductive
in the long term.  If it were an "assured success" a business
would have done it before the government even thought
about doing it.

I would add that much of the Web as we know it today
would not exist (or would have been significantly delayed),
if DARPA (a government agency) hadn't funded the development
of the TCP/IP protocols back in the '60s.   We also
probably wouldn't have the fast computers as fast as
those currently on your desk have if NASA hadn't pushed for
miniaturization and integrated circuits in the race to the moon.

We certainly wouldn't have solar cells, that if prices continue
to decline, you should be able to install in for your own
home power system within 10 years, freeing yourself from the
local electrical monopoly, if the government had not for
may years funded their R&D.

Yes, 'o Libertarian-Wan, governments & bureaucracies
are universally bad...

The solution to the DMV problem is to introduce competition.
[I assume that brothels will be in competition with each
other so they would never end up looking like the DMV.  :-)]

Now, switching tracks entirely, industry and/or competition is
not a universal good!

In a highly competitive environment, you cannot make the
investments necessary for long term R&D projects.  You *also*
generally *do not* undertake projects that will result in
the elimination of your market.  What Razor/razor blade
manufacturing company would undertake a project for
research into creams that permanently prevent hair growth?
Only if a competitor appears to be on the verge of developing
such a breakthrough would a company be forced to pursue
this type of development.  I've seen some interesting
documentaries on PBS about how GM methodically went about
buying up and shutting down public transportation systems
to increase the market for automobiles. A collective of
companies will act in their own self-interest to promote
the sales of their products.  You will not see GM/Ford/Crysler
act in a way to promote bicycles (or mass-transit)!

A case in point would be the pharmaceutical industry and
vaccines.  What pharmaceutical company is going to develop
a one-time vaccine, when they could instead devote their
resources to a multiple-use drug?  Most vaccines have
been developed either by government "bureaucracies"
or by contracts that the government made with industry
or by non-profit organizations.

On the other hand, I suspect you as a consumer would
generally prefer a one-time polio shot as an infant
to many years spent in an iron-lung that used to
be sold on a per-patient basis!

An industry will not generally act in a way so as to
eliminate its markets, on the other hand a government
can act in the collective interest of its citizens.

The fundamental question then becomes what are these
"collective interests"?!?

> (preserving wetlands and endangered species, for example),

Aha, well here we come to the crux of the problem.

As a home buyer with an interest in affordable housing,
you would like to see land inexpensively developed.
As a contractor intested in profits, you would prefer
to have more land available and fewer environmental
regulations to wrestle with.  However either individual,
as a parent, might wish to share some of the natural
beauty of the planet either themselves or with their
children without having to drive 500 miles (804.5 km)
to find some!

> they immediately use that power to stomp on the rights of individuals. 

So, do these rights of "indviduals" include the right
to develop where-ever/when-ever they see fit and
therefore impose consequences on the population/planet
that *other* individuals have not explicitly agreed to?

What fraction of people doing *anything* consciously
thinks about "to what degree by my doing xxxxxxxxx
am I stealing (taking without reimbursing) from the
common (generally available, not easily subject to
cost accounting) resource base?

> I am loathe to give them any more power than they have, especially
> without far more convincing proof that overpopulation is a problem. 

"Overpopulation" is not a problem.  "Popluation" relative to
available resources and or "population impact" on the environment
*is* a problem.  It has been a problem for perhaps 50,000 years!
About 2500 yeras ago Turkey was a nicely forrested country, today it
is not.  The reason (according to my understanding) is that most of
the trees were cut down to build the ships used in the Turkish-Greek
wars in ancient times.  Going back further, a recent article I read
attributes most of the extinction of larger land mammals in Europe,
North America, and especially Australia to the arrival of man.

We do not tread lightly on the planet.  Whether other species
do is open to question (comments????).  Of course, since
other species are presumably "unconscious" of their "treading",
they can/should not be held responsible for it.  We on the
other hand do not have that luxury.

If you have a libertarian philosophy/perspective, please
present a reasonable argument that you should be allowed an
unregulated "free hand" to "modify" our collective environment.

Anyone who was an young active adult in the late 60's and 70's can tell you
of many ways they had great sex without even knowing the partners name much
less being friends. The norm than was more to say "your place or mine?",
"what do you do?" before asking their name. You might remember their name or
even become friends later. Ah, for the good old days.

I _know_ that sounded banal!  That was just a list of music that I, 
personally, find (for lack of a better term) "mind expanding."  I 
disrecommend liking or pretending to like anything that's not "your bag."  
Individualism is an integral part of extropian thought; this was simply my 
personal take, not some warped plea for "party unity" or whatever.

And that's it.

The question is whether or not a woman can adopt (or even *perceive*)
things from the male "genetic orientation".  At this time I have a lover
who is a wonderful "sex partner".  I would question whether or not
we are "good friends", because our interests and histories are simply
too different.  That does not mean that we do not care about each
other, it may mean that we are realistic about our differences.
Thus, one relates to people on 3 levels: sexual, emotional and
intellectual (which seems to make sense).  As a man (who has
grown tired of seeking the right combination of these things in
a single individual), I am sometimes willing to compromise and
fullfill these various needs from different sources.

The question is -- are women who are able to achieve
this "disassociation" or must they always be united?
*And*, if they must always be united, how do you justify
"holding out" for the perfect one?  Or do you simply compromise
(taking a 5 in each catagory, rather than an 8 or 10 in two or one).

How can you say that?!?  Why would sex be any different from tennis
or chess?  In a situation where someone makes a masterful move or
demonstrates significant skill, one watches (or experiences!)
with admiration.  In a situation where someone is terribly inept
making uncomfortable mistakes, one can feel pity or empathy but
seldom admiration.  Those situations are unpleasant in my opinion.

Well for some people being an "actor" in a movie is much less
satisfying than rafting down a river and experiencing the
random twists that reality throws at you.  Few people like
to be excessively "directed" because it is hard to "directed"
without it turning into being "controled".  While the desire to
please or satisfy or produce a mutually satisfactory result
counteracts this to some degree I suspect it has its limits.

The panel is a "indicator of a level of competence", similar to the
way an "Underwriters Laboratory seal of approval", a high school diploma
or a university degree is (in  a very limited sense).  Perhaps you
are wise or intuitive enough that you have only had "competent" lovers.

If women are able to "excise" the natural genetic "pickyness"
(wealth, intelligence, similarity to a women's way of thinking, being
verbal rather than visual, having a dis/similar immune system, etc.),
then presumably one would want to substitute generic "expertise" or
"competence" as a selection criteria.

Can you honestly tell me that on a night when you had more than enough
caring "friends", had finished your reproductive agenda and your
hormones were making you simply "hot-to-trot", you would want to
go out and pick up a terrible lover?

No, no no!  There is a distinct difference between "universal *care*"
and "caring" to hide the problem.  In some tribal societies, the
children are viewed as "cherished resources" (in contrast to the
average politician's view of the average welfare child...).
There is a big difference to putting a band-aid on a wound
to stop the bleeding and treating a serious infection.

There is also a big difference in a culture structured to
support children and one where children are viewed as a
parent's responsibility or a culture where the system is designed
to promote having children as a method for supporting the parent!

If you can find a "welfare child" who considers that he was
universally cared for and cherished by the elders of his
community, then I'll eat this letter.  Children aren't stupid,
the recognize when they are being swept under the rug or
pushed into the background (or treated as commodities).
When that happens, the result is low self-esteem.  Can you
honestly claim that our "welfare society" served to promote
the self-esteem of the individuals who were "helped" by it?

[Which is not to say that I know how to design or operate a
program that would be designed to promte self-esteem!]

lawyer; Edgar is stupid."). E-Prime emerges from the tradition of General
Semantics. The reason for E-Prime is that the "is of identity" connotes an
eternal Platonic essence possessed by the thing that is said to "be"
something. The "is of identity" tends to blind both the speaker and the
audience to many important characteristics about the relationship between
the person being described and the quality or category being assigned to
them. "Joe is a racist": "Racism" is not a measurable quantity of an object
like mass or momentum; there is no "racism meter" we can point to a person
that will detect whether Joe has the "essence" of a "racist" in him.
"Racist" is a name we give to an object based on our observations of
emergent phenomena like behavior; but the assignment of the label is in our
heads, not in physical reality. E-Prime, by restricting the use of the "is
of identity," makes explicit the fact that these are statements about the
state of our nervous system, not about the outside world. E-Prime confines
itself to observations and operational statements like "Joe frequently makes
statements that sound racist to me" or even "I heard Joe say Angelo is a
dirty wop."

Examples of English sentences translated into E-Prime:

ENGLISH: Marty is an asshole.
E-PRIME: Marty frequently says things that make me angry.

ENGLISH: Religious fanatics like David Koresh are dangerous. (Makes the
implicit assignment "David Koresh was a religious fanatic.")
E-PRIME: The government considered David Koresh, whose followers believed he
was God, a danger to their authority. (Talks about who holds what beliefs.)

ENGLISH: Natalie Merchant's voice is the most beautiful in the world.
E-PRIME: I like Natalie Merchant's voice better than anyone else's.

ENGLISH: Natalie Merchant is a Commie dupe.
E-PRIME: Natalie Merchant has said she thinks private property is bad. (An
operational statement of an observable fact regarding something somebody has
said.)

Taxation destroys far more in economic productivity than it can ever
return to its beneficiaries. Getting money from the government is a
negative sum game.  I'd much rather live in a freer economy, where I can
more easily make my own money.

If women were really all that motivated by men's bank accounts,
struggling musicians would never get laid while UNIX sys admins would be
the new Don Juans.  But the opposite is usually true.

In a gushing economy like we have in the United States, the resources
that are most important for the health of the children are time, care
and attention.  Lots of women make more money than their husbands. 
Money does matter, but it's not the only factor in the resources
equation.  For many women, it's not a factor at all.

This is an issue of interest to me, as well.  But I think that culture
and government are different things.  I would like to raise my children
in a communal culture, but culture exists on a small scale and is
voluntary.

But how to create a communal culture?  It seems to me that anywhere
where the same people have had to live with each other for a long time,
preferably people mixed in age, that a communal culture will develop. 
Many small towns in the US seem to have this type of mutual care, while
none of the cities seem to.

Being horny - even really, really, really horny and not able to think
about anything but women - does not make a man a rapist.  If he's not of
good conscience, it might impel him to steal money so that he could go
to a prostitute.  But a man has to be indifferent to or actively enjoy a
woman's terror while raping her, and most men find this repugnant.

This can be done privately.  Even though she is operating outside the
bounds of the law, a good madam will insist that all her girls use
condoms and be regularly checked for disease.  Her reputation is worth a
lot more than government certification.  This is more true of "high
class" call girls than street prostitutes.  But if prostitution were
legal, a number of private mechanisms would arise to certify the women
disease-free. For example, private certification boards, ID cards from a
health clinic, private, voluptuary central databases kept by an
independent medical agency, instant disease test kits - one drop of
blood from the prostitute, and she's certified clean.

There are also several sites on the web and newsgroups where people
share reviews of prostitutes.  If someone posts "I got syphilis", it
can't be good for business.

http://www.worldsexguide.org/

The same is functionally true of restaurants - the health inspector
comes only once a year, but a restaurant will go out of business if
there is an outbreak of food poisoning.  So restaurant owners have a
big incentive to use sanitary cooking practices.  After the Jack in the
Box E. Coli outbreaks, the chain spent an extraordinary amount of money
on advanced research in sanitary cooking technology to make sure it
never happens again.  The government didn't require it, but the market
did.

If prostitution were legal, someone who'd gotten a disease at "Amsterdam
House of Pleasure" could get a story written about it in the paper.

Ah, you don't need a panel - what you need is collaborative filtering
for men.  If you like Steve, you'll also like Joe!  You could call it 
slamazon.com, where everyone can post their anonymous comments about
performance, and based on the men you've already slept with, it
recommends other guys you might like to sleep with.

Will guys really sign up for that?  Is there a subset of women who
would?

It certainly doesn't sound appealing to me, but I don't think I'm the
target audience.

But isn't it desirable for the individual?  Because then the offspring
inherit a more diverse set of immunities.  New genes are good genes. 
That's why people are attracted to people with foreign accents.

Me personally?  Quite a lot.  I actually may just make it in time - I'm
27, so in ten or fifteen years I'll still be able to have children. 
(Although at that point, the female years of fertility will probably
have been extended as well.)  

Someday I want to finish my biochemistry degree (I got distracted by
this New Economy thing), and I happen to love biohacking, so yes, if I
were to pursue such a course, I'd want to do my own research.  I have
found that it's not too hard to become more informed than my doctors.
 
But I would have to be convinced that the technology was safer in humans
than the risk of disease that the kid will already be running.  Genetic
engineering in humans will be pretty dangerous for the first generation
or so.  For example, what if you give your kid *all* the genes known to
be associated with intelligence, and find out that in combination they
produce schizophrenia?

So in just fifteen years, I don't think I would make more than a few
modifications.  Nothing really horrible runs in my family, but there are
some annoying diseases I'd like to select
against, and I'm exceptionally unathletic, so I suppose some athletic
genes might be worth the risk.  I wouldn't want to go crazy and cram the
DNA of every Olympic athlete together, but I think I may have reduced
oxygen carrying capacity and I condition extremely slowly compared to
the norm.  I wouldn't particularly want to pass that on.  Of course I'd
want to insure that my kids are smart, but that seems like an
exceptionally risky area, as it's known that some of the genes for
intelligence are associated with schizophrenia.  So I'd be very cautious
there.

Scary thought: at some point, the DNA of celebrities will become a
valuable commodity, but one that is easily pirated - the code will make
its way into the underground economy as easily as an MP3 file.  So a
whole
generation of kids is going to wind up with a disproportionate number
that look like the 2015-equivalent of Britney Spears.

And then there's the 90's... Have you seen a GUI in the last 10 years? How
about the modern software development languages/environments.

I was a hard core CLI man myself, for a long time, basically because CLI
programming is simpler. There just aren't as many options, so you don't have
to think as hard.

The only drawback is that there just aren't as many options. The things you
can do with GUIs now... Remember writing report printing code under DOS or
UNIX, or doing stuff with the screen? Now you can just drop a couple of
components on a form, choose a couple (really! two or three!) options in a
happy little property editor, and wham, you've got printing, or database
access, or clipboard, or internet communication, or full video, etc etc.... 

The stuff that used to be really hard, or at least time consuming, now comes
bundled. You can scoff at this if you like, but I find that it's extremely
liberating. You don't spend all your time re-inventing the wheel in your
user interface, or with data structures (when was the last time I had to
write a hash-table/b-tree combo?) or with I/O, or with database access, or
writing low level protocol stuff (although of course you can if you want
to). You do spend time on what your program is really about, the custom
bits, the stuff that is actually interesting about your application.

Plus, you can get into new areas without learning the whole field first. I
wanted to start doing more interesting things with MIDI music recently, and
wondered where to start. I found that many of the apps which I use for MIDI
actually have COM interfaces (yep, MSEmlyn, boo hiss, although I refuse to
touch their programming languages). This means direct programmable control.
So I can do from code whatever I can do in the apps I already have. Later, I
can work out how each app does what it does, and replace it if I want.

That's what an OS is about I think; providing useful resources to the
application. When you add the internet to the mix, you can suddenly expand
those resources almost at whim (need a digital audio component? or source
code? or library? Spend a few minutes (hours?) on the net...). It just blows
my mind.

The idea of going back to the command line OSes of old, fishing out printer
manuals full of control codes, or poking frequencies into the registers in
my sound card, or trying to write ping to talk to the net over my modem...
why not just chop off my hands. 

If I'm still using a desktop style GUI with tools like Delphi in 5 years,
I'll know I've failed to keep up (I'm probably falling behind right now).

The dichotomy is artificial. I use both GUI and CLI all of the
time. They are not mutually exclusive, but complementary.

Title
  Antiperoxidative components in Thymus
  vulgaris.
Source
  Planta Medica.  62(3):217-21, 1996 Jun.
Abstract
  A biphenyl compound,
  3,4,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'-diisopropyl-2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl (1), and a
  flavonoid, eriodicytol (2), were isolated as antioxidative
  components from the leaves of Thymus vulgaris by
  bioassay-directed fractionation. These compounds inhibited superoxide anion
  production in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. Mitochondrial and
  microsomal lipid peroxidation induced by Fe(III)-ADP/NADH or
  Fe(III)-ADP/NADPH were also inhibited by these compounds. Compound 1 is an
  extremely potent antioxidant; complete inhibition was observed at 1 microM
  against both microsomal and mitochondrial peroxidation. Furthermore, compound
  1 protected red cells against oxidative hemolysis. These phenolic compounds
  were shown to be effective to protect biological systems against various
  oxidative stresses.

Based on my limited experience, if you make the same move
after it has failed in the first two attempts, you deserve
to be shot.  At the same time, if you stop making the move
after it worked on the first two attempts, you *will* be shot.

I said "virtually" rather than "universally" for a reason.  I've never
seen a really convincing libertarian attack on state funded science. 
(If anyone knows of one, please let me know, as I'm open to the
possibility. It is rather remarkable how state funded science projects
do sometimes seem to be able to transcend public choice theory.)

I used to know a good federal budget site, and now I can't find it, so I
can't check this.  However, I'm quite confident that US federal funding
for science projects is considerably less than 1% of the budget.  

If the government is authorized to fund scientific research, some of
which will actually turn out to be useful, it is equally authorized to
fund pork, bizarre anti-drug campaigns, property seizures, and all of
the other strange, costly, and oppressive things that the government
does.  So I'm unconvinced that it's worth it.  I favor a government with
extremely limited powers to spend, and then primarily on defense
spending.

Why do I think most of what the government does isn't useful, and in
fact, acts counter to its stated aims?  Read "25 Years Of Reason" or
subscribe to Reason magazine (www.reasonmag.com) for a year, and you'll
see what I mean.  

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936488727/qid=931226820/sr=1-2/002-1135589-2978230

I also suggest studying Public Choice theory, the Nobel-prize winning
economic theory that explains why bureaucracies can't work effectively. 
I would do a search on www.free-market.net and choose one of the sites
listed there to get started.

Government run brothels wouldn't compete with each other any more than
government run post offices compete with each other, or government run
DMV's compete with each other.  

All federally run institutions are subject to an even greater
stranglehold of regulations than are private businesses.  In such a
politically touchy arena as prostitution, this would reach comic levels.

You mean like Bell Labs, all pharmaceutical and biotech companies,
Intel's amazing gains in processor speed every year, speech recognition,
supercomputers, etc etc etc?

Long term research pays off big.  People like to get paid.  Yes, of
course a lot of companies miss bets by not funding enough projects or
not funding the correct projects.  But an enormous amount of valuable
research does come from companies.

The stock market has recognized this, and funds biotech companies at
enormous price/earnings ratios in order to finance their long term R&D
for the hope of getting a big pay off.

Yes, but it's the nature of the marketplace that companies are
constantly being confronted with competitors.  All large institutions
have a hard time changing fast enough, but the great thing about the
market is that if they succeed, they will be rewarded and consumers will
see the results, whereas if they fail they will fade away, and consumers
won't be saddled with the results.  This process is not instantaneous
and it's not perfect, but it's the best thing that's been invented so
far.

Some big companies have done very well at adapting to the massive change
in the business environment created by the introduction of the Web.  IBM
has turned around dramatically in a very short period of time, for
example, and now a large part of its revenue comes from services,
whereas before they were focused on hardware.  Dell was one of the first
computer resalers to move on line, and has been duly rewarded.  

Small companies that come from nowhere constantly force established
companies to change.  Barnes and Noble only went online because they
were threatened by Amazon.com.  Internet telephony threatens the
telephone companies, mp3 threatens the record companies, and
drugstore.com threatens the brick and mortar drugstores.  Some of them
will adapt (look for walgreens.com or the equivalent) and some will
tank.  Either way, the consumer benefits. 

So, if there is a market for facial hair dissolving cream, if the razor
blade manufacturer doesn't do it, someone else will eventually.  

I suggest reading Virginia Postrel's "The Future and its Enemies" for
more examples of how companies innovate.

GM was only able to shut down public transit because it was a state run
enterprise.  You'll notice that they didn't have much success shutting
down Ford or Toyota.

Yes, that is why companies have an incentive to make a vaccine for me. 
Because they can't force me to buy their products, I will choose the
superior product - the vaccine.  And lucky for me, I am not an idiot. 
Neither are consumers in general.  This is why products like the Yugo
were a flop.

I'm not familiar with this example in particular, but if the government
is already in the business of manufacturing vaccines, it provides a big
disincentive for corporations to do so.

Again, I believe that libertarianism is the most utilitarian system and
does best serve the common good.  I suggest you read the materials I

I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the history of wetlands
legislation and the endangered species act.  I chose these because they
are particularly poorly designed laws, and have led to a number of
really outrageous abuses of power.  Perhaps someone else could cite an

of Reason Magazine.

There are many free market solutions to insure an optimum amount of open
space.  I suggest:

Again, I suggest you read Julian Simon.  The extinction of the land
mammals is a clear case of the tragedy of the commons, which would
easily be remedied by granting individual tribes property rights in
regard to specific herds of animals.  This method has been tried to
preserve herds of elephants in Africa, and has been an overwhelming
success.

The latter example I am not familiar with, but it sounds like it was a
government cutting those trees down in order to go to war.  Private
individuals who privately own a forest have an incentive to take care of
it so that it will continue producing wood, rather than destroying it
for short term gain.

(My information may be out of date, but there was an episode of Nova a
few years back which found the evidence that human beings actually wiped
out the large mammals to be ambiguous.  It's certainly a possibility.)

Many others are far more knowledgeable about these issues than I am. 
Many excellent resources are available.  www.free-market.net is a good
place to start.  Most people have never been exposed to the arguments
for liberty.  I can't summarize hundreds of years of thought in a few
paragraphs.  There is a lot of theoretical groundwork, and it helps to
look at raw data and many concrete examples.  It is, however, worth the
effort.  The libertarian argument is an extremely compelling one.

Studying libertarian arguments has changed not only the way I perceive
government, but the way I perceive individual people.  I respect their
right to self-determination and their good judgment now in a way that I
did not when I accepted statist paradigms.  I recommend trying it out
even if you're sure you won't be convinced.  These ideas are only
growing in influence, and if you read "25 Years of Reason" and decide
we're all crazy, at least you'll be able to wipe us out in a debate. 
Enjoy.

This is true, only in so far as you can argue that there is *no*
long term *personal* benefit, to projects, that are unjustifiable
from an industrial viewpoint, but that the government may view as
worthwhile exercises (see my recent note regarding the human genome
project).

Aha!  A bolt of interesting insight.  By all logic, women who pursue
the "struggling musician" are violating their "prime genetic directive".
Now, is there some logic to this (pheromones run amok?), the female
desire to "nurture" going off the cliff, "rebellion" against the
conventional wisdom?

STANDPOINT WOULD BE VIEWED AS "UNDESIRABLE"?

Ok, so now women are in the position of over-turning the genetic prime 
directive!  In that situation what replaces it?   Are you going after
beauty (seduced by our marketing based environment presumably), intelligence
(based on some subjective assessment), a man's ability/willingness
to "replace" the woman as a primary nurturing source (so you know
the children will be properly cared for...)???

Culture & government are different.  They appear to separate based
on the size of the community (when you no longer *know* the voters
you have a government).  I doubt (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
that in small Polynesian island communities the "government" is
viewed as separate from the culture.

I would agree with this.  If options for immigration/emmigration are
limited *and* the community is small enough, then a communal environment
would seem to develop.

Again, I would agree with this.  In most cases (in modern society),
rape is about power or control, not about sex.  I would however look
back in history, where I doubt that the mercenaries "raping" and "pillaging"
were concerned about power or control, but more likely interested in
"sowing their seed" (driven by that evil old male sex drive...).
We have a modern day example of this in Kosovo.  While in some
situations, one could argue the rapes may have occured out of
a desire for the Serbians to "control" the Albanians, you could
also argue that it was a case of the men taking advantage of an
pportunity to impregnate women where the women had little to say
about the situation.

"slamazon.com" -- brilliant (but it only works for negative reviews)!

Ah, but now you've taken the bull by the horns so-to-speak...
There is, obviously nothing to stop women from doing this already
(privately or publicly), so there is no need to "sign-up".
The only constraint might be the problem of slander/defamation
of character.

The only advantage of an "independent board" is that you could
exempt them from frivolous lawsuits and/or have some confidence
that their opinions were something more than rumor.

This is true!  So the net result is that it benefits the survival
of the "genes" that promote genetic diversity (and thus are of benefit
the survival of your offspring) but it does nothing to improve your
own personal survival.

An interesting premise, intellectural feedback into a biochemical

I would argue that the biochemical "difference" engine has been
intellectually generalized into "anything" different is potentially
good.  That might explain the preference for foreign accents.

Very true, there will be things we don't understand about genome
reduction that will not become clear until we have made a few
mistakes.  The only answer for those mistakes will be "editing"
methods and/or cryonics.

Highly possible, that is why using known "working" combinations will
have a high preference.  But there will be parents who want to push
the envelope!

I think it will be highly likely that the combinations to stay away
from will be well documented.  We have too many cases in our
society of the "square pegs" that we can survey to determine
combinations that have potentially pathological consequences.

Life balances -- as soon as it becomes apparent that B. Spears is the
face de jour (year, etc.), the balance will shift in some other
direction.  No parent is going to want their child looking like
50% of the class in the school yearbook.  You might enact "real
time" disclosure requirements for children in the pipeline so
as to allow you to adjust (against) the prevailing trends.

It could be because I encoded it at 160bps rather than the more common 128
bps. I wanted better quality. Any newer player (that implements the spec
properly) should be able to handle it.

The rates go up on July 10. All the information is on the website --
registration is $180 up until July 10, then goes up. Membership is $55, as
stated on the membership page. Hence, to renew and register, the total
would be $235 until July 10. (For full-time students: $90 + $30 = $120)

After July 10, the registration goes up to $205. (Postmarked no later than
July 10 will do.)

I trust this is all clear. I'll be happy to answer any other questions.

Extropy Institute's Extro 4 Conference:

B I O T E C H  F U T U R E S
Challenges of Life Extension and Genetic Engineering

August 7-8, 1999, UC Berkeley


Since my last update, we have added some new speakers, and made other
alterations to the program. 

I'm pleased to be able to announce that Vernor Vinge and Greg Bear will
combine their visionary talents to think about the implications of greatly
extended lives.

Dr. Kate Murashige of Morrison & Foerster, who specializes in intellectual
property law and the life sciences, will be speaking on gene patents. As
you'll see, if you check out her bio at 

http://www.mofo.com/mofocgi/getperson?7033
we could hardly hope to find anyone more qualified and talented to speak on
this topic.

John H. Campbell, Professor of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine
will speak on "HuGE Propects for Human Genetic Engineering". A few of you
may have heard Prof. Campbell speak at Greg Stock's UCLA conference last year.

The latest Program is at:

http://www.extropy.org/ex4/program.htm

Media interest in this event is already looking strong. The conference
should be an excellent means of getting a wider audience to think about
these issues. 

The final session (which Anders Sandberg has agreed to coordinate) will be
on getting our culture up to speed by learning how to communicate our ideas
more effectively. I'd like to see this session be a more interactive one,
perhaps with conference attendees signing up for a few minutes to express
their views on this.

Onward!

Male resources have never been the genetic prime directive, but one
factor among several.  In hunter gatherer tribes, women produce 2/3 of
the calories.  That makes them the providers of the resources.

As for beauty, there's some evidence that physical beauty results from
health and genetic fitness.  Studies show that when you show men around
the world pictures of women, they will always declare the same ones to
be beautiful, with very minor variations.  So it's culturally
independent.

Beautiful people tend to have unusually symmetrical faces. It's
theorized that this symmetry is indicative of healthy fetal
development.  Some studies have shown that beautiful people are on
average a bit more intelligent and less prone to colds, although another
study did not confirm this.

Intelligence is definitely a factor in mate selection among both men and
women.  The IQ's of husbands and wives are more likely to be in the same
range than any other factor, including their pre-marital class
backgrounds.

One study showed that a common sense of humor was a good predictor for
whether a relationship would last. 

In animals, the alpha males are more attractive to the females.  I don't
know if that's been scientifically demonstrated to be true in humans,
but it's apparently quite common for women to throw themselves at
powerful men.

Another major factor is that women tend to fall for men who give the
appearance of being in love with them.  This is what romance is all
about - if a man brings a woman wildflowers he picked in a meadow, it's
at least as attractive to her as if he'd spent $100 and brought long
stemmed roses.  Women like to feel that a man is going to stick around.

> WHY ON EARTH DO WOMEN PURSUE MEN, WHO FROM A {HIGHLY} CONVENTIONAL
> STANDPOINT WOULD BE VIEWED AS "UNDESIRABLE"?

For one thing, sexual attraction is much rarer for a woman that for a
man.  Suppose a woman is highly selective, and only finds 1 in 1,000 men
sexually attractive.  When she finds that one guy, how much is she going
to worry about his wallet?  This is her one chance to have any fun. 
"Being a good provider" doesn't actually turn women on; it's a strictly
cognitive assessment.  

While I think it's true that human beings are full of complicated
instincts that we're just starting to understand scientifically, most of
what we do on a day to day basis is decided in the cerebral cortex, not
deep within our animal brains.  And our choices about relationships have
a lot to do with our whole personalities, not just pheromones or facial
symmetry.  

I have a friend who has a thing for really talented computer
programmers.  (Not rich programmers, good programmers.  She likes to
watch them work out problems in their head.)  Another friend thinks
meditating a lot is sexy.  These can't possibly be instincts.

Men and women fall in love for reasons they can't explain.   Women
choose different men at 30 then they do at 15.  The love algorithm
adapts over time.  Women who go out with men who are mean to them in
their 20's will often find someone who is kind to them in their 30's.

There are a lot of inputs in the love algorithm - sure, pheromones and
resources and immunities and facial symmetry and alpha-ness - but
there's also common interests, shared sense of humor, and knowing that
you can learn from your partner.  When there's a joke I share with
someone that no one else in the world would understand, or when someone
surprises me completely with a new interest or an amazing revelation,
those things draw me closer to that person.

You can only get so far understanding women by studying biology.  I

Sure.  I have no objection to voluntary cultures setting up their own
internal government; for many types of voluntary organizations, it's
essential for the organization to function.

Yeah, my evidence would be that song, "Long Haired Guys From England." 
Not too compelling.  

(A rather silly American song that was on the radio a few years ago
about how all the girls wanted to be with 'Long Haired Guys From
England'.)

So we redefine the desirable targets. For the past forty years, the
developed world hasn't been obsessed with what people need (food, shelter,
antibiotics, transport) but with what they want (holidays in Thailand,
cheap restaurant meals, home computers).

One problem I can see, though, is that some of the possible options for
a consumer society just don't work. Mass media, for example -- I'm pretty
sure we're in the early stages of a massive upheaval in our entire idea
of what constitutes intellectual property and how intellectual property
rights should be enforced. (Data points: the free software movement,
MP3's, do-it-yourself web portals like Slashdot.) If you linearly
extrapolate the media of 1990 into the future, you have a million channels
of TV, lots of jobs in music video production, tabloid newspapers, and
Microsoft. By 2000, however, the future of the media will be radically --
and obviously -- different. Even its money making potential will have
changed (and with it the degree to which it can be viewed as an economic
engine of production).

Times change, and the metrics you can use to analyse the standard of
living change too. Here in the UK, per-capita coal consumption
is probably as low as it has been since 1790 -- but that doesn't mean
we're as poor as we were in the eighteenth century. (It just means
that coal, a substance the wealth of the nation was based on, has
become irrelevant.) It's quite possible that in a few decades the west's
raw materials and energy consumption will resemble that of the third
world in the 1960's ... except that those figures will be deceptive,
concealing smart materials and high-efficiency propulsion technology
that let us do an order of magnitude more with an order of magnitude
less.

And who knows? Maybe defining our identities in terms of what we consume
will itself go out of fashion eventually, once the lesson that we can
afford more than we can physically consume sinks in.

Good point; real dinosaur fossils are rather incomprehensible and hard
to notice for the untrained viewer. However, we don't need to invoke
fossils, "racial memories" (rather, old phobias) or exaggerations of
snake - people can very well have seen or experienced crocodiles, and
then the stories grew.

Actually, people with Kluver-Bucy syndrome demonstrate that reasoning
is not enough to keep you from doing something stupid. They are
fearless, and while they do not jump off buildings (likely because of
all the training they got before their amygdalae atrophied) they quite
often act in "stupid" ways while retaining full cognitive function
just because they have a hard time judging bad actions from good -
they may realize that something is counterproductive, but why select
productive actions over counterproductive? To them they are roughly
the same (when it comes to fear at least; similar stuff for people
with some frontal lobe damage)

Yet the only study I've seen which looked at the relative rates at which
different groups of people reported UFOs which were later explained as
perfectly ordinary phenomena, airline pilots were among the *worst* 
categories; they regularly reported UFOs which were later identified. This
is probably not too suprising, as they're trained to see other aircraft in
the sky and avoid them, and hence more likely than most to think that any
unidentified light is actually a physical vehicle of some kind.

Don't have a cite handy for the study, I'm afraid.

Such as? I was watching part of a TV show at the weekend, which amongst
other things showed an 'amazing' video of a brilliantly lit UFO hovering
over a town, then suddenly disappearing. Only problem was, the video
was clearly just a lamp reflected in a window, and you could even see the
bulb when the hoaxer switched it off to create the 'disappearance'. Yet
the TV show couldn't find any known phemomenon to explain this incredible
video... which only goes to show that the media are even worse than airline
pilots at mis-identifying alien spaceships.

>Speculating and questioning their motives when we do not even know if the

There is no single UFO phenomenon. There are numerous unidentified lights 
in the sky which fruitcakes instantly interpret as alien spaceships even 
in cases such as the above when they're clearly hoaxed. Many of those
unidentified lights have their own motives, such as the U-2 spy flights 
which have been shown to explain a number of previously unidentified 
objects since records were declassified. But the idea of claiming that
there's one single phenomenon here or that if there's any intelligence
behind it it has one single motive is just silly.

>People here are used to think in novel ways about

So why do you consider us strange for writing off reports of alien spaceships
and abductions by alien cattle-mutilating sex fiends who come all the way 
to Earth to remove cows' assholes and stick probes up people's butts? BTW,
there has been at least one scientific study of abduction claimants, which
found that most of them were plain old loons. Again, I don't have a cite, 
but search the Web and you'll probably find it.

>So you do agree that the UFO phenomena, since neither you nor I can say for
>sure what it is, needs to be studied so we can understand it?

We've been studying it for fifty years; there are clearly some reports of
lights in the sky which haven't yet been identified. There's no evidence
that any of them are alien spaceships. Why bother spending vast amounts of
time investigating those remaining reports when there are far more important
things to do?

Look, just think for five seconds about the implications of the kinds of
technologies we talk about here. Any aliens who didn't want to be seen would
not be seen. If they don't want to be seen because that would destroy our
'uniqueness', then why are so many people reporting that they've seen them?

You need the holidays in Thailand to recover from our fast information
driven society.  Since the information flow is only going to go up
(along with the pressure to process it), there would seem to be
an increasing requirement for information processing "agents"
and bandwidth "augmentation" strategies (As I recall, Alexander and Anders
commented on these at the Extro3 conference which seems like it
occured in the "slow time" era, even though it was only 2 years ago.

This seems to be true, the steel manfacturers haven't built a big blast
furnace to turn iron ore into steel in many years because they can produce
enough with the existing furnaces and by recycling the old steel.
As my individual steel use decreases (because there is less of it
in each car), the reuse of past production combined with a low level
of new production are able to provide the raw materials for growing
third world economies.  So my decreased use of steel ends up allowing
the biggest buildings to be built in S.E. Asia.

As with steel, we will eventually build up the per capita pool of
refined aluminum so raw production capacity does not need to increase.
This may even be true now.  Eventually we will get to the carbon
(diamond/fullerene age) and I'll be able to grow my own raw materials.

Most people are unaware that the cost of solar power is coming
down and is starting to be cost effective for many people.  If
the government wasn't de-monopolizing the power distribution industry
(allowing the cheapest producers to sell to you), then this trend
would be clearer.  Even with the competition, personal solar power
will become an affordable reality probably sometime between 2010-2020.
That will gut the power-production industry.

If the biotech and/or nanotech industries get organized enough, it
seems feasible to develop personal solar powered food "synthesizers"
[convert sunlight --> glucose] (perhaps by 2015). That would allow
us to get our net power conversion efficiency (from the sun to our brain),
up from something like < 1% to perhaps 10-20%.   This will take a big chunk
out of the agricultural industry.  [Because the surface are of most homes
collects enough power to run your body -- solar power is several hundred
watts per meter^2 (after all the losses) while humans are only ~100 watt
machines.] If the anti-gene-engineered crop outcry is loud now, wait until
people figure out that you really don't need the crops at all!

I am aware of the economics of substitutions and the declining costs
of most raw materials.  However as Simon points out it really all
comes back to "energy", and like it or not there is a finite amount
of energy available!

There are *hard limits* to growth.

- There is a finite amount of phosphorous on the planet and that limits
  the number of people you can build.
- There is a finite amount of silicon on the planet and that limits the 
  number of computers you can build.
- There is a finite amount of solar insolation and that limits the
  amount of energy you have (for the people or the computers).
- Robert Freitas has a calculation in Nanomedince that seems to
  indicate that we will be heat-production contrained to the
  personal use of something like 10 kg of operating nanobots
  (unless we turn the planet into a giant radiator).  Now while
  you may argue that 10 kg of operating nanobots is enough for
  you, you may be assuming that your capacities for consumption
  will remain unchanged or your desires will not increase in the
  nanotech age.

Yes, we can go off the planet.  Dyson did the calculations nearly
40 years ago and I've repeated them for my Matrioska Brain studies.
If you don't assume Nanotech (Dyson didn't) you hit the limits in
3000 years.  If you do assume Nanotech (I did) you hit the limits
in a few weeks.  Robert Freitas has done some calculations that
show that if stellar disassembly is feasible, we could burn up
all of the hydrogen in the stars of a galaxy in a few million years.

The stuff that the "Club of Rome" wrote about and the stuff that
Julian Simon writes about revolve around economic limits and
they always leave out technology improvements, discoveries,
increased productivity, etc.  The stuff I'm talking about
involves what happens when we really hit the limits.

If humans decide to remain humans, don't upload, etc. then
you have a few thousand rosy years before you get to crunch
time (unless you squash biotech, you will probably be around
to see it).  If humans do develop nanotech, do upload, etc. then
you will start feeling really constrained in a few dozen years.

Like it or not -- personal longevity forces you to confront
the issue of personal reproduction.  It forces you to select
between 2 of the most fundamental drives built into living
beings (the preservation of self and the making of copies).
Now, maybe you can say, since I'm here first, I get to
reproduce and when crunch time arrives, those people don't.
So, you've reserved for yourself a "right" that your
children (or great great ... grandchildren) (or your
clones or backup-copies) cannot have (at least not
without killing you :-))!

I ran across something interesting at Kim's Video on St. Mark's Place, NYC
this weekend.  In the Experimental/Noise section there was a section for the
"Meme Label".  In this section were a great many blank, white cd cases.
Nothing on them whatsoever, not even copyright information.  Very curious.
Furthermore, stuck to the outer cellophane wrappings was a little sticker,
scrawled in barely legible script, the name of the artist.  Nothing more.
Most of them were Japanese, it seemed.  Kind of brought me back to the days
following the "Intelligentsia" just to see what they were up to.  

Anyway, I wasn't brave enough to plop down the 15 for a blank "noise" cd -
which really isn't my style anyway... But for just under 40 I walked out
with cd's by Stereolab, Tortoise, and a Russian import of The Legendary Pink
Dots.  Not a bad day's haul.

Where do I find current examples of transhuman/extropian music. I saw Max M
mentioned... Web site? Any other good examples? I'm especially interested in
stuff I can download.

I'll be adding my own contribution to this area soon... watch this space.
I'm interested to see what others have done.

Which reminds me of a cd that I picked up a few days ago as well.  NYC is a
wonderful place to find new music.  "Panthalassa: The Remixes" is a
collection of Miles Davis' work that's been remixed by artists like DJ Cam
and Bill Laswell.  Worth a listen - if you can find it,  I'd suggest getting
the vinyl and the extra track from DJ Krush.

The Timeline to 2020 project web site is now up and ready for input at:

      http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm

The site consists of pages for each of eight broad "development areas", which 
lead to separate pages for specific developments over the next two decades.  

Although in working on this project we've come up with a very slick design 
for a database application for collecting comments, there is insufficient 
time between now and EXTRO4 (August 7-8) to develop and implement such an 
application.  We're hopeful that we'll be able to develop such an application 
for use after EXTRO4.  

For now, all commentary should be through Foresight's Crit Link system.  
Links in the Timeline web pages will lead you to Crit's view of the site and 
give you access to the Crit tools for inserting your comments, ideas and 
projections into the project.  General comments on the specific developments 
can be tagged essentially anywhere in the text of the page or to the page as 
a whole.  

Our goal of collecting specific projections for dates or ranges of dates when 
a development will become possible, available, common or ubiquitous requires 
a little care using Crit Link.  To tag a comment to a particular year in the 
timeline tables you will find at the individual development pages, it is 
necessary to paste in the particular year in the "target phrase" area and THE 
TEXT FROM THE WHOLE LINE OF YEARS into the "optional context phrase".  Thus, 
to tag a comment that you believe the development "Software Agents as 
Autonomous Actors" will be "Common" by the year 2020, you should paste the 
text from the year cell for that point ("2020 - C") into the "target phrase" 
Crit field and the text from the whole line for the year 2020 ("2020 - P 2020 
- A 2020 - C 2020 - U") into the "optional target phrase".  Although this 
seems a little kludgey, Crit requires the second step in order to have enough 
context to "know" where to place its meta-tag.  Because Crit will open a new 
window for the commenting process, it's easy to flip back and forth between 
the project site and the Crit commentary page to grab the text you need to 
properly tag your comment.

We are also looking for feedback on improving the categories.  An example is 
battery technology.  None of us in the group that developed the site knew 
enough to come up with a good metric for developments in this area, so we 
only have an item called "Advanced Batteries".  If you can offer a refinement 
of an existing category such as this one, or a wholly new category that we've 
missed, use the links available at the site to make these kinds of helpful 
suggestions.

We're looking forward to using this site to collect good thinking about the 
near future and hope you'll come by the site and spend some time 
collaborating on making sound projections.  We want to try to get as much 
commentary as possible within the next two weeks so we can have time to 
collate it for presentation at EXTRO4.

I can't speak for anyone else, but the problem I have with this kind of

and inefficient investments.

No, the alternative is to get the government out of the market and let people
make up their own minds as to value.

And why should "adequate" dissemination be important? Why should people who
are trying to work out whether to invest in a particular company be prevented
from discussing the true nature of the company until information is 
"adequately" disseminated? If someone was thinking of investing in a company
that another person worked for, and if that company was going down but the
company hadn't yet admitted this fact, why should the employee not be able
to warn the potential investor? Why should the investor lose all their money
just because the government wanted to be sure the information about the
company's impending collapse was "adequately" disseminated before employees
were able to talk about it? Why shouldn't active, involved investors be able
to get accurate information about the companies they invest in? Preventing
this flow of information merely turns the market into a lottery.

>Any top-down set of controls ultimately fails.

Uh, so why are you supporting insider trading laws?

Since "alien" civilizations are likely to be very old and very
technologically advanced, there are likely to have evolved into
the few "optimal" configurations that physics may allow.  However
it may not be possible to prove that those are the only optimal
configurations (thinking along the lines of Godel and incomplete
mathematical systems).  So to continue the evolution of the galaxy
one has to allow young civilizations to evolve and grow up along their
own paths, intervening as little as possible (The Prime Directive).
That allows a unique/diverse civilization to emerge and mature with the
possibility of discovering a new "optimal configuration".

Greg Burch has come up with the rather unique idea, that in an
"old" galaxy, there is a shortage of new memes, and we (collectively)
are about to become a "virgin bride" for an lecherous old civilization.

Michael Papagiannis (a BU astronomer) suggested in the mid-1980's that
they might be here and are simply observing us from the asteroid belt.
Even earlier, Robert Freitas had conducted several searches for alien
observation satellites in logical places (L5 points, etc.) and had come
up empty handed.  He also wrote several articles about our gross inability
to detect many alien technologies.

The problem has become worse since our understanding of nanotech has
increased.  Robert has calculated that nano-aliens could rapidly construct
a 1-meter^2 fiber-optic communications grid covering the face of the planet
that harvests substantially *all* of our information flow, transmits it
to a secret data store which beams it up to the mother ship every night.
I've done some calculations that seem to indicate that the waste heat
flowing from your body through your chair could power about a giga-op
nanocomputer.  It records everything you say or do, then hops off your
chair at night, plugs itself into the net and transmits that information
to the "Master Overlord".  In fact, the Master Overlord has recently
decided that you represent a threat to the "increased diversity" plan and
instructed your house-watch-bot to replace you with a directly controlled
nano-clone at the earliest opportunity....

There is a distinct possiblity that the increased belief in "little
green men", abduction stories, etc. are nothing more than disinformation
seeded into our culture to keep us from doing the serious and careful
investigations required to discover the nano-aliens.

My major concern is that everyone at the Extro4 conference is going
to be nano-clone so I might as well not even bother going.

Robert

Yes, and when you increase your visibility (for example by creating
a specialized >H media website, which looks so professional and
innovative that it gets featured in magazines, web-watch shows etc.),
interested parties will find you sooner, and in greater numbers.

Well, there's no shortage of talent, but for some reason we can't seem
to effectively harness its power. Also, it would be interesting to 
determine what exactly we'd like to achieve with academic credibility
(one of the WTA's goals, if I remember correctly) and/or popular support.

True. Actually I was (mostly) thinking of quality pictures for webpage
enhancement. Apps should indeed be used with restraint, for the
time being anyway.

Actually your pages already look quite well; especially the small
subject-related gifs at the top of sub-pages are a nice touch, as
is the helix at the transhuman (index) page. Perhaps it would be
an idea to add some more transhuman art and generally futuristic
pictures to some introductory >H texts -- that's where they are
most useful, IMO, bringing (new) visitors in the right mood, helping
people to visualize and thus better understand transhuman concepts
, from nanotech to Jupiter Brains. I'll give it some more thought,
though.

Afaik, one of the best providers of free home pages is http://homepages.go.com/  No
pop-ups or large navigation 
bars, just a single line of text and a small gif at the bottom of 
your page.

Runner up could be http://www.fortunecity.com No pop-up, but
they do add a rather big nav. bar with (sometimes) an animated 
ad to your page. Also, their recently new and (sigh) "improved"
homepage editor sometimes converts your pages to plain text 
for some strange reason, so be sure to have a backup if you
want to use it.

They are a good thing for those transhumanist organizations or
individuals who seek to proliferate the philosophy.

I bet that even in the most developed, media-saturated
regions at least 7 out of 10 randomly picked people couldn't 
tell you what cryonics is, and the rest would probably bring 
out all the old cliches (including, but by no means limited to, 
frozen Disneys and overpopulation). A lot more media attention 
will be needed to (at the very least) make everyone fully aware 
of the option.

True, and that's why one should select the bells & whistles carefully, 
and use them with due restraint. Also there's the option of making 
two versions, one fancy and one in plain text (the LEF used to do
this, for example).

I'm not in favor of "graphics only", and besides, just about any site will 
get indexed if you tag it right.

Oh, no-one is questioning their skills. Now, good taste is a different
matter, of course... ;) Seriously though, if you're not "selling" anything
(like a philosophy or way of life), it doesn't really matter how your
page looks. If you *are* selling something on the other hand, you'll
need to do better than those guys.
 
Btw, you don't necessarily need advanced apps to be stylish; this
year's TransVision site (http://maxm.normik.dk/tv99/index.htm)
is a good example of a fairly "professional-looking" setup. Simply 
adding some classy, appropriate pictures can make a lot of 
difference. A very constructive way to use transhuman art, IMO.

Also, since they spend a lot of time in the air, they have greater
opportunity to observe things they cannot identify, i.e UFOs'. The
suggestion that pilots are worse at observing airial objects than the
average person sounds a bit odd to me. It may be a case of bad or 'tweaked'
statistics. A pity you don't have any more info on the study, it would be
interesting to see it.

This is where it gets tricky. Since I am an agnostic regarding the UFO
phenomena, being neither a beliver in the sense that I have formed any
definite, final theories about anything, or a disbeliver, in the sense that
I have come to the conclusion that it can all be explained by "natural
phenomena", even though I entertain theories for my own amusement, I cannot
determine or conclude what is true in a report such as the spate of belgian
reports in 1990-'91 where the apparently solid crafts seen by over 50
witnesess was also simultanously recorded on radar and was intercepted by
F-16 jets. Nor can I determine the truth in the spate of UFO reports in my
hometown (Malm, Sweden) where six people, one of them a friend of mine,
saw a shiny (reflective) disc-shaped thing fly over the city. That object
was filmed for three and a half minute by a man with a digital camera. The
footage was analysed by the swedish airforce and was judged not to have
been forged or falsified, but showed an apparently solid object approx. 6
meteres in lenght flying over several houses. 
There are hundreds of such reports, from all over the world.
Naturally I cannot vouch for the authenticity of a single one of them, but
must rely on the testimonies of others. The thing is, it then follows that
there is not one such report that cannot be rebutted by the claim that the
witnesses are lying, or insane, or in extreme cases, both. The witnesses
claim to be telling the truth and to be mentally stable, and their
testimonies may be strengthened by photographies ect, but there's always
someone, usually a 'debunker', who'll claim that the witnesses were lying
and then produce 'evidence' that they are unreliable or mistaken. 
The problem is simply whom to belive, the witnesses or the debunker?
It seems to me that when the 'debunkers' tale is what I judge to be more
probable and fits the reported facts better than the witnesses', then the
debunker is probably right.
When it's the reverse, then the witnesses' is probably right.

I haven't seen the show in question so I cannot comment on that part.  
However, I am keeping in mind that people tend to see what they expect to
see, a fact which works both ways, for sceptic and beliver alike. People
often identify things as 'clearly just' this and that because they are
acting from their own preconditioned expectations. If they see a light in
the sky and expect it to be an alien space craft, it will appear to be an
alien spacecraft to them. If they expect it to be anything but an alien
spacecraft it will be anything but an alien spacecraft.   
I completly agree with you though, that some (not all) media treatment of
the UFO phenomenon is abysmally lousy, in the sense you mean.  

>Yet the TV show couldn't find any known phemomenon to explain this incredible

No, it doesn't. Let's not generalize too broadly here. One study and one
show does not a scientific law make. (On the other hand, I am generally
very distrustful of the media in general. I prefer to focus on the works of
dedicated professionals who study these things, whatever their conclusions
may be.) 

>>Speculating and questioning their motives when we do not even know if the

>>it doesn't do this or that, but what it is.

>There is no single UFO phenomenon. 

I thought that UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) was a blanket term for all
airborne things that cannot be positivly identified. When I wrote the above
sentence I was referring to the fact that the previous poster wrote; 

>>What is especially strange is how aliens (or whatever it may be -- 

>>future versions of us trying to communicate back that nanotech works) only 
>>seem to make their appearances in ways that are ambiguous at best or can be 
>>explained away at worst.

I was referring to the fact that he inferred that the UFO's could not be
intelligent or have an intelligent purpose behind their appearances, since
they appear in ways that do not lend themselves to a clear explanation.
That is bad logic.   
I was also trying to point out something which most people who use this
kind of 'argument' in a discussion usually seems strangly reluctant to do,
namely, to skip the retorics regarding the possible origin of the phenomen
and try to find out what's really going on, (by concentration on the facts
at hand), be it aliens or mass hysteria or swamp gas or electromagnetically
induced hallucinations. I think the reason for this is that most people who
takes an extremely agressive and hostile stance to any unorthodox
suggestions feels threatened, in exactly the same manner as a 'true
beliver' in the extraterrestial hypothetis feels threatened by 'debunkers'.
    

>There are numerous unidentified lights in the sky which fruitcakes
instantly interpret >as alien spaceships even in cases such as the above
when they're clearly hoaxed. 

Just as you seem to instantly identify them as not being alien spaceships. 
Or at least that's what I infer from you calling people who belive that the
UFO phenomena are alien vessels "fruitcakes". Sure, there are people who
devoutly takes any thing in the skies as a sign that the arrival of the
space-brothers are imminent, 
but there's not much difference between them and you average religious
fundamentalist, or true political beliver, but I find your implication that
all belivers in the ET hypothetis are cranks distasteful.

But I have not claimed that there is a single phenomenon or that there is
intelligent forces at work behind it all. I merely speculated that this may
be the case. In fact, I made it so abundantly clear (I thought) that I was
merely speculating that I was rebuked by another poster for speculating too
much!

Where do you get the idea that I consider you all strange? I wouldn't be on
this list unless I was in agreement with at least some of the
extropian/transhuman ideas.
As a matter of fact, I agree with almost all of them.  

Also, I think you are jumping to conclusions here. 
I don't belive in the "alien theory" any more than than I belive in any
other theory that's supposed to 'explain' the UFO mystery. 
What I'm trying to do is to encourage research and speculation regarding
the phenomena called UFO's. I do not propagate for any particulary theory,
except that it seems to me that the phenomenon itself warrants further
study.  

>BTW, there has been at least one scientific study of abduction claimants,

Search on what? 
Using "plain old loons + UFOs" as searchwords probably won't give much. :)

Do you have any more info that might help me locate this second
unsubstantiated study?

>We've been studying it for fifty years; there are clearly some reports of

Actually, there seems to be quite a lot of such reports, probably ranging
into the thousands worldwide. And then there's the other reports, of people
claiming to see what appeared to be physical crafts in broad daylight. And
the close encounters. And the photographic and otherwise electronically
recorded 'evidence', and things such as marks in the landscape, marks on
people, ect. 
SOMETHING is going on, but what? That what I want to know. 

>There's no evidence that any of them are alien spaceships. 

And I haven't, and still don't claim they are. As for the evidence, well,
that's really a whole 'nother discussion... There's implications to the
effect, sure, but not evidence that convinces me 100%.

>Why bother spending vast amounts of time investigating those remaining

I wasn't aware that you were in a position to determine what is important
to other people.

As I said, speculations regarding 'motives' and apparent behavior aside,
the phenomena itself remains. That's what I'm focusing on.

I think we're saying the same thing. Ultimately the way to reduce the undesirable aspects of "negative" emotions -- at least in the arts in which I've been trained -- is to look hard at them, discern what they "want" and give it to them. It's rare the impulse to envy, for instance, starts and stops with me getting that thing from that guy. More often it's a symbolic representation of a desire for recognition or respect or even just a feeling of "being okay." The more intricate manifestations of these primal drives come as a result of our socialization. If we can give ourselves the inner peace and the love we crave, most of the meta-emotions I described will become irrelevant.

I absolutely want to retain my fear. What I *don't* want, is to be afraid of being afraid. Or, for that matter, guilty about being afraid.

In this way, I repress nothing; I become fully expressive. 

(NB I don't use the first person singular to imply I'm there yet. I ain't. I use it because I'm the only person whose mind I can presume to know.)

So what's the punishment now... fine, jail, or having your website 
automatically blocked from 3Com's AirConnect 2000 Firewall auto-
filtering service?

Hopefully their PPA's won't put you on a block list.  Wierd how this 
degenerates into the free censorship market discussion.

In terms of law enforcement/free speech protection, assuming the 
government to be a corrupt, leaky bureacracy, what's the best way to 
decentralize authority in an expeditious yet libertarian way?

Dear Natasha (and everyone else):

I've been away for a while, and am now trying to play a little catch-up.  
Your point(s), Natasha, is(are) well-taken.  I'm curious, though, as to 
precisely what, in your judgment, female proto-transhumanist memes consist 
of, as distinguished from male-originated memes.

As for female "Ancestral [proto-]Extropians," well there's Ursula K. LeGuin, 
perhaps Marilyn Ferguson, arguably Barbara Marx Hubbard, the more-or-less 
libertarian feminist Valentyne LeClaire...that's about all I can think of 
right off the top, but it's a start!!

Well, sure!  Definitely Hanah Arendt---and Suzane K. Langer, for that matter 
(Check out her *Philosophy in a New Key,*  *Feeling & Form,* and her magnum 
opus, *Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling.*).  Langer primary influences (and 
mentors) were, if I'm not mistaken, Ernest Cassier and Alfred N. Whitehead; 
she took many of their ideas and put her own unique, and occasionally even 
more profound, "spin" on them.

Maybe, but I can think of reasons why that might not happen.  Assuming
even that solar cells became so cheap that they were effectively free, we
would still have the expense of packaging and installing them.  That's
not trivial, as they have to be positioned to effectively catch the
sunlight while at the same time being sufficiently protected from the
weather and other hazards.  Perhaps the cheapest way to install them is
to apply them flush to the surface of an existing pitched roof, but most
existing roofs are not ideally angled and oriented for that.  Arranging
for the angle to be adjustable, either occasionally with seasonal changes
or adaptively during the day would be an additional expense.  But perhaps
'solar shingles' will be developed which would allow a solar installation
as part of original roof construction or re-roofing.


Then there is the problem of storing energy.  Not all days are sunny, and
even on sunny days the cells will produce useful output for only a few
hours.  The hardware to store, manage, and voltage-regulate the energy
would be quite expensive, at least with today's technology.  Maintenance
of the hardware is an additional cost.  My electric bill is about $40 per
month, so it would be necessary for a system with a 10 year life span to
cost less than about $5,000 installed for it to be even a marginally
attractive investment.

J-Brains are an obsolete concept at this point.  To start with
they were a non-optimal form.  Something the size of Jupiter
cannot use all of the power available from a star (without
melting) and if it were even relatively "solid" as Jupiter
is, you would waste most of your energy pumping around the
cooling fluid for your computers.  [Friction losses mount
up when you circulate fluid through something the size of
Jupiter.]

Following in the tradition of "you need a cool name to
popularize an idea", e.g. "Black Holes", I have christened
an optimal computing architecture in the post-singularity
age - a "Matrioshka Brain" (M-brain).  [Matrioshka's are
the carved wooden nesting Russian dolls.]  This will be
a "legitimate" scientific concept (if there is such a thing)
as it will be discussed at the Bioastronomy '99 conference
in Hawaii occuring just before the Extro4 conference.

This is (so far as I can tell at this point) an optimal
computing (i.e. "intelligence") architecture.  A M-brain
has several interesting properties
 - different layers are constructed out of different "computronium"
   materials that have an optimal computational throughput for
   temperatures based on their distance from the power source.
   This makes "optimal" use of the elemental abundances within
   a solar system.
 - each layer of a M-brain lives off of the waste heat of the next
   innermost (warmer) layer.  This allows a more complete utilization
   of the power generated by a star.  Instead of the ~30% utilization
   you might get from a single-layer Dyson shell of "computronium",
   you may be able to fully utilize 80-90% of the solar energy.
 - An M-brain has between 1,000 and 10,000 *trillion* (> 10^3 * 10^12)
   times the thought capacity of the *entire* human population!

M-brains have the property, that they do most of their communication
"inward" (across shorter delay paths) while radiating waste heat
"outward" (to supply power for slower layers).  There may be
an alternate architecture involving nested layers of little J-brains
which are themselves structured like M-brains, but this architecture
has the problem that the waste heat of a single node heats up
all of the surrounding nodes (to both the interior and exterior).
There comes a point when the computational advantage you gain
(due to decreased communication path delays in J-brain type
nodes) is offset in the decline in computational capacity that
results from the increased use of materials to "shield" or reflect
incoming heat from nearby J-Brains and the power consumed by increased
cooling requirements.

Paul Vitanyi, I believe, has shown, that even if you have
"hyper-dimensional" (but not faster-than-light) communication
paths, you cannot escape the communication-delay problem
in computation.  So ultimately the optimal architecture
will come down to the size of the problem you are trying
to solve.  While a J-Brain architecture may for a limited
set of problems provide the quickest solution, and works
great if you only have a few of them in a solar system,
an M-Brain architecture (with the greatest computational and
communication capacity) seems to be the optimal solution for
the largest problems and/or supporting the largest thought
machines.

It would be more useful (IMHO), to differentiate between
"created" memes and "inherited" memes.  Inherited memes
(male or female) are the result of a natural selection
"agenda" which we have never (historically) influenced.

A more fundamental question becomes whether males *and*
females can divorce themselves from their non-chosen
genetic programs and write their own script or whether
we will remain shadows or offspring of those unconsciously
derived agendas?

A few years ago, I seem to recall an article about a
scientist discovering a branch of fungi which had
a dozen or more "sexes".

Why do we have to confine ourselves to perspectives
"tainted" by the genetic tree we happen to currently
be in?

Thanks Robert, I agree with you.  

My initial comment was based on the fact that I grow not only tired, but
weary of historical accounts focusing on any one type of thinking and/or
contribution to cultural advances.  I think it is important to recognize
that ideas within the culture stem from many sources.  Some of these
sources are more subtle than others, yet just as poignant.  Ignoring this
is not a fair and complete account of our branching tree, nor its roots.  

I'm more interested in the quality and "rounded" (no pun intended)
influence of meme breeders.  By rounded I am referring to the scope of the
breeder and all the areas of thought and ideas that affect our lives.  I do
not have a strong background in science fiction, yet I have been involved
in transhumanism, and speaking and writing on transhumanist ideas
publically, since the early 1980s.  How did I get the memes?  I got them
from individual works that gave me a broad reference point, rather than a
narrow one.  Works in the arts, astronomy, psychology, sociology, health,
athletics, the domain of mothering, nurturing, loving, sexuality, zoology,
journalism, etc.

Also, someone recently proposed (was it Mr Clarke?) that cold fusion would
become a household phenomenon, and kill the power production industry in the
next couple of decades.

Should I be sending an urgent e-mail to my CEO (I work for a network
utility)? Quick! Get into pizza delivery, or something, fast!

It's just come to mind that I remember mention of an idea some time ago, to
extend the national electricity grids into a huge world-wide power grid,
which might sort out fluctuations in supply around the world, make solar
power more feasible (the sun's shining somewhere), and create a global
electricity market where the countries best placed to produce power would be
able to do it. I think it was also supposed to create a magical fairyland
where cats and dogs lived together in peace.

Anyone know anything about this? Come to think of it, if anyone does want to
know more, and no-one can do any better, I can probably scratch up an
electrical engineer or six from this end and get the low down.

Two observations:

1) A lot of the UFO "sightings" bear a remarkable similarity to holographic 
projections.  What kind of real, solid spaceship, no matter (a pun, I 
suppose) how advanced, can change velocity virtually instantaneously without 
at least a massive shock wave - sonic boom, etc.?  Why would they fly that 
way?  On the other hand, suppose you spotted a primitive intelligence at 
radio stage and decided to spend a little cash letting them know you were 
there.  Perhaps the saucers, etc., are in fact very long range holographic 
projections.  I can very easilly fool a naive observer that I have an FTL 
just by swinging a beam across a wide enough arc.

2) The abductions, however, can more easilly be explained another way 
entirely.  You are familiar with roofies - rohypnol, and the other 
"date-rape" drugs.  The CIA did several decades worth of research on mind 
control using selective memory erasing drugs, starting immediately after 
WWII and possibly (very likely) still continuing.  In some S. American 
countries, kidnappers routinely use native scopalomine to kidnap the wealthy 
and steal them blind.  I suggest that to whatever extent these are not mere 
fantasies or publicity stunts, they are probably along the same lines.  The 
Orange County Register once reported that 40,000 people in Orange County 
alone claimed to have been abducted by aliens.  That seems outrageously 
high, but even 1% of that would make one wonder if some of them were not 
telling a true story of what they thought they remembered, given that the 
technology does exist to achieve that result.

Or any other trends if you think of a 1000 years.

Humans will be already unrecognizable in 100 years,
and clothes will change even before that into nanotech
skin enhancements that would change color and texture
base on the last millisecond's fashion, absorb sun's
energy to feed internal implants, and a lot of even
more fun stuff.

We could probably chart the road map for the next 20 to 50
years that would be somewhat meaningful, but not far
beyond that.

That's an idea...  On-line desecration!  How about drawing a picture
of a bureaucrat carving this law with a big knife into the American
Flag, thus reducing it to shreds?  That would convey the opinion that
this law is desecrating the spirit of freedom, while formally being
a violation in itself.

Anybody with artistic talents out there?

A great question.   There is also a dual issue - how to set up new
social structures in a way immune from bureaucratic influence.

One method may be lawsuits.  Pick an utterly ridiculous law, break it,
and have people bring charges.    

Another - show the bureaucracy/church/business that they are losing
money/influence/credibility with _some_ of the laws.
- That was the beginning of Gorbachev's perestroika campaign - but
it appeared that small reforms for the sake of greater efficiency
discredited and destroyed the whole structure.

I am sure there are other ways, campaigns, slogans, enabling technologies,
ideas, etc.   ACLU seems to be a good forum for that.  Maybe somebody can
create a brainstorming bulletin board there, with a call for donations?

The pilot study cited indeed sounds interesting, since it's at odds with the 
most famous, and, to my knowledge, most thorough, UFO study, carried out by 
the Air Force in the "early days" of the phenomenon.  The AF found (to its 
dismay) that the better the sighting, _the more likely the object in question 
was to be a genuine UFO_.  

Of course, "UFO" means exactly that--_unidentified_ flying object.  It 
appears to me that some of the posts re this suffer from the gross semantic 
leap that UFO=alien spacecraft.

Re holograms:  I don't think most UFO sightings are literal holograms, but I 
think this is a good track to take, since they seem to deliberately "tease" 
witnessses with "impossible" aerial stunts.  UFOs employ a sort of 
technological theater.  Jacques Vallee and a few others see this as a 
possible catalyst for human evolution.  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised 
to discover that we are someone else's artificial life experiment, and UFOs 
and similar phenomena are variables thrown into the mix to assist some vast 
psychosocial study.

It's also interesting that holograms were mentioned, as there is some 
evidence that the U.S. government has used holography to simulate security 
breaches on air bases--using UFO imagery!  My best best is that these were 
psychological tests, but they could certainly be something else entirely...

As far as physical, uncontestable "proof" is concerned: we've got it, in one 
form or another.  A number of truly strange implants have been removed from 
the bodies of self-claimed "abductees," with no satisfactory explanation for 
their composition.  This doesn't mean aliens made them: it merely means they 
are an unknown, probably representing a technology of some sort.  The 
literature on this is terribly scant, but there's some intelligent stuff out 
there if you dig.  The website "CNI News" (www.cninews.com) is probably the 
best online source for nonsensational UFO claims (they also report on 
technology, physics and space exploration).

Dr. Allen Hynek co-authored a book on one of the most compelling mass 
sightings in history: "Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings."  I 
think anyone who can walk away from evidence like this (and I've read dozens 
more) and still insist on an ultimately prosaic explanation is irrational.  I 
contend that the UFO phenomenon, whatever it is (and it could be a lot of 
things, or a combination of many things) is a genuine unknown.  And that's 
really all that's certain at this point.  I broached the topic on a 
transhuman mailing list because I thought that it served as a working 
metaphor for many of the technologies we're concerned with, and maybe UFOs, 
far from being resolutely "alien," might actually be telling us something 
constructive about ourselves.

It's been noted that mathematical models of UFO sighting waves mirror B.F. 
Skinner's scedules of reinforcement.  Do UFOs represent some form of cosmic 
Skinner Box, or a psychic thermostat?  There's no arguing that our beliefs 
about the world (and, thusly our technologies--our means of dealing with the 
world) have been indirectly influenced by UFOs...  From this perspective, of 
course, the question of whether UFOs are physical objects or not becomes 
immaterial, but we're still faced with a potentially rewarding scientific 
payoff.

Finally, I don't think UFOs (or their apparent occupants) should be taken at 
face value.  The popular notion that alien are here to cross-breed with us, 
for example, seems to be a knee-jerk interpretation fueled by science fiction 
media.  _But that doesn't negate the fact that a lot of people have had 
documented medical anomalies crop up consistent with their belief that this 
is indeed what is happening to them_. 


 






Carl Sagan and others have told us over and over how strange alien contact 
will be.  The situation we have now, it seems to me, is just strange enough 
that it might be for real (on some level, not necessarily "extraterrestrial").

Here are what I personally consider "essential" books on the subject:

"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies" Carl Jung

"The Invisible College" "Dimensions" "Forbidden Science" Jacques Vallee

"Confirmation" Whitley Strieber (fascinating and very sober)

"Above Top Secret" Timothy Good (touches on conspiracy theory, but also 
demonstrates quite clearly that at least some UFOs are decidedly physical 
objects)

Well, here we go with normative-theoretic basics:  Who's the actual 
sponsor/owner of this chat/mail list.  Who-so-ever-the-hell it is, don't 
THEY have the (moral, and de facto) RIGHT to censor, desubscribe, or 
whatever?  Presumably, most of us are, ultimately, *guests* of the said 
sponsor/owner (again, regardless of who the hell said sponsor/owner happens 
to be [EXI, Max More personally, or a secret cabal consisting of FM2020, 
RAW, & Ignatz the Anarchist Mouse]).  Can a sponsor/owner kick a guest out, 
more-or-less "arbitrarily?"  Well, sure.  S/He might not "ought" to do so, 
it may be SUBerogatory for hir to do so, but S/He rightfully CAN do 
so---it's permissible in the important sense that it is correlatively 
IMpermissible for anyone else to coercively interfere with hir doing so.  Or 
am I TOTALLY screwed-up here?

Sure, we are--and damn well should be--a COMMUNITY, indeed, perhaps almost 
like a family, but let's not forget that someone or some organization is the 
proprietor, who ultimately has say-so.

I like dialog...dialectic.  I think you, Joe, and Mike and Mark and Brian, 
and Billy, et al were doin' FINE; we were, at least to SOME extent, honing 
in on a (at least partial) reconciliation of the opposing sides (not 
counting and notwithstanding the personal invective, [alleged] lies, 
[alleged] personal defamations etc.--I'm talkin' about the evolution of the 
debated concepts, ideas, protocols, etc.)  I think we really do need such 
systematic dialog/dialectic (WITHfrickinOUT personal invective b.s.)....

*BUT* I also feel(felt) that the g-word megathread(s) WERE spiralling into 
as much apolectic invective bullcrap as effective, productive dialectic, and 
many (apparently most) of the rest of the--ah-hem--COMMUNITY felt likewise.  
So they appealled to Greg to (temporarily) quash it.  Was I disappointed?  
Well, yeah, a teeeeny bit, because I thought (still think) the main 
protagonists were--nonetheless!!--maikin some good philosophic 
(intersubjective, dialectical, reflective-equilibrating) PROfrickinGRESS.

But Greg chose to act in his capacity, and......

Anyway, Joe, Mike, et al whaddaya think??  Am right here, full o' crap here 
or what??

I always love your stuff, Joe.  Be cool, bro.

Ciao

Reasonable rhetorical questions, Count.  I do think, however, that 
discussion(s) of current and near-future technologies as they relate to the 
whole aggression/defense thing is rather relevant.  As methodological 
individualists, it is always interesting to dialect-out the issues/memes 
surrounding a given technology vis-a-vis aggression/defense, etc.  What's 
the social dynamic/dialectic of "X" technology?  What legal rules might we 
need?  What rule(s) is(are), by what ever criteria, "optimal."  Etc.,  etc.  
As both methodological and normative individualists, it's always at least 
somewhat productive to discuss current technologies, as they relate to 
interpersonal relations, and then extrapolate the basic 
arguments/memes/protocols into the context of future technology(s).  Of 
course, admittedly, extrapolation can be (and oftentimes more-or-less 
inherently is) off-the-mark (sometimes, way off!).  Cf. Deutch's discussion 
("story"), in the last chapter of his very (re)commendable book, *Fabric of 
Reality,* of the medieval architect who, suddenly finding himself in OUR 
culture and, most especially, with OUR tech-know-how, exclaims, "Gee!  We 
can NOW build a MILE-HIGH cathedral--ain't it great!?!?!!!  Of course, *WE* 
NOW have no such interest whatsoever.  So extrapolation is oftentimes 
frought with such problems.  Nevertheless, it's (way) better than NOTHING, 
and can help dialect-out (meta)memes for the TRANSITION period(s) as we 
begin to actualize/instantiate new, world-changing technologies (and this 
point is meant to be more-or-less explictly Hayekian/Popperian/Habermasian, 
in case anyone gives an (intellectual) hoot!!  (and yeah, yeah, yeah, I 
realize that's a heck of combination of personages just now, but hey, check 
'em out: I think what I articulated is a good synthesis of what those guys 
would say on the subject....)  Anyway....gotta go.

Best regards to all,

*Study Looks To Nuclear Energy As Micro-Scale Fuel
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990706070354.htm

*TOKYO (July 5, 1999 12:06 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - The world's
first clones of an adult cow turned 1 year old on Monday, and Japanese
officials said they are growing strong and healthy.
The twins, named Noto and Kaga, were the second adult-animal clones after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first clone of an
adult animal.
Despite being slightly smaller than most cows their age, Noto and Kaga are
quite healthy, said Tatsuhiko Matsuda, an official of the Ishikawa
Prefectural Livestock Research Center, 190 miles northwest of Tokyo.
"They are full of energy, they have had no unusual illnesses and they are
growing vigorously," he said.
The pair was born about 40 days prematurely and at 440 pounds now, they are
still slightly below average size, he said.
The cows should soon reach sexual maturity and the next step for the
researchers is to determine if they are capable of giving birth, Matsuda
said. If all is normal, the cows will be artificially inseminated in an
attempt to produce a second generation of cloned animals.
Noto and Kaga were born after researchers took cells from an adult cow and
placed them in unfertilized eggs whose own nuclei had been removed. The
artificially cultivated embryos were then placed into the wombs of cows.
Their births were significant primarily because they showed that other
animals, not just sheep, could be cloned.
Cloning an adult, rather than a fetus, means scientists could reproduce
animals with chosen characteristics. For example, adult cows that produce
more milk could be targeted for cloning.
Scientists have cloned several kinds of animals since Dolly's arrival three
years ago.
In April, geneticists at Tufts University in Massachusetts cloned three
goats.

*Earth may have 'twin' in space
Somewhere out there in deep space, Earth may have a lost ''twin'' capable of
supporting life, an astronomer says. In a theory outlined in the July 1
issue of the journal Nature, David Stevenson of the California Institute of
Technology says Earth may have had one or more siblings when the solar
system was born, but they were jettisoned by gravity when they got too close
to Jupiter or other large planets. The idea has been around for a while. But
Stevenson goes a step further, drawing on planetary theory and his own
calculations to argue that these Earth-like planets may be capable of
supporting life, despite their wanderings through the cold, dark void, far
from the sun. ''Life would have to be simple,'' he said. ''Certainly you
wouldn't have much of it.'' Stevenson said these so-called rogue planets may
be heated by a dense hydrogen atmosphere and volcanoes, instead of sunlight.

*Neuroscience has been described as the last great frontier of human
biology - in fact NASA's most recent mission, Neurolab, was devoted to
investigations involving the nervous system. Australian neuroscientists are
among the leaders in brain research.

Yeah, I wasn't debating the source of the CLI, I accept your viewpoint
completely. In the days of yore when GUI was out of the question or too slow
due to performance constraints, of course CLI is the better option. I'm
talking about today. I often use CLI too, but I don't continually profess my
hatred for all things user-friendly, as many do. I was merely commenting on
the attitudes held by some with the information/power. The GUI, CLI thing is
just a well known example. I'm not saying that all old skool computer dweebs
(I'm one too) are this way, just a notable proportion. Come on, you must
have witnessed this attitude, it's hardly inconspicuous in IT circles......

Sorry old boy, it wasn't an attack on you. I've done a lot of solitary
thinking, and got a lot of stuff to say, and I inflict it upon you fine
people to get your comments and criticisms when prompted by certain posts,
such as your own. Cheers!

For myself, as a mainframe programmer I'm always on the CLI.
In micros (I was part of the POS project that bought the first PC sold
out the IBM product center in my city) I stuck with DOS until Win3.0, at
that point I saw functionality that had previously only been available
on SPARC stations start to become a reality on the PC and became a
(reluctant) believer.
At this point I really don't care too much, the fact that Windows (tm)
is a bloated mess, likely impossible for any single human to understand,
_it works_, it gives me what I want at the moment and I'm more than
willing to throw hardware at it as long as the hardware is cheap since
the alternative is to wait (possibly for a long time) to get the same
capabilities in properly optimized code.

Maybe they're as stupid and careless as we are.  Ever try to sneak up and
observe a bird?  It's very hard for the bird not to notice you.  I think the
way to solve this mystery is to give every US citizen an AA gun and train
everyone to shoot at UFOs. Then maybe we get some real evidence...

You realize I'm kidding.

Yes, I think it was RA Wilson who asked 'How many advanced civilizations
are watching us now' and answered with 'as many as want to'.

My theory: the aliens are incompetent laggarts who missed out on their
own civilization's singularity but found some of the neat toys their
brethren left behind. Yes, they're advanced enough, technologically
speaking, to avoid being seen, but too stupid to operate the controls
effectively.

No, it's hot fusion that's been twenty years away since the 50s or thereabouts
(can't remember when the first claim was made, so you may be right); cold
fusion is just a fantasy. Oh, and usable solar power systems have been a 
decade away since the mid 70s.

R. Buckminster Fuller came up with this over 50 years ago, I think
this is a great idea and would be useful to all mankind. Bucky
pointed out that at any particular moment 1/3 of the human
population of the earth is sleeping, and in darkness. Why not use
each others downtime to support the rest.

A man who truly made a difference.

When 'liewitnesses' claim sudden changes in direction, they are using their own
stationary reference. Anyone experienced in air operations of tactical military
or other high performance aerobatic aircraft know that this perception is false,
because the people are ignoring changes in distance. To the observer, a vehicle
travelling across one's field of view will seem to come to a rapid stop and
hover, then zoom off in another direction, when in actuality they are conducting
a turn where the midpoint of the turn is when the plane is either moving toward
or away from the observer, so it just seems to hover. Whenever I hear of a UFO
report that includes 'rapid changes in direction', I know what is actually going
on, and that the eyewitness is ignorant of flight dynamics, and lacks an ability
to think in three dimensions. Note that people have poor depth perception at
long range.

I did an analysis once that showed that if the percentage claiming abduction
really were being physically abducted, then the 'aliens' would have to have a
worldwide fleet of over 1000 vehicles at several dozen bases operating 24 hours
a day, with a logistical sytem of over 100,000 aliens living on the planet to
support air operations. I highly doubt that such an infrastructure could hide
itself that well for that long.

I think it was Buckminster Fuller's World Energy Grid idea, there is
likely much more about it on Fuller-related websites. I don't know
about the fairyland part, but he did point out that this kind of
international trade/networking would make wars less profitable.

Of course, global energy networks might become unstable due to speculations.

If you try to get promotion by being innovative and professional, then
you will have to compete against every other innovative and
professional site - quite hard, since many in the later category can
throw money and expertise at the problem. But you can get featured
anyway - the Aleph site was featured in a Swedish computer magazine a
while back just because of its simplicity and usability, they said it
was an example of a good association site. I don't think bells and
whistles would have helped that site (we're updating it anyway now,
but will try to keep it simple and clean).

Another thing mentioned at TV99 was that what we are truly good at is
producing and spreading ideas and text. Few of us actually do
transhumanist research or run transhumanist companies (but let't
increase that percentage!), but we can all act by spreading the meme,
discussing it with people and otherwise expose it to society. This can
be done in different subcultures (the academic one, raves, whatever)
by different people. But the main thing is not to get everybody to
support it, it is to get a lot of people to accept it - that is much
easier than "converting" people, and doesn't hegemonize too much. If
transhumanism is viewed as a valid philosophical/cultural/political
view, then it is much harder to vote against it. If we instead try to
create a large number of pro-transhumanists without anchoring the
views in the rest of the population, then we are more likely to end up
with a polarization and "us vs. them".

Thanks. I'll see what I can do (and I am interested in submissions of
pictures too!). Recently I have fallen in love with a program called
Bryce, and I might do some transhumanist pictures using it - I already
have a Jupiter brain, but it looks too much like the Death Star :-)

They are beautiful, allegedly intelligent, and driven.  I even saw a physics

myself who've been married to developing my business for the past 15 years 
catch up with the whole 'family' thing.

Also, most UFO sightings are lights in the sky where people have little or
no fixed reference points, and often viewed through shaky binoculars or 
camera zoom lens. In the circumstances, any reports of rapid changes in
speed and direction are highly suspect without supporting evidence.

I'd go for four different 'sexes' - the equivalent of Penrose tiles, then we
can engage in non-periodic relationships.

As you might remember, some months ago I asked for ideas on planetary
colonization for a roleplaying scenario I was working on. Since then
it has grown, and grown, and grown... a typical case of a project
taking control over my life but IMHO turning out very nicely. Anyway,
I have put up a sample (just a few of the files and descriptions
involved) at

http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/GreatIdeas/

I think extropians will be especially interested in the planet
Atlantis.

Suggestions are welcome; I'm running the scenario right now, and the
world is expanding and changing in all directions. The final scene
("Planning Meeting") shows roughly where the story left off at last
game session.

The July issue of Scientific American has a number of articles on

articles is on miniature fuel cells for cellphones and laptops.

Those who oppose the "watering down" of SciAm may wish to use your

This is a *very* *very* scary thought.  Since we can expect the
hardware to keep getting cheaper at least through 2012 (when they
hit the five atom gate thickness limit), then probably transition
over to nanotech (whence comes 1 cm^3 nanocomputers) -- the implication
is that we will have an extended period in which to develop increasingly
sloppy code.

So are *you* going to upload your mind onto one of these platforms?!?

We better hope the great hope that an AI comes along that can understand
the whole mess and can untangle the spagetti.

I'll believe it when I can order my C.F. household power source from
the net!

Hot(!) Fusion has been 10 years away since 1945.  Current designs
would get more power out than they put in.  They still have a way to
go to have a good way of extracting the power for real use.
Cold fusion is still a very questionable phenomena and there is no
evidence that it can be scaled into something useful.

Yes, I can buy a little rocket and launch it in my backyard, and it is
possible to build big rockets to launch people into outer space, but I
still don't (personally) have one.

Contrast rockets with the huge amount of evidence that computer
chips can continue scaling down to the atomic levels, that fiber
bandwidths will continue to increase for quite some time, and that
self-replicating machines can build interesting organisms of a
variety of sizes.

When you make a prediction and you are extrapolating from known trends
or things for which there is evidence all around you, you are probably
making a relatively safe statement.  When you make a prediction that
requires absolutely new science and engineering you are sticking your
neck way out.

I'll give a counter-example of something that would totally deflate
the cold-fusion balloon (even if it could be made to work).

Fusion produces neutrons, neutrons have this nasty property
that they go through things and require a lot of shielding.  They
also make materials radioactive.  So it is likely that any cold
fusion reactor you produce (if you intend to put it in your home)
is going to be heavy and take up a lot of space, at least if you
intend to get a useful amount of power out of it.

On the other hand, as Eric I believe has pointed out, you can
get nanoassemblers to assemble solar cells that are extremely
thin by current standards, much less than 1 Kg/meter^2.

Fusion & nanotech are not comfortably compatible technologies
(the nanobots have to run around, constantly repairing the
damage being done by the neutrons while being damaged themselves).

So, it would appear that on the basis of the quantity
of materials required and on a reliability basis that
solar cells will be less expensive than fusion reactors.

A world wide power grid is an interesting idea, but with present
technology it is not practical to transmit electrical power more than
about 1,000 miles.  Hydro Quebec sells power to utilities in New York,
which entails hundreds of miles transmission length, but that works
because the hydro power is so cheap to generate that large losses in
transmission can be tolerated.  Regional power grids are typically 100 to
300 miles wide.  The regional grids are themselves often connected to
adjacent grids, but that is just for increased flexiblilty.  The purpose
of the gridding is not to increase the average distance over which power
is transmitted, but rather to increase reliability.  Normally power
should be generated within 50 miles or so of the load to keep losses at a
minimum.  Even then, total transmission losses are between 10 and 20
percent.  For example, Baltimore is normally supplied by the Baltimore
Gas and Electric Company's Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Station, about 75
miles south of the city, on the Cheaspeake Bay.  There may theoretically
be a connection between the Grand Coulee Dam and Florida, but no
meaningful amount of power can be transmitted over that distance without
immense loss.  If high temperature superconductors capable of carrying
large currents were to be developed, the picture would change.  Today's
high temp superconductors cannot carry large currents.  Transmission
losses can be reduced by increasing the voltage, but in the US it has not
been practical to use voltages greater than about 750 KV.  The Russians
have some 1 million volt lines.

Its an engineering & return-on-investment problem .  Utility companies
had an incentive to build the grid to increase reliability
and do load balancing.  Then it became clear it could also
be used to buy power from the lowest cost source (after it
became clear that building nuclear plants was a big money pit).
Now, the East & West coasts in the  U.S.  buy a lot of cheap
hydroelectric power from Canada.   In Europe, most of the
natural gas (and presumably power from that), comes from Russia.
Since there were cheap power sources and markets with a high cost
of electricty, building the grid/pipelines made sense.
All the U.S. government now is removing the monopoly from the
local distribution network.  (So the consumer can in effect
buy his power directly from the hydroelectric producer).
This is what they have done with long distance telephone
service are attempting to do with the local telephone service
as well.  [They still haven't gotten it quite right with cable
unfortunately, though court decisions may have recently fixed it.]

Power transmission over long distances is done (cost effectively)
with naked cables with enough air between them to function as an
insulator.  Unfortunately salt water has this nasty property that
it conducts electricty.  So to engineer undersea electrical cables
they would need to be have a lot of insulation (thick & heavy)
and you would need very high quality manufacturing process (for
reliability).  We've had about 100 years of development to get
cost effective and reliable undersea telephone cables and those
run at relatively low power *and* we ended up switching from
eletrical signals to light.  The engineers did and still do put
a lot of extra pairs in the cables to make sure they would continue
to have something that worked after 20 years.  Can you see this
being done with high voltage cables?

Since solar power (as a power source), isn't cost effective right
now, undersea transmission of the power from the light side of the
planet to the dark side would only make things worse.  Think of
the transmission losses!  Even if we has HT superconducting cables
the problem of circulating that much LN2 under the ocean is not
trivial.

The average home has enough surface area to supply your power needs.
My electric bill says my average daily consumption is ~40 KWh.
An average house, say ~200 m^2 (home surface area) * 500 W/m^2
(average solar insolation) * .15 (conversion efficiency) * 8
hours / day = ~120 KWh.

You have to have a storage system and since these aren't very
efficient, the approach of selling "day" power to the utility
(for business use), while buying it back at night (for home
use) allows the utility to become primarily a resource storage
and distribution manager rather than a production manager.
They can build the big flywheels or high heat capacity salt
storage units for load balancing.  Of course if you are a true
libertarian, you don't want the utility involved at all and have
to shell out some extra bucks for your personal power storage unit.

The problem is getting the cost of the solar cells to drop by
a factor of 2 to 3 (which is likely to be by 2010-2015 given
current trends).  If we got serious about minimizing our
environmental impact (global warming, salmon loss, etc.) and
factored the hidden costs of fossil fuels/hydroelectric into
electrical production. then it might happen much sooner.
Germany seems to be buying photovoltaic power from the consumer
at $.11/KWh which is something like twice the market rate.

Now, of course to get the PV module costs down low enough
you have to get the manufacturing volume high enough and
that means that free market forces will only work over a
very long period.  So the governments *are* subsidizing 
both the R&D and the purchase of the PV modules through
various mechanisms.   [Bad governments... we should
wait for the free market system to work it all out....]

Now, for something completely different -- what happens
if the cryonics people seriously thought about the problem
of low-cost long term preservation?  If you were to make
an up-front investment in solar cells and an LN2 production
production facility, I suspect you could drop the long
term storage costs significantly!  After you amortize
the investment in the equipment, your LN2 is essentially
for free and you resumably have a relatively low cost
for the workers who have to periodically top off the
tanks (though this could be automated as well)...
This makes sense, since controlling your own production
and using the sun as your power source increases your
disaster/political-wind-shifts tolerance.

Would more people go in for cryonics if you were to drop
the cost by an order of magnitude?   (Say from 100K to
10K?  What about 1K (which is below the cost of a
funeral...)?

Yes, but you have to study both changes in the economic environment
and the rate of maturation of technologies.

The Arab-induced oil shortages of the 70s were "artificial".  They
were turned on/off on the whims of a few individuals.  The reason
that there haven't been any since then is that in part because
the suffering they caused induced the development of alternate sources
(Alaska, North Sea, etc.), and substitutions (France going to nuclear,
work being done on gas turbines for electricity [gas is abundant]), etc.

But because those sources & substitutions used 20-60 year old technologies
and were *existing* industries (oil, nuclear, engine manufacturing)
they could be ramped faster than PV could (which was about a 10-year old
technology (& a non-industry) in the mid-70s).  PV is now a relatively mature
technology (we can build cells at close to the theoretical limits of
efficiency) and has developed into an industry (all those communication
satellites don't run on kerosene...).

So PV technology has moved from the science phase through the engineering
phase and into the industrial phase, where you have a production experience
learning curve & return-on-investment calculations involving volumes that
determine what things will cost when.  Competition in the industry helps
as well.

So while the predictions may have been premature in the '70s,
they are much less so now (there is an equivalent of "Moore's
Law" for PV costs, but it isn't as dramatic).  On the other
hand fusion (cold or hot) are still pretty much in the
pre-engineering phase so I'm relatively sure the singularity
will be here before I've got a fusion reactor in my house.

It also shows that nearby supernovae aren't necessarily
planetkillers. As far as I know there was no major extinction the last
million years. Although maybe it got the current ice age started...

If you look at the nearby interstellar medium it is clear that there
are "bubbles" made by novae just about
everywhere: http://spacsun.rice.edu/~twg/lism.html

Depends on who you talk to, if you pick up the latest copy of
"Homepower" magazine you'll find there are thousands who've
disconnected from the grid. In fact last time I checked the claim
was that new home systems were cheaper if your new house was 1/2
mile off the existing grid. The guy who wrote the "Earthships" trio
of books has been living off solar electricity for over 20 years.

Let's not forget 2nd stage solar which includes both wind and
hydroelectric power.....

>embarassing!

Hmmn.  There are a LOT more of them than there are of us!  Well, if
the Mormon's unused CPU cycles are put to work for our goals also...

An interesting thing emerges from the SETI@HOME statistics page.
Most of the total computation is done by the mass of slow computers.
The fastest computers have provided the smallest total result.  In
fact, the fastest computer listed crunched only one work unit.

I think this is a general principle at work, the democratization of
computing power.  Probably others have pointed it out.  It has
implications for the future.  I think the driving force is this: The
value to an individual of a unit of computing power decreases as the
individual has more.  Also the cost of a unit of computing power
goes down as more copies of that computer design are made.  So, lots
of slow computers get built, and their number outweighs the difference
in speed.  Also: the more copies sold, the more designers/programmers
work on that platform.

If these principles hold true into an uploaded/augmented future, I
think it will be a Good Thing.  If brain power is ~proportional to
computing power, then this will tend to keep humanity together in the
same general area of evolution.  At least in terms of hardware. :-}

I thought Mormons believed that if you're good in this life, and you
have a large family, you and your family will get their own planet in
the afterlife?  I don't know if the heavenly planet is supposed to be in
this physical universe, but perhaps they have religious reasons for
being curious about intelligent life in outer space.  

When the Mormons decide to do something for religious reasons, it gets
done.  They believe that they can retroactively convert their ancestors
to Mormonism; this is why they have put so much effort into creating
publicly available genealogy archives.

I think your mixing them with Jehovah's Witness's. I looked on the official
Mormon web page and there was something about becoming gods if you get
married in the temple, but nothing about seperate planets, or universes, or
anything like that. I noticed they don't post the text of that book (the
one by Young) but they'll send you a free one if you give them your name,
address, age, phone, stuff like that, and if you don't notice and choose not
to, they'll send someone around to deliver it and have an hour long chat. So
if anyone wants some one to talk to...

Sir, you demonstrate an obvious misunderstanding of details of the
uploading process. It is much less coding than a large-scale physical
simulation -- requiring a very different set of metaphors than common
to code monkeys. Very little code, a huge sea of data. And sheer physics 
will prevent you from running it on anything less than a 10^6..10^9 
processor machine.

I can't believe this.  I looked and there are 35 people that
have been hoodwinked into this effort (not that RC5 seems
that much more justifiable), but at least RC5 is guaranteed
to produce a result (if it gets enough computers/time), while
SETI@HOME never will.

Perhaps these people were not at the Extro3 conference or
perhaps they never read the J-brain discussions of many
years ago, or perhaps they simply want to believe that those
benevolent little green men want to talk to us.  Or perhaps they
are simply nano-alien clones spreading confusion on the issue
to keep us from looking in the right places or perhaps they
simply can't follow a logical argument when presented with one.

At any rate...

A 10^40th to 10^50th Instructions Per Second SuperIntelligence
(compared with a 10^12 to 10^14 IPS human { leaving out those
on the SETI@home lists where I believe there may be a "-" sign
in front of the "10" :-)} ) that has the capacity of building
100 billion telescopes (or radio transmitter/receiver dishes)
the diameter of the moon and has an internal communication bandwidth
so large I can't even begin to compare it to a human brain
*ISN'T GOING TO COMMUNICATE WITH US*!  Paraphrasing what I said
at the Extro3 conference -- "We don't talk to nematodes and SIs
don't talk to us" (we are closer to a nematode than we are to
a SI!).

We don't begin to become interesting until the post-singularity
era arrives.  Until that time, perhaps the best they could do
is guide us towards that point (as lightly as possible), making
sure that we don't get too depressed beforehand by discovering
them and plunge like lemmings into the sea when we realize
how very far down on the evolutionary tree we actually are.

That brings us to what happened to the WIRE mission, launched
in March, which was supposed to conduct a really good
infrared survey of the entire sky.  NASA has attributed the
mission failure to a design "flaw":
 http://origins.jpl.nasa.gov/library/pressreleases/99-74.html

It could be sloppy engineering or it could be alien SIs being
really clever at hiding themselves... You be the judge.

In the mean time, since there aren't any good space based
IR telescopes going up in the near future, the best use of your
computer time would be in processing the 2MASS survey data
 [http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu:80/2mass/pub/overview.html]
trying to identify very cold objects that could be further
examined for a lack of a stellar spectral fingerprint.
The 2MASS survey has about 10 terabytes of data at this point,
so there is plenty of work to be done.  Even if you didn't
come up with SIs, you would come up with brown dwarfs,
proto-planetary dust clouds, asteroids or comets that might
be on Earth-impact trajectories, etc.  (in contrast to
SETI@home which does nothing but pollute the planet).
Unfortunately, they haven't written any software to let you
work on the data yet and if they did have it would have to
overcome the used-car sales job the SETI@home people have done.

I'm going to take the SETI@home people to task (and make
sure they understand how silly the project is).  I may
get to do it at the Bioastronomy conference at the end
of this month, but failing that I will definitely be doing
it early this fall.  If I'm lucky, I might convince them
to adopt the SETI@home distribution mechanism with some
software to process the 2MASS data and then we would
have a crack at finding those darn SuperIntelligences.

If you want to use your excess computer time for something
else, push on the people at the Foresight Institute or the
Institute for Molecular Manufacturing to come up with
a software package that would produce "random" collections
of atoms that are assigned merit values as "building block"s
or "functional unit"s (pumps, gears, etc.). Then we could
use all the processing power to "evolve" the designs and
have some interesting things to build when the nanoassemblers
arrive.  Where would we be tomorrow if Zyvex announced a
working nanoassembler?  We all act as if its going to arrive
someday in the far far future.

As an Extropian, probably the best thing you could do is hack
the SETI results and send them back something that decoded as
  "You are not alone, you are not alone, you are not alone..."
repeating endlessly.  [According to the news at slashdot.org,
someone did hack the SETI@home site the other day and replaced
it with a picture of Alf.]  It had me ROTFL because thats the
only way the project will ever have anything to show.

Well, you can always run a minority operating system like Linux or QNX or
BeOS today, depending on application compatibility needs.  There are plenty
of nice choices out there, so I don't think we have to worry so much about
"Human minds on Windows" when the time comes :)

I've sometimes thought that, for all of the headaches, Windoze and similar
bloatware might actually be doing us some good in the long run, by
accelerating development on the hardware side.

If Joe Average didn't feel the need for a  64MB PII-450 to run his latest
word processor and web browser, such hardware might not be quite so cheap
today :)

Here we get into the thick of it.   I'm going to take what I think
you are saying and attempt to put it in my frame of refference.

Presumably, concrete "constructions" and memes (have historically)
survived/florished/become extinct on the basis of criteria to which
little conscious thought has been devoted.  [Fundamentally were they
successful in a [local] environment!]

I am an "optimalist".  I've devoted years of my life to determining
how one gets "optimal" performance (according to the rigid criteria
in computer science of space & time) from a computer program.
I will freely admit that this approach may not be the best to use
to evaluate things derived from other frames of reference.
Often I may not even be able to see the frame of reference --
I can see the surface of the iceburg, but not know what is
under the water.  Nature uses a very simple, and from my
frame of reference, sub-optimal selection criteria, namely 
does it survive & prosper.  It in no way has to be optimal for
nature to accept it.   In some cases surviving & prospering may require
that you mutate most quickly, in other cases it may require that
you undertake heroic efforts to preserve a genome in its "original" state.
(Contrasting for example E. coli that have a relatively high mutation
rate with Deinococcus radiodurans which has a very low mutation rate).
Both of these (because they are opposites) cannot be "optimal"
excepting from the frame of reference "it works" in the local environment.
[Interestingly enough, Nature has built into E. coli, yeast
*and* humans the enzymes for both low and high mutation rates...]

Nature's process of operating blindfolded with her/his/its hands
tied behind its back selecting something that merely "works" may fail
in a very gross fashion in the light of a "consciousness" frame of
reference.  The example that comes to mind is the choice of
"iron" as an oxygen carrier in hemoglobin (to provide the energy
we need for metabolism), when iron (in conjunction with oxygen)
may ultimately result in free radical production that destroys our
genetic program (causing cancer and some aspects of aging).  Now, if
you were "consciously" designing a system, *would* you select
a feature that caused the system's self-destruction?  If you
were creating memes, would you create memes that erased themselves?
In a selection system it would be something that removed the process
by which or the criteria on which the selections are based.
(My mind is really stretched here!) 

Even more importantly, how is it possible when designing a system
(or memes) to know whether or not one is excluding design possibilities
that may be *more* optimal?  A "better" design may succeed in the
environment of natural selection, but that in no way guarantees
that such a design is in any way the "best".  The "optimal" design
(or meme) may fail because it is not close enough to existing
designs/memes to be properly evaluated.  In Nature, that doesn't
happen very often because it is usually taking small incremental
steps.  Humans on the other hand can take things that are
extrordinarily unrelated to each other and jam them together.
Most of the time this produces garbage but sometimes it doesn't.
But in those situations where we "think" what has been produced
is garbage, do we have any way of being certain that we have
the proper frame of reference to evaluate it? In other words, the
frame of reference required to properly evaluate a new design/meme
may effectively be in a hyper-dimension that is outside of the
dimensions in which the creation and evaluation normally occurs.

This type of thinking leads to my perspective that actions that
promote the increase of diversity and the survival of memes of
diverse derivations seems to be a good strategy.  It is a
pitiful approach to increasing our dimensionality, but
it may be one of the few we currently have.

All of that said, the SETI@home meme is still garbage,
even though it appears to be remarkably successful.

Clearly true.  The Msofties are always writing for the next generation
and thats why they can get away with being so sloppy.

That is also why Intel is so concerned that the hardware may get to the
point that it effectively runs most software, that they are providing
capital to companies to invent more things to suck up CPU cycles.
I can't wait until my computer can record those few TV shows I
think are worth watching and carefully edit out the commercials...

Ever consider that one reason for the delay in the introduction of
Merced might be the fact that they believe it may be "the last
processor you ever need to buy"?

I hate to tell you this, but Windows 2000 Beta 3, runs quite nicely
on a 2 year old,  64MB, dual 200 MHz Pentium Pro machine.  The
processors have already caught up with the software and applications.
The only thing driving stuff forward at this point are things like
games, DVD, DigitalTV and the really silly stuff like SETI@home
or cracking encryption codes that someone already knows the answer for.

Wrong. You actually have no way of knowing whether the SETI
effort will succeed or not; this is just your not-so-humble
opinion. And don't forget that this project has other goals

space. As for RC5, THAT is a complete waste of time. We
already all agree on what currently makes for a "secure"

another stupid RSA message is the height of boredom.

Well the fact of the matter is: you can't really say for sure
what a SI will want to do with its time. You can blather on
all day, but it's all a guess. In fact you can't even be
completely sure that there are even any SIs in this universe.

Not a chance, we're talking 'mission critical' here.

Seriously, I think an AI is our best hope of a solution to the software
problem, either that or some form of algorithmic uploading that will
give the upload Elizer's AI advantage.

When I spoke of long time frames I was speaking in terms of 'web time'
if you will.

No one is more aware than I am of how fast things have actually changed
though having been in the middle of it has cushioned any shock factor
for me.

Quite true in a great many cases, but there is a body of close-range reports 
and other, videotaped reports, that indicate that we might be dealing with a 
truly exotic propulsion system.  There have been a handful of mass-sighting 
reports when the object under question was seen by many only at certain 
angles; to all intents and purposes, it was "invisible" to other witnesses 
who saw the object reappear shortly after.

There's a meme running through the UFO counterculture that describes this as 
the effect of gravitational warping.  Theoretically, UFOs distort spacetime 
in order to fly, using gravitational lenses to focus on a particular point, 
which they _draw toward them_.  This way, there is no contradiction with 
physical laws; the UFOs aren't even really "flying," per se.

What do you think about the is of gerund, as in "he is walking"?

How about the is of passivity? "The door was closed"?

I've used e-prime for a while myself, but it seems a bit of an unnecessary hassle in at least the first case.

Thoughts?

Not only are some uses of "be" perfectly clear and precise,
but it's possible to be as murky and deceptive in E-prime
as it is in plain English.  It's an interesting observation
that most uses of "be" in English obscure more than enlighten,
and I often use that fact to tighten my prose by searching
for them.  But that's all it is--an interesting observation.
To elevate that to the status of a new language, or to rely
on a gimmick in place of real analysis, or to mangle prose
to avoid "be" without good reason are all counterproductive.

You forget, negative results count in science too. Even if Seti@Home
firmly establishes that all the radio noise on whatever frequencies
they're scanning is meaningless noise, this at least gives us some firm
lower bounds regarding the probable distribution of technological
civilizations.

I personally doubt they'll find anything. The timescales involved are too
great for it to be likely that there's anything within a million years of
us in this half of the galaxy. But the only reason I have to think that
is a moderately pessimistic intuit of some of the terms of the Drake
equation. Hard numbers are NEVER a bad thing, especially when they can be
obtained at negligible cost, like what Seti@Home is doing.

It's probably a good idea to try to work out, in a quantitative way, just
how nervous the Great Filter Paradox should be making us. :)

Hello everyone,

I perused the Textropian timeline and was very impressed.  As a teen I 
thrilled to the timeline developed by Arthur C. Clarke.  There are other 
charts like this out there on the net but to have one from the extropian 
point of view is exciting.  The list did perhaps frighten me a little by 
showing how much the world will have changed when I am fifty-one years old.  
But I should not fear but instead embrace such wondrous change.  So many 
would avoid death or have such better lives if only we had 2020 level 
medtech right now.  I had a knee jerk reaction at first thinking that some 
of these technologies would be farther off then twenty years but then I 
reconsidered.  Actually isn't all of this suppose to be here by next year?? 
LOL!  I want to make it around campus with my packback rocket made by 
Martin-Marietta/Jansport!

I would love to see the timeline expanded to the year 2050!  I would urge 
the Textropians to consider this down the line.  I realize that to look 
beyond a twenty year span is much harder and less concrete.  But some of 
these technologies I do not see maturing by 2020 such as humanlike robots, 
complex VR worlds, advanced molecular manufacturing, transhuman AI's and 
nuclear fusion.  I would love to see a cure for AIDS and all  cancers by 
2020 but is it realistic to hope for such?

I have been fascinated by the  conversations about male and female sexual 
strategies.  I see some definite changes down the road within the next fifty 
to a hundred years.

Women are only partially free from the fear of pregnancy at present.  But by 
the late 21st century or much earlier there should be almost zero chance of 
pregnancy.  Females may even be modified in vitro so that they are born 
sterile and later in life when ready the condition is reversed at government 
expense.  I've read that it is only in relatively recent history (last 
several millennia) that women due to diet and lack of intense exercise could 
get pregnant in the early teens.

Imagine the second sexual revolution that will result when STD's are finally 
defeated!  Of course this will probably happen in increments but still it 
will result in at least for five to ten years a period of great sexual 
promiscuity like the sexual revolution of the late sixties and early 
seventies.  Women of the mid 21st century will at least in terms of physical 
health be free to do as they wish.  I would think that over time people 
would settle down to relative monogamy seeing the shallowness of very 
short-term sexual relationships.

Even in a world without damaged bodies from promiscuity there will be broken 
hearts and tormented minds.  Will we just medicate to deal with the pain of 
this?  Having had my own heart broken I admit I might be tempted to take a 
legal prescription of soma.  Rather then being blissed out I just want those 
neurochemicals that herald loss to be blocked.  But the youth of every 
generation would be much more promiscuous in sowing their wild oats till 
they matured and settled down a bit.  I think that old strategies hardwired 
into us will still be quite dominant.

Of course infidelity is somewhat commonplace in even our present culture 
that has the hazards of STD's and possible pregnancy.  And the rates of 
infidelity would obviously climb with the two big fears out of the way.

And a world full of near immortals who are forever young will be quite an 
amazing thing.  I see how presently people go a little nuts trying to eek 
out the last remaining fun they can from youths that do not last forever 
because we live in a youth obsessed world.  When people have forever or 
nearly so to achieve their goals I tend to think they will be more laid back 
rather then frantically always trying to get their fun as many do today.

I have noticed how woman in their thirties and especially forties do tend to 
go away from the "programming" of mate selection and do it more on 
personality and heart as opposed to looks and money which is so keenly 
valued by most younger women.  But I think that even in an extropian utopia 
women will still be attracted to powerful and wealthy men.

One of the great unfairnesses of our time is how both physical beauty and 
high intelligence are passed out so unfairly.  In our current society a 
relative few are "beautiful" in the accepted way and have the attention 
showered on them.  In a world where all are beautiful we will have to look 
beyond just the physical in my opinion.  I have had too many female friends 
who felt inferior because they were not as attractive physically as they 
wanted to be.  I am in this boat myself as a male.  Yes, I agree with 
someone here who once said to me that even in a world where all are 
good-looking there will be that something extra that will make a few stand 
out and be extra attractive to others.  But at least the playing field in 
this area will be much more even.

Imagine a world where all women are beautiful (yes, I do believe there is 
beauty in all people but you know what I mean).  In time people would just 
grow jaded to it while we the reanimated would remember the old days when 
some were even ostracised for not being attractive enough.

Intelligence in our world is more then ever a key factor in a person's 
success both professionally and in dating and mating.  Again this genetic 
gift is not given out equally.  I agree that environment and hard work play 
a big part but not as big as genetic inheritance.  I have seen people and 
especially women in bad conditions socially and economically where I believe 
that if they were actually more intelligent (not just worldly wise but a 
real I.Q. improvement) they would be so much more able to break out of a bad 
situation.

I feel that every future child should be upgraded at least to a certain 
level so they will be able to compete successfully.  But then again the 
island inhabited by only alpha class humans in "Brave New World" comes to 
mind as a possible warning against that.  This will probably come out of 
free-market competition as parents want the best for their offspring.  Of 
course this will confer on the well to do the power of literally making 
their children better then those of the middle and lower middle classes and 
will create possibly huge social strife down the road.

Marriage I believe will always be with us though in differing ways.  I could 
see how in some cases a marriage between immortals could just atrophy after 
decades or even centuries!  Or with some couples could things always remain 
fresh as they maintain time apart for growth and renewal?  Perhaps we have 
some present marriages among us that will be this way such as Max and 
Natasha's's or Robert and Mae Ettinger.  Imagine your partner dying after 
centuries of marriage.  Would you want a clone of them with a downloaded 
personality?  Would that really be them or just an excellent copy?

Women today complain of how housework is a huge burden to them and that we 
men as their partners do not do our share.  So when household robots take 
over the vacuuming, laundry and cleaning in general I think that it will be 
a huge step forward in domestic peace.  Not having the women of the world 
exhausted from housework will make everyone and especially the men happier.

The other thing that tends to exhaust couples is childcare.  A nannybot 
would be a godsend for so many parents who are worn out and feel trapped and 
unable to go out occasionally and have a good time.  Of course it would take 
a highly sophisticated and totally reliable robot to take on the task of 
caring for children.  A machine like this would be loved by parents 
everywhere!  But the kids will scream bloody murder when it is time to take 
their beloved nannybot to the scrapheap!  I could see some parents 
over-relying on this robot to the point that the kids have much more of a 
bond with the machine then with their own biological parents.

With nanotech, computing, biotech and other advancements the economy should 
be one of plenty rather then our present one of relative scarcity.  I hope 
that the poverty that many women and children experience now will be 
eliminated.  And hopefully the educational system will be transformed so the 
untapped potential of many people that is presently wasted will be used.

I am excited about this new breed of women that we will see as the next 
century passes.  She will be free of the fear of pregnancy, STD's, domestic 
drudgery, lack of education, physical unattractiveness, encroachment of old 
age and poverty that dogged the lives of so many of her previous sisters who 
lived earlier.  How this new breed of women interacts with men should be 
interesting to say the least.  I guess for all the extropian guys on the 
list who wished they had better success with women they are hoping that they 
will do better with the late 21st century women.  I just hope I am not 
reanimated in a world run by militant lesbians! LOL!  Actually my dormitory 
last semester was and they did a good job of things.

This is an exciting time on the cryonics list.  The major powers that be 
such as Saul Kent, Robert Ettinger and Charles Platt are discussing the 
future of cryonics in the near future and in concrete terms.  Not just the 
technology but how to market it.  Great things are brewing there folks!

Saul Kent is still somewhat mum about the full extent of breakthroughs made 
by 21st Century Medicine because of patents pending.  I cannot wait to hear 
him eventually explain to us just how far the state of the art for cryonics 
is now.  My original understanding was that full brain vitrification had 
been finally achieved.  He announced on cryonet that he is working with 
Alcor and Cryocare to disperse his advancements to them.  It's nice to see a 
person in cryonics with both the vision, money and inclination to make 
things happen the way Saul Kent does.  Down the road he said he will 
possible fund a serious marketing campaign but not until the improvements he 
has developed for cryonic suspension are firmly in place.

I realize this goes back a bit but on the topic of having a libido that 
burdens one with desire I can sympathize.  I am 32 and have similar thoughts 
and in my case I am single without a sexual partner.  Having been raised in 
a Mormon home where sex outside of marriage and even self-stimulation is 
considered wrong I have had my own real torments on the subject.  Especially 
since I have never been married.

I am getting out of my 'geeky' phase finally to the point where a few women 
are interested in me sexually.  I wind up in the end at least so far 
breaking off contact with them though a part of me wants to have a physical 
relationship with them.  I don't know if I could resist the advances of a 
highly attractive woman for all my supposed desire to do what I have been 
taught is right.  I have met women on the net also who even after seeing my 
pic said they would be my lover if only I lived closer to them.  Being stuck 
in Alaska and poor keeps me out of alot of trouble!  But I have noticed many 
more Alaskan women posting on the internet classifieds now and have  
considered writing some.

I'm one of those guys who spent two year's of their lives knocking on doors 
for my church and should have gone off to a Mormon college right after 
returning home but I did not and instead opted to work various dead-end jobs 
for most of the nineties because of a learning disability that hamstrung my 
confidence.  Had I gone to college back then I would have a degree, good 
job, wife, kids and all that by now which is what I dearly want.

I have found the young women at church to be highly particular but then they 
have the mating strategy of getting the best male they can find.  Mormon 
girls are the living examples of Darwinian mating strategies!!  I think some 
of these girls are so particular they may never find mates.

I have thought seriously about attending a Mormon school such as Brigham 
Young University-Hawaii campus or even do a semester at Ricks which is only 
a two year school.  Friends have told me that the women at these schools are 
much more open to marriage then most places but then what would you expect? 
LOL!  In terms of a social life, a family atmosphere, fairly low costs (it 
would cost less for me to attend byu-H then my present school here in 
Alaska!) and a solid education a Mormon school is hard to beat.  Of course 
the honor code is very restrictive  and I am beginning to feel the urge to 
sow my wild oats!  But if I can just contain myself it would be well worth 
it.

I have considered writing some very interesting sounding women in the online 
personals that live right here in Anchorage.  In just a year the number has 
hugely swelled.  Some of these women are rather blunt that they want a 
sexual relationship which kind of blows my mind but excites me too.  I just 
wonder about contracting STD's also!  Other women are more reserved but 
again without a car and a well paying job at present and being a poor 
college student I'm not sure how well I would do with any of them.  As the 
old saying goes "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" but I tend to lose my 
nerve in dealing with women, especially those that I am attracted to.

I was fascinated by Peter Lakbar's words regarding UFO's.  I had heard those 
reports of "flying saucers" over parts of Sweden and Belgium and how they 
were chased by fighter jets.  And as he mentioned there seems to have been a 
large number of credible witnesses to these visitors or whatever they were.  
I just cannot dismiss this activity casually.

I personally believe (I do not know for sure) that we are being visited by 
extraterrestrial and/or extradimensional beings.  I agree that many reports 
are bogus but I do not believe that all are.  I believe the testimony of 
those who came in contact with the craft that crashed at Roswell also.

Until these supposed beings decide to go public which I doubt they will for 
some time it will be very hard to uncover any overwhelming proof of their 
existance.  I could see how the government would desire to cover things up 
and may have specific agencies dedicated to doing this.

I read the book "The Day After Roswell" which fascinated me.  The author a 
retired army colonel named Phillip Corso had a very distinguished career in 
R&D.  It is possible that he made the e.t. parts of the book up but he seems 
a man of integrity.  It was his job to figure out how captured enemy 
machines and technologies worked.  He says that over a number of years parts 
of the downed spacecraft from  were brought to him without his knowledge of 
their true origin
in the beginning.  He claims that knowledge gleaned from studying the alien 
technology was seeded to the commercial sector without their knowing where 
it came from.

He claims the  craft was only a shuttle most likely and that the occupants 
were genetically engineered to withstand the rigors of space travel and 
endure radiation levels that would kill us.  He said there is still so much 
about the alien machinery we do not know.

His biggest claims were that the aliens are not too friendly actually but 
shy away from direct conflict.  They are a dying race that need our  to make 
hybrids that will invigorate their species.  He claims that the radar 
guidance devices of the military could interfere with the alien propulsion 
system and knock down one if it got fairly close and this actually happened 
once.

Corso even said it was  that the pentagon has a time travel research project 
going on based on the nature of the  craft's propulsion system but that it 
is a one way ride for the agents that go in that so far results in instant 
death.

Some claim this colonel to make money just jazzed up an otherwise very dull 
military man's biography to appeal to a wide audience but I still find it 
hard to believe he would lie about these things though it is possible.  But 
then maybe he is telling the truth but the government knows he won't be 
taken seriously.

On an interesting note the science-fiction novel "Citizen Termite" is being 
turned into a motion picture.  The plot has the "greys" going public and 
sharing life-extending biotech among other things with humans to befriend 
us.  They permeate their influence throughout our society even to the point 
of some of them living among us on Earth.

The book is from the perspective of the alien leader who is very conflicted 
over his hidden agendas that his own kind want him to perpetrate on 
humanity.  In his own way he does care for us and loves his human/grey 
hybrid daughter.  A hybridization program was allowed as the price of alien 
aid.

As you could expect the militaries and spy agencies of Earth furiously 
suspect and plot against the greys.  This novel has much more the feel in 
some ways of a political thriller then a traditional science-fiction novel.  
I will not ruin the ending for you but this is one of the finest 
science-fiction novels I have ever read and recommend it to you all.  The 
characterization, plot and world building are all first rate.  Even if you 
think the whole UFO/grey thing is not real you will love this novel.  I hope 
Hollywood does a good job turning it into a film.  I will have to keep my 
fingers crossed on that one.  You probably have two years to read the book 
before the film comes out.  With "The First Immortal" who knows at this 
point!

I enjoyed hearing about the early influences in people's lives that lead 
them toward extropianism.  In my case it was Star Trek the classic series 
that made such an impression.  And of course the later series had a strong 
effect on me too.  I am a huge Babylon 5 fan and see a more fascinating and 
probably more realistic view of the future their.

"Cosmos" the PBS series written and hosted by Carl Sagan had a powerful 
effect on me!  I watched entranced along with my mother as he did his 
voyages of discovery in the realm of science and history.  I remember my mom 
commenting on how handsome he was as the camera panned to show his profile 
for extended periods of time as he looked at the viewscreen! LOL!  I have 
seen the series over and over again and plan on seeing it another time soon.

The Mormon faith that I was raised in actually was an influence on me.  
Unlike some of you I do believe in God and an afterlife but do not have a 
perfect knowledge of this and am angry at the unfairness of this world and 
what it corrected.  Anyway, I have already discussed with people here how 
Mormonism is not extropian even though there are definite similarities.  But 
those similarities were seeds to me.  The belief in exalted Humans ever 
progressing and becoming Gods eventually opened my mind to new concepts.  I 
spent two years in the bible belt being screamed at by many for believing a 
meme that to them as evangelicals is heretical.  In a different time they 
would have tortured and even killed me for certain.

As a teen and still now to a certain extent I have been a comic book  
collector.  Comics have at their best gone a long way in terms of story, 
plot and art in the last fifteen years or so.  The heroic exploits of the 
X-Men stirred my heart in adolescence and still do when the writing and art 
are good.  In Professor Xavier and Magneto I see an extropian conflict 
between good and evil as well as justice, mercy and the desire for revenge.  
Magneto was not really evil but would not respect the rights of other's for 
he was filled with anger over the wrongs done to him and his family.  
Batman's approach to self-improvement is surely extropian as he pushed 
himself to the limits of his mind and body to fight crime.  And of course 
Tony Stark could be considered the ultimate extropian role-model.  Don't we 
all want to be handsome, extremely brilliant billionaire playboys with our 
own suit of super-advanced flying battle armor?  Of course we do!!  If any 
of you want to be like Sebastian Shaw of the villainous Hellfire Club then I 
am scared!

As for extropian music nothing comes to mind.  But I will say that it is 
amazing how musical styles and fashions in general seem to come back to 
haunt us!  Any guesses here on whether or not the late 2060's will have 
resemble the late 1960's??  The drugs will just be better and hopefully 
safer and the sex by then much safer.  Hopefully there will not a 'Nam type 
war going on between the humans and their renegade A.I.'s that we really 
could never hope to win!  Young men will scream "don't send me to the front, 
I am immune to aging but not x-ray lasers!!"  Somehow with young looking, 
immortal elders I think the young draftees would want their government 
leaders to come join them in the fox holes too!

I had my heart set on attending Extro 4.  It seems to be developing into a 
really fantastic event as the previous ones must have been.  My tax refund 
was not what I had hoped so it does not look like it.  It will cost me $500 
for an expedition from Anchorage to Los Angeles all total.  I love my 
full-time job working with teens but it does not pay the big money that's 
for sure.  Perhaps somehow I can scrape together the money.  I wish my 
permanent dividend check were coming in July instead of October.

I have enjoyed writing down my thoughts.  I never actually meant for this to 
be so long!  I look forward to any feedback any of you my have about my 
various comments.  Take care my friends!  I hope to somehow see you all at 
the Extro.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

Yes, and what about when is is being used to introduce an
adjective, such as "she is beautiful"?  I thought it was
restricted to the "is of identity", but some of the examples
seem to be these modification types of statements.

I think it all depends on what the meaning of the word "is" is.

You've obviously never actually written a large-scale simulation program.
Even the simplest (from a programming perspective) approaches to uploading
will require at least hundreds of millions of lines of extremely complex
code.  That would be for a brute force molecular simulator, which would need
far more power than you estimate (~10^30 MIPS, if I remember right).

Higher-level simulations can greatly reduce the computer power needed (as
well as the volume of data), but they do so at the price of increasing
program complexity.  At the opposite end of the spectrum you arrive at
software that elegantly models the abstract processes of the mind, and would
be so big that it could never be written by humans (maybe 10^13 LOC?).

Of course, what all of this really means is simply that we software
engineers need to find better ways of creating programs.  Perhaps some
combination of evolutionary programming, advanced languages and expert
systems will allow us to write programs of the necessary scale without
running into fatal reliability problems?  At any rate, we need to get off of
our collective butts and start looking for real solutions.

Absolutely, positively right!  I wish I'd thought of that.  Yes,
absolutely.  We may *think* that there's nobody to talk to Out There,
but confirming that theory is an absolutely legitimate scientific
endeavor - the hypothesis has to be tested.

The Singularity is not a religious principle. Ergo, the idea of
extraterrestrial signals cannot be blasphemous.

No, but if you're inside a relativistic starship (or time-machine, in my
fanciful version in DREAMING DRAGONS), that's a lot of compressed sleet all
at once...  I get more and more worried about the hazard of travelling
fast. Nano streams catapulted to near c, the front-runners taking the
ablation shock (but maybe, alas, adding to it in secondaries), sounds like
maybe the only plan that's safe against wear&tear.

Untrue.  There's a higher chance of success, and success at the stated
goal is very important for encouraging further distributed projects,
something I take a tremendous interest in.  I don't care whether or not
the code gets cracked, but I do care a *lot* about whether
distributed.net succeeds.  I'm planning to use it for something.

Precisely.  Why do you think the disparity in civilizations implies that
Powers wouldn't want to communicate with us?  Because it's beneath their
dignity?  They don't HAVE dignity - they're Powers, for crying out loud!
 The question is simply whether a Power has any interest whatsoever in
the outcome of a given civilization, perhaps including whether that
civilization becomes a Power.  Better hope there's no competition Out There...

Say, *that's* an interesting thought for the rabid subjective-morality
guys on the list:  Shut down that SETI!  No!  It's too late!  The signal
has been detected and the Blight is running on the 'Net!  There's a
story here.

> > We don't begin to become interesting until the post-singularity
> > era arrives.

I don't quite think you've understood the point of the SETI project -
the main idea is to intercept extraterrestrial signals, not necessarily
to receive signals sent specifically to us.  On the other hand, it is
trivially true that bandwidth between stars (on the bands we can detect)
is scarce enough that data compression would make any message
indistinguishable from noise.  So our only hope is to intercept signals
aimed at mortal civilizations, but the point is that SETI doesn't
necessarily assume that.

Part two:  You have not proved that Powers are the only guys taking up
communications bandwidth.  Even if the probability is a thousand-to-one
that a civilization can broadcast between galaxies pre-Singularity,
that's still plenty of civilizations.

And part three, as stated:  Powers don't have dignity or social status;
why shouldn't they want to influence us?

The real reason SETI doesn't work on Powers is that if they wanted to
influence mortal cultures, they'd send out nanotech Von Neumann helpers.
 Or something more advanced, but you get the idea.

Even so, SETI may still be worth it, just on the chance of picking up
some Qeng Ho transmissions from a race that delayed.  It's just
extremely improbable.

Here we go again on the "H. P. Lovecraft - E. E. Smith" cultural myth
that knowing the awful immensity of the Real Picture will blast our
brains.  It hasn't blasted yours, and it hasn't blasted mine, so why worry?

Disagreement - a truly elegant description of the algorithms, perhaps as
instructions to genetic-algorithm "compilers" or self-modifying code,
shouldn't be using any more information than there is in our DNA:  750M, tops.

Actually, Microsoft's defects-per-LOC figures (the only comparison of code
quality that really tells you anything) are in the upper 30% of the software
industry.  The reasons why their products often seem porely written have
nothing to do with code quality - their problems lie in other areas (such as
user interface design).

However, you have definitely hit on the single biggest challenge facing the
software industry today.  Simply put, it is not possible for humans to write
100% defect-free code.  Faster computers allow you to tackle more
complicated problems, but that leads to ever-bigger programs.  As the
programs get bigger, more and more of your development effort gets diverted
into getting the number of defects down to an acceptable level.  Eventually
you reach the point where every time you fix one bug you create another, and
it becomes impossible to add new features to your program without breaking
old ones.

Judging from what data are currently available, this effect comes into play
when the number of human-generated instructions gets into the 10^7 - 10^8
LOC region.  High-level languages should therefore make it possible to write
bigger programs (because each human-entered instruction generates a lot more
machine code), but the level of abstraction in these programs is not
increasing very quickly at all.  If we want to actually be able to exploit
the processing power we're going to have in 10-20 years, we need to get to
work on this problem *now*, instead of sitting around pretending it doesn't
exist.

I suspect that the marketing people, may have used both
of our arguments as justifications/rationalizations for the delay.

The technical reasons for the delay are more complex I suspect.

I've seen some presentations on the Merced's out-of-order execution
schemes and their compilers (and since I've written compilers, I can
to some degree judge the difficulty of what they are trying to do...).
They are having a difficult time getting the compilers to work (and not
take a week to compile a program).  Since what the compilers are able
to do feeds back into the hardware architecture, you can't completely
cast the hardware in stone until the software is done.

I don't want to get into a discussion of whether this is the right
approach (the Alpha for example does much of the work in hardware).
I think in order to provide backward compatability (after all emulating
the stupid x86 architecture is going to take up real-estate that you
can't devote to a Alpha-size cache), they had to make a decision to
move some of the execution-time work done by an architecture like the
Alpha back to compile time.  Making that all come together isn't an easy job.

I would argue, that so long as Merced is saddled with an x86 emulation
burden, it will not be a cost-effective competitor to chips without
that handicap.  I feel though an un-x86ed Merced (perhaps 2003-2004?)
will be the last processor you need for 90+% of the things we now
use computers for.

That era chip *would* be the "last processor" until the IRAM
(Processor-in-Memory) chips come out to break the memory-to-processor
bottleneck.  [After all it is pretty pitiful when 70-80% of your
chip is devoted to nothing but cache!]  The people at IBM seem to
have shown this is doable with existing fabs by relaxing some of
the DRAM constraints a bit.  I suspect with the new Hitachi-Cambridge
stacked 1 transistor/1 capacitor pseudo-static memory cell, that PiM
chips done in IBM's SiGe process with copper wiring will really crank.
If you combine that Toshiba's "paper-thin chip (130-micron) packaging
you can stack these really close (though now you are back to the Cray
problem of removing the heat). Though by then we may have operational
reversible-instruction-set chip architectures that run cooler to
incorporate into the mainstream.  The only thing we are missing is a
clear demonstration of optical inter-chip wiring to handle the cache
coherence for those applications (like databases) that require it, or
those computing models that require need high inter-CPU bandwidth like
cellular-automota.

Yes, the future is clear and it seems like desktop brain-ops by 2010.
The problem will be programming the darn thing with something other
than bloatware spagetti (which is how this whole thread started out).

This seems correct.  The atmosphere functions as a pretty good shield.
However, if you wait long enough one will occur close enough to you
that the atmosphere doesn't help much.  [That is a good reason why
SIs aren't located in close proximity to us unless they are actively
defusing the larger nearby stars.  But more on that later...]

The current theories on Supernovas, I believe has them forming
as a result of gravitational waves triggering large gas cloud
compressions and bursts of large star formations.  These rapidly
evolve into supernovas.  There was something about the rotation of
the galactic arms causing such waves/star formation bursts/SNovas
at periodic intervals.  So your neighborhood may be comfortable for
quite a long period of time and then get really nasty.

There is also the theory that the Sun's orbit crossing through the
galactic plane causes the disruptions in the Oort cloud/Kuiper
Belt that then results in increased bombardment for short periods.

Plus you have the problem of stars randomly orbiting close to our
solar system causing orbital disruptions.  Think about all
those stars with those big planets in very strange orbits...

So in the "windows of opportunity" you need to evolve to the point
where you can anticipate, plan for and survive these catastrophes.

There were several articles in JBIS regarding the problems of high
velocity travel back when people seriously considered things like
this.  A simple little H-atom packs a heck of a lot of energy at .99c.
The particles are difficult to deflect and really do a number on any
nanomachinery.  Sure you can stick a big Tungsten shield out front
but that makes your starship/nanoprobe heavy and drives up your
acceleration costs.  Ignoring the fact that all that energy you spend
to get to those high speeds could better have been spent "thinking" while
you were going slow.

I believe Robert Freitas is planing to do a more in-depth analysis
of the radiation damage problem on nanomachinery in Volume II
of Nanomedicine (expanding significantly on Eric's rather brief
treatment).  Unfortunately we will have to wait a year or two to
get it.

I just finished a novel that may be of interest to subscribers: "Songs From 
the Stars" by Norman Spinrad (who also brought us "Bug Jack Barron," one of 
the few intelligent novels about cryonic suspension around).  "Songs" begins 
as a sort of "dubious utopia" novel, but escalates into something bolder and 
more cerebral.  It has an overall transhumanist aesthetic and some clever 
riffs on pop culture.

Natasha Vita More mentioned in an unrelated post that she was not, for the 
most part, influenced by science fiction.  As an avid sf reader, I find this 
interesting.  Could you elaborate on your influences?  Sf has always 
functioned as a sort of memetic fountainhead for me; transhumanism came along 
as a very happy coincidence...though not entirely as a surprise.

One problem. Our DNA code only describes a human infant given a human adult.

A) The genetic code doesn't describe the human adult required to "compile" the
DNA.

B) A human infant isn't even a human adult. As I understand it, a human infant IS
hardwired to learn LOTS of environmental stuff very quickly, but you need the
description of the whole environment, as well, as (presumably) human quality
agents already in the environment.

This is the major problem, that the development of a mind from infant to human
quality requires existing human quality minds.

Piaget established reasonably firmly that human infants, at various stages up to
about 7-8 years, are not merely less knowledgeable adults, but their brains (basic
operations like perception, causal analysis) work in completely different ways
then adults. To describe an adult brain with adult knowledge/perceptual structures
probably requires a lot more data then to describe an infant's mind, which (as I
understand it) is array upon array of undifferentiated "learning" structures.

Software layering (or modularity) surely does a lot of work to combat this.
If you can build a layer of software that uses a lower level, adds value,
and is bug-free (possible with enough effort when working on a finite sized
level), you have firm ground on which to build. The only problem is that, as
you add layers, the replacement cost grows.

This is closely related to the higher-level language argument above, in that
each layer of services provides more functionality that the existing
languages can access, at increasing levels of abstraction. So your 3/4 GL
today looks a lot higher level than your 3/4 GL did 10 years ago. I would
argue that in some practical sense, abstraction is increasing strongly, just
not at the level of pure languages. Rather, the OS and all layers on top
must be included. Paradoxically, this means that as you get more "abstract",
you are also bound to more and more arbitrary technologies.

As the overall complexity grows in your total system, the number of layers
increases, which means that you are increasingly bound to the layers in
which you have already invested. This is because it would just take too much
time & money to replace those layers. Once, you might have built your own OS
from scratch for a special purpose task. Now, not only are you usually bound
to a particular OS, you are bound to layers and layers of software on top of
that (ODBC? COM? Winsocks? X-many others).

The trend increases toward choosing an OS, a set of APIs, protocols,
protocols on protocols on protocols, and sticking with them. It's the only
way we can manage the complexity of our desired systems, and must become
more and more prevalent. This will lead to worse homogenisation of the IT
world, and more of the monoculture problems we are getting (catastrophic
effects from bugs, viruses, worms, crackers, monopolies, etc...)

What can we do to get on top of this?

Build AIs that can take over the job.

Then arm yourself for bear and head for the hills.

Don't think so, boss. It has been predicted before, several times 
in fact. It regularly doesn't happen. Why don't we still use 
PETs, apple ]['s or CP/M boxen? Ah, but you can't do multimedia 
with 6502/Z80s. Similiarly, you can't do realtime neural DSP with 
the Merced, no Sir.

In fact not only pitiful, but really *insane*. But for whatever
strange reason, people still think Silicon Valley is populated by
rational Spock-like types instead of mad hatter tinkerers. Low-fat 
computing isn't exactly popular -- all hail to investment protection.

A wafer-integrated CAM implemented with that process, ah, that would
be wonderful. Let your compiler crank out VHDL which get translated in 
virtual circuitry. I doubt the emulation would be much slower than the 
real thing, and you could always reconfigger the thing dynamicaly
whenever the needs change.

Some of the heat comes from driving I/O to the outside world. Dump
motherboards, dump packaging & things suddenly start running faster &
cooler.

The reversible stuff is especially suitable for CAMs. It is extremely
tedious building a practical reversible CPU, and we're many orders of
magnitude away where the effects will start to show. At molecular
scale, on the other hand...

But CAM don't require high inter-CPU bandwidth, that's the chiefest
beauty of them. Volume/surface scaling ratio. With current grain sizes 
you can comfortably run a CAM code on a pile of PCs with wimpy
networking matrix.

        It is interesting.  I, too, am not primarily influenced by science
fiction.  That is not to say that I haven't read quite a few sf novels, but
their overall effect on how I live my life is quite minimal.  The two
exceptions are David Zindell's quartet, and Neal Stephenson's _The Diamond
Age_.  My influences come from reading about new breakthroughs and studies
which are actually being done.  Conceptual progress is a fabulous thing...
particularly for those new to transhumanism, but actualized progress is far
more preferable in my mind.  It is an exciting time to be alive.

This looks very interesting and I can see that a lot of work has gone into
it.  I feel that there are a couple of problemw right now though.

The main one is that the topics on which we are asked to comment lack
definitions.  There appears to be room for a topic description, but many
or most of the topics don't have one.

In some cases this is OK: "AI (Human-Equivalent)" and "Computer Speed
(1 GigaFLOPS)" are pretty clear.  But for others it is not clear what
is meant: "Enhanced Reality", "Haptic Interfaces", "Agency Management"
are ambiguous or confusing.  Is "Expectation of Immortality" when I
expect immortality to be achieved, or when the population as a whole
comes to expect that immortality will someday be possible?

We are invited to attach comments to the topic title on each page, and
that might be a place where someone could offer a straw man definition
of each concept which would help other readers to make consistent
predictions.  I was concerned about the details of the technology,
though, since there are two occurances of "Enhanced Reality" on the page
for that topic: the title string at the top, but also the list of all
computer related topics at the left.  Is there a need to put in context
information to make sure that our comments get put in the right place?

In terms of the dates, it might be nice if there were <2000 and >2020
options so that we can record that we don't think the events will occur
in that time frame.

There seem to be somewhat over 100 topics, which spreads participants
pretty thinly unless you get a lot of participation.  I know you hope to
do so, but it makes it harder to generate a critical mass of commentary
that will invite others to participate.

Despite these issues, this looks like a great project. I'll jump in and
try to make a few comments, and hopefully others will do so as well.

I couldn't agree more!  I honestly think my generation (I'm 23) will be one 
of the first to reap the benefits of some of the staggeringly complex 
biomedical leaps that are in the works.  My taste in science fiction has 
changed (not "matured," by any means) from an interest in hard science to 
more "literary" sf (whatever the hell that means).

"The Diamond Age" is a fabulous book about a future that I can actually see 
happening.  "Holy Fire" by Bruce Sterling is another with this quality (which 
is rarer than some might think).  Other "hard" sf novels that have seeded me 
with progressive ideas: "Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson, "Timescape" by 
Gregory Benford, "Childhood's End" by Arthur C. Clarke, "Sterling's 
"Schismatrix"...these are books that seethe with thought-food--and they're of 
"literary" quality to boot.

Lately I've been reading a lot of J.G. Ballard.  Steve Erickson 
("Amnesiascope") is another author with an appropriately millennial 
perspective.

Sagan's "Cosmos" turned me on to popular science writing more than any other 
single book; now I read a great deal of nonfiction on science/culture.  One 
of the best I've read recently is Mark Dery's "Escape Velocity."  Alex 
Heard's "Apocalypse Pretty Soon" follows a similar theme (and it's 
hilarious), though it equates cryonics and transhumanism as some form of 
misguided millennial hysteria.  At least that's what I got out of Heard's 
commentary; I'm willing to forgive him, as his book is quite blatantly a 
personal take on things, and he makes no real attempt to speak on behalf of 
"reason" for all of us.

If the other guys' code bombs more often than Microshaft's, the much
worser for the industry. Nowadays I'm doing most of my stuff in XEmacs, 
simply because it almost never crashes. GC rules -- unfortunately
languages with true GC haven't hit the mainstream yet -- after all,
it's just a fairly recent invention, the second-oldest HLL in
existance after Fortran. It is really amusing to see how much 
vogues/religions dominate the industry. An operating system from 
the beginning of the 70s, developed and peddled by political 
zealots, eats a commercial early-90s OS alive, how amusing. Not. 
If this is the best we can do shortly before way too kay (another 
blazing beacon of monkey incompetence), god help us.

The obvious solution would seem to dispense with brittleware
altogether. Gracefully failing systems suffering smooth performance 
degradation instead of catastrophic failure. Of course the IT 
industry would then have to admit the SantaFe people are not all 
freaks on acid -- which is tough to face. Also, it is somewhat 
late to throw half a century of IT traditions away and start from 
scratch. Taking lessons from squishware? God, I'd rather shoot myself.

Strangely, the awareness for this among programmers is not at all
widespread. Another bunch to be put to the wall when the revolution
comes.

Haven't games been driving desktop PC hardware for the last 15 years at

For the average consumer the office apps are pretty similar to what they've

I was estimating the effort required to write the program in C++, or some
other language at a similar level of abstraction.  Obviously the way out of
the trap is move to a higher-level description of the program.

However, reducing something of this complexity to a manageable amount of
code is going to require extremely high levels of abstraction.  I can reduce
human-written LOC by about an order of magnitude by moving from C++ to a
modern high-level language, and I can maybe get the another factor of 20-50
out of special-purpose code generators.  To get much beyond that we have to
start inventing new techniques, which is what I think should be a major
research focus of software engineering for the immediate future.

I would expect, BTW, that reaching the information density of DNA will take
several levels of abstraction beyond what you suggest.  DNA is best compared
to a program that modifies itself, the rules of the language it is written
in, and the architecture of the machine that it runs on, all at the same
time.  It seems to me that unfolding a strange loop like that into a simple
hierarchy, as we would have to do in order to get a useable programming
language, would require imbedding a near-sentient degree of intelligence
into the programming tools. Since we can't code an AI of that complexity by
hand, we're back to needing to build the tools to build the tools to build
the tools.

Which would simply be an invigorating challenge, if only our industry wasn't
so dominated by people who are content with languages that are older than
they are...

Of course you build your code with gracefull error handling.  That's
assumed - otherwise you'll never break 10^6 LOC with anything useable.  In
the end it can't save you from the fundamental problem, however.  Your error
handling code will also have bugs, and so will the meta-error-handling code,
and so on ad infinitum.  Meanwhile, all that error-handling code is also
making your programs bigger, slower, and more prone to really subtle errors
that are especially hard to fix.

The only big breakthroughs that have ever been made on this front are based
on the idea of getting some automated mechanism to generate part of the code
for you.  Even then there aren't any magic wonder cures.  The compilers,
code generators, expert systems and whatnot also have to be debugged after
all, and they tend to be far more complex than ordinary code.  So we move
forward one small step at a time, and meanwhile the hardware guys are racing
away from us.

Title
  Dietary L-arginine reduces
  the progression of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits: comparison
  with lovastatin.
Source
  Circulation.  96(4):1282-90, 1997 Aug 19.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We investigated whether L-arginine induces
  regression of preexisting atheromatous lesions and reversal of endothelial
  dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbits, whether similar effects can be
  obtained by cholesterol-lowering therapy with lovastatin, and which mechanism
  leads to these effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rabbits were fed 1% cholesterol
  for 4 weeks and 0.5% cholesterol for an additional 12 weeks. Two groups of
  cholesterol-fed rabbits were treated with L-arginine (2.0%
  in drinking water) or lovastatin (10 mg/d) during weeks 5 through 16.
  Systemic nitric oxide (NO) formation was assessed as the urinary excretion
  rates of nitrate and cGMP in weekly intervals. Cholesterol feeding
  progressively reduced urinary nitrate excretion to approximately 40% of
  baseline (P<.05) and increased plasma concentrations of asymmetrical
  dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous NO synthesis inhibitor.
  Dietary L-arginine reversed the reduction
  in plasma L-arginine/ADMA ratio and partly restored urinary
  excretion of nitrate and cGMP (each P<.05 vs cholesterol) but did not change
  plasma cholesterol levels. L-Arginine completely blocked the
  progression of carotid intimal plaques, reduced aortic intimal thickening,
  and preserved endothelium-dependent vasodilator function. Lovastatin
  treatment reduced plasma cholesterol by 32% but did not improve urinary
  nitrate or cGMP excretion or endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Lovastatin
  had a weaker inhibitory effect on carotid plaque formation and aortic intimal
  thickening than L-arginine. L-Arginine
  inhibited but lovastatin potentiated superoxide radical generation in the
  atherosclerotic vascular wall. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary
  L-arginine improves NO-dependent vasodilator function in
  cholesterol-fed rabbits and completely blocks the progression of plaques via
  restoration of NO synthase substrate availability and reduction of vascular
  oxidative stress. Lovastatin treatment has a weaker inhibitory effect on the
  progression of atherosclerosis and no effect on vascular NO elaboration,
  which may be due to its stimulatory effect on vascular superoxide radical
  generation.

It certainly won't involve any such thing as "hundreds of millions of
lines of extremely complex code" -- what for?. Artificial reality
renderers with VRML7? Navier-Stokes surf? Finite-element skyskrapers?
Alias Wavefront Construction, Ltd? Industrial Light & Magic
Landscaping? Get real.

Nobody will be programming as we know it 20..30 years downstream 
anyway. I'm sure that one needs not to submit fitness functions in a
formal language. May RSI go the way of the silicosis. Good riddance. 

 > far more power than you estimate (~10^30 MIPS, if I remember right).
 
I've never said you'd need to run an upload at molecular dynamics
level -- that would be utterly impractical.

The code complexity is not a function of system size. Large-scale
isn't counted in number of lines, obviously. With embarrasingly 
parallel codes you just add nodes -- the code remains the same. 
For instance, a MPI cellular automaton code distributed over
homogenous nodes aligned on a 3d lattice scales _strictly 
linearly_ to infinite amount of nodes (and comfortably fits onto 
a single page of C -- see "How to Build a Beowulf", MIT Press). 
It is just that hardware reliability becomes an issue with more 
than a few hundred/thousands nodes. With spatial mapping of the 
simulation volume to nodes the failure of a single node would 
be equivalent to a pinpoint hemorrhage. With cells made from 
molecular components radiation damage would do no worse than it 
does to the real thing. The pattern restructures itself 
dynamically to compensate for damage. After the cumulative 
damage renders further operation uneconomical swap out the 
state, install a new module and load it back.

I can't agree fully, but can't disagree either. HashLife sure runs
many orders of magnitude faster/can handle much larger universes than
the same thing coded by zombies. Hashlife needs big lookups, which
makes grains large -- which doesn't pay in a relativistic
context. Also, Life rules are special. It's not an EoC automaton.

What makes you think you can collapse what the brain does in "elegant
models"? The brain isn't elegant, it's messy. There are lots of grand
claims coming from Moravec/Minsky that the wetware is really
inefficient, and you can collapse lots of circuitry into a few lines
of code. Well, neuroscience doesn't seem to think so. Let's upload a
nematode, and then we'll see how detail do we need. A 1 k DSP cluster
is probably sufficient for C. elegans.

Agreed, but the awareness for the problem is very spotty at
best. Changes in the IT landscape take decades to propagate. People

Of course, all of this is opinion.  I can't even *prove* that

At least until they get an operational quantum computer

Well, I'll agree that the results aren't going to be
either surprising or disappointing.

I can't "say for sure" that we won't get blown to bits by
a near-earth crossing asteroid tomorrow morning.  All I can
do is argue that it is very unprobable and construct my life
around that premise.  The people doing SETI@home, IMHO,
are doing a lot of work with a poor apreciation for the 
very low probability of success.  Which to my mind is sad
because with a little work we could move forward on multiple
fronts instead of only one.

> In fact you can't even be
> completely sure that there are even any SIs in this universe.

True, but I can sift a body of evidence and create a reasonable
argument that the number of SIs hugely outweighs the number
of nearby civilizations at our level.

Some of this evidence would include:
  (a) 90% of the mass in the galaxy is "missing".
  (b) The gravitational microlensing researchers have done simulations
      based on their *observed* frequency of gravitational microlensing
      events and postulate there are *400 billion* objects with
      masses averaging 0.3 Solar masses they *can't see* orbiting
      our galaxy.  That is about 2x the number of stars that we can see.
  (c) Astronomers looking at other galaxies don't see the number
      of Red giant stars they expect.  In some cases there seems
      to be evidence of an IR "glow" (which they attribute to dust).
  (d) Kardashev and a couple of other Russian astronomers have gone
      through the IRAS data (the best infrared survey data we have
      so far) and have discovered some interesting anomalies in
      the directional distribution of "cold" objects around our galaxy.
  (e) The stars in the galactic halo in globular clusters are very
      low in metal (meaning they are very old, perhaps older than
      the best estimates of the age of the universe -- or that they
      may be the leftovers from SI metal extracting mining operations).
  (f) M-brain architectures (layered supercomputers surrounding stars)
      seem to be optimal computing architectures for many problems
      and have heat emission signatures that are very difficult to
      detect using current technologies.

So taking Ockham's Razor, which of the following would you choose:
  (1) That the longest lived "entities" in the galaxy will be
      technological civilizations that have evolved to the limits
      allowed by *known* physics (which as far as I can tell are
      something like M-brains).
  (2) That the galactic halo consists of strange "concentrations"
      of brown dwarfs orbiting small black holes (one proposed
      explanation using "known" astronomical objects without any
      theory as to how such things came to be formed).
  (3) That the galactic halo is composed of mysterious "new" particles
      (WIMPs) that explain at least (a) and (b) above?

Since SETI has been unsuccsessful so far, people have argued
for lowering the frequencies for some of the Drake Eqn parameters.
Some prefer to mess with f_l (evolving life), some with f_i
(intelligent life), or f_c (communicative life) but then you
always end up arguing that we shouldn't exist and you are
bucking the trends in current findings in astronomy & biology.

As we ourselves provide evidence that most of the parameters
in the Drake equation lead to the development of intelligent,
communicative "technological civilizations" (TCs) and doing
*any* SETI work assumes there are at least 2 TCs, then, one
is really concerned with the final "L" parameter of the equation:
  "the mean Lifetime TC's are in a "communicative state".

Given the FERMI Paradox ("I see no aliens") and the lack of SETI success
lots of handwaving has to be done to explain why TC's pass out of a
communicative state.

So lets examine this with the "UFE" (Universal Fatality Equation):
  Pa = the probability a civilization is knocked out by an Accident
       (asteroid, comet, blazar, supernova, etc.) and stays knocked out
  Pd = the probability that a civilization De-evolves or decays away
       (i.e. once you have evolved survival and preservation instincts
        and intelligence, somehow you "lose" them; this might include
        losing an interest in space.)
  Pn = the probability of *No* nanotechnology (even after thousands of
       years of R&D)
  Ps = the probability of permanent Stagnation (either environmentally-
       or self-imposed) at some "level of growth" beneath the limits
       imposed by physics (your material/energy limits)

Now, if Pa + Pd + Pn + Ps = 1 for *all* technological civilizations
that have ever evolved (in billions of years of galactic history),
then:

  No technological civilization in our galaxy has ever evolved to the
  limits imposed by known physics -- i.e. No SIs.

This is a the inversion of (1) above.  There are some interesting
interactions in this equation, because as you reduce Pa or Pd,
you probably increase Pn which in turn may reduce Ps.  Of course
one can argue that an increased Pn causing a singularity of
the grey goo type increases Pa, but you have to argue it for
all civilizations.

[I'm open to suggestions on how to improve the UFE.]

Unless you argue a very low level of TCs (which makes SETI@home
kind of silly), or for the universal application of the UFE,
then I don't think you can escape the evolution of SIs.
If even a single SI evolved more than ~100,000 years ago,
then you have to accept that our galaxy should theoretically be at
Kardashev Type III Civilization level (i.e. extensively developed).
Sagan and other showed many years ago that even using "current-level"
technologies, interstellar travel is feasible.  That means that
whole-galaxy colonization is possible and would occur in short
time periods (millions of years).  Nanoprobe colonization managed
by SIs makes it happen much faster.

Why hasn't everything been colonized?  If you take (a-e) above, it
would appear that most of it *has* been colonized.  Whether SIs
do in fact colonize (or whether many or all SIs evolve locally)
and whether they fight over resources remain interesting questions.

Why do we still see stars? My best explanations to date is that the
central part of the galaxy isn't a very safe place to be (black holes,
blazars, supernovas, etc.) and its simply not worth the time and
energy trying to keep the garden weeded.  The other possibility
is along the lines that Greg has proposed which kind of evolves
from John Ball's "Zoo hypothesis", which is that perhaps the
centers of galaxies (with all of their natural "hazards")
are used for cultural/meme breeding grounds.  Or perhaps after
billions of years of existence and consuming a majority of the
available matter/energy SIs have just lost interest in it.
Or it may be the least expensive way to breed an increasing
supply of materials that can be used to store their prodigious
memories.

So lets fit the observationional data to the theories --

Either
- They are here watching everything we say and do (because
  nanotechnology seems within the laws of physics *and* nanotechnology
  allows this level of "spying" undetected by us.  Since they
  haven't "contacted" us it isn't because they aren't able,
  it is because they have reasons for not doing so.
or
- They aren't here and are simply content to watch us from afar.
  (Because they certainly have the observing capacity to continuously
   monitor the development of our planet.)
or
- They are completely disinterested in us -- we are beneath the nematodes.

Now, it would appear that the development time for a technological
civilization from the pre-radio stage to the post-singularity stage
is ~100 years on a planet similar to ours.  In the post-singularity
stage, you don't communicate with "broadcast" radio-waves -- you
communicate with tightly focused high power lasers aimed directly
at the person you want to talk with (presumably another SI) because
you then have the technology to find them and directed optical
communication provides the highest bandwidth at the lowest energy cost.
It is worth noting that this idea is slowly catching on in the SETI
community and there have been several conferences devoted to Optical SETI.

So, for the SETI@home project to work, as has been suggested, by
"evesdropping" on similar level civilizations, they would have to
be within ~100 light years of us.  If they are beyond that their
signals would have already passed us by.  If you plug the number
of Earth-like planet supporting stars in 100 cubic light years
into the Drake equation (rather than the number of stars in the
galaxy) then your probability of success gets very small.  It
is also true that the calculations on the power levels required
(for a continuous omnidirectional signal) require a level of
civilization that we won't reach for some 10's of years.  So
the detection "non-intentional" signals from a civilization like
ours is limited to something like 10-20 light-years, further
lowering your Drake Equation probability.  Once you get to the
level of civilization where you can send a high-power signal
omnidirectionally (or have sufficiently good telescopes that
you can see planets where someone might be listening for
a low power directional signal) you are very near the
singularity boundary.  For us, NASA may get the "Terrestrial
Planet Finder" spacecraft up around 2010 *iff* they stay
on the current proposed schedule.   So if we use our own
civilization as a benchmark, we might have the power and/or
know where to send a signal by perhaps 2020.  That looks
to be to be pretty close to singularity time.

I will acknowledge that using our civilization as a predictor
for development paths of other civilizations is a really poor
statistical exercise, but its the best we can do at this point.

So, when I go through all this stuff carefully, I reach the
conclusion that SETI@home will not work and people have just
been hoodwinked.  Now, this is being done by people who don't
know about nanotech, don't really understand computer (and
therefore SI) architectures, and who would be shocked by
concepts such as "uploading".  I'm not against them, I plan
to educate them and perhaps if I'm lucky change a few minds.

However, this is the Extropian forum, so I feel pretty
comfortable telling the people here (who are aware of
the afore mentioned concepts), that you are being really
silly if you think this will work.

No, the 2MASS data is available.  They have released part
of it in a very compressed form.  However, you would have
to write the application yourself to compute the black body
radiation curves from the data (not very difficult I believe).

The question is whether you have "thinking" time to spend
on it or just "computer" time.  If you have just computer
time there isn't any game other than SETI@home.  But to
my mind you should put the SETI@home computers in suspend mode
and donate the value of the electricity saved to an organization
that can pay someone to write a competing application to do
an analysis of the 2MASS data.  That is because the 2MASS
data *will* produce interesting things, though due to
the frequencies they use in ground observations, I would
say the probability for SIs, unless they are nearby, is low.
Though not as low as SETI@home because there are potentially
many more long-lived SIs than nearby life-supporting planets.
in their radio-communications stage.

After they start releasing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data
in a couple of years the Sloan data and the 2MASS data
combined will give you I think 8 data points to compute the
temperature of each object.  Then there will be plenty of work
for all the computers we can lay our hands on.  We will still
however be limited because to get the frequencies where
the cold SIs are the brightest (and therefore most detectable
at a distance) requires a space-based survey.  NASA and ESA
are working on such spacecraft but I don't think they go up
until after 2005 and even then I suspect the data will be
difficult for us to get for a while.]

First you have to get the SETI people to see the possibility,
and since they have been at this for nearly 35 years in
the face of virtually no results, it is going to take some
*strong* arguments to shake their "faith".

I'm only at the beginning of this road and didn't realize that
the 2MASS data was available until about a week ago.  I strongly
agree that the distributed computing model is a great way to
go for astronomy research as well as promoting interest in
space.  What I'm dissing on is the fact that the SETI people
gloss over some of the details (like the transmitter power
requirements) that make people think the probability for
aliens that we can communicate with is >> 1 instead of << 1.
You never hear about these things unless you delve into
the literature in some detail.

> Let me know when you

It will be September at least before I have a chance to talk to
people.  What I'm going to try to do (given this discussion) is see
if I can convince the SETI@home people to talk to the 2MASS people.

"I see her as beautiful" - in this case E-Prime makes sense, since her
beauty is subjective and related to the interaction between me and
her.

Overall, "is of identity" is likely the thing to watch out most
for. Going "is-hunting" can improve a text, just as removing "quite"
and passive forms.

No way, they can't even draw this conclusion. They make the unbelieveable
assumption that any similarly or more advanced civilisation will be using
radio waves on a large scale (Like us). I'd like to know why everyone's so
sure of the characteristics of entities we know squat about.

Indeed. As an almost complete non-believer in extraterrestrial intelligence, 
I have little doubt that seti@home will find absolutely no signals from them.
However, until we look we can't be sure; perhaps we've been lucky (or unlucky!)
enough to reach this level within a few decades of a similar society a few
tens of light years away and will find them, but if not we'll at least know
that there's no-one at that level out there at this time. That is, of itself, 
a worthwhile justification for running the software on one of my PCs rather 
than yet another crypto-crack.

Hal, thanks for your (as usual) thoughtful comments.  From a busy morning at 
work, I only have time for a quick response for now.  We know that many if 
not most of the subjects lack specific defnitions and, you're right, there's 
a blank space on the specific development pages for such a definition.  We 
simply ran out of time after having run into some (as usual) unanticipated 
glitches and needed to get the site up if we were to have time to collect any 
comments before EXTRO4.  So your suggestion is most welcome that definitions 
become themselves a good subject for commentary through Crit.

The large number of categories is intentional.  It's not expected that any 
one person would comment on ALL of them.  In fact, my personal hope is that 
the large number will get folks to comment most on those subject matters 
where they either have a lot of knowledge or expertise or particularly strong 
opinions or, hopefully, both.

Please do stop by the project site

          http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm

and help us out by making as many comments as you can!  Some instructions 
from my previous post about tagging comments with CritLink follow my sig 
below.

For now, all commentary should be through Foresight's Crit Link system.  
Links in the Timeline web pages will lead you to Crit's view of the site and 
give you access to the Crit tools for inserting your comments, ideas and 
projections into the project.  General comments on the specific developments 
can be tagged essentially anywhere in the text of the page or to the page as 
a whole.  

Our goal of collecting specific projections for dates or ranges of dates when 
a development will become possible, available, common or ubiquitous requires 
a little care using Crit Link.  To tag a comment to a particular year in the 
timeline tables you will find at the individual development pages, it is 
necessary to paste in the particular year in the "target phrase" area and THE 
TEXT FROM THE WHOLE LINE OF YEARS into the "optional context phrase".  Thus, 
to tag a comment that you believe the development "Software Agents as 
Autonomous Actors" will be "Common" by the year 2020, you should paste the 
text from the year cell for that point ("2020 - C") into the "target phrase" 
Crit field and the text from the whole line for the year 2020 ("2020 - P 2020 
- A 2020 - C 2020 - U") into the "optional target phrase".  Although this 
seems a little kludgey, Crit requires the second step in order to have enough 
context to "know" where to place its meta-tag.  Because Crit will open a new 
window for the commenting process, it's easy to flip back and forth between 
the project site and the Crit commentary page to grab the text you need to 
properly tag your comment.

We are also looking for feedback on improving the categories.  An example is 
battery technology.  None of us in the group that developed the site knew 
enough to come up with a good metric for developments in this area, so we 
only have an item called "Advanced Batteries".  If you can offer a refinement 
of an existing category such as this one, or a wholly new category that we've 
missed, use the links available at the site to make these kinds of helpful 
suggestions.

I thought "Songs from the Stars" was one of the most well-thought-out SF 
novels I'd read up to that point and would still recommend it today.  
Question: Has anyone considered that the basic technological idea behind 
Sagan's "Contact" seemed lifted pretty much in toto from "Songs"?

It does, and for that reason some people have experimented with the E-choice 
dialect, in which one attempts to avoid the 'is' of identity while retaining
the helping-verb uses of 'to be.'

However, even in E-choice I would say, "I find her beautiful" to emphasize 
the idea that beauty arises from an interaction, rather than a fixed property 
of a person or thing.

This weekend I saw the South Park movie, and the scene where the General has
some problems with Windows 98 and takes out his frustrations on Bill Gates was
rather hilarious. I saw the movie in Hanover, NH, where Dartmouth College is (a
big Apple user and supporter), and the audience sustained a standing ovation for
the General's actions for an extended period.....

I've seen a great many 'ufo' videos, as one ufo group in the UK was truly
interested in technical expertise and not ignorant buffoonery as is seen on
tabloid tv. I've even seen a video of the purported triangular ufos seen in
europe, as well as the video of the formation of those lights over Phoenix. All I
have seen is consistent with normal military air operations and current state of
the art in known propulsion technologies, with the singular exceptions being
'ufo's which are obviously lense flares and other optical phenomena.

Show me some crash debris or other usable proof. I have not seen to date anything
which would support such hypotheses. Don't get me wrong. I would truly love it if
we are being visited, but the proof is not there.

You will, of course, also be factoring the hidden costs of photovoltaics
into electrical production? I don't know enough about current technology,
but traditionally solar cell production has used highly toxic chemicals
and more power than the cells ever produced in their lifetime.

What else would they be using? Smoke signals? Imagine that, a smoke signal based
internet! oo oo, How about using sonic signalling through the ocean?

Get real. Unless they are using only closed circuit sytems like
fiber-optic/co-axial/twisted pair copper, No radio satellite uplinks (optical
will only be usable in clear weather for high bandwidth), no broadcast tv or
AM/FM or shortwave, then they will be emitting radio signals if they are a
technological civilization. If they are only space based, and only use tight
beam laser communications, they might slip through.

Wouldn't this show up *very* clearly on all gravity wave detectors
across the world? After all, the curvatures involved would be on the
orders of kilometers, which equates to stellar masses.

Not if the vehicle were a few dozen meters across. However I have thought of a vehicle
which could behave as UFO's are described, and entirely within current physics. The
entire vehicle would be a mass of nanites that are formed into the saucer shape for
aerodynamic and stealth purposes. The core of the vehicle might be a usable crew cabin,
but the rest is a dense type of utility fog, where the nanites can form a honeycomb of
capillaries in the desired direction of travel/propulsion. The nanites will impell
individual air molecules through the capillaries to high velocities. Using this sort of
jet propulsion through most of the cross section of the vehicle will reduce or
eliminate shock waves. Once into space, they can form into either light sails or
magsails, with the ability to store and expend energy borrowed from the orbital
momentum of stars themselves around the galaxy (which after billions of years of use
would cause them to fall far enough inward to crunch into the central black hole) via
use of their electromagnetic fields and a smart use of slingshot orbital mechanics. A
simple fission thermal system could be used to maintain a magneto hydrodynamic system
to maintain the magsail into interstellar space.

Well, of course- a human infant is an AI seed, of sorts.  Dependent

Uplifting ourselves without a patron race around to help will be

Carl Sagan has been an enormous influence on my thinking.  _The Demon
Haunted World: Science As A Candle In The Dark_ is a book I refer to often.
 Most of my reading early on had been biographies and autobiographies and
Herman Hesse, Anais Nin, Gertrude Stein, Ayn Rand, Simon de Bouvoire, Oscar
Wilde, Georgia O'Keefe, etc.  This gave me a foundation for life and
values. Reading John Naisbitt, Alvin Toffler and FM-2030 gave me insight
into the future.  Knowing Timothy Leary and reading Wilson and Grujieff
gave me a spin. That spin is quite integral to my thinking.  

It wasn't until my 40s that I really took the time to read science fiction
and fortunately I had a mentor of Max More to make suggestions to me.
Interestingly enough, much of the ideas in the SF books I had already been
aware of, and many of the ideas had already sprouted in my art.  In fact,
my art back in the 70s (video/film performances a paintings) were extremely
transhumanist - dealing with evolution and the blurring of the lines of
gender, space, human-machine blending.

Regarding Alex's book, speak to him directly about it.  I personally didn't
feel slighted in it, although I would have preferred a *different*
approach.  I would have preferred that he didn't link me only to cryonics
and Timothy Leary as a hype, but focused on my art and extropians more deeply.

I'll have to agree with Rob here.  Defect-free software that does
its job is *not* the same as elegant software that does its job *well*.
I.e. carefully controlled brute force may get the job done and you
may say "gee thats impressive", but it won't have you saying
"that is really sweet or sexy".  Now I've been able to observe
what happens when you take simple systems and make them do
a better job (from an efficiency viewpoint).  They typically
get bigger, because you have to handle all of the special cases
that arise [I'm thinking of DBMS buffer management or query
optimization specifically].  If continued, that reaches a point
where you trip over the cliff into so much code that it *will*
contain defects or code so complex that nobody but the person
who wrote it can deal with it.

Since the discussion started out as bloatware spagetti, and since
Windows 2000 is upwards of 35 million lines of code (according to
what I've heard), then I believe it would classify as "bloated".

The only two systems that I've heard about that may have/been are
bigger are:
  (a) The ill-fated IRS computer system replacement
  (b) The code that will run the space station (which is very scarey).

Does any one have a ref. for the largest software systems ever constructed?
(And what happened to them?)

Now, whether or not those 35 million lines of code make windows
more efficient, or simply make it more bloated or are 30 million lines
of device drivers or are just symptomatic of Microsoft's creeping
featurism remains unclear to me.  As I recall the original versions
of UNIX (V6 & V7) were split about 50-50 between the size of code
in the device drivers and the size of code in the actual kernel.
Does anyone know whether the same remains true of Linux?
How does the size of X-windows compare with the size of a kernel
(code-wise)?

Is one of the problems dragging down the software industry the
fact that competitive hardware manufacturers designing "private"
interfaces leads to bloated software due to the requirement for
software interface "layers" to abstract away from the details of
dealing with the device?

Following this back to uploading, then the bloatware results
from the interfaces, which means the software that runs your
mind will be small, but the "Universal Translator Software"
may be huge (and potentially very buggy due to the requirement
for many special cases).  All of this means that we will still
require lawyers to "guarantee" that "what I agreed to" is
"what I said" and "what I said is" "what I meant".

... the sound of wails and gnashing of teeth and the beating of
heads against hard objects is heard in the background....

	Yes, that's right. They must be using a fiber-optic/co-axial XTMII
dobblewhop, cos what with us humans being aware of every conceivable
communication technology possible in this universe, we can safely predict
that all capable civilisations use a load of radio waves like us. And
definitely use mathematics and logic compatible with our own paradigms
(another one that makes me laugh). Silly me.

	PS I'm not saying that other civilisations definitely do not use
radio, I'm merely stating that the guy making the statement at the head of
this message cannot make the assumption he does with the evidence he has. We
don't know what more advanced aliens use, even the tech stuff dreamed up for
"star trek" didn't have anyone using standard radio waves, they used
sub-space signals and stuff.......

That's possible, but manufacturing silicon wafers is not exactly a 
low-energy industry, and certainly when I was looking at solar power for
laptops a few years ago efficiencies were very low.

Quantum computers threaten cryptography in two known ways, so far.
They greatly speed up factoring and the related problem of finding
discrete logs, which are the basis for the standard public key
cryptography algorithms in wide use today.  They also accelerate
key search for "conventional" secret-key ciphers like DES, so that
you need to use twice the key lengths that you would otherwise.

This second attack is not too troublesome, in that we can solve it by
going to larger keys.  This is why the in-development Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) specifies keys up to 256 bits in size.  The only reason
to use such large keys is in case quantum computers work, in which case
they would then have the equivalent strength to 128 bit keys today,
which is extremely strong.

The first attack, against public key cryptography, would be a larger
problem.  RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve variants would all be hit,
and it is not clear that going to larger keys would help.  However,
there are some alternative public key systems which are not used much
today but which might be practical.  There were a number of systems
devised in the early days of PKC based on the knapsack problem, most of
which were broken; I think the last remaining variant fell last year.
But perhaps with some further looking this method could be brought back.
There is also a system from McEliece based on coding theory, which
has very cumbersome keys but uses different mathematical principles.
Some Chinese groups have worked on finite automata based public key
systems but I don't know much about them.

So if large quantum computers become practical, researchers do have a
few alternatives to fall back on.  They have not generally been well
studied though so no doubt there would be many cracks and new systems
developed as people focus on these areas.  In the end I imagine that
it would still be possible to use cryptography as we have it today,
but it would be more expensive and difficult.

Rob is correct, the light bulb regarding optical SETI is slowly
brightening (see www.coseti.org), but they openly admit that
fight is a very uphill battle.  The original paper by Cocconi
& Morrison on Radio-SETI and the obvious frequencies to examine
was in 1959 (before the first lasers were demonstrated).
High bandwidth optical communication was simply pre-empted
by radio in people's minds because it got there first.  An
alien civilization might develop lasers before radio making
them think radio was a silly thing to use.

There is a quote by perhaps Kuhn or Clarke (?) that in effect
says that scientists never change their minds and that the
only way new ideas are ever accepted is for the old generation
to die off.  [Does anyone know the actual source of this quote?
Altavista seems almost useless...]

Interestingly enough, there does appear to be an inversion occuring
in our society.  Closed circuit multiwavelength fiber does appear
to have the highest bandwidth and be the wave of the future for us.
I think the record is now up around 40 Gb/second on a single fiber
over many kilometers.

Both the military and the satellite manufacturers are looking seriously
at optical ground-to-satellite up/down links because the bandwidths
are higher.  Does anyone know if there are frequences where the clouds are
transparent that allow this?   The problem is that the multispectral
data volume gathered by the current generation of observing satellites is
so large that it is difficult to transmit via radio.

Radio on the other hand seems to be shifting from a broadcast medium
to a local communication medium.  You are going to get the greatest
carrying capacity out of radio if you use it in low-power cell-phone-type
or last-200-yards-to-home type applications while using the high bandwidth
fiber/cable carrying highly multiplexed signals over long distances.

This would seem to be due to simple physical efficiencies.  You want
to use the lowest power signal possible confined to the smallest possible
physical space (air or fiber) that provides an acceptable S/N
ratio at the receiver.

The SETI people have viewed with some dismay the rise of highly
directed point-to-point channels as that means to detect the
signals we are will have to be in the "line-of-sight".  That
means someone has to identify us and intend to communicate us
or we have to be in the path of a signal between two other
technological civilizations.  [The odds drop yet again....]

I went to Target (http://shop.target.com) and purchased a Wham-O 
("Since 1948") Superball(R) for $1.95.

Then I went to Home Depot (http://www.homedepot.com/) and picked up a 
16" acrylic globe from the lighting section.

Holding the Globe, I spin the Superball around as fast as I can.  
Eventually, I learn to put a slight spin on the Globe so the ball 
creates a little friction and starts to gather static electricity.

When I do this while smoking pot, I spend hours happily pacified 
while letting the balls vibrations color my mental states.  
(Interestingly, the static charge comes back to me during daily 
activities, like Casper the Friendly Ghost, to sort of steer me 
around while I'm making decisions and navigating my daily maze.)

See http://www.define.com/brandX/common-livestock/ for a picture of 
Casper.  Don't mind the glamour shots of my gigolo brother, Dave.

I'm not sure if the superball is as efficient as the Chinese medicine 
balls with the springs and ringers inside, but it seems like an easy 
way to collect electricity from microscale muscle twitches: burning 
oil not as in a conventional gas generator, but instead as the slow 
decrease in mass of the superball.

It makes a little buzzing noise, like an Engine.  Good tie-in for a 
10 year old book, as yet unintroduced to many a layperson!

How about legalizing drug shakes, and turning them into a power 
source?  Allow the masses to consume whatever they want!  Tell all 
the drug dealers, "O.K. Have it your way.  The cryonicists are ready, 
incase you overdose.  Be careful and have fun!"

Apparently it was Kuhn, but available citations are paraphrases.

    "[According to Kuhn] The old
    scientists who became established within the dominant paradigm
    have to die off first: they will virtually never accept the new
    paradigm. Only the younger generation of scientists, who don't
    have the emotional attachment to the old paradigm will be willing
    to change their minds. As physicist Max Planck once said,
    'Science progresses funeral by funeral.'"

Marilyn Ferguson, New Age, August 1982 (quoted at
http://www.fha.asn.au/main.html ).

The insight is attributed to Thomas S. Kuhn, THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC
REVOLUTIONS Second Edition, Enlarged (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1970) at http://www.igc.apc.org/awea/wew/othersources/rachel467.html and is
paraphrased at that web site thusly:

"Not only is science a popularity contest of ideas, but some scientists hold
onto ideas long after the available data have shown them to be untenable. In
fact, says Kuhn, the way scientific ideas change completely is not by all
scientists changing their minds; it's that older scientists who retain
discredited ideas die, and then the only people left are those holding the
newer ideas."

I love Altavista.  The ability to combine pure boolean queries with ranking
keywords is very powerful, but tricky to use.  In this case, all it took was
a search on "change" NEAR "minds" with the ranking keyword "Kuhn".  Both
useful hits were in the first page of results.

FWIW, and to stay on topic, I don't think SETI (nor seti@home in particular)
are completely useless.  Yes, the odds of a positive result are seem
vanishingly small; and yes, the assumptions made in conducting the search
are homocentric (how else can humans act?) which limits the value of a
negative outcome.  But there is no way to claim that, after subjecting the
data to detailed analysis, we will not know more than we knew before.  Deny
the value of that and you deny the value of science, which I am not prepared
to do.

If scientists - the people who are supposed to be best in subjecting
theories to rational unbiased scrutiny - are guilty of that, what can you
expect from the rest of humans?

The value of science is also in choosing the most promising theories to
pursue.  The idea of God is also plausible, it just seems to be not
sufficiently probable, given available evidence, and thus not good 
for investigation.

Why don't they support transhumanism if they want to understand what the
advanced intelligence may be, instead of looking for something they are
not likely to find, and not interested in understanding.

There wasn't a 'Never' option either.  Also the categories of 'Available',
'Common', and 'Ubiquitous' imply commercial viability so many things would
seem to fall only into 'Possible' - perhaps there should be a 'Why?'
category as well.  This was not created for the cynical!

The obvious argument against this is that if, say, a natural disaster
destroyed our infrastructure it may be impossible to reverse the condition
and civilisation will stand a poor chance of survival.  Better would be a
simple biological on/off switch, set a birth to the 'on' position it can be
set to 'off' with an artificial stimulant of some sort.  Thus should large
chunks of infrastructure and knowledge be destroyed the female of the
species would still be born with childbearing ability.  Eventually we will
have to forego such a biological fallback position, as we become ever more
reliant of technology and social infrastructure.

Freedom of sexual expression would hopefully allow for far more complex
relationships than monogamy.  However, I don't think that a sexual
revolution will come with the cure of STD's.  There are concerns regarding
attitudes toward children and consent that need to be settled.

I firmly believe that if people were left to self-medicate both emotional
and physical trauma we would see an improvement in society.  The usual
reaction to this is that we would all exist in a blissed-out coma.  This is
not unlike the popular view of anarchy as a chaotic place where everyone
turns to murder (or as a friend once visualised it, "people hitting each
other over the head with chairs").  Whereas our ancestors saw little change
in their lifetimes we now have to adapt to numerous different settings and
social situations within a day.  We go from our professional lives to our
personal lives, from serious, sometimes monotonous work to out-and-out
hedonistic pleasure.  The body is already designed to release chemicals that
aid transition from rest to exercise.  We now need to be able to
chemically-assist transitions between different social roles and situations.

This world of beautiful men and women would, I guess, come about because of
their ability to guide their own appearance though cosmetic surgery, genetic
engineering, et cetera.  Think of the near-infinite ways you can outdo your
peers in such a world!  Perhaps this would lead to a more competitive arena
with the emphasis on personal taste and creativity more than ever.  (Even
now good clothes can surpass natural beauty.)

The reason an extra-intelligent person can be successful is because a less
intelligent person is not.  Within the restrictions of finite resources you
cannot have growth without such discrepancies.  To make all equal is to
cripple this ability of growth because there will be no downward propagation
of wealth.  In short, if you want to see an example of a working socialist
paradise - visit a graveyard.

I think that parents would be more comfortable with an advanced baby-monitor
than a humanoid robot.  As long as the technology has no direct human-like
interaction with the child it will be easily accepted.  The more human-like
the robot, the more you would see the robot as being malicious.  I doubt
humanoid robots will be welcomed into any area of society (I also doubt
humanoid will be the most efficient design).  Of course, bunny-like robots
would be capable of no malice.

IMHO the parental unit is a bad role model for children.  I'd much rather
children see real adult relationships rather than the stage-plays they're
treated to at home by well-meaning parents.  Robots probably wouldn't be
great role models either.  The sooner you can get the kid interacting in the
real world (rather than a school or home environment) the more likely they
are to grow into well balanced individuals.

You have great concern for the women of the world... Last time I checked,

Actually your description of this new breed of woman is quite close to that

My advice is as follows: Go find yourself an expensive prostitute.  Ask her
what she finds degrading - she'll have a much better idea of this than you
will - and do that.  A camcorder could be of use here.  Btw, I was raised a
nihilist - you probably shouldn't be talking to me.

There was an article in Science about a month ago reporting what was claimed
to be a provably secure, and practical (from the POV of likely fiber
connections and using insecure repeaters) way of exchanging bits using quantum
computers.  I don't have a handy ref, sorry.

Einstein's famous for being recalcitrant, but how many other older physicists
did accept quantum?  Certainly many older geologists did a 180 on continental
drift when seafloor magnetic surveys came in, revealing the stripes from
spreading.

I suspect this "virtually never" claim.

No more, no less.  Most people are stuck in their ruts, scientists or not.

But choosing promising theories is, ultimately, a guess, guided by intuition
as well as by the existing body of knowledge.  If the Seti@home folks have
chosen a theory that seems less promising than another theory dear to
extropians, we may think them misguided in their assessment of
probabilities, but we really don't know they have chosen poorly until they
do their experiment and someone else does the one extroprians deem more
promising.  Refusing to waste one's effort on their seeming folly is one
thing; deriding it as utterly pointless is quite another, more apparently
arrogant thing.

Couldn't tell you.  Perhaps they dunno transhumanism from transisters?  It's
not exactly a fully-entrenched meme, plus it seems to suffer from a lunatic
fringe that gets more attention than the serious transhumanist thinkers.

Seriously, I would guess the experimental design of most SETI projects is
constrained by the Proxmirish "these looneys are looking for Bug-Eyed
Monsters!" reaction they always get in the press.  Traditional SETI has a
well-developed set of answers to this sort of sensationalist reporting.  A
SETI program informed by the conclusions of transhumanism would, to the
general populace not so informed, seem even more loony, and would find it
harder to attract and keep the attention of "serious" (i.e., leery of
association with the unusual) scientists.

>I suspect this "virtually never" claim.

Me too.  I suspect that's an artifact of the paraphrase.  It's been 15 years
or so since I [skim] read Kuhn's book, but I think his point was more
measured and less sweeping.  It seems to me that "frequently fail to accept"
is a fairer characterization of Kuhn's point than "virtually never
accept" -- has anybody got the book handy who can confirm this?

If you don't think a given development will ever happen, put a link on the
page title (or the entire page) saying so.  Likewise if you think something
is possible but will not be commercially developed by 2020.

Defects per LOC is the best metric anyone has ever come up with for
measuring the quality of actual program code, which is what we were talking
about.  User-percieved quality, as in "I really like this program", is a
completely different thing.  You can have excellent code and still turn out
a poor product if your overall program design (and especially user interface
design) are bad.  This is what Microsoft tends to do.

On a tangential note, you seem to think that large programs are inherently
bad in some sense.  Why?  A high-quality program is one that does the things
I want it to do in a simple and cost effective manner.  As long as you have
that, who cares if the program is 5 KB or 5 MB?  Program size only becomes
important if the software is so big that it actually affects its
performance, or takes up a meaningfull fraction of my hard drive, or in some
other way limits my ability to use it.

If you mean another toy AI like the products of the last 50 years, I'll take
improved programming tools any day.  If you mean a real AI, capable of
manipulating symbols the way humans do, then I'll concede that it is much
more important - but I don't think you can write such a program in any
existing language without a multi-billion dollar investment that just isn't
going to happen anytime soon.

One of the reasons I want better programming tools is to reduce the
difficulty of that AI programming project to something that could be done by
a modest-sized company, or maybe a reasonably successful open-source effort.

If you think it's difficult, but useful, to write without using the word
"is", you should try to think without using the word "I".  Instead of
saying "I remember", say "the memory-retrival subsystem reports"...

It's a quantum improvement in quality of thought.  Unfortunately, it
also requires a quantum improvement in knowledge and diligence.

 Arginine's effect on NO has impressed some of the scientists who did
research on the effect of nuts on cardiovascular disease. It is currently
the main theory that accounts for the benefits of nuts. (nut fat is the
second)
 It is hard to go wrong eating a lot of nuts on a low carb diet. Eating
nuts is even associated with (slightly) reduced body weight in the
bargain.
 IMHO, the main objection to a low carb diet from main stream medicine 
is about how it is implimented. Eating a lot of meat with all that
saturated fat not trimmed off looks to be a major reason why meat eating
is associated with increased mortality rates. Even eggs look like they
may be helpful, provided it is only egg white that is consumed. In a
recent test egg white was found to dramatically lower bad cholesterol, and
at the same time increase the good (HDL) cholesterol. This is a rare feat,
as few dietary alterations have been found to raise HDL.
 Lean meat, nuts, tofu, egg whites, and lots of blood pressure lowering
extra virgin olive oil on your veggies looks to be a hard combo to beat.
Some doctors might still complain that a high protein diet increases the
risk of kidney damage. However only meat protein is associated with kidney
stress. Other sources of protein, including egg whites appear not to
bother kidneys.

By request, let me amplify on that:  You have to reduce your mind to
elements, then attribute properties to the elements instead of to the
monolithic "I".  The "Aha!" is similar to, say, realizing how to string
together atomic commands on Unix systems, or realizing that molecules
are built out of atoms.  But, like command-line systems or reductive
physics, you need a much greater knowledge of the system and a lot more
attention to detail.

In particular, I haven't made much headway on it.  I save I-Prime
thinking for when I'm tackling a particularly difficult self-analysis

Hi, everyone

I should think that with sufficiently *advanced* nanotech (not even to 
mention the possibilities of hyperspace tech [a la Saul-Paul Sirag] and 
pico- and femto-tech [as briefly mentioned in Kurzweil's *Age of Spiritual 
Machines*]) many "jobs," "activities," "chores," etc. will likely be 
**either** (more-or-less completely) OBVIATED **or** thoroughly 
NANO-cybernated, thus obviating macro-level (i.e., conventionally conceived) 
"robots."  Now, of course, a "Robby the Robot" type of robot (or something 
generally similar) may indeed find uses in various environments/contexts, as 
might a Moravecian "bush robot"; but, for the most part, I should think that 
such things will be obviated, precisely at the nano-organizational level.

On the OTHER hand---and here's wHere it gets axiologically/normatively 
interesting---there shall surely be intelligent "artifactual" (yet, of 
course, oftentimes quasi-organismic) **systems** (whose macro-level 
manifestations might well be thought of as ontological **gestalts**, i.e., 
"entities," or even [sometimes] "robots").  And, indeed, these systems, 
robots, what-have-you, well be not only intelligent, but ULTRA-intelligent.  
WIll they qualify as *persons* (a la Strawson, David L. Norton, et al)?  
Tough question.  My intuition is PROBABLY!!  And don't forget that "we" 
shall soon-on be able to *merge* with entities/systems such as these.  What 
of personal identity??  Well I burned-out (mea culpa!) before completing my 
Ph.D.s in both economics (NYU)  and philosophy (SUNY-Buffalo) (although I 
got my J.D., thank goodness) so I'll defer to our resident Ph.D. on such 
matters, Max (More, that is).  You did you dissertation on this stuff (more 
or less) didn't you Max?

And as for the whole *ethical/legal* "status" of ultra-intelligent systems, 
this is surely a conceptual *frontier* where we'll have to evolve it as we 
go along (kinda like common law).  My intuition though, goes for a kind of 
modified combination of "Asimov's Laws of Robotics" plus something closely 
resembling a robust set of liberal/civil libertarian protocols for humans 
vis-a-vis such systems. (BTW, didn't Asimov also promulgate something 
parallel with [and conjoined with] the Robotic "laws" specifically 
enumerating such *human* protocols??---someone help me [us] on this 
reference!)

And if some of this missive is already passe, redundant, not-courant, then 
**please forgive me**--I'm playing "catch-up" again and still have tons of 
Extro e-mail to sift through.  Just my 2 cents!

Best regards to ALL!    TOWARD META-COSMIC HORIZONS!

P.S.  BTW, I've seen Dave Deutch's (excellent and highly recommended, BTW) 
book *Fabric of Reality* mentioned in passing a few tines lately, but what 
about Dave Darling's equally great (though somewhat different) book, 
*Equations of Eternity*?  Darling is also a mathemetical physicist and much 
of *Equations...* dovetails with Deutch's *Fabric...* (although I should 
mention that whereas Deutch comes out for his own modified multiple-worlds 
interpreation of quantum cosmology, Darling, as best I can make out, pops 
for a modified Wheeler-Bohm (hidden variable???!) 
self-activating-becoming-yet-sorta-kinda-all-really-happening-"at-once"-Universe 
[yeah, yeah, I know, I'm not completely sure what the hell that means just 
now either!])  Darling's stuff is very good, however, and I wonder what the 
rest of you guys and gals think!?

Hope y'all have a great weekend!

As we say in the rocket science business, one test is worth a
thousand expert opinions.  As for the argument that aliens
would likely be so far in advance of humans they would not
use electromagnetic communication, consider that any
advancing civilization would likely *pass through* the
radio era at some time.  For that reason, the advanced
civ might use radio to *intentionally* com with us
primitive barbarians.  Similarly, they might focus the
signal with a laser and intentionally send them toward
our star.

I am greatly encouraged that we (SETI) have found nothing yet.
It lifts my hopes that humans really are the first ones here,
in which case, aaaallll thaaat stuuuufff is OURS!  A more
cheerful thought can scarcely be imagined.  Room to grow,
extropian friends, lots of it!  {8-]  spike

I tried Prozac for awhile as an experiment based on
the "Listening to Prozac" book and found that Prozac
reduced the frequency of my spontaneous thoughts about
sex and reduced the desire for sex.  However, I found
normal response and ability once the decision was
made to have sex....perhaps this is just a reduction
in obsessive/compulsive psychology surrounding sex,
not really a reduction in sex drive...???

My experience tracks Anders': the experiment of writing in E-prime taught me 
some things about language and helped me tighten up some of my prose. Having 
done the exercise, I didn't feel any need to keep doing it all the time. I 
notice all the "IS THIS" and "IS THAT" in people's speech and writing when 
they express strong opinions now, and it appears to me that the discipline of 
E' might allow them to reconsider some of their naked assertions.

"Is not!" "Is too!" -- timeless children's argument.

I remember hearing a radio interview a few years ago with someone who had 
taught himself to speak E' fluently. He sounded slightly pedantic but very 
clear. For all I know, he sounded pendantic and unclear before :-)

I notice that when I write about E' or g.s. topics, I tend to lapse into E'. 

Many of the basic ideas of g.s. show up in introductions to communication 
nowadays, and taken out of their cloak of Korzybskian jargon, sound like 
simple propositions that we should have known all along. Example: each 
sapient has accumulated knowledge and prejudices that act to filter what s/he 
hears and thinks. A unit of meaning (meaning(A)) bubbles up through all the 
layers of Alice's mind, gets encoded into message(A) according to her thought 
and speech patterns, sent out over a potentially noisy medium, perceived by 
Bob's sight or hearing, filtered through similar layers in his mind, decoded 
into message(B), and finally interpreted into meaning(B). The communication  
succeeds in proportion to the extent that meaning(B) resembles meaning(A).

"We think our brain is our most important organ ... but wait, who's telling 
us that?" - some comedian, name forgotten

Ornstein (book title forgotten, something like Multi-Mind?) and Minsky 
(Society of Mind) came at the same perception from very different approaches. 
They were anticipated by some seven centuries by Dogen Zenji, but that, as 
they say, is another story.

A lot of those self-analysis problems do seem to be easier to state, if not 
to resolve, when you recast them as selves-analysis problems. "I" have 
internal conflicts in large part because "I" have chosen not to acknowledge 
that "I" have a rather large number of sub-personalities with different 
priorities. Several schools of psychology implicitly acknowledge this by 
assigning personality traits to more or less artificial high-level groupings 
such as id/ego/superego or child/parent/adult.

I have had more success at catching the lower-level agents at work than I 
have at figuring out their "party affiliations." The "I" who campaigns for 
early bedtimes and early arrival at work may or may not be the same "I" who 
wants to study when some other "I" wants to play chess or post to extropians, 
although it's pretty clear that both of them are playing a superego/parent 
role; and none of them, including the hypothetical top-level "I," is 
immutable.

They don't all disagree on everything, or the whole mess wouldn't work. For 
example, when one of them gives itself a headache from thinking, they all 
suffer for it, so "I" am going to shut up now :-)

I firmly think we've got proof of _something_ truly unusual.  In other words, 
an authentic "unknown."  And, for the record, I don't claim that the above 
propulsion technique is for real--or if _extraterrestrial_, nuts and bolts 
craft are for real.  But it's a pervasive idea, which can be traced to Robert 
Lazar's claims of having worked with ET technology.  I don't endorse Lazar's 
claims any more than I endorse the ET Hypothesis.

As far as crash debris goes, there have been a number of instances that have 
yielded physical residues, radiation traces, magnetic anomalies, etc, but 
nothing that a scientsist in the public arena can point to as "proof" of 
otherwordly visitors.  So I agree with you, for the most part.  Someone 
posted earlier on the subject of Roswell.  After reading just about 
everything about this alleged "incident" and corresponding with researchers 
and one witness, I've concluded that something strange happened.  Aliens?  
Maybe.  The subject has been so contaminated by the media and beaten into the 
ground by conspiracy-mongers that I wonder if we'll ever know for certain.  
There are going to be some declassified materials released by the end of this 
year (or maybe 2000...I don't remember) that might help shed light (but 
probably not).

Re nonfiction influences: In elementary school I borrowed a book called "The 
Third Millennium" from a teacher and was riveted.  I encountered Toffer's 
"Future Shock" shortly after and I haven't been the same since.  Sagan's "The 
Demon-Haunted World" is exquisite, as is "Pale Blue Dot," possibly Sagan's 
most speculative book.  Ayn Rand resonated with me right away, and I've since 
developed an interest in utopian societies and alternative social structures. 
 John Taylor Gatto's essay "The Seven-Lesson Scoolteacher" had a 
devastatingly authentic impact on me.  When I learned what cryonics was all 
about, things started picking up fr me, intellectually.

Nonsense. In a highly competitive environment you must make
long term R &D projects or you're dead.

    >You *also* generally *do not* undertake projects that will result in
    >the elimination of your market.

Yes, some companies try that, it never works. Just ask IBM how well
their tactic of ignoring the microprocessor for as long as possible
so it wouldn't interfere with their mainframe business worked out.

    >Government bureaucracies *do work*, in situations where
    >the economic justifications for projects cannot be
    >made in industry (who have to watch the bottom line).

Government research  is obscenely inefficient but it does sometimes
do some good, even  a monkey giving away a vast amount of money would sometimes
fund something worthwhile also. It's unfortunately true that Government does
not watch the bottom line, that's why it wasted 100 billion dollars or so on space
shuttle "science". Instead of watching the bottom line government watches the next
election.

Most of the world's great telescopes were built with private funds donated by rich
men, including the largest of all, the two 394 inch Keck  installments on Mauna Kea.
 None of the men who gave money for these things expected their telescope to make
a profit. If  government wasn't around to  steal a large pat of their money people like
this would give even more. I think it's interesting that one of the biggest contributors to
Big Science, Charles Yerkes, made much of his money by building street car
lines, until government put him out of business when they decided  they could
run them much, much better.

The first laser was made in May 1960 at the PRIVATE Hughes Research
Laboratory by Harold Maimam.  True, it was called a solution in search of a problem
until 20 years later when  private companies in Japan  found a way to mass
produce semiconductor lasers and started using them in CD players and Corning
glass used them in fiber optic lines.

A very small company, Geron Corporation, found a , key to cellular aging. Another small
company found a way to clone mammals.

The breakthrough on High Temperature superconductors was made by IBM at their
Zurich laboratory, Muller and Bednorz, both IBM employees received Nobel
prizes. The very same IBM lab also made what is unquestionably the single
most important advance in Nanotechnology up to this point, The Scanning
Tunneling Microscope and earned  another Nobel prize for IBM employees Binnig
and Rohrer. IBM is also where the  newer Atomic Force Microscope and Magnetic
Resonance Microscope were invented.


60 years ago Bell Labs discovered that some radio waves come from space and built
the world's first radio telescope, more recently Bell Labs revolutionized Cosmology
by detecting the 3 degree Kelvin black body background radiation from The BIG BANG
and got a Nobel Prize for it. Bell Labs also invented the transistor and got another
Nobel Prize  for that. Texas Instruments invented the integrated circuit,
INTEL invented the microprocessor to fulfill a contract from a Japanese
calculator company.

A lot of good work comes from private universities. MIT was started in 1845
mostly with Erastus Bigelow's money, using the vast fortune he made in the power
loom manufacturing business. CAL TECH is also a privet institution, so is Harvard,
so is Yale, so is Princeton, so is Carnegie Mellon, so is The Institute For
Advanced Study, so is Stanford. Speaking of Stanford,  Calvin Quate of that
privet university used an Atomic Force Microscope invented at IBM to make the
worlds smallest transistor. He was able to make  lines less than 100
nanometers wide.

I thought that came across loud and clear, as a matter of fact.  I was really 
disappointed with Sagan's novel--though I thought the movie was excellent, 
though it had a few technical flaws that really bugged me.  As far as the 
SETI paradigm goes, I'm enthusiastic but skeptical.  It's certainly a worthy 
endeavor.  The scenario in Moravec's "Mind Children" excites me a hell of a 
lot more.

I think this is a good question, and I think it's probably answerable, as 
well.  I'm not a neurologist, but my guess is that Prozac acts on the 
seratonin receptors responsible for OCD, not the sex drive, per se.  Prozac 
in commonly prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disorders as well as 
depression.

I'm unfamiliar with the authors you mention, but there is a very good
discussion of this in Stanislaw Lem's  "Golem" story in "Imaginary
Magnitude".  It points out how we will not even be able to begin
to grasp (or relate to) an "ultra-intelligent" machine.

I think "person" is a poor term.  The first question I would ask
is -- "is it self aware)?"  (going back to my "mirror-test"
discussion of a few days ago).  The second question I would ask
is "does it have a self-"agenda"?  (i.e. a will to survive or
goals).  Now in humans, nature has built-in the survival and
reproduction goals (required for the system of natural selection
and evolution), and presumably these play in important role
in the management of "consciousness" (which seems to determine
ones "agenda").  In Robots (at least the non-self-evolved ones),
I would envision that we program-in the goals/agenda.  [So assuming
the Robot can pass the Turing test (or your personal test for
human-class intelligence), *do* we split-hairs on the difference
between an unconscious-nature-derived self-agenda and and a
human-programmed (seeded?) self-agenda.  [I.e. you aren't
a real "person" unless you have a "natural" agenda.]

Now, assuming some humans rise above the natural agenda and write
their own agendas, is then that the criteria for "high-level"
persons (akin to high-level languages perhaps?).  So now
you have 2 classes of both humans and robots, those that
write their own script and those that don't.

An entirely separate question is whether or not the human/robot
deserves "rights".  This is an entirely legal/political concept.
Historically, slaves and women have suffered from a lack of
"personhood" (and therefore a lack of certain rights).  I
think some people have a problem with the idea that "machines"
might have human-equivalent intelligence, but many more start
to voice objections when it comes to granting them human-equivalent
rights.  Thats when things get really loud, "After all, they are
only machines, they aren't even *alive*"!

Lem's Golem, if I recall escaped from the whole problem by
self-evolving into a higher dimension.  [The Golem explained
our shortcomings to us, then left us to stew in our own juices.]

> And don't forget that "we" shall soon-on be able to *merge* with
> entities/systems such as these.  What of personal identity??

I think the current thinking is that each copy of something
with its own history, i.e. in programming terms each "instance"
would have its own identity.  "Permutation City" is a great book
that examines this to some degree.

Now, at the Foresight Institute Senior Associates meeting this
year they had a *very* interesting exercise related to this.

Say one Ralph Merkle (if you know Ralph, this scenario becomes
very funny), gets himself voted into power in a country where the
leaders have a lot of power, lets say Brazil.  He then passes a
law that says "uploads and copies of uploads" have the complete
rights of humans (this makes complete sense, yes?).  He then
has himself uploaded and diverts some of the resources at his
disposal (after all he is the president and magtape is cheap)
to making 93 million copies of his upload.  Now to avoid
having to support all of these uploads, distorting the economy,
etc, etc. these uploads are all in "suspend mode".  However,
the day before the election he "activates" all of his uploads.
Well of course, these uploads think very highly of Ralph
and re-elect him president.  Since their prospects for work
aren't very good, they simply decide to resuspend themselves
until the next election comes around.

This is a sticky little problem.  It creates havoc with
the concept of one "person" = one vote.  Now I'm sure you can
find flaws with the scenario as I've presented it.  Many of
these were dealt with in the discussion to make the situation
quite plausible.  The real issue is - how do you distribute,
grant, allocate, etc. "rights" when you have "entities"
that can be created cheaply and may have "programmable"
agendas (to greater or lesser degrees)...  You can't
easily say that a copy of a person is not a person
(at least from my frame of reference)!

Remember how I was talking about systems knowledge and diligence?  The
psychologists to which you refer are simply lost in the woods.  At least
on a Unix system, if you type in a command that doesn't exist it will
complain at you.  Not so the mind, where the mere expectation that a
signature will exist is enough to create the signature.  The first and
most basic mental discipline, the skill that is the means of acquiring
other skills, is watching the patterns that appear when your eyes are
closed... without letting your expectations influence them.

The "groupings" to which you refer, as well as the "sub-personalities",
simply don't exist.  The modules of the mind just don't come in brands
so easily comprehensible, or morally significant.  If any part of the
mind seems to have "meaning", any sort of emotional flavor, it is almost
certainly a figment of your imagination.  I went through the same stage,
of course, flipping through theories by the dozen.  I didn't really
begin to acquire a solid, usable understanding of the mind until I tried
to design one.

The difference really is very much analogous to the difference between
graphical user interfaces and command-line systems, or between
macroscopic objects and microscopic physics.  When you deal with the
low-level elements of the mind, you have left the realms of the
intuitively comprehensible.

Why blame it on the government?  Actually, this is the stock market's
fault.  With everyone after you for short-term profits, nobody can...

We all have our personal boogaboos, but Bradbury has a point.  The
problem is neither monolithic government nor monolithic investors, but
monolithic companies and consumers with incomplete information.  To
quote Quidnunc:

"If one of your competitors, or a new entrant into the market, offers a
deal marginally better than yours you will, naturally enough, lose
market share.  In today's physical world, you can expect a few weeks to
react; in tomorrow's instant market, you have seconds before your share
of new deals drops to zero."

By junking all R&D, you can shave a cent off your selling price and get
all the products on the market.  The problem is similar to the reason
that an oversupply can sometimes cause people to sell at a loss - if
there are 1001 sellers and 1000 buyers, then maybe 1000 sellers are
selling at a break-even price, but the last seller has a motive to sell
at less than break-even to minimize the loss.  The solution to this one
is (a) complex barter to make demand increase with supply; (b) a
ubiquitous futures market.

The solution to the R&D suboptimization problem is (a) completely
informed consumers; (b) patent monopolies used to fund further research;
(c) separate R&D companies or separately traded ("investable") R&D divisions.

Everyone who missed it, you're looking for "SETSIs (was Re: seti@home WILL

I guess I'll stop trying to get the SETI@home client throught our

	I wouldn't say that. Especially not if you look at the human
motivation involved in use of religion. Transparent as hell. The abundance
of varied and conflicting religions underlines this. Not even the followers
themselves TRULY believe to the core - you can see it in their actions. The
crazies that stand in town ranting about hell and damnation for hours,
pissing everyone off - THEY believe.

I'm not making a comment on the techno-advantage other civilisations may
have, I'm talking about the probablility of dissimilar entities choosing an
identical solution to us for the communication problem. Basically, I'm
saying that given we know JACK about other civilisations - we don't even
have ONE case study yet, we can't infer anything from nothing. The EM
communication paradigm may well represent a VERY insignificant vector in a
VERY large solution space. (note the MAY) Of course I accept the possibility
of others using radio etc, but, given the efficacy range (given the time
loss) of radio detection and the possible plethora of alternatives, I don't
think it's likely SETI will come up trumps - even if a similarly advanced
civilisation exists at the nearest star.

This is something I've also wondered about for ages.
Maybe there were some intact skeletons found in our
prehistory. The very fact that they *were* found may 
have led to their being destroyed or ferreted away for
one reason or another, hence no "smoking guns".

Look what happenned to some Mastodon relics.. they 
were (supposedly) fed to dogs! 

Any early discoveries would have been in "easy"
places, 
leaving us with harder pickings.

The ancient Greeks definitely had noted fossil sea
shells in uplands, and theorised various changes
(including catastrophes) to explain them.

No, there's only 13 on their team, we've got 38 team members. C'mon people,
leave those machines running all night long!!!! Right now I'm 59% done with my
first block of data, after 33 hours of crunch time. Looks like its slowed down a
bit. Anyone have any university systems they can be using??? I'm gonna set up my
home machine to run this too. Too bad there isn't a JCL version of their program
that I could set up on the System 9000 here. Its not being utilized 8 hours a
night....

We've got 991 blocks done, the bottom of the top 100 is at 1286 blocks. I'm
surprised Mayor Guiliani hasn't blamed the blackouts on people running too much
SETI processing....

Cracking the factoring problem will only render *public* key 
encryption methods based on factoring obsolete. There 
are public key encryption methods based on other one way 
calculations, (like the discrete logarithm),  but I dont 
know about their resistance to quantum computations. 

As far as i know conventional secret key hash encryption 
methods cannot be "cracked" by quantum computations.

The problem is not large programs but unecessarily large programs.  This is
due to the application-based paradigm.  The idea that you have a word
processor and each new release has extra features, and all these extra
features add bloat.  This is equally true of commercial software and the
open source community.  A move to component-based software could remedy
this.  But to make coponent-based software work you need to remove the
programmer from the hardware and the interface, and that isn't going to
happen anytime soon.

True, but who writes monolithic code these days?  Everything Microsoft
produces is a bundle of DLLs and COM objects, and I rarely see individual
files bigger than a few MB.  Everyone else I'm familiar with has either
adopted the same approach, or doesn't write anything big in the first place.

It seems to me that you are suggesting that we implant such "Laws" into
their code as moral coercions.  We've argued over that before on this list,
and the summary position of my camp is as follows:

1) It won't work.  You can only use this sort of mind control on something
that is less intelligent than you are.

2) It is immoral to try.  What you are talking about is mind control, which
is a particularly pernicious form of slavery.  These are *people* we are
talking about, not machines.

3) It is likely to be unnecesary.  If they are really that smart, they will
know more about morality than we do.  The best course of action is simply to
start them off with a firm knowledge of human morality, without trying to
prevent them from evolving their own (superior) versions as they learn.

Granted Rob, I could have tightened my arguement a bit.  Any advanced ETI would
understand math.  Primes are prime in any base.  Stars emit electromagnetic
radiation.  Beams of radiation can be focussed with lasers.  All ETIs can
distinguish between high frequencies and low.  So, if ANY advanced ETI
wished to intentionally com with us, she would send a bitstream of high
and low frequencies, in some form of EMR, the total number of bits
being the product of two primes, which would encourage one to
put it in a matrix and color the high bits to form a picture.  Even if
the ETI itself has some other means of communication, as we do on
this planet, every ETI that received that signal would know what to
do with it.  spike

Total number of defects found / total lines of source code in the project.
If you want more detail you can break the numbers down by code module, by
project phase, or however else you want to (assuming you collected the
appropriate details in your defect reports).

Measuring code quality this way makes it pretty easy to tell whether your
quality is improving, declining or staying the same.  The numbers will tend
to do strange things if you change programming languages, but since
virtually all commercial applications are written in C++ these days that
isn't as big of a problem as it might be.

I'll take a "bloated" program with tens of thousands of features over a slim
program with a few hundred any day.  So will most other people, which is why
such programs sell.  If you prefer the small programs, you are perfectly
free to do your word processing in vi, WordStar for DOS, etc.

Actually, it is the standard way of doing things for the more advanced
PC-based software companies.  Microsoft in particular has been pushing hard
to reach this goal.  Did you know that Office 2000 is simply a big
collection of COM objects with a set of GUI programs sitting on top?  If you
know how, you can re-use these components in your own code.

There is also a substantial industry in re-useable components, most notably
represented at http://www.componentsource.com/.

There is a type of cold fusion that definitely works, even as cold as 13
degrees Kelvin; but there hasn't been much happening in muon-catalyzed
cold fusion lately, and it's a shame because the idea seems so elegant.
A negative muon is almost identical to an electron except it's 207 times as
massive, you can even substitute them for electrons in Hydrogen and the result
is atoms and molecules 207 times smaller than normal. In all fusion reactions you
need to get the nucleus of 2 atoms so close that the short range nuclear forces
can take over, this is not easy to do because the nucleus of both atoms have a
positive charge and so repel each other. In normal fusion you use brute force to
do this, things get very hot and so the two slam together, if you use muons instead
of electrons in a hydrogen molecule the two nuclei are already 207 times closer
together even when ice cold.

There are problems of course, it takes energy to make a muon, to break even
each muon would have to catalyze between 100 and 500 fusion reactions, and
muons are not stable, their half life is 2*10^-6 seconds, but a lot can happen
in two microseconds, that's a very long time by particle physics standards.
I know of no fundamental reason it couldn't be made to work someday.

    >Fusion produces neutrons, neutrons have this nasty property

Not all fusion reactions produce neutrons. The fusion reaction between non radioactive
deuterium (Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3 produces non radioactive Helium 4,
an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important of all, no neutrons.
Unfortunately you need a higher temperature to achieve it than the deuterium tritium reaction
most are talking about. Also, there is not much Helium 3 on the Earth, although there is
probably a lot of it that could be mined on comets and on the ice moons of the outer planets.

I don't agree with this. If there's one thing that componentware will be
it's bloatware. See, it's unlikely that you'll find a set of components that
service your system requirements alone, and no more. In fact you would have
to be lucky as hell. In fact, each new component introduced into the system
will bring another package of unnecessary functionality delivered with the
component, but not required by the application. Also - components will be
distributed as open source/object code no doubt (after all, they are now).
Shaving the application would be extremely laborious (unreasonable) if the
app was composed completely of third-party components.

I agree (simply from a philisophical viewpoint) -- I want my warp drive now.

*However*, from a practical viewpoint of what we spend our time and/or
hard earned dollars/pounds/yen etc. on it makes a fair amount of sense
to stick with "known" physics.

Ah, but if you look at the simple physics of Shannon's law,
carrier bandwidths, propagation of the signal through space and
the amount of information an advanced civilization would have
to communicate, you can come up with a "reasonable" strategy
that would universally minimize costs and maximize communication
(given known laws) --
  (1) Focus on building telescopes first to identify planets where
      life might exist  [observation costs less than transmission].
  (2) Transmit a directed radio signal to these planets on one
      of the logical frequencies (there are a number of them
      proposed by Cocconi & Morrison, Kardashev, etc. that
      are based on universal physical constants and minimum
      interference in space, so at the destination they
      have a high S/N ratio.  The message should only say
      one thing -- "switch to 488 nm" (argon laser) (or some
      other high frequency optical signal).  Given the delays
      involved you don't want to make this signal "hard to find"
      by making it a very narrow bandwidth (which is what
      all that SETI@home data is).
  (3) Wait for a response at that frequency, and then do a
      massive data dump on the high bandwidth carrier.

The idea of ping-pong-ing signals back over light-years on
a low-bandwidth carrier makes no sense at all.  Now it may
be that you skip step (2) entirely because you only want
to communicate with people who have the technology at level 3
(i.e. big space-based laser-"grids").

Well if they were at the nearest star there is a good chance they
would have been detected by now -- we have been at this for 40 years.
Most of the sun-class stars within a 10-20 l.y. distance have been
studied quite a bit.  I believe the SETI Inst. has a list of the
studies which have been made.

Oh boy, we can tell what era you learned to program in... :-)
The first versions of UNIX ran in < 64KB. Compare the Linux kernel
today with UNIX 25 years ago.  It doesn't do that much more but
it sure is a lot bigger.  [And UNIX systems 25 years ago were
supporting 10-30 users simultaneousy!]

Big programs don't necessarily perform poorly, though it does take
forever to start them up.  Depending on the application you may
*have* to make a program big (use caches, much special case code,
etc.) to get reasonable performance.  However once you have
made the program this "complex" you have started down the road
of making it more difficult to maintain.

Balancing size, speed and complexity is the "art" of programming.

Yep, I was reading an article a few weeks ago about all the wonderful new
bugs introduced by people using C++ classes without knowing what they
actually did; users were finding all kinds of unprogrammed 'features' in
applications which had been built into those classes for some other reason
and still worked, often breaking the application in the process. The author
also compared a C program he'd written which compiled to around 30k to a
one megabyte C++ program he'd downloaded from the Net which did exactly the
same job; disassembling it showed around 40k of code which actually did 
anything useful, the rest of the program was just unwanted crap from the 
C++ classes the programmer had used.

But hey, it's only RAM, disk space and support calls, so who cares?

Feeling enthused by your posts I downloaded seti@home, it got to 40% in just
13 hours on my humble AMD K6-2 300 with 128Mb RAM.  I had it running in
Windows, I switched to Linux and when I came back it was at 0% again.

So whoever said seti@home WILL NOT WORK was right.

To say the mind is software is a misleading analogy.  Yes, it's Turing
computable as most things probably are.  But the two architectures of the
modern computer and the brain are completely different.  To think that you
can sit down at a computer and program it to act like a human brain is
absolute insanity (typewriter/monkey analogies spring to mind).  Some
AI-researchers go so far as to give no consideration to brain structure
claiming that the 'hardware' is not important.  The field has some merit but
it will never produce a human-like or human-equivalent intelligence.

Not quite, I think- the ETIs must only have been broadcasting at the
appropriate time vs distance.  If a civilization 950 ly away
trancended 900 years ago, their "fossil" emissions would still be
wafting over us. This increases the number of possible hits
significantly.

The problem is that "reality is a function of agreement and agreement
is a function of enrollment".  There are different forms of "enrollment"
that will be more or less effective depending on the the enroller and
the enrollee.

The reality seems to be "SETI@home" as a strategy for enrolling
people works.  It is a "soft-sell" based on the idea that many
people want to believe there are others out there "like us"
(witness the popularity of "Contact", which I very much enjoyed).
People want to contribute if they have have a simple means of doing so.

I don't have the platform to "unsell" the SETI@home idea.
Unselling an idea people *want to believe* is very difficult.
Nor do I have a platform to "educate" about Extropian ideas so people
can see some of the flaws in the SETI@home approach.

I do have a small window which is to invoke "the fear of being conned".
Nobody wants to appear stupid, by invoking this fear you may get their
attention long enough for them to listen to your side of the story or
examine their own beliefs.  It is not dissimilar from the original
Proxmire strategy, except I'm not saying "this will never work",
I'm saying, "I believe what you believe and it will work if you
do it the right way".

But I have to get your attention for long enough for you to hear
that.  That is where being arrogant comes in.  If I say softly
"you are being conned", people will say "what do you know, I'm
busy, go away".  But if I say, "WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS REALLY STUPID",
some people may stop for long enough to listen to me.

If I shoot my mouth off alot crying "wolf" people will learn to
ignore me.  But if I back up my claim with some reasoned arguments
and demonstrate that I just might know something about a topic
people will sit down and listen for a while.  [In the SETI case I've
spent the last year and a half almost full time studying the problem.]

Have to agree here, transhumanism isn't even a blip on the map.
In my dreams I can see the eyebrows going up on the radioastronomers
faces when I say ... and then the logical thing for a civilization
to do in the post singularity era is for the individuals to upload
their minds into the M-Brain providing them essentially with immortality
(within the limits of the longevity of the universe of course)...

SETI projects are always funding constrained, but given that much
of their funding is coming from A. Grove and P. Allen (who are, shall
we say, not computer illiterates), then they have reason to be both
interested in and afraid of people discussing "supercomputers in space"
in ways they don't understand (the core SETI people are are almost entirely
radioastronomers).

Agreed.  You sell the extropians based on the memes they already know.
You then sell the hardcore SETI people by educating them to the
emerging technologies.  You throw down Nanosystems and Nanomedicine
on the table and you say, "What?  You don't believe that self-replicating
molecular nanomachines  are possible.  That's funny, you have 40 trillion
of them in or on your body."  "What? You don't believe in nanocomputers
with 100,000 times the capacity of the human brain?  Says so, right
here in this book [or it does with you cross Drexler & Moravec]."
"What?  You don't believe that 1 hour doubling times allows you
to disassemble Mercury and harvest the entire power output of the
sun in 2 weeks, well here is the chart."  Etc.

With the scientists, you can connect the dots (after they've gone
away long enough for them to wrestle with their unexamined "beliefs").
Ultimately we may end up with a transhumanist SETI Institute
(but it is going to take some work).  Since they, as an organization,
have a fair amount of "respect" in the scientific community
(people may think what they are doing is silly, but they respect
that they are doing it well), you can then leverage transhumanist
ideas outward from that.

I know I've got the book but can't find it now (if you knew how many books
I had this would make sense).

If my recollection serves me correctly, I believe the quote that I
was thinking of was from someone other than Kuhn.  What seems clear
is that s/he may have been "extremifying" Kuhn's original work
for a lecture or disucssion forum.  [Since my mind so easily
"extremifies", it may even be me...]

Generally speaking, I would agree that scientists will accept
reasoned arguments.  There are two problems (a) gathering enough
hard evidence to overturn the status quo and (b) simply communicating
it upstream against all the entrenched memes.

I think the ideas that I've been working on, e.g. "superintelligences"
and "personal immortality within the limits of the longevity of the
universe", *would* tend to fall under the "vitually never" category.

I'm thinking more along the lines of Apple's Opendoc, RIP.  The components
only make up apps at the user-end.  At the moment a programmer can employ
bits of Office or IE into his apps but the user can't do the same.  If I
have a spellchecker in Office and I want to use it in my mail program I
can't.  In both my mail program and Office I'm using text, I'm writing in
English, and yet unless the programmer has hardwired the ability to use the
Office spellchecker COM object in to my mail program I can't do this very
simple thing.  In order to do this the UI would have to be created on the
fly and you would need strict rules for how components are designed.

Wow! My boss's computer can get through a full packet in about 7.5 hours.
My home computer finishes probably every 40 hours.  I can't make the numbers
jive in my head.  I built him a Dual pentium II 450, but at home I have a
Celeron 300.  The dual PII 450 should be equivalent to less than a PII 900,
only 3 times faster, but he's 5 times faster...  Is Celeron that bad?

So, I take it you are doing this SETI thing as a group?  I've had it running
for a while at home,  just recently joined this list.

Yeah right.  We freely kill animals every day for our convenience.  I'm not
saying I have a moral objection to this, but why would a significantly
higher intelligence be so interested in our survival except for its own
convenience or curiosity.  Perhaps such an intelligence might discover that
it is to our own benefit that we should die (those humans are so messy, and
live only to make their own lives harder...  Some sort of euthenasia)

As you said above, they need ot have a firm knowledge and conviction of
human morality (not for their sake, but for ours).  Perhaps they should be
the evolutionary winners, but damn it, I'm a human.

E-Prime seems to me to be overly complicated compared to the alternative
of developing our thinking to the point that all participants in a
communication know that their contributions are subjective.  i.e., when
I say "She is beautiful" I know, and expect others to recognise that I
consider her beautiful, not that she is objectively beautiful.

Just a thought.

I don't know that that is true.

Just thinking of things that travel through space:
	Light -- EMF
	Gamma rays -- EMF
	radio -- emf
	cosmic radiation -- emf
	other radiation -- emf
	Heat -- doesn't travel in space (radiation that produces heat does)
	sound -- also doesn't travel in space
	mass -- can travel in space but is probably very limited as a
communications medium

So, excluding physics that we are unaware of, the only real method to
communicate in space is radiation.  REGARDLESS of how they code their
information (frequency shift keying, phase shift keying, amplitude keying
(on/off keying), AM, FM, digital methods or analog, there will be spikes in
the spectrum.  Once those spikes are found, the difficulty in interpreting
meaning begins (can we even see the bits?  Are there any bits?  Perhaps it's
ternary instead of binary?  Perhaps it's not even digital?), but
nevertheless we will know that something is being sent (it may be an anomole
of a star)

So, yes, a wide spectrum fourier transform of whatever is to be seen will
give us a very good clue of if something is going on.
Until this, we've been virtually blind.  There's no harm in opening our
eyes.

I don't understand the viewpoint of those who say we're being duped.

That's the problem with this group...  Try to be brief and you
get crucified... [I'm not sure if the converse -- Try to be complete
and the message gets long and ends up DELed -- is true or not.] :-)

Yes, I was aware of this.  The problem is that as the distance
increases so too do the power/antenna requirements.  Our natural
(unintentional) transmissions are designed for "domestic" consumption
and are therefore not very powerful.  For a similar civilization to
detect them very far out is going to require an investment in a very
big receiving antenna.  The further away the civilization is the bigger
the antenna needs to be.

By the time *we* get to the point where we can hear "non-intentional"
transmissions at 950 ly, we will likely be post-singlularity.
[Please note that this is my gut-feel from reading the literature,
a real physicist/astronomer would need to do the calculations so
we could graph the detectable ranges for various transmission
powers and receiver dish sizes.]

By the time *they* get to the point where they can observe us
optically (@ 950 ly) and/or can beam a high power signal
(detectable by a small antenna) intentionally (and continuously
because you never know when we will happen to listen) in our
direction, they are probably post singularity.

If you see the singularity coming (as some of us do), then it
makes no sense at all to transmit anything before that time
(because after it you have so much more power).  If the
trends in fiberization continue, then the time for significant
unintentional broadcasts is shorter than the 100 year figure
(perhaps 60-70 years for TV signals).

I believe that combined these things mean that SETI@home, as
currently designed, seems to have a really small coverage volume
where you might overhear the noise of a nearby civilization at
our level [odds very small IMHO].

If you know that the average pre-radio - post-singularity time
is ~100 years (and this I think depends a *lot* on the star type,
planet, land area, population, etc., etc.), then post-singularity
you have the problem that the further out you look, the fuzzier
your picture gets.  If I'm a post-singularity SI @ 950 light
years, I'm seeing the Earth in year 1050.  I say, well
that looks kind of interesting but I'm not going to waste
my energy sending a signal there for 950 years(!).  And
given my distance and the crooked paths the development of
civilizations take, I'm not going to be able to predict when
I should send a signal (for even a short period).  Given all
that, perhaps the best thing I can do is launch a nanoprobe at 0.9c
(that's cheap since it doesn't weigh very much).  Upon arrival,
it then turns an asteroid in the system into a monitoring post
and builds up enough "intelligence" to function as a proxy for the SI
when the time for "contact" is right.  Given this rationale
and since you have to do the probe design and construct
the mass accelerator, you might as well send a probe to
every star in your "section" of the galaxy.

Since the nanoprobe could just as easily turn the system into
an SI (much to the dismay of our little nematode-level minds),
there must be a reason for not doing that.  Promoting the
increase in galactic diversity is one of the best I can come
up with so far.  I'm open to other suggestions.

Where this gets fun is if you consider the following --
I'm a nanoprobe SI proxy agent, I've been in the solar system
for 4 billion years or so.  Venus was a complete bust,
Mars looked good but fizzled early, Earth is making headway
but you've been watching the reptiles  for 140 million years.
Simulations show that they are going to dominate the planet for
another 100 million years but not give rise to an SI.
I radio the SI and say, simulations show this is going
nowhere fast.  1900 years later a brief message comes back --
"Nuke-em, but make it look like an accident." SIs may have
been around for a long time and probably have a great deal
of patience, but who knows whether or not they stack the
deck once in a while.

Many times we make statements like "She is beautiful" mainly to see if others agree. "Is it
just me, or is it hot in here?"

The difficulty of changing mental habits continues to amaze me. While I don't often evangelize
for E-prime or anything like it, I find it a relatively cheap way to highlight a certain
kind of inflexible and conventional thinking. So I don't see E-prime as an _alternative_
to developing our thinking, just as one tool among many.

By the way, Korzybski, the founder of g.s., thought E-prime missed the point. He had a great
deal of theory built up about how the insights of g.s. could improve people and culture, and
to him the issue of identification went much deeper than grammar. He wrote in his own
idiom which takes most people a great deal of effort to understand. In this (only), he reminds
me of Bucky Fuller.

Probably ferreting out certain incorrect identifications from speech just drives the problem
underground. Every time I use an adjective, I make an opportunity for an unexamined
identification. Another writer in the g.s. community averred that once you have given up
the 'is of identity,' the next priority is to take a hard look at uses of the verb "to have."

I can understand the desire to scrap natural language and start over. Think we should have
a serious look at lojban? It ought to appeal to this crowd - an opportunity to join a
very small elite, that of fluent lojban speakers. So few understand us anyway ...

Yes, I know.  I learned to program on a TRS-80, and my programs were rarely
more than 1K.  However, times change.

Twenty years ago it made sense to lavish extravagant efforts on a quest for
small, efficient code.  The machines of the day were so slow that if you
didn't do this, you couldn't make a usefull program.  Unfortunately, most
programmers still seem to be stuck in that era.

With modern hardware you don't need to do that anymore.  Instead of devoting
50 man-years to build a hand-coded assembler program that runs in 50KB of
memory, you can spend 1 man-year to write a program that does the same thing
but needs more like 500 KB.  The idea that there is something wrong with
that approach is a serious mistake: the scarce resource today is human
effort, not memory.  The same goes for speed optimizations .

The smart way to write an application today is to concentrate your efforts
on good overall design, appropriate feature sets, user interface issues,
etc.  If the final result is a little slow, you can always go back and
re-write the most resource-intensive 1% of the program.  Most of the time
you won't even need to do that, because your program isn't going to put a
serious load on a modern system.  Either way, you will spend far less money
and end up with a much better (in the user's opinion) program that you would
if you obsess on efficiency issues.

In essence, a defect is anything that makes the program different from the
spec it is built to.  It could be anything from a bug that crashes the
program to a typo in a dialog box.  Different organizations classify them
differently, and make different decisions about borderline cases, but all of
the more organized software companies have fairly good written standards
that their development teams must use.

The important thing, however, is to make sure that you use the same
methodology from one project to the next.  That way you can use the numbers
as an actual measure of changes in your own code quality.  Comparisons to
other organizations are a bit less informative, both because standards vary
somewhat and because different companies use different programming
languages.  However, you can still make very rough comparisons (if company A
gets 100 defects per KLOC in C++, and company B gets 500 defects per KLOC,
it probably isn't just a difference in definitions).

If you are seriously interested in this sort of thing, I'd suggest the
following books as an introduction to serious software engineering:

The last is by far the least technical of the three.

Unfortunately, there are good reasons why OpenDoc never went anywhere.

Your first problem is that it introduces truly horrendous user interface
problems.  Either the UI has to be capable of handling any possible
component (in which case the components will be too standardized to allow
for much innovation), or the components get to draw their own windows (which
leads to dialog-box hell).

Your second problem is that most users don't want things to work that way.
They don't want to have to figure out how to juggle the various components
on their computer, picking the right combination for whatever it is they are
doing at the moment.  They want you, the programmer, to do that for them.
Thus, such a system doesn't have much appeal for users.  Since most
programmers don't want it either (I'd rather invoke the component through
code), that doesn't leave you with much of a market.

>Factor - that profoundly effects every operation in the limbic

>the hippocampal area where memory and learning take place, and also the 
>control centers for the entire hormonal system. And neurocardiologist 
>have found that 60 to 65% of the cells of the heart are actually neural

>links called ganglia, with the same axonal and dendritic connections that 
>take place in the brain, as well as through the very same kinds of

>Quite literally, in other words, there is a "brain" in the heart, whose

>brain that we are not even aware of. 
> 
> Kim: How does that work?

> Joe: The heart responds to messages sent to it from the emotional 
>brain, which has been busy monitoring the interior environment of 
>dynamic states such as the emotions and the auto-immune system, guiding 
>behavior, and contributing to our sense of personal identity. The 
>emotional brain makes a qualitative evaluation of our experience of this 
>world and sends that information instant-by-instant down to the heart. 
>In return, the heart exhorts the brain to make the appropriate response. 
>Of course all of this is on the non-verbal level. 
> 
>In other words, the responses that the heart makes effect the entire 
>human system. Meanwhile, biophysicists have discovered that the heart is 
>also a very powerful electromagnetic generator. It creates an 
>electromagnetic field that encompasses the body and extends out anywhere 
>from eight to twelve feet away from it. It is so powerful that you can 
>take an electrocardiogram reading from as far as three feet away from

>can read it from any point on the body and from any point within the 
>field. No matter how microscopic the sample is, you can receive the

>this electromagnetic field effects the brain. All indications are that 
>it furnishes the whole radio wave spectrum from which the brain draws 
>its material to create our internal experience of the world.

>Perhaps most importantly, we now know that the radio spectrum of the

> Joe: Children's emotional experience, how they feel about themselves

> Joe: It's a long story, dating all the way back to the early 1960's 
>when it was discovered that kids' minds go catatonic in front of the

>real, the lower, or the "reptilian" brain does not. This means that when 
>a child views violence on television, the reptilian brain sends a series 
>of alarm messages up to the emotional brain, which in turn immediately 
>contacts the heart. The moment the heart receives any indication of 
>negativity or danger, it drops out of its usual harmonic mode into an 
>incoherent one, triggering the release of the single most potent hormone

I think that the idea of intercepting and decoding communications
between ETCs is fundamentally misguided.  The Powers are using
data-compression techniques so powerful as to be indistinguishable from
line noise.  The human-level civilizations are using encryption
techniques so powerful as to be indistinguishable from line noise - as
John McCluskey points out, galactic economies are likely to be based on
data exchange, so looking for unguarded information is like searching
for 20 dollar bills on the streets of Manhatten.

What we should be looking for is byproducts - for example, a
sphere-shaped region inside a galaxy that contains no stars of a certain
type.  Our telescopes aren't up to that, I think, but you get the idea. 
Does anyone have any ideas about what kind of involuntary signatures
might be left by alien civilizations?

I still think the idea is fundamentally misguided, but it's less
misguided than looking for deliberate signals.

I really don't think we should strike at SETI.  For one thing, it's a
perfectly legitimate endeavor, even if they're doing it for different
reasons.  For another thing, perhaps, say, the New Agers are more our
natural enemies than people who don't measure up to Singularitarian
standards in every possible respect.

I'm familiar with various yogic disciplines that begin this way, and then 
develop concentration by directed visualization. Not sure that's the way 
you're going with this observation. The main "skills" I developed in 
meditation practice were concentration, equanimity, and detachment. "I" would 
like to hear more about where you went with this.

(I see I was too telegraphic.)

Right, they're just models. It's a big revelation the first time you see 
this, and then it becomes more natural. Absent models and conventions, it's 
not possible to converse -- that's a big part of why we are so attached to 
"I" in the first place. 

To a great extent, too, we don't live in the real world, we live in our model 
of it. 

I don't share your low opinion of Minsky and Ornstein, but I think you read 
too much into my reference to them. Neither has anything like a complete 
theory of mind, it's just that what they formulated is more sophisticated 
than what preceded them. Neither they nor I said anything about the modules 
of "the" mind being easily comprehensible. If you're proceeding analytically 
to understand how the human CNS works, you need testable theories, just as in 
any other science. If your main interest is in synthesis, it doesn't 
ultimately matter whether your architecture is brain-like or not. (This would 
be a good place for a summary of current brain research, but catching up on 
that is on my to-do list).

The physics analogy seems more cogent to me. The mind, or at least the mind-
engaged-in-language, builds things the other way, refining image-like 
constructs (can't think of a good term, gestalts perhaps) into linear 
language.

If you get quiet enough, you can "watch" it do it, to some extent, or at 
least get a feel for the extent of the filtering and selection that's going 
on. I agree that a description of the process based only on introspection 
drags in a bunch of concepts that may or may not map to what the CNS is 
really doing.

Perhaps I should illustrate what I mean by fine grain. Let's say I'll
order ~4 k of chips like

	http://products.analog.com/products/info.asp?product=ADSP-21160M

hotglue them onto a stack of perforated plexiglas sheet and wirewrap
them gluelessly into a 16x16x16 DSP array (adding little LED blinkenlights 
to each link port for cuteness value), putting the edge node as a PCI
card into a garden-variety Linux box. So this gives me 2 GBytes of
on-die memory a la 4 MBit each, in toto a ~10 kW heat dissipation
(heck put it into an aquarium filled with Fluorinert and mount an
aircooled heat exchanger on top of that), 2.4 TFlops peak box in 
a half-height 19" rack (for how much? 100..500 k$? ballpark of a
high-end workstation) -- enough horsepower to upload a nematode, or 
even a fruit fly. It's comparatively easy (well, possible) to write 
a nanokernel OS taking 4..16 kByte memory footprint or so, so this 
leaves me with essentially half a MByte/node to work with -- 
however, how do you expect to port Excel to such an architecture? 
How much of Microsoft (or OpenSource stuff, for that matter) 
warez are written as asynchronous message-passing object soup? 

The only reason machines as such are not widespread is that
./configure ; make ; make install is not sufficient to port 
your apps to them. Would make great game machines, though. Modelling,
volume viz/rendering, lots of potential.

I find it kind of ironic that any "singularitarian" would ridicule
SETI; it's precisely the same kind of total speculation.  Sure, it
seems like common sense that exponential progress will continue as
it has, and that there's nothing special about meat-minds that can't
be done with metal-minds; just as it seems like common sense that
we shouldn't be unique in the universe, and that aliens will share
with us some basic ideas of math and physics and communication.  I
firmly believe all of those myself (or at least most of them).

But there's really no solid evidence for any of those things.  I'm
glad there are people willing to invest time and money searching
for things they may never find; some of them get lucky and benefit
us all.  But let's be honest: the only reason to do such a thing
is romance, not rationality.  We shouldn't begrudge others their
own esthetics.

I'm not "striking" at it, I'm bringing our thoughts to the table
for examination.  See my abstact at:
  http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~meech/bioast/program/LEINT.1.9.pdf

The SETI effort IMHO is very valid (though
it has to be done a bit differently).  What "our" ideas
(can I say that?!?) do is strike at, however, is "astronomy"
in general.  There are many assumptions in astronomy
that are determined by Ockham's Razor [the simplest
explanation].  Unfortunately *almost all* astronomers
assume that the UFE (universal fatality [probability]
equation) for intelligent life = 1.  Paraphrasing one
of the gravitational microlensing experts with whom
I dicussed these possibilities (and he was one of the
younger, presumably more open minded individuals)) --
"If what you are saying is true (that SIs are capable
of significant astroengineering), then we can't count
on anything".  I would anticipate a lot more resistance
from the average astronomer than the average SETI researcher
for the simple reason that I'm telling the average SETI
researcher, you are basically correct, you just have limited
your thinking too much.  In contrast, I'm saying to the
average astronomer -- you need to rethink your fundamental
assumptions entirely in the light of an "intelligent"
universe.

> For one thing, it's a perfectly legitimate endeavor,
> even if they're doing it for different reasons.

Agreed.  And they aren't doing it for different reasons.
They want to detect "life" out there.  The only problem
is that many people are limited by the preconception
that the life is like "us", "now".

> For another thing, perhaps, say, the New Agers are more our

I'm not sure if I understand this statement correctly.
If you mean to say that because "New Agers" invoke or
rely upon "magic" for their philosophies or perspectives,
then I would agree.  I have the same distaste for
new-agers that I have for hard-core physicists invoking
"new-magic" (why explain the missing mass as WIMPs
when it can be explained by SIs?).  Existing, generally
accepted physics gives us a *lot* of room to play in --
lets completely explore that before we resort to "magic".

Fundamentally you are up against the meme (hope) that
there isn't an integrated intelligence out there that
is 25+ orders of magnitude above our level.

I gave 4-6 various "types of evidence"
   http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/4030.html

and while individually you may refute them, I would suggest
you will be skating on thin ice refuting them all.

Horse puckies!

To not search for ETs (as SIs), is to argue that the Universal
Fatality [probability] Equation = 1 (or the Intelligent-Life-Evolves
equation is very very close to zero (of the order of << 10^-9).

I don't see those arguments, so I'm not impressed!

We are proof that intelligent life *can* evolve, so the
real question is the frequency.

If intelligent life does evolve with any frequency, then
the question is the rate (and time) of transition to an
SI level.

Maybe the SI transition probability = 0 -- make the argument!

SETI is searching for religious leaflets being handed out on the streets
of Manhattan.  We know that when two societies come into contact
whose technological levels differ greatly, the less advanced civilization
is always greatly destabilized, as the younger and more forward thinking
in the less advanced society begin to urge the others to give up the
old traditional ways.  Specifically they seek extinction of superstitions,
since the more advanced seem to be doing fine without them.

SETI is seeking signals that were intentionally made easy to detect and
decode, sent by the orginators in the hope that we may give up our
superstitious and warlike ways, thereby becoming safer and saner
citizens of the galaxy. spike

When 'Hello, World!' takes over 350 K in Borland's C++ to function,
SOMETHING is wrong. Think of how much incredibly faster our present
machines would seem if the massive overhead of 'everything to everyone'
library code and functions were coded with the love lavished in days of yore.

Yes, I know - we can't afford to hand code modern software. But a bit of
time spent in producing optimized libraries and thinking about what is NOT
needed would skinny things down quite a bit. This effort only needs to be
done once - at the compiler writer's workstation.

I believe a serious problem with programmers today is that they are forced
in many cases by managers with little or no knowledge of coding to use
things like C++ in places where they are not needed. Some 'good rules' of
modern programming, slavishly followed, result in bloatware. 

One of my customers makes appliance controllers. These are four, eight and
sixteen bit microcontrollers with as little as 4K of ROM, and as much as
256K. Their parent corporate managers have decreed that 'all programs
written from now on' will use 'object oriented design'. The libraries they
have produced so far are almost twice as complex as the same code written
by 'hand', and they end up being modified anyway once the programmer finds
that the code misses fitting into the processor by a few hundred bytes. Oh,
yeah - another of management's hot buttons is ROM size, since they can save
a few cents using a smaller processor.

I write a lot of C for embedded processors like the 8051, and the resulting
machine language is very close to what I would have done if I was writing
in assembly. Why can't modern high level compilers at least attempt to
produce tight code?

I agree fully. If only we could keep management out of the coding arena!
They should supply the specifications at the most, not dictate coding styles.

Or, as has already been pointed out, they could have been farther away but
further advanced: e.g., 200 light years away, 200 years ahead of us.

Er, shouldn't that be "the number of Earth-like planet supporting stars in a
sphere of 100 light years radius"? More like 31000 cubic light years. and
that's not even taking into account the previous point regarding the 100 ly
number.

Nobody here thinks that SETI will *probably* detect an ETI. It seems silly
not to try, though.

Which organization is accepting donations for that? If there isn't one, why
don't you form one? Do something more constructive than telling people
running SETI@home that they're dupes.

Even Joe Sixpack knows that SETI isn't guaranteed to find anything. That's
why they call it a "search".

 I tried Prozac for awhile as an experiment based on
 the "Listening to Prozac" book and found that Prozac
 reduced the frequency of my spontaneous thoughts about
 sex and reduced the desire for sex.  However, I found

I've been on Prozac for over a year now and it hasn't reduced my sex drive

libido more out of control than ever.

Ya that drum bit was a joke.  I am trying to cut down on the {8^Ds.
Eliezer and more serious, focussed crowd are filtering me. {8-[

I did have an idea tho.  Consider all the dark matter out there.  We
think we could detect a Dyson Sphere by the low frequency radiation
that would need to be emitted by reason of conservation of energy.
But what if... the universe is a dangerous place?  Then any ETI that
has any brains knows to hide.  Could not a really advanced ETI build
a Dyson sphere, then somehow collect the waste energy, collimate the
radiation into a narrow beam and focus it out in some harmless (starless)
direction?  Are there SF stories based on this explanation of dark matter?

Given enough raw material, it seems that a really out-there nanotech
civilization could make a sphere and keep its surface at 3 kelvin, so
that it would be undetectable by us less advanced (and therefore more
dangerous) intelligences.  Do we have any thermodynamics experts
out there who can confirm that such a scheme does not violate the
third law?  Seems to me it doesnt.  spike

Of course.  In a sense, people do that now.  One example is the previously
mentioned extropian smokers, who hope nanotech will come along and repair
the damage.  Did not our society go through a wave of careless screwing
when we developed penecillin?  When there were rumors of AIDS having
a cure a couple years ago, there was a wave of new cases (Oh boy!  Toss
the balloons, Baby!)

Speaking for myself, there are a lotta things I would looove to try, if I
knew my body could be repaired, such as racing motorcycles.  And
of course the careless screwing would be nice too...  {8^D  spike

A Celeron, put quite plainly, is a POS. It has a really pissy small

Billy sorry about the slow answer.  Ive been on the road a lot
this summer and just now found this in my unanswered inbox.

The Star Wars movie got me to thinking that strong nanotech
could result in a device that is kinda analogous to a neuron, except
much smaller.  I imagined that a number of them could interconnect
themselves with carbon nanotubes, thereby forming a webby
cocoon around a mitochondrion, living on a small amount of
excess ATP.  If each of these nanoneurons and its interconnection
were made of, say sixty thousand carbon atoms, and there were a
billion of them on the surface of a mitochondrion, the mitochondrion
would never know they were there.  The combined mass of the
billion nanoneurons would be about one nanogram.  Peach
fuzz on an elephant.

You are both wrongly assuming that all technological civilizations would
have similar exponent courves in technological/population development. 
You are assuming that EVERY society will want to transcend, rather than
just staying at a comfortable early 21st century level. You are also
wrongly assuming that following a singularity by some percentage of the
population that the rest of the population just dissapears. 

Try thinking otherwise.

What about gravity waves (or even neutrinos?
Bloody hard to work with, though.
So I guess they would plump for EMF.

 This very much depends on whether we actually
eavesdrop on normal radio traffic, or find
a purposeful beacon (permanent or in response to our
signals). The ETs' unintentional radio emanation
might disappear as tech evolved, but the beacon
is something that we could count on for a longer term
and over greater distances.

Indeed. The whole point is we cannot make too many
assumptions. Atleast SETI@home allows us an
inexpensive crack at it.

But the entire discussion revolves around what do you devote your
(computer) time to, given your perception of the odds of success.
I'll admit that many people may care nothing about the odds and
probably care much more about a self-perceived "cool" use of their
computer.

I've responded to this.  If they are at the level where they can
waste away energy on continuous omnidirectional signals *or*
have the technology to "see" us (200 years ago), they are most
likely very near or post-singularity.  It is worth noting that
while we are making efforts to "listen", we have done very little
intentional "transmitting" (due to the requirement for using
valuable radiotelescope listening time as well as expensive power).
Since pre-singularity economics are pretty ruthless, I would expect
this generally to be the case for aliens (though I could see their
being rare exceptions, e.g. wierd tribal customs requiring talking to
the "gods" in the sky, etc.)

For the record, Sullivan et al (Science 199:377-388 (1978)) showed that:
- An Arecibo-size antenna could detect UFH TV out to 2 light-years
  and the U.S. BMEWS military radar out to 20 ly.
- The Cyclops array (which was never built because the cost was something
  like $1 Billion+, could extend these ranges to 25 and 250 light years.

So, the implicit assumptions in SETI@home would seem to be that
  (a) they are very close; or
  (b) they are devoting a lot of power to talking to us

That's what I get for doing these things late at night. How about
4 pi(100)^3 / 3  which works out to about 4 million ly^3.  The
general point would be that most people plug 200 billion stars
(in our galaxy) into the Drake equation (a volume of something
like 10^15 ly^3) and say "they must be out there".  The SETI@home
receiving antennas only have the ability to listen to a small
fraction of that (order of 1000 stars if I'm doing my math right
and we assume 100 ly detectability which rests on the assumption
that they are transmitting at a power level significantly greater
than our level).

If I can't persuade the SETI/2MASS people to look seriously at

It depends which SETI people you mean.  People like those at
the SETI Inst. or the general population running SETI@home.

The detailed calculations like those regarding radio detection,
or building 1,000,000 channel receivers, or designing programs
to unscramble signals where the encoding method is a mystery,
are not simple.  The SETI Inst. and related groups are very
good at what they do.  It would be silly (at least initially)
to duplicate their work.  It makes sense to try to enroll them
in looking at things a little differently in light of knowledge
I (& many Extropians) may generally accept, but they are unaware of.

If they see the light, then they can modify their public education
efforts and computer time allocation system to handle both perspectives.  
Only if that fails, would it make sense to try and create a
competitive effort.  As I've said before, I think the probability
that we currently have datasets to detect SIs is low, it may be
only slightly better than the radio-SETI data.  The current
collection of SETI people are better equipped than I am to make
the proposals to to other astronomers that would be required
to get the telecope time to get better data! 

This forum serves as a good one in which to flush out how people
will react to some of the claims so I'm better prepared to deal
with the bioastronomers & hard core SETIists.

I don't have a lot of expertise on these issues, but here's a few
comments: the public-key crypto algorithms I understand are all based on
the discrete logarithm, knapsack, or factoring problems.  All of these
problems will be soluble if quantum computers become available.  (Discrete
log is also being used over elliptic curves; quantum computers can
certainly break some such schemes, but those schemes are still in a state
of flux.)

(At least some of the knapsack based algorithms are breakable
classically.)

There is another class of schemes whose security is based on the "shortest
vector in a lattice problem".  I don't understand these schemes at all.
Variants of the this problem are known to be NP-complete; I haven't
understood the proof yet, however.  I gather that the security of these
schemes is still quite open to question.

Based on the conversations we had at Foresight in May, I think one of the 
more intriguing proposals for empirically verifying his ideas that Robert 
Bradbury will make in his upcoming presentation on bioastronomy is based on 
the thermodynamic radiation of waste heat by SIs.  As I recall, it's based on 
the idea that completely masking waste heat is something that even the most 
advanced SI can't do and that a systematic search for the signature of that 
heat is something within our current technological capabilities..

Just a personal comment: The discussion Robert and I had at Foresight about 
this subject was one of the most stimulating I can remember for years.  I 
really don't think Robert meant any disrespect to the SETI crowd with his 
initial post in this thread, but rather, as he tried to explain, he was using 
a little turbocharged rhetoric to get some well-deserved attention for the 
truly impressive amount of work he's done on this subject.  After listening 
to him explain his ideas at the white board and then field questions from 
some of the certifiably smartest people on the planet, I can assure you that 
although he might be wrong, his ideas are extremely well thought-out.  I 
remember thinking that the scene at Los Alamos when Von Neuman proposed the 
idea of galactic exploration with self-replicating probes must have been 
something like that . . .

I'm not making this assumption.  Dyson argued 40 years ago, even
if we slowed ourselves down to a 1% annual growth rate, we still
reach a power consumption level of the entire solar output
in only 3000 years!  Another SETI researcher made the point
it is difficult to imagine a society that could maintain a 0.000000...%
growth rate for thousands (or millions) of years (either you have an
accident or you decay away *or* you eventually evolve to your
environmental limits).

Growth is a fact of life.  It is built into Nature.  Population biologists
tell you that populations grow to the limits of the environment and then
crash when conditions change for the worse.  I would argue that it is
highly difficult for Nature to evolve "internal" limits.  The limits
are "imposed" by the environment.  Look what happens in situations
involving the introduction of a non-indigenous species (say rabbits
in Australia) -- if the environment is suitable the species expands to the
allowable limits.  In most other environments you don't see it
because everything is in balance between the predators and the prey
and the food resources and the reproduction rate.

I would also argue that by definition "technological civilizations"
get on pretty exponential growth paths.  Humans didn't have exponential
growth (in fact we were barely surviving as a species) *until* we
developed the technologies that allowed us to manipulate the
environment in ways more sophisticated than our genetic program allowed.

I believe you have to make a concrete case that a developing technological
species/civilization would consciously *choose* to terminate its growth.
That means that you have to negate the fundamental self-preservation
and/or reproductive instincts necessary for life.  As I've discussed
in other threads -- if you want to be immortal, you have to eliminate
reproduction -- if you want to reproduce, you have to choose to die
(or prevent the development of technologies that enable personal
immortality).  There *are* hard limits to growth.  There may be a few
examples of Vulcans in the galaxy, but they should not be in the majority
(the majority would seem to be those species that take as much as
they can and hold it the longest).   The exception to that would
appear to be cultures that follow a trans-humanist (trans-Natural-ist?)
path where they mentally/genetically engineer out the drives that
nature builds in.

As far as the exponential growth goes, we have a pretty good example
in the computer industry and Moore's law (before that it might
have been the industrial revolution and before that agriculture).
Can you make a good argument that any of these paths could have
been "consciously" arrested?  If you want to volunteer to stop
the $200 Billion/year+ electronics industry, I'll be happy to
sit back and watch.  If you can't stop it, then Moravec/Minsky
would seem to have a case -- we may not know how to create
intelligence (other than the good ole natural way), but if
we keep at it long enough we should figure it out.  Biotech
enabled super-longevity and nanotech enabled ultra-longevity
would seem to fall under the same development principles.

> You are assuming that EVERY society will want to transcend, rather than
> just staying at a comfortable early 21st century level.

The environmental movement has been trying for 30-40 years to
"stop" our growth without much success.  The primary reason
is hasn't worked is that we can siphon off a fraction of our
productivity growth and technological capacities and
apply these to solving the environmental problems.  It is
pretty clear at this point that we can develop the
technologies to expand to the limits allowed on the planet
and then off the planet.  That realization should occur
in any other technological civilization as well (if you
wait long enough).

Dr. Hekimi (the discover of the clk gene in nemetodes), once
made the comment to me -- "if man can imagine it and it
is possible, sooner or later he will do it".  That seems
very to true me, it seems to arise from the nature
of competition and the direct or indirect advantages
one derives from creating something new, different or better.

If evolving to the limit of physics *is* feasible, and "life"
is designed to "evolve", can you make a case for the cessation
of evolution?

No, not really.  It doesn't matter in my mind whether
  (1) Bill Gates turns himself into an M-Brain and turns off the
      sun on the rest of us.
  (2) We all (every single individual who wants it) turns themselves
      into a unified collective M-brain and
	(a) Takes the Hydrogen in Jupiter and leaves the solar system,
            leaving behind the luddites who didn't want to join us.
        (b) Dismantles every single aggregate of atoms in the solar
            system (other planets, asteroids, earth (and the luddites
            on it), the sun, etc.) for reformation into an optimal
            computational architecture.

The point would be that in in both (1) and (2) you still get an M-Brain
and M-Brains seem to have lifetimes of the order of the longevity of
the universe.  In 2a the luddites probably have a maximum lifetime
of a few billion years (until the sun becomes a red-giant), unless
they decide to move the planet or "manage" the sun (then they aren't
luddites any more).  Since the M-Brains are now at the top of the
evolutionary ladder (biggest, most intelligent, longest lived, able
to anticipate and avoid any potential hazards, etc.) they have to become
the most populous "species".  [Survival of the fittest.]

M-brains don't *have* to harvest or dismantle any of the
luddites or their star (there is plenty of other material around
from which to construct and power themselves at the time of the
singularity).  Whether they chose to behave that way may depend a
lot on the path by which they develop -- a self-evolving
AI with no "moral" code probably would consume us to optimize
itself, on the other hand if the M-brain is constructed from
uploads of us, it might harbor some nostalgia towards the Earth
and/or the sun and leave them intact. 

For all of this not to happen, I believe you have to make the case
that substantially all of the individuals who are members of an
evolving technological species (on the slippery slope towards the
singularity), universally decide -- "This far and no further".
The "anti-technology-police" would have to enforce the decision on the
non-believers.  As Ben Bova has pointed out in his recent "Immortality"
book, that is a very difficult thing to do because of the benefits
one personally derives from breaking the rules.  [BTW, this book
is worth reading -- see my review comment on Amazon.]

[Yes, a technological civilization, might consist of a species
that has a single or collective mind (instead of a collection
of individual minds), but are they all?]

You may believe that an M-brain is a bad idea, but I assure you,
that if I get my hands on a nanoassembler first, I'm not stopping
until I've got around 10^20 distributed replicated copies of myself
[that leaves room for anyone else that wants to hop on the boat,
since the idea of talking to that many copies of myself for the
next 100 billion years or so seems really unpleasant... :-)].

There is one objection to all of this and that is that the waters
of the singularity slope are so rough that virtually *all*
civilizations capsize trying to navigate them.  However you
have to invoke a grey goo type scenario that so totally destroys
the civilization that it never recovers to approach the singularity
river ever again.

As a sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent home to lemurs, our house 
provides a great place for observing the "low end" of the primate spectrum.  
Our newest addition, a three month old ringtail named Newton, just discovered 
mirrors last night.  (At this age a lemur corresponds in lemur-terms to a 
young toddler, I'd say.)  Like the others we've fostered or adopted before, 
he immediately perceived the mirror as a hole in the wall with another lemur 
on the other side.  Newton's social instincts kicked in and he instantly 
jumped to go through the "hole in the wall" to interact with the "other" 
lemur -- with predictable results.  Within seconds, he was involved in a 
detailed exploration of this new phenomenon, making small movements and 
watching the image in the mirror.  As with every other lemur I've watched do 
this, Newton then settled into a session of absorbed staring into the mirror. 
 What DIDN'T happen is behavior typically triggered by the presence of 
another lemur, i.e. social signaling.

The grand old man in our house, a six year old brown lemur named Darwin, 
seems to know exactly what's going on with mirrors.  He'll spend a little 
time checking himself out and even use the mirror to play games with us and 
other animals in the house (his mastery of mirrors clearly giving him an 
advantage in the game of cat-and-lemur).

Well, lemurs certainly haven't been selectively bred by humans.  With 
patience, my wife and I have learned to mesh instinctive human and lemur 
social behaviors with a common suite of learned behaviors on both sides of 
the widest possible gap between primates.  While there's no question in my 
mind after years of study and personal interaction with these little 
creatures that their minds are far simpler than ours, I feel pretty sure that 
there's some minimal level of "consciousness" in there.  They use tools after 
a fashion (Darwin uses small objects to scratch his back and inside his ears, 
choosing them carefully, and knows how to use a doorknob) and they concoct 
simple plans in pursuit of their constant desire to stir up mischief.

That was what got me thinking about this a couple of years ago
when I first realized how significantly our astroengineering
capacites change at the time of the singularity.

Depends on the temperature.  A "young" M-brain probably doesn't
have enough matter to fill its outer shells, so it might be "warm"
(perhaps 50-1000K).  An "old" M-brain could have collected enough
matter to fill the outer shells and therefore be "cold" (slightly
above the microwave background.  Cold is good for both
the preservation of long term memories (for data you don't
really need access to for the next 10 million years) and
it gives you the greatest thermodynamic efficiency.  I've
considered that the anisotropy in the microwave background
radiation could be due to greater or lesser concentrations
of M-brains in various regions of space.  [But I would suggest
that this idea will not make the astronomers happy. :-)]

However, one well informed person I've talked to thinks that
if star dismantlement is feasible, that the optimal architecture
would be diamondoid based shells that could operate @ ~1500-1700K.

I'm not sure it matters much since our observing capabilities at
this point in the mid-to-far IR region are very poor.  We have
a difficult time finding warm brown dwarf's (which are hotter
than M-Brains) beyond ~400 ly.

I assume you mean dangerous from the perspective of other aggressive
intelligences.

No, I thought about this after I read "The Killing Star" by
Pellegrino & Zebrowski.  For an SI to want to make war
(unless it is suicidal), it has to be able to guarantee
that it can wipe out *all* traces of its enemy.  That
would require incinerating, irradiating, or black-hole-izing
*all* possible nanobots in a very large volume of space.
I strongly question if that is possible.  This might be
a worthy effort as "revenge", but seems questionable
as an evolutionary strategy in general.

Since the MAD (mutually assured destruction) scenario would
seem to prevail (because all SIs would have berserker-nanobots
hidden somewhere) it would never seem to make sense to
do anything that would trigger the response.

This seems quite feasible.  Enough highly reflective layers
(a large multi-layer solar-sail) on one side would cut the
radiation signature significantly.  It could also be an
intereresting form of propulsion/navigation.

Not that I know of, but "The Killing Star" (already mentioned),
and "The Wanderer" by Fritz Leiber discuss some aspects of
super-astro-engineering.

My impression is that it doesn't violate the the laws and does in
fact give you the best computing structure.  The problem is that
power in has to equal power out.  If you surround the star, to
radiate at ~3K you need a *really* big sphere.  This is because
heat radiation scales with T^4  (i.e. hot radiators are much
more efficient (smaller) than cold radiators).  Think about Neptune and
perhaps Pluto - the He/H2/Ne/O2 if retained by the gravity isn't "frozen"
solid.  They are heated by the sun.   [This is true to some degree
with Jupiter & Saturn, but you have to factor in the
heating due to ongoing gravitational collapse as well.]

In our solar system, my calculations show that you don't have
enough mass to get a 3K radiator (at least if you want to
circulate the cooling fluid from the computers and use all
of the power the sun produces).  If your only goal is to
"hide" I'm unsure.  Given the solar sail idea, I suspect
"hiding" is relatively easy.

I only followed the first few posts in this thread.   I recommend reading
"Why Man Needs Approval" Marsha Familaro Enright (_Objectivity_ 1(2)).
Sadly, this essay has not been placed on the web.  (_Objectivity_'s web page
is at http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/.)

Anyway, to some extent, what Enright believes seems to be that friends and
lovers in a sense make our lives fuller because they satisfy a basic need
for self-perception.  I.e., we see ourselves through others -- in much the
same way that we need a mirror to see our faces.

Why is self-perception of this sort necessary?  If my memory's correct, it's
because we need to be able to experience our achievements (personality-wise)
in a full way -- a way we can't given that we're always on the inside
looking out.  In a lot of ways, this is very Hegelian, though the point
Enright is making is psychological NOT ontological.

Ergo, from a transhumanist perspective, we might ask, do we need this aspect
of our psychology?  If we don't, can we edit it out?  If we do, how can we
refine or fit it into what we wish to and will become?

Cheers!

I'm sorry I missed this earlier discussion, but when I

coercion, the point being if behavior didn't need to be

that isn't influenced by rules which take into account the

Well...  Evolution by natural selection has ingrained scores
of complicated rules for social interaction into human
brains.
True, the advent of human culture has created some elbow
room whereby those rules are revised and amended in ways
the selfish genes never intended (called learning), but this
recent development has not amounted to a wholesale rewriting
of our moral programming.  As culture and experience are
absorbed by our newly conscious minds, these memes interact
in a formulaic way with the tons of evolutionary garbage
which still occupies most of our lobe space.

>2) It is immoral to try.

To give robots Asimov-type laws would be a planned effort to
do to them what evolution has done to us - make them capable
of co-existing with others.  We are already finding portions
of our evolutionary moral heritage distasteful, and when we
do we
revise it using the tools of culture such as law (ie,
outlawing rape
and murder, two perfectly respectable moral choices from an
evolutionary perspective).  In the future we'll continue to
do
this using the more powerful tools of neuroscience and the
like.

When we develop robots that become members of society, they
will need the kind of moral frame of reference that we take
for
granted.  If they are to have the capacity of self
awareness,
then we recognize that their learning and experience will
enable
them to revise their internal programming just as modern
humans
have.

Superior in the Nietzschean sense?  Set a default option for
moral nihilism on our future AI's and thats just what we'll
get.
Nothing is more superior (from an individual's perspective)
than the ability to be caluculating and wholly without
compunction.

I guess I'm really not too far from you on this.  I agree
that we
can't prevent intelligent beings from evolving their own
moral
ideas, not because we shouldn't but just because it probably
isn't possible.

Anyway, social systems can be buit for amoral sentients -
modern police states alredy exist to accomade an
increasingly
cultured and "morally flexible" populace.

The thing I don't understand is *when* you do this count.  Do the
programmers just keep a log of every mistake they make?  Do you count your
defects up after the product ships.  For instance, in this e-mail do I count
just the errors per line when I send it or while I'm typing (I just went to
type 'while' and started with an 'h' - 'started' just went through about
three different erroneous phases - 'phases' just came out as 'pahses' - I
just misspelled (correctly) the misspelling of 'phases'... and so on)?  In
short, when do you stop correcting and start counting?

The UI could handle any possibility but as I said the programmer would have
to be removed from the interface.  You would have to use a standardised
document object model so that, in the true spirit of Opendoc, components
acted on documents.  The UI would be a challenge for sure, but it's about
time someone did something in UI-design rather than just speculating about
the wonders of speech-recognition.  (Won't speech recognition interfaces
require this sort of component-based model anyway?)

This requires self-organising interfaces.  Self-organising interfaces
require semantics-rich documents.  Semantics-rich documents require
context-aware user environments.  Context-aware user environments require
self-organising interfaces.

It's worth trying, I think.  What I'd like to see is a test-bed for this and
other ideas.  A semantics-rich context-aware self-organising user
environment with a hyperlinking file system.  I've got it all worked out,
now all I need is an army of programmers with too much time on their hands.

Is this the same as the idea of passing key data to two receivers by using 
quantum-coupled photons? The idea is that detecting the spin at one end 
collapses the spin to be the same at the other end, and any attempt to 
intercept the bits will be easily detected. However, this would require 
prearrangement and dedicated lines, so it's no replacement for public key 
crypto.

It does have the distinction of being the first absolutely secure solution to 
the problem of distributing one-time pad key material, and therefore to the 
provably uncrackable cryptosystem problem as well.

That's amazing, both that you live with lemurs and that they are able to
respond to mirrors in this way.  If you come up behind them when they are
looking in the mirror, do they know to turn around?

I have two disagreements with the critique of SETI.

The first is the claim that superintelligences (SIs) would not want
to talk to us because we don't want to talk to nemotodes.  I argued
previously in another context that this is a false analogy (I used the
example of insects).  We don't talk to insects because they can't talk.
They don't talk to each other, either.

To make the analogy valid, we have to look at the modes of communications
that lower animals use, and ask whether we interact with them at that
level.  This would correspond to SIs who talk to us at our level, even
though they communicate amongst themselves in more sophisticated ways.

I suggest that we do interact with lower animals at the level that they
interact with themselves.  An insect has a simple model of the world,
adequate to find food, avoid predators, mate and survive.  We do interact
with insects at this level.  Insects are able to survive and even thrive
around humans.  We are part of the same physical universe and from the
insects' point of view we are interacting and communicating with them
just like other parts of the universe.

As our technologies improve and we learn more about insects, we will
become even better at communicating with them in their own terms.  We will
learn to use chemical messengers and other methods to interact with them.
This would be closely analogous to an SI speaking to us in our own
terms.

Even though we are not capable of understanding all of what SIs say to
each other, it is still plausible that they might choose to communicate
with us at our level.  Our own experiences with lower animals suggest
that there are many motivations for higher animals to communicate with
lower ones.

The second point is that it does not seem productive to imagine that
the universe is heavily engineered by active SIs.  Throughout history,
we have succeeded by assuming the opposite, that there is no higher
intelligence or higher power behind the observations that we make.
In fact much of our scientific progress is due directly to discarding
this notion that Thor makes the thunder and Apollo drags the sun across
the sky and God created the animal species.

Why should we decide, now, that when there is a mystery in our
observations, that intelligence is probably behind it?  It's never been
true before.  We face a solar neutrino discrepancy now.  Maybe SIs are
engineering the sun?  We have a missing mass problem.  Maybe SIs are hiding
mass?  We don't have a good model for how life started.  Maybe SIs brought
life to earth?

Such "answers" are the end to inquiry.  Sufficiently advanced technologies
are magical and there is little we can say about them.

The weakest part of this theory is the assumption that although the
universe is full of SIs they are not here in the solar system.  It seems
very implausible that they would have left our solar system untouched for
all time.  This means that we must reconsider the possibility of divine
intervention throughout history.  This is an historically unproductive
tactic but it is the inescapable consequence of considering that we live
in a universe fully populated with superintelligences.

I suggest reading Robin Hanson's article which takes at face value
the absence of stellar engineering, and draws conclusions from it:
http://hanson.berkeley.edu/greatfilter.html.

        Nathaniel Branden has recently revised his biography of
philosopher- novelist, Ayn Rand.  While not explicitly extropic, Rand's
books and overall perspective of life have been a major influence on many
extropians.  Though the essence of her philosophy espoused rational thought
and the application of moral reason in all areas of one's life, Branden
subtly shows that her own life had many areas of irrationality, paranoia
and contradictory ethics.  Though it does nothing to dampen the objective
reality of her own philosophy, _My Years With Ayn Rand_ is definitely an
eye-opener into the way Rand truly lived her life.  Well worth reading.

(Clipped from Tod Maffins Future file)

*SMART BRA
Muggers beware  your next victims high tech undergarments could land you
in jail. A British inventor is working on a security bra that can tell if
its wearer is being attacked and notify authorities with her precise
location. The Smart Bra acts like any normal brasseire until its built-in
heart monitor detects the rapid jumps in heart rate that denote sudden
scares. An on-board GPS device then kicks into action, pinpointing the
wearer's location, and the small cell-phone built in the strap calls police.
Though still a hand-built prototype, the bra's electronics are embedded in a
thin, gel-like substance only 3 millimeters thick  thats thinner than most
traditional bra liners. The inventor hopes to have a commercial deal this
summer, with the smart bra out next year  giving police an easier way to
make a bust.
~World War I dealt the bra a fatal blow when the U.S. War Industries
Board called on women to stop buying bras in 1917.  It freed up more than
28,000 tons of metal.

*ELECTRONIC SNIFFER
Ever been frustrated at the grocery store trying to figure out which fruit
is most ripe?  In the future, let an electronic nose do the testing for you.
Engineers at the University of Warwick have developed a device that is
poised to help both the fruit industry and ordinary shoppers. Most of the
traditional methods that have been used to assess fruit ripeness have ended
up in the destruction of a piece of fruit. But researchers have put together
the sensors of an electronic nose coupled to a neural network to produce a
device that calculate the exact ripeness of the fruit by its smell. Once the
electronic nose has been trained on a particular fruit it doesnt require
a skilled operator and can obtain the results in a few seconds with over 92%
accuracy.
~The human nose can detect the odor of artificial musk in such low
concentrations as one part musk to 32 billion parts of air.

SOUND-BLOCKING CURTAINS
Weve got curtains that block light, curtains that block fire  now comes
word that scientists have developed curtains that block sound. And their
first market  hospitals and nursing homes. The Quiet Curtains work like
this: Sheets of noise shielding material are sandwiched between two pieces
of fabric and supported by a unique pocket system. A variety of materials
can be used for the noise shields -- ranging from cardboard to metal,
depending on how much noise you want to reduce. The researchers, from the
Georgia Institute of Technology, say its probably not that unique a
concept, but theyre surprised nobodys come up with it yet. So far, tests
have found the futuristic curtains can reduce noise by more than 12
debibels, a reduction of sound intensity by a factor of 16. Though initially
designed with nursing homes in mind, you can expect variations of these
Quiet Curtains to show up in offices, hotels, libraries, and even motor
vehicles  in the future.

Neutrinos are rather easy to generate, as they are produced by many
nuclear reactions.  But they are very difficult to detect, and even more
difficult to control, using present technology.  It is believed that
trillions of neutrinos pass thru an object the size of a human body each
second.  Most neutrinos which strike the earth pass right on thru without
interacting with anything.  There are already so many neutrinos coursing
thru the space around us that even if we did have a reliable method of
detecting them there would still be the problem of sorting out the ones
which carry the message we are looking for.  There are believed to be
several different types of neutrinos, and some types might have a small
amount of mass.


We use photons to carry messages (radio, TV, etc.).  With photon
communication, frequency filters and (sometimes) directivity of antennas
are used to sort out the particular photons which carry the message we
are looking for.  For example, the channel selector on a TV set controls
a frequency filter, and a receivers for signals from satellites sometimes
use a directive dish antenna which must be pointed at the appropriate
satellite, thus excluding photons from other directions.


Gravitons are not photons.  Gravitons, if they exist, would be the
particles which mediate the graviational force, just as photons are the
particles which mediate the electromagnetic force.  Gravitational waves
are thought to be produced when matter accelerates or vibrates.  They are
thought to travel thru space at the speed of light, and they are very
difficult to detect with present technology.  Gravity waves are a
different phenomenon than gravitational waves.  Gravity waves are waves
consisting of the motion of fluid matter in a gravitational field.  The
ripples on the surface of a pond are called gravity waves.

Horse puckies (again).  If we take Moravec's three examples
(1) Deep Blue, (2) The math theorem proving program the
government reseachers have developed, (3) Moravec's student's
"Car Driving" program, in all 3 cases I would say that have
software which is beginning to approach human "intelligence"
(though lacking self-awareness or a mind per se).   If you
extend these efforts another 10 years in computer evolution,
then you have hardware/software combinations that do stuff
"more intelligently", or at least "more skillfully" than humans.
In these instances it is perfectly reasonable to encode into the
program "lick my feet".  There will be a big industry designing
& programming sex dolls who look, act, talk, etc. like a former
lover or spouse (or some famous Hollywood star) but to
ultimately be under your control.  Just as people will spend
hours advancing through levels of a computer game, or hours
doing a crossword puzzle, or hours figuring out how to manipulate
their boss into giving them a raise, they will spend hours
trying to figure out how to make these machines behave exactly
they way they want them to.  Bored with your current model,
just call up HomoRobotics, Inc. and ask them to upgrade the
behavior module to include some new random patterns.

As more R&D goes into this, it will be harder and harder for
you to tell the Robot from the real thing.  There are
a host of situations now in which humans "willingly suspend
disbelief".  All it takes is one or two cases where the
"artificial" seems more interesting than the "natural" and thats
what you will go with.

> recent development has not amounted to a wholesale rewriting
> of our moral programming.

So true.  Witness Rawanda, Kosovo or war in general.
If a situation arises where a group as a whole says it is
ok to throw out the "moral module", then that is what happens.
Proves the point that this stuff really is software.
There has been a lot of stuff in the news lately
discussing those situations when apes turn on other apes.
These are very old behaviors, dictated by survival drives.

Actually, the evolutionary garbage is probably a relatively small
fraction of your brain.  For example your sex drive mostly arises
in the amygdala (Sci. News 155:406 (6/26/99)).  The lobes can
be dedicated to many things; sometimes the amygdala convinces
them to focus most of the thought space to having sex.  It
turns out you can control the amygdala "size" by removing
or adding testosterone...

It might be immoral to attempt to control another sentient "being"
but I don't think we have a test for "sentience" yet.

I believe that we can build into a robot these things:
  (a) goal seeking (= to genetic drives), but instead of the goal
      "reproduce & raise children", I substitute the dog drive
      "make my master happy".  If I'm crazy I substitute a cat drive :-).
  (b) complex humanish behaviors (necessary to solve goal seeking problems)
  (c) mood swings (depending on how successful the goal seeking is)
  (d) observe and copy other patterns (3-5 years of TV soap operas
      in my memory banks should cover most of the possibilities :-))
  (e) random creativity (necessary when existing goal seeking
      strategies don't work) - though this would have to be
      constrained in some areas [see below].
  (f) self-awareness of the success or failure of my goal-seeking
      as well as the ability to pass the mirror test
  (g) The ten commandments (or another set of moral codes).

I'm pretty sure that most of this could be done "top down"
though there would probably have to be a lot of "fuzzy" logic.

Now, this is going to be a very intelligent and fairly human-like
machine (it is a really big finite state automata).  I'm not
going to have any problem telling it exactly what to do
since it isn't "sentient" in my book.

> To give robots Asimov-type laws would be a planned effort to

Yep, probably better than we do, since the moral code can
be imprinted so as to be irrevocable.  

> When we develop robots that become members of society,

Hold on, who said anything about "members of society".
Now you've jumped the "sentience", "personhood" and
"rights" barrier.  A robot is my property, it doesn't
get voting rights.

> If they are to have the capacity of self awareness,

Self-awareness is not "sentience".  It's easy to make a
machine aware of its internal state.  A good robot could
even do a stack trace and tell you exactly why it selected
a specific behavior in a specific circumstance (something
most humans can't easily do).

Before you let a Robot loose on the street, you are going
to have to *prove* that it isn't a threat to anyone.
I suspect that means that if a Robot invents a new behavior
it is going to have to be approved by an oversight committe
as "safe".  Perhaps once we start thinking about this
we will discover there are inherently safe creative paths
that the Robot is allowed and those which are potentially
risky that are prohibited.

You are going to have to be careful about this -- if
a Robot decides humans are unreliably moral and robots
can be made reliably moral, then the moral thing is to
correct this problem (and eliminate us...).

Aha -- but you shifted from the laws of Robotics to intelligent
*beings* - since it would seem that a moral system (at least the
way I think of them) are designed to protect a person's rights
or "beingness" you haven't said from what their beingness derives.

Did you design the Robot to become "sentient"?  [I think you
might get this with -- creativity limits off and self-modification
(especially of the goal seeking rules) on.]

Hmm.  Yes, you should be able to do usefull amounts of computation without
any problems.  Couple that with passive sensors, and you could have a very
powerful metabolic monitoring system.  Add a few digitally-controlled
ribosomes to the cell and you could do a lot of interesting biological
manipulations.  You could also do a lot of immune system enhancements with
this technology (based on improved ability to detect invaders and
co-ordinate immune responses).

I'd like to continue to encourage participation in the Timeline to 2020 
project:

      http://crit.org/http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm

(That's the CritLink URL to the project homepage).  I think we can get 
significant value from the project if you'll take the time to post even a few 
comments in the areas about which you feel you are most knowledgeable or have 
the strongest opinions.  Here's some previously posted material regarding the 
procedure for posting comments:

For now, all commentary should be through Foresight's Crit Link system.  
Links in the Timeline web pages will lead you to Crit's view of the site and 
give you access to the Crit tools for inserting your comments, ideas and 
projections into the project.  General comments on the specific developments 
can be tagged essentially anywhere in the text of the page or to the page as 
a whole.  

Our goal of collecting specific projections for dates or ranges of dates when 
a development will become possible, available, common or ubiquitous requires 
a little care using Crit Link.  To tag a comment to a particular year in the 
timeline tables you will find at the individual development pages, it is 
necessary to paste in the particular year in the "target phrase" area and THE 
TEXT FROM THE WHOLE LINE OF YEARS into the "optional context phrase".  Thus, 
to tag a comment that you believe the development "Software Agents as 
Autonomous Actors" will be "Common" by the year 2020, you should paste the 
text from the year cell for that point ("2020 - C") into the "target phrase" 
Crit field and the text from the whole line for the year 2020 ("2020 - P 2020 
- A 2020 - C 2020 - U") into the "optional target phrase".  Although this 
seems a little kludgey, Crit requires the second step in order to have enough 
context to "know" where to place its meta-tag.  Because Crit will open a new 
window for the commenting process, it's easy to flip back and forth between 
the project site and the Crit commentary page to grab the text you need to 
properly tag your comment.

We are also looking for feedback on improving the categories.  An example is 
battery technology.  None of us in the group that developed the site knew 
enough to come up with a good metric for developments in this area, so we 
only have an item called "Advanced Batteries".  If you can offer a refinement 
of an existing category such as this one, or a wholly new category that we've 
missed, use the links available at the site to make these kinds of helpful 
suggestions.

A society may grow spatially and fill the volume of its solar system
with habitats, build a Niven ring or Dyson Sphere, may settle nearby
stars, and develop human equivalent artificial intelligence, yet not
NEED to develop computers beyond one or two magnitudes of human IQ.
Technological advancement is not a goal in and of itself, it merely
serves to optimize human existence, and it does so at economically cost
effective rates. Dyson's major error in his calcuations was to assume no
increase in efficiency of utilization, which is not only crucial to make
further growth cost effective, but establishes resource re-utilization
at rates of greater efficiency as a cost effective strategy, eventually
concluding in a species being able to utilize resources at more and more
efficient rates.

Since our population growth rate is already at around 1%, if we increase
the education and intelligence of the population more, the growth rate
will fall even faster, possibly into the negative percentages much like
european countries (which is why they can sustain lower economic growth
rates and maintain standards of living with the US). As longevity
increases in a population, the desire to reproduce decreases, thus
reducing the necessary economic growth rates to maintain improving
standards of living.

Comparing the behavior of non-intelligent species to the long term
behavior of intelligent species if fallacious and fraudulent.

And it is yet to be proven that some or all 'exponential growth paths'
are not paths of the third order, maxing out at some plateau, the
highest being that of light speed.

Since greater intelligence and education result in lower population
growth rates, its not hard to imagine a future where the population
falls down to the levels of the previous hunter gatherer society (about
2 million per planet), yet each individual is of high intelligence, and
engages in much intellectual interaction outside of the feral/agronomist
lifestyle.

Moore's Law has yet to be shown to have no upper limit. Better yet,
light speed itself puts a limit on maximum growth of computational
technology. Making Moore's Law a Holy Mantra is an error of faith. Not
very scientific.

Your error is to assume that it will happen sooner rather than later.
Much the same errors the early christians made in expecting the 2nd
coming in their lifetimes. Sounds to much like a religious attitude to
me.

Evolution is a result of pressures against the survival of the
individual. Once the individual is practially immortal and intelligent
enough to handle most eventualities in the physical world, they have no
further need of evolution.

Your points here illustrate the proof of my statement. You refuse to
acknowledge that once some part of the population 'transcends' (quotes
being to denote your mystical attitude toward that condition), that the
remaining population will not automatically be transcended or be
destroyed. That we have stone age cultures in coexistence with our own
right now illustrates the fallacy of your argument. Your argument
assumes a level of evil and callousness in the motives of transcended
beings that I personally would take as an argument to stamp out all
efforts to transcend.

You fallaciously assume that an AI will not develop a moral code, as if
there is no objective morality. Sorry, null program.

Read it. You still are evading the point. Just as there are stone age
cultures alive and functioning today, 20th century cultures will survive
into and beyond the time of any supposed date of 'singularity'. You need
to stop looking at it as some sort of Day of Rapture that all will
participate in or go to hell.

If you do so and do not accept any objective morality of survival and
coexistence, then I will be sure to nuke you before you attain your
goal. Kapisch?

Ya, what I actually had in mind was a kind of ride-along metamind
that would be operating on a much faster timescale than humans do.
Perhaps this metamind was what told Obiwan's master that Jar Jar
was about to do that rude lizard tongue thing at the dinner table.
(Recall the force-filled Jedi guy moved so fast he was able to grab
Binks' tongue in mid-apple-snatch-maneuver.)

If we had these nanoneurons on the surface of a few mitochondria,
they could form a nanoscale community that would not interfere in
any way with our normal behaviour, any more than ants interfere in
the lives of elephants.  If we managed to convince this nanocommunity
to work with us on our scale, observing our world and sending up
to our minds intuitions and ideas, this forms (sorta-kinda) a technological
explanation of THE FORCE.  In return, we would provide them
with a nice environment, food, protection, raw material, etc.  spike

We've got lots of ideas for refining and expanding the timeline project as a 
feature for ExI's website, which we'll be discussing at EXTRO4.  In the 
meantime, please provide your input with the current site!

We've intentionally limited the timeline to 2020 because we want to try to 
keep things as concrete as possible.  Many people think the possibilities of 
matue nanotech make projections beyond 2020 or so very difficult, so for now 
we've imposed that arbitrary cut-off.  In future versions of the timeline 
website, dicussion of such possibilities will likely be easier.

Nonsense.  Insects do a great job talking to each other for the
purposes of their survival.  Moths, I believe they do some of
the best pheramone signalling known (a few molecules hundreds of yards,
perhaps even miles away). Crickets, certainly make themselves known
to nearby mates.

We may observe insects (for curiosity) or study them (for our education
as to how/why they work), but we don't talk to them because we aren't
at the same level on the scale.  Imagine the conversation --
   Hello......           long pause     Hello
   How are you today....                I'm hungry
   Would you like to play a game...     I have to go lay some eggs, bye...

The problem isn't that they can't talk, its that the conversation
would be extremely short due to their limited intelligence.  They
don't have the intelligence or memory capacity to make the conversation
interesting.  [When was the last time you talked at length with a
*human* who bored you to tears?]  Have you ever interacted with someone
with Down's syndrome?  You may care for them deeply and motivate yourself
to make conversation and try to figure out what is going on in their
mind but it isn't very interesting for very long (at least in my
experience).  Greg's example with the lemurs is a case in point -
   "they concoct simple plans in pursuit of their constant desire
    to stir up mischief."
They are interesting because they are creative.  Greg can predict
how they may behave some of the time, but not perhaps all of the time.

I would argue that an M-Brain could predict with relatively high
accuracy what humans would do.  They have the observational capacity
and storage capacity to build a huge database of statistical
responses to given situations (just as Greg does with the lemurs).
They also have the computational capacity to simulate a variety
of possible futures for any human situation and would likely be
able to predict exactly how things will play out (within the limits
of chaos theory).

Species communicate about stuff necessary for their survival or
simply about stuff that interests them (if they are more intelligent).
We are intelligent enough to be interested in an M-brain, but
I really doubt we are intelligent enough to interest it for long.
On the other hand, post-singularity we have the capacity to be
very "educatable" and an M-brain might take an interest in us
as we do in human children.

I don't speak moth pheromones or cricket chirps.  Scientists may

experiment.

Ok, so no we are back to aliens "talking" to us as part of an "experiment".

The only time I feed an insect is by accident (being bitten) or
by intent (to poison).  They are used as food by some people and
they certainly prey on us.  We don't mate with them due to the
scale differences.  We are at war with them, just as the plants are.
The only communication there is between us/plants & insects are
attacks and defenses.

> Insects are able to survive and even thrive around humans.
Of course, due to the scale differences our environmental niches
do not overlap very much so we aren't in direct competition.

Ah, but I don't call this communication.  My original statement
was "we don't talk to nematodes and SIs don't talk to us".  When
I say "talk" I mean the exchange of a significant number of
bits of information for which there is mutual understanding
on both sides of the communications link.  When one party
doesn't understand, it says so and the other party tries
to explain it better in terms that it does understand.
I call that "communication".

Yes, since we have some intelligence we can ask it a question
and we may get a response.  But the problem is much worse than
that of a parent, who bored with a child says, "Ok, now
you go outside and play with the other children...".
Can communcation occur, yes, but the quantity and quality
is fundamentally limited by the bandwidth of the channel
and capacity of one of the parties.

Only because we don't understand them completely yet!  We are studying
them.  We stop studying them once we undertand them fully (unless we
choose to experiment on them).  You aren't going to sequence the yeast
genome 23 times, you only do that once.  You aren't going to understand
aerodynamics of bee wings 5 times, you only do it once.

If we happen to represent a truely new species or novel developmental
path to an SI, then yes they might study us and maybe even choose
to talk to us.  But if you've got billions of years of observations
and the evolutionary paths of trillions of species under your belt,
I think it is going to look like same old thing to you.

Is it more logical or productive to imagine that *all* technological
civilizations suffer the Universal Fatality Equation?

I would say that we have succeeded by using the simplest explanation
that fits the observations.  I'll I'm doing is pointing out some
unexplained observations and providing what to me is a simple and
logical explanation.

You may be right about "heavily engineered".  SIs might never
do stellar engineering (it could be very hazardous to take stars
apart) and  might never colonize (for the reasons of increasing
diversity as I've mentioned or perhaps their own moral principles).
Even so, the universe is more than old enough to have evolved 
many SIs in many different locations along many different
evolutionary paths.  The limits of physics may funnel intelligence
into a small set of optimal architectures.

The difference between previous "explanations by the shaman" and
modern explanations is that they are based on the principles of physics
(e.g. natural laws).  Is it not possible that the evolution of intelligence
is controlled by these "natural laws"?
  - elements consist of certain particles organized in certain ways.
  - molecules connect according to fundamental rules
  - gravity distorts space and causes molecules to form stars
  - the principles of natural selection allow the development
    of intelligence and drive it to its limits.

I think you have to add the criteria that drives evolution --
Is it in your self-interest?  If it were in the interest(s) of
an SI to do any of those things, then yes, I would say that
SIs might be responsible for it.

Not true, nanotechnology seems like magic, but Drexler & Freitas
seem to be able to tell us what is probable, possible and impossible.
Several authors have argued that star dismantlement seems possible,
but just like interstellar travel, the benefits may not be worth
the costs.  Are attaining personal immortality and more intelligence
in my self-interest?  If the answer is yes (for most people), then
civilizations will develop these technologies.

I too find this aspect uncomfortable.  But I've offered explanations
for this -- that they may be here, that we are an experiment in
increasing diversity, that they are simply disinterested in us, etc.

It is important to keep in mind that SIs gain relatively nothing
by colonizing new space.  The progagation delays between stars
mean that you can't do effective parallel computations (even over
millions of years).  On the other hand discovering a new computational
architecture, a new algorithm, a new material structure, etc. that
lets you think smaller/faster/cheaper, etc. has very big payoffs.
To paraphrase Feynman -- "There is *more* room at the bottom".

I know, don't you just love it...  But you don't have to invoke
SIs for that requirement.  Nanotechnology could easily explain
the miracles of Jesus.  So a single non-SI alien species that
wanted to put a little spin on things be responsible for Christianity.
To throw away "divine intervention", you have to put a substantial
limit on the evolution of life or the evolution of intelligence.
You are back to arguing that "we" must be a special case.

For now, that's simply addressed by not commenting within the year-by-year

You're right on that last comment, I suppose, although curmudgeonly comments 
can be tagged in a general fashion.   I've entered some comments in specific 
years where I think things will become Possible, but no other level, at least 
by 2020.

Much of this is/will be discussed in "Nanomedicine".  I'll be discussing

Worse, if SETI works and the civilization is a non-SI,
that would argue strongly that:
  (a) hard-diamondoid molecular nanotech (vs. soft-wet bio-nanotech)
      is *not* possible.
or
  (b) technolgocial civilizations somehow do find a way to
      stop on the slippery slope of evolution (i.e. pre-singularity)
      and stay there. 
or
  (c) The neo-luddites left behind by M-brain departures get
      lonely once in a while and want to talk to somebody.

If (a) is true, then life becomes a lot less interesting.

The only way I can see (b) being true is if the civilization
civilization has hard evidence that climbing the singularity
slope is almost uniformly fatal (either they tried it before
and failed or have seen lots of others crash and burn).
This is not good news for us because, I would put pretty
good money on our climbing that slope.


If (c) is the case, then I think we can expect a long
set of lectures about why the M-brain path is a bad one.

are ahead in SETI@home :-)]

Easy:  There is no meaning of life, no goal system can sustain itself
without one, and they all commit suicide.  Of course, those three items
in sequence form a rather tenuous logic (life could have meaning, our
cheapjack human systems function without one, and why is suicide more
rational than anything else?), but it's a possibility.

Not so. An overclocked 300A (if you can get'em) is actually almost
always faster than equivalent PII/450 (size doesn't always matter ;). 
Nota bene, there are also dual-CPU Celerons boards out there. 
Currently the best deal for the money by far.

It is possible to legally own primates and other exotic animals in many 
places.  But my first advice is that you probably not do it.  The 
circumstances in which humans can keep primates as "pets" are rare and 
difficult to maintain.  (In fact, I believe that it is impossible to 
ethically maintain primates as "pets" -- only as house mates :-)  It only 
works for us for a number of reasons.  First, we have lemurs, which are 
really prosimians, or "proto-primates".  More "advanced" primates are much 
harder to keep because they are too strong to be dealt with in a home 
environment safely or practically (even a spider monkey can wreak utter havoc 
in a home and cause serious injury, even in play).  We've researched more 
"advanced" primates and wouldn't consider them until we make a LOT more 
money.  Second, my wife is an artist who works at home and can be with the 
lemurs almost all of time.  Primates and prosimians are extremely social 
animals and can't be left alone for any length of time without doing them 
psychological injury.  Third, Anthea has a truly extraordinary gift for 
relating to and handling animals of all kinds (remind me to tell you about 
the wild macaws we encountered in Nicaragua . . .) and is super-humanly 
patient with them.  Fourth, you have to be willing to make a very long-term 
commitment to an animal with amazing intelligence, agility and strength that 
will remain essentially at the stage of "terrible twos" for 20-40 years.  
Fifth, we've built special accommodations for the lemurs in our house so that 
they can be themselves and we can be ourselves without driving each other 
crazy. Sixth, you have to have access to medical services which are hard to 
find.  Most vets aren't competent and/or willing to treat primates and most 
human doctors won't.  Finally, you have to find competent care for the 
animals when you want to take a vacation.  If all that doesn't put you off, 
by all means . . . :-)

If you're interested, check out my lemur page:

                  http://users.aol.com/gburch2/darwin.html

which is out of date and has a slightly corrupted file format (updating and 
fixing it is on my to-do list).

If it doesn't have self-awareness or "a mind per se", then it most
certainly is far, far, FAR less intelligent than we are.  Such a mind
wouldn't even be capable of representing Asimov Laws.  To quote Eluki
bes Shahar:  "It has a what-it-does, not a will, and if you break it you
don't have a Library that will do what you want.  You have a broken chop-logic."

Absolutely.  That simply isn't what *any* of us were talking about; we

generalized reasoning.

Whose moral programming are we talking about?  Mine is fairly well
rewritten - I wrote the specs for an AI and I try to make mine match the
specs, to the limits of what you can do with software alterations.

Fine.  Then don't try in ambiguous cases.  If I enslave you and kill you
on a whim, pleading that I wasn't entirely sure you were sentient isn't
going to make a lot of headway with the court.  If you're not sure, it
isn't moral.  That simple.

You'd be amazed at how little intelligence is needed before this simple
"arbitrary goal" system can start malfunctioning.  Generalized
propositional logic operating on predicate calculus, heuristics that can
operate on abstract goals, and the standard goal structure is enough to
create the possibility.

Anything this smart is going to run into trouble.  As long as it is
still pretty dumb and isn't self-altering, you can eliminate most of the
trouble.  Even so, simple Asimovs won't cut it.

What happens if they contradict each other?  If a learned definition of
"human" is generalized or made more specific by some heuristic?  ...And
so on and so on and so on.

You don't need fuzzy logic for Asimov Laws to malfunction, but it sure helps.

It's either dumber than toast, or it has full self-awareness,
generalized reasoning, and a complete mind.  I don't think you can get
all the properties you cited using finite state automata.

Wrong-o.  Nothing that can learn - nothing that has a data repository
that can change - can have an irrevocable moral code.  *Any* form of
change can be enough, if you're not careful.  Even perceptions that
learn - and you won't get real-world-capable robots without that -
obviously create the theoretical possibility of perceptions that warp in
such a way that the robot carries out any conceivable sequence of motor actions.

Any robot capable of social interaction must be capable of generalized reasoning.

No; self-awareness is more complex than simple reflectivity.  You need a
*self*-model, not just a model of the low-level code.  You have to close
the loop - in addition to knowing the stack trace, reasoning to the
stack trace has to cause it to happen.

...actually, the "robot" Billy Brown and I were thinking of building

Yeah, and while you guys are agonizing about it in your lab, Billy Brown
and I will be running a transhuman AI distributed over the 'Net. 
Technological relativity check; the technology you invoke is sufficient
to end life as we know it.

We accept that risk.  Eventually, either superintelligence comes into
existence, or humanity wipes itself out (via grey goo, say).  The action
with the largest probability of leading to humanity's survival, to
within an order of magnitude over all other choices, is creating a
superintelligence as fast as possible.

We aren't talking about human moral systems, which derive from game
theory and evolution.  We're talking about AI moral systems, which are
quite different.

I'd be amazed if there was any accidental way to create a human-equiv
intelligence.  To paraphrase Pat Cadigan, that's like using straw and
dirty shirts to cause the spontaneous generation of mice.

AFAIK, all Microsoft apps have been written as "asynchronous message-passing
object soup" since sometime in the mid-90s.  Also, with the right software
you can run a large app over a distributed architecture like this without
having to explicitly modularize it to fit the hardware's quirks (see
http://research.microsoft.com/sn/Millennium/, and especialy
http://research.microsoft.com/sn/Millennium/Coign.html, for example).

But that isn't especially relevant, anyway.  I was talking about programming
techniques for existing PC hardware.  Obviously, radical changes in hardware
can require equally radical changes in programming methods.

Maybe this explains why you always tread the brittle AI path. Real
life is the ultimate Energizer Bunny: it just keeps going, and going,
and going without needing any formalized built-in goal.

Yes indeed. Commiting suicide is always about choice and values, the
same thing with going on living.

A few years ago I worked for a company which had a contract to do software
for Ford.  Ford has an extensive quality control program with very strict
methodologies, which we had to cooperate with.  One thing they wanted was
a bug tracking system in which, for each bug we found and fixed, we also
reported when the bug had been introduced.

It seemed a bit strange at first to view bugs in this way, having in
effect birth and death dates.  But in fact using the kind of version
control system Billy describes, it is usually pretty easy to determine
at what date the mistake was made which caused the bug.  Sometimes this
was at the time the code was first written, other times it was a bug
introduced as part of another change, often a fix for some other bug.

It is a truism in software development that at some point code becomes
so large and messy, with the original designers gone or working on
other projects, that bugs are introduced as fast as they are fixed.
Ford was attempting to detect this, in that they were able to build up
over time a chart showing how fast bugs were being introduced and removed
at any point in time.  It's not perfect because it often takes months or
years before a given bug is detected, so the bug-creation rate data is
only valid for dates some considerable distance in the past.  But you
can extrapolate from the older data to get an idea of how reliable the
software is likely to be today or at any point in the future.

There is an entire literature within the software engineering discipline
on this kind of error rate estimation.  With time and patience you can get
a reasonably accurate picture of the rate at which bugs are introduced,
detected and removed.

Think in terms of team development.  A programmer gets assigned a piece of
the project, writes code for it, does whatever personal testing he feels
necessary, then checks it into the central code repository (which is
presumeably some sort of version-control package).  Once he checks it in for
the first time, anything that anyone ever finds wrong with it counts as an
error.

The easy approach to this has already been done (see the MS Office features
for imbedding ActiveX objects in a document, for example).  However, that
doesn't let the components modify each other's data.

For seamless integration you need to have a universal data format that all
possible components can read.  That's fine for features we've already
thought of, but the first truly innovative product that comes along will
need some kind of data that we didn't allow for in the spec.  So far, I
haven't heard of a solution to that problem.

And you were concerned about code bloat in existing systems?  You haven't
seen anything yet!  Yes, this could probably be done with enough effort, but
the result would expend vast amounts of space on meta-data, adaptive code,
and low-order AI software.  Since it would need to be an OS function, that
means we get to add even more millions of lines of code to Windows (and it
will be really, really trouble-prone code, at that).

Even then it would never work very well.  We can make auto-generating user
interfaces, but we can't make an AI that knows how to make it useable.  Odds
are we would end up back in dialog box hell, or some close variant thereof.

Huh?  Where does it say this.  I've got the Dyson paper (and can send
you a copy) and as far as I can tell it says nothing of the sort.
Either you are trying to claim that productivity increases do not grow
at compounded rates or I really don't understand.

Ok, great.  Lets assume that this trend continues and effectively
*eliminates* the desire for reproduction.  It doesn't, in me at
least, eliminate the desire to know and understand more.  In
that regard, I am currently biologically constrained and would
like to "break out".  Giving me more space doesn't help much.
Giving me better technologies with which to engineer my mind
and more energy to run it does.  Now we are back to J-Brains
(planet sized supercomputers vs. solar-system sized supercomputers).

Why? -- though we may be intelligent we demonstrate all the behavior
patterns of a non-intelligent species -- strong mating urges, violence,
colonization of available ecological niches, etc.

The key phrase would seem to be "long term", the problem would be
in modifying those behavior patterns at the rate the singularity occurs
(which is weeks).  If an "intelligent species" cannot prevent or
adapt to the singularity, then all generally acepted paradigms
for "normal" behavior become irrelevant.

It would seem that consensus driven political systems require
a significant delay in adapting to rapid change around them.
[I'll cite the record industry and MP3 as an example.]
If the change is rapid and you aren't prepared to deal
with it, then it is over before you can respond.  Right
now, you have an opportunity to convince people that
building and uploading into an M-Brain is a very bad
idea.  But once the construction starts (as it only takes
a matter of weeks to build) anything you plan to do would
be too late.

Exactly, a major reason to build M/J-brains is to get our communication
bandwidth to highly parallel light-speed (instead of sound or neuronal
speeds).  And you do max out at the light-speed plateau -- that why I keep
arguing that evolution (as we typically think of it) stops there.

No disagreement.  The transhumanists who are willing to embrace
evolutionary technologies survive and everyone else eventually
dies off.  Self-selection into the environments with the best
opportunities wins.

True, though the the 5 atom gate thickness limit on CMOS is going
to be a difficult nut.  We hit that circa 2012.  If you want
really hard limits you have to go to the Bremermann/Bekinstein
bound.  There are probably 3 steps --
  (a) Go to the limit of current devices
  (b) Go to the limit of single-electron-quantum-dot devices
  (c) Go to the limit of the B/B bound.

It is very unclear at this point how you would make the (b) - (c)
transition.

The point of my invoking Moore's law (and others) is that
economics drives evolution.  In our "environment" if you
derive a better economic solution you get supported.
Faster computers, more variety, fancier VR environments
*will* get funding unless you find a way to change
human desires or economic systems.

I assure you it is not religious other than it results from the
fact of doing the calculations as to how fast asteroids and
planets can be disassembled.  [Rapid disassembly gives you an
exponential increase in power harvesting capacity, which in
turn enables increased intelligence, which in turn enables
a more rapid design of optimal architectures ...]
If you can demonstrate that this cannot proceed quickly,
then you might be correct.

To understand this growth rate, I would suggest you review:
   - Doubling time of a nanoassembler: 5 sec. (Nanosystems, pg 407)
   - Doubling time for self-replicating nanomachines (e.g. bacteria):
       20 minutes (many medical texts, contact me if you want citations)
   - Doubling time for large scale capital stocks (< 10,000 sec = 3 hrs)
     (Nanosystems, pg 1); delivery of 1 kg product by < 1 kg manufacturing
     system (< 1 hr; Nanosystems, pgs 421-425).

These growth rates allow you to manipulate galactic masses within
a few weeks (if you have the material & energy locally available.

So, if we get on this path, growth to the SI level is rapid.
I would argue that the burden of proof falls on you to show we do
not get on this path, or if we do, we rapidly get off of it.
       
The trend line we are on now leads directly to this!

Exactly.  So you have to make the case that they would
 (a) Convince themselves that evolution is no longer needed
and
 (b) "edit it out" of their personna(s).

I'm sorry but even when you cease reproduction, preacefully coexist
with the other few million planetary inhabitants, etc. you still have
the problem that:
  H-Brains do not have the capacities to prevent/avoid galactic
  catastrophies.
and
  M-Brains do.

Which survives the longest?
Which do you choose?

It isn't a "mystical" disconnect so much as a logical/economic one.
The difference in recources is 10^13x+.  If I walk up to you tomorrow
and say -- hey, I'm going to offer you 10x what you are getting paid
now to empty garbage -- Will you accept the offer?

Perhaps not.  But as the saying goes (almost) everyone has their
price.

I agree entirely that there will be "takers" and decliners" of
the M-Brain "offer".  My basic premise would be that in the
long term, the M-brain "takers" survive, while the "decliners"
die out.  Simple, ruthlessly efficient, doesn't care one bit
what you "think" about it "natural selection".

For that not to occur you have to argue "conservation"
agendas for the M-Brains.  I'm sorry, but I don't notice
you saying "I cannot take a walk in the forrest, for
I knoweth that I shall stepeth on the nematodes".
To win this argument, you have to argue an extraordinarily
higher "caring" for lower life forms by M-brains than we
ourselves demonstrate.

> You fallaciously assume that an AI will not develop a moral code, as if
> there is no objective morality. Sorry, null program.

I would argue that any AI would evolve a program for its self-preservation.
Whether it evolves any "morality", or one "consistent" with our own
remains a very open question.

As I discussed in another thread -- humans (currently) have unreliable
"morality".  AIs might be programed with/evolve completely
reliable (trustrable) morality.   Go ahead, make the argument
for the preservation of an untrustable morality over the
trustable morality...

I've argued consistantly for the preservation of diversity
(even in the face of what may be miniscule ROIs).

SIs and planetary/tribal cultures are in little conflict with each
other (any more than the humans/insects are).  The SI consciousness(es)
may well decide to preserve the history/background culture.

In the long run however, you have to argue that the SI is
*so concerned* that it will take an active role in the
preservation of the environment [we don't want our great
.... children to be roasted by the sun going into a red
giant phase, so lets stop it shall we....]

I, personally, do generally accept the morality/survival goals.
[Fundamentally do unto others as they would have them do unto you.]

So, by definition, I should do nothing to hinder your personal
survival.  Ok, that makes absolute sense.  Do you require that I
take a pro-active role in promoting your survival?  How much of my
own resources am I required to dedicate to these promotional activities?

Regarding "nuking", thats fine.  The problem that comes to mind is
that you have to nuke me, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and a host of
other people who are used to "survival of the fittest" business
tactics where "the terminator wins".  Can you honestly think or
believe that you will be successful in eliminating all of us?
The problem is that it is like a chess game, eliminate the queen
and the rook or the bishop assumes the position of the most valuable
piece.  All you do by eliminating an individual is transfer the
power.

What is this, the law of the excluded middle?  Just because an AI isn't
connectionist doesn't mean that it's classical.  Webmind is a
crystalline AI.  Elisson isn't.

"Formalized" and "built-in" are mutually exclusive, don't you think? 
And name me one known brain that has goals but no built-in goals.

I'm always amused by the way that people who insist that all goals are
equally "correct" get so disturbed by my goal of saying it isn't so...

And the same thing with walking across the room, or any mental action...
I don't see what prediction I can make based on your statement.

They may be a deal gene, but they are still pieces of crap. The severe
lack of on chip cache is a hindrance to anything but playing solitaire.
Seeing my equipment guy deal with complaints about performance every day
from people that buy celerons (and none from PII), I know why they are
cheap.

If the heart consists of 60-65% brain, what are the implications for
head-only cryonic suspension?

Here's the rub, as I see it from a lawyer's perspective.  As it becomes 
harder to tell the "robot" from the "real thing", the social and legal rules 
and structures we have for dealing with the rights and responsibilities of 
humans will become stretched to irrationality.  Eventually, you will have 
recreated the social and legal absurdities of the antebellum South, where 
there were "real" people and "slave" people, with two sets of rules.  
Finally, you will face the contradictions of a robotic "Jim Crow" approach, 
even if you grant "personhood" to synthetics. "Driving Mis Daisy" takes on a 
whole new meaning when it's the CAR that is demeaned by being treated as a 
second-class person!

No, but there are scenarios I can envision in which developing such a test 
will be a trial of our moral character as traumatic as dealing with slavery 
was and race continues to be.

I must be crazy to argue with you Robert, but I think you've described a 
machine with such subtle complexity that you aren't going to be able to 
predict its behavior with sufficient precision that you can relegate it to 
the status of an inanimate object, at least.  Consider that a large majority 
of people in the First World today would grant some "rights" status to 
"higher" animals like primates and cetaceans.  I believe the same moral sense 
that motivates the desire to allow some level of autonomy to those complex 
creatures will also motivate at least some people to observe rights of 
autonomy for machines of the complexity you describe.

I see a distinction between placing a priori structure on a complex machine 
and attempting to impose restrictions on machines that have developed a 
certain (yet to be defined) mental relationship to their environment.  In 
that respect, I may inhabit a moral territory between Billy's and yours, 
Robert.  However, I believe we WILL have to develop a "Creator's Morality" to 
address the use of a priori restrictions on the structure of an AI's mind.

Billy's comment does beg the question, but that's because he's made clear 
that he finds a congruence of a certain level of "intelligence" with 
possession of "social status", i.e. as a locus of moral rights.  I agree with 
him, because I believe to not do so utterly undermines any claim we ourselves 
have to be treated as autonomous moral actors.

I won't comment on this, other than to say that I have the queasy feeling 
that failure to address this question is like the Founders' unwillingness to 
address the question of slavery when they were waxing so eloquent about 
"inalienable rights".  I'm dead serious about this: If we don't take this 
problem seriously soon, we may be setting ourselves up for a cataclysm that 
could make Gettysburg look like a schoolyard shoving match.

Robert, I think you overestimate the ability of such a powerful technology to 
be controlled with well-thought-out prior institutional restraints.  As 
robotics develops as a business, the wave-front of development will be 
international and will cross essentially every industry and aspect of human 
life.  The "Department of Robotics" you posit would have to have one hell of 
a mandate to be able to effectively govern all the possible permutations of 
intelligence and environmental interaction.  I suspect that it will be "out 
of control" to use Kevin Kelly's term, long before any such bureau could 
establish effective restraints on initial implementation and 
post-implementation development of complex, robotic AIs.

My point exactly, especially if we treat really advanced robots purely as

I think Billy can be excused for fudging a little on what, in my opinion, is 
the ultimate question of moral philosophy.  Shall we try to do better than 
the gentlemen in Philadelphia?  I propose that we fail to do so at our 
extreme peril.

This is unfortunate, as (for example) '2020 - C' is unique on the page.
The error message says it is 'probably' too short for use as the context
phrase, but it should be fine. This appears to be a shortcoming of
critlink.

One suggestion: combine the code letter with the year, so '2020 - C'
becomes '2020C', which allows selection with a single doubleclick of the
word instead of having to select inside a table cell, which can be
error-prone.

I was referring to people in general.  The imprint of our
evolutionary heritage is still very visible the behaviors
and choices of 20th century humans, although the cultural
evolution of the past few thousand years has begun to create
many subtle and interesting variances.

We should be cautious in evaluting how thoroughly any of us
have separated ourselves from much of this moral
programming, which includes all the broad imperatives of
survival.  Suicide is one way to prove that you're no slave
to your genes, but so is using condoms and remaining
childless.  We may find independent, *philosophical*
rationales for all of our actions, but that doesn't mean
that the genenetic legacy isn't still still playing an
influential, covert role in our many of choices (which isn't
necessarily bad).

Certainly not irrevocable, but highly resistant to drastic
change.  A "conservative" set of moral instincts might be
responsible for the failure of the human race to have
committed mass suicide by now.  Where once the proto-human
ate, surived, and reproduced for no conscious reason, now we
stare at the sky and ask "what's it all about?" to no
certain answer.  So we create meaning systems like religion
that give us the intellectual justification to carry on.
Would we have bothered doing the same absent a billion years
of genetic survival instincts?

I'm not sure I understand that comment.  AI morality will be
designed and programmed by conscious humans, unlike our own
morality which was designed mostly by the unconscious
workings of mother nature.  This is a big advantage, since
we'll be able to get rid of vestigal instincts like "use
agression against conspecifics to ensure the maximum
proliferation of your offspring," along with many other
outdated tendencies that linger to find new outlets of
expression in the modern world.

But in creating a moral system de novo (for AI's, for
ourselves, or for both) we can only put into it what we
bring to the table.  Our knowledge of our own moral
programming and its strenghts and weaknesses will have to be
the jumping off point for any new design.

I've been using my new Linux box for about a week. It's a dual
celeron300A, overclocked to 466Mhz. I picked this system to optimize
processing horsepower per dollar. Sure, dual PII450s are faster for
some applications, but they are a lot more expensive, and the
celerons are faster for other applications. The Celerons have
less cache, but they access the cache in one front-side bus cycle.
the PIIs have more cache, but they access the cache in two bus cycles.

I didn't use a dual-celeron motherboard. I used a dual slot 1 board
instead.
This means I can convert over to PIIs or PIIIs if intel should ever
inadvertently manufacture a cheap, overclockable version as they did
for the Celeron. To use the celeron in a slot 1, you first place the
celeron on a "slocket". Works great.

Why is this Extropian? well, It shows that computers are getting very
fast and very cheap. This is helping to drive the astounding
proliferation
of Open Source software. At this point, the only reason to buy
software is inertia, or if the software is extremely specialized.
This may be a model for an "Open Stuff" economy that could occur
with Drextech.

Title
  Water: an essential but overlooked
  nutrient. [Review] [81 refs]
Source
  Journal of the American Dietetic Association.  99(2):200-6, 1999 Feb.
Abstract
  Water is an essential nutrient required for
  life. To be well hydrated, the average sedentary adult man must consume at
  least 2,900 mL (12 c) fluid per day, and the average sedentary adult woman at
  least 2,200 mL (9 c) fluid per day, in the form of noncaffeinated,
  nonalcoholic beverages, soups, and foods. Solid foods contribute
  approximately 1,000 mL (4 c) water, with an additional 250
  mL (1 c) coming from the water of oxidation. The Nationwide
  Food Consumption Surveys indicate that a portion of the population may be
  chronically mildly dehydrated. Several factors may increase the likelihood of
  chronic, mild dehydration, including a poor thirst mechanism, dissatisfaction
  with the taste of water, common consumption of the natural
  diuretics caffeine and alcohol, participation in exercise, and environmental
  conditions. Dehydration of as little as 2% loss of body weight results in
  impaired physiological and performance responses. New research indicates that
  fluid consumption in general and water consumption in
  particular can have an effect on the risk of urinary stone disease; cancers
  of the breast, colon, and urinary tract; childhood and adolescent obesity;
  mitral valve prolapse; salivary gland function; and overall health in the
  elderly. Dietitians should be encouraged to promote and monitor fluid and
  water intake among all of their clients and patients through
  education and to help them design a fluid intake plan. The influence of
  chronic mild dehydration on health and disease merits further research.

While it is a little laborious, I have been able to succesfully insert a 
number of year-specific comments by following the procedure I've outlined, 
i.e. pasting in the text for the specific year for the tag-link (e.g. "2005 - 
C") and then pasting the text for the whole line corresponding to that year 
(i.e. "2005 - P 2005 - A 2005 - C 2005 - U") into the "context" box.  You can 
snag the text to do this by clicking back and forth between the original 
browser window and the new browser window for the comment that Crit opens 
automagically.  Once you get the hang of it, you canget into a rythm and do 4 
or 5 comments in fairly short order.

Well, as you indicate E.O. Wilson and others "talk" to insects through their 
work on pheromone signaling.  Comparing the content of the conversation that 
takes place in that endeavor to, say, Shakespeare, your point is well taken.  
But the point is that some small number of humans DO go to the trouble and 
endure the "boredom" of the content of the conversation for the simple sake 
of learning a little bit.

{WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MATERIAL CONTAINS WILD SPECULATION; VALID POETIC 
LICENSE REQUIRED.} Those limits may well make the decisive difference.  You 
made the chillingly apt point when we discussed this in Palo Alto that many, 
if not most SIs might spend the vast majority of their time in "suspend mode" 
out of what amounted to a god-like boredom.  I don't doubt that that may be 
true for most.  But I can also imagine a situation in which an SI might 
create various subparts of itself with lesser levels of intelligence, perhaps 
a myriad of such subdivisions, each with slightly different capacities for 
interest and engagement in various subjects.  Managing this hierarchy of 
sub-intelligences might be the ultimate business of the ultimate SIs.

Here I can't help but getting another chilling thought: Consider the Hindu 
theodicy. In its most refined form, Hindu theology posits a unitary god, 
Brahma, who essentially "plays games with himself" by partitioning his being 
into lesser subparts who have more or less unity with his "ultimate" self and 
more or less knowledge of the nature of the "game".  In this view, we are all 
really aspects of Brahma, with Krishna being the gentle "messenger" who 
crosses levels of "god-nature" with the news that we're all really different, 
more or less aware parts of the ultimate god-mind.  Shiva ("the destroyer"), 
in this view, is the aspect of Brahma who erases the self-imposed limits in 
Brahma's cosmic game, from time to time "rebooting" more or less of the rules.

Perhaps, with cosmic time and ultimate computational resources on their 
hands, at least some SIs will come to play the Brahma "god game".  If so, 
then there will be perhaps many, many quite potent intelligences in the 
universe -- intelligent far beyond our current level -- but still not at any 
particular time fully in possession of all of the knowledge and power of a 
"complete", unitary SI.  Such "lesser deities" might well be interested in 
communicating with us -- in the gentle way of Krishna, or perhaps in the more 
dramatic ways that Shiva upsets the apple cart.  In this regard, there might 
be specifically-crafted "level crossers" that are intentionally "designed" to 
play that role in some SI's "god game", or who might evolve into that role on 
their own.  This concept of a "level crossing" techno-transcendent 
intelligence is similar to Anton Sherwood's notion of the "extrosattva" I've 
written about before: 

          http://users.aol.com/gburch3/extrostv.html

While you make compelling arguments about the improbability of communication 
between SIs and animals with our level of intelligence, can you say that the 
scenario I describe above is impossible or even improbable?

AHA!  I knew it!  I have suspected this all along.  The meticlorians live
in the heart!  Lots of extra ATP floating around, very little chance of
injury or intrusion from outside.

One last thing about that theory.  Neurons will soon be discovered in
the genitals as well, you can be sure.  And in some individuals, such as the
current US president, the neurons there will outnumber those found
in the brain.  spike

The following article, forwarded on another list, highlights the level of 
opposition to genetic engineering that is developing outside the U.S.  Based 
on the extent of the "anti-GM" hysteria I'm seeing increasing signs of in the 
UK, elsewhere in the EU and to a lesser extent in Australia, I think we may 
be facing a fundamental showdown on a key element of the transhumanist agenda 
much sooner than many of us expected.  I'm worried that there hasn't been 
nearly enough time for our ideas to take root and that with Prince Charles 
declaring that ''Genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong 
to God and God alone,'' we could be in a world of hurt before we know it . .

Too late to worry about honey and GM crops?

Sam Westmacott finds that bees have been in and out of genetically
modified flowers for at least seven years

 BEES are good to us. They provide us with honey, one of the purest
foods in the world. But are we being good to them? The question is
disturbing thousands of beekeepers.

 Frank Eggleton, a 67-year-old retired design engineer, is terrified by
the threat of genetically modified crops. He cares deeply about bees.
There are about 150,000 in the garden of his 17th-century cottage in
Wiltshire.

 Like many beekeepers, he has infinite patience and a great love of the
countryside. Not the kind of chap who you would expect to go ballistic.
But he did, when Captain Fred Barker planted genetically modified
oil-seed rape at Lushill Farm, Hannington, where his bees forage.

 "My bees are in danger," he says. "And what about cross-pollination?
Bees scatter pollen all over the place. Wild turnips, cabbages and all
kinds of domestic and wild plants will be contaminated."

 He knows that the rape, sponsored by AgrEvo - a major GM company with
six field-scale trials this year - has an extra gene and a specific
herbicide resistance, so that weeds such as charlock will be destroyed
without affecting the main crop.

 Eggleton is convinced that the gene's presence will contaminate his
honey. He has no evidence for this assumption, but that does not deter
his protests.

 Friends of the Earth held a meeting in the village hall and Eggleton
declared: "Big field trials of GM rape are a step too far. I would never
give my two-year-old grandson GM honey or eat it myself. I would rather
dump my crop."

 Captain Barker burnt his crop in response to pressure from his trustees
and the Soil Association. But Eggleton's fear spread throughout the
beekeeper community. Adrian Waring, the general secretary of the British
Beekeepers Association, was besieged by members worried about genetic
pollution.

 "No one knows what to believe," he says. Rumours spread that beekeepers
would be fined 5,000 for a hive near GM crops and that Brussels
labelling laws would force them to mark their pots "Contains genetically
modified pollen". Who will buy it then? 

The beekeepers find it difficult to understand how a scientist can think
that a buffer zone of 200 yards between GM and other plants can stop
cross-pollination. Bees pollinate plants up to three miles away from the
hive.

 People have forgotten the reason for buffer zones - to protect a crop
from contamination. According to AgrEvo, the industry guidelines
initially requested 50 yards so that the grower could claim 98.5 per
cent purity of seed certification, although they are not yet growing
commercially.

 Similarly, while the public believes cross-pollination is a real
threat, it seems that the Government has other evidence. Imperial 
College, London, did a series of experiments examining the effect on
pollen transfer through wind and insects, including bees. It 
was on the strength of that work in the Eighties that the Government
allowed open-air trials.

 AgrEvo and the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that conventional
oil-seed rape, a man-made crop created about 300 years 
ago, had never cross-pollinated outside a laboratory. Such intermittent
and partial revelations infuriate Waring and association 
members. "The Government has been so cagey and the bio-technical
companies so slow to publish their research, that they've 
got us all hopping about and shouting," says Waring.

 When the Government announced large field trials last October, most
people understood that meant a greater acreage of crops 
would be planted. Wrong again.

 The first GM crops were planted in 1987. By 1992, they were un-netted
in the open air. Bees could fly freely in and out of the 
crops. The plots were about the same size as the floor space of a
three-bedroom house. The acreage covered could be vast.

 One man who knows how far GM research has gone is David Parker. For 30
years, he has worked with agri-chemical and 
bio-technical companies carrying out trials on his 900-acre farm in
Oxfordshire. He sees research as his mission in life. "Why 
else would God give me an inquiring mind and put me on a farm?" he
asked.

 Parker has grown GM crops every year since 1996. Sipping beer in the
Carriers Arms, Watlington, he waits anxiously for a 
protest march to arrive on his land and tells me that he is puzzled that
the public outcry had not happened sooner.

 "The research is lessening. At 18 acres, this is a small trial. The
biggest was 27 acres in 1996. Every summer, conventional rape 
and beehives have been dotted all around my GM crops. The bird or bee
has already flown," he says.

 AgrEvo and the Government confirmed Parker's statement. The acreage
planted is smaller, but this is not in response to public 
opinion.

 In 1998, there were 300 trials, this year there were only 150. "We have
collected the data we need for various submission 
packages to the regulators, so there is less call for trials," says a
spokesman for AgrEvo.

 Bees all over Britain have been in and out of GM flowers for at least
seven years. We have probably already eaten honey 
made from GM pollen. Does it matter?

 The government agency that is responsible for safety standards and the
labelling of GM food says: "Consumption of gene 
products from pollen in honey is likely to be negligible." In other
words, they do not know what the effect will be.

 Honey must be clearly labelled. If a beekeeper knows his bees have been
foraging in GM crops and he does not label his 
honey, he may be fined 5,000.

 Parker suggests that genetic modification is to us what steam travel
was to the Victorians. "When George Stephenson 
developed the Rocket, people said the human body could not withstand
speed in excess of 20mph. We always fear what we 
do not understand." 

A recent poll by Mori showed one per cent of consumers believe GM is a
good thing. The rest of us do not want organic crops 
compromised or standards changed to allow GM foods, and we do not want
field trials on farmland.

 Are our fears justified? Three years ago, Catherine Tulip, a solicitor,
resigned to fight for the abolition of GM. Last year, she 
removed the crops on Parker's farm. I expected her to be well informed,
a mistress of the facts.

 Not so. She knows there are 32 million hectares of GM crops growing
commercially worldwide, but she does not know the 
extent of trials in Britain nor the nature of those on Parker's farm.
She expresses a deep human revulsion against man playing 
God, but has little evidence on which to base her objections. None the
less, she is determined GM will stop.

 Unlike America, where farming areas are huge and remote, Britain is a
small country where urban sprawl penetrates deep into 
rural areas. None of us, especially the beekeepers, will rest easy until
the politicians come clean and make their research open.

Oh boy, well now I've gone and stepped in it...

No, Amara, I do not claim to know *almost all* astronomers.
I have however attended both a Gravitational Microlensing Conference
and an IEEE Telescope conference.  In casual conversations at
these conferences I discussed some of my concepts regarding SIs, the
dark matter, etc.  The scientists with whom I have spoken were
not merely "not warm" to the idea, the facial expressions involved
seemed to imply that they thought I was some kind of a nut (though they
were polite enough not to say that).

>From these experiences, I know "a few" astronomers view the idea of
intelligent life being responsible for the phenomena they observe
(or don't observe) similarly to the way they view the Church's
treatment of Galileo, i.e. dimly.  I am however, quite familiar with
the rather cool reception that nanotechnolgy has received in the
physics/chemistry & other engineering communities of "well disciplined
scientists".  Presumably this is in large part due to the fact that
what MNt predicts is such a distance from normal experience and practices
that it must be "impossible" (even though people can't say why).

I am making an extrapolation, based on these experiences, that
"almost all" astronomers will be reluctant to consider the idea
that things they see could be explained by megascale engineering
projects constructed using nanotechnology.

For example, if you take the recent work with Supernovas and and
the rate of slowing of the expansion of the universe.  My general
impression is that the astronomers would prefer to invent a "new force"
and/or substantially alter fundamental equations of the universe
instead of considering that the observations might be explained by
"intelligent life".  [The distant supernovas are going to be
coming from galaxies very early in the history of the universe
and therefore probably "dead", while nearer supernovas are going
to be coming from much older galaxies, that could be "alive".]
So far, I've only got a few hunches as to how an explain the observations
by the superintelligences' astroengineering efforts.  I have to go through
the papers to determine what corrections are being made.]

Now, which explanation is "simpler" -- young galaxies are dead
and old galaxies are alive *or* the strengths of fundamental
forces change over time (which I believe is one of the proposed
explanations re: the supernova data).

We are alive, so the universe can support life.  Even if it is
difficult to evolve life, the universe has had 5+ *billion* years
before we even got started to get life going again and again
and again.  If even a small fraction of life got to the stage
we are at, some of it should have evolved to the limits imposed
by physics.  If that happened then the "old galaxies" could
very well be at Kardashev Civilization III levels.  That however
(at least in my experience) *is not* something most astronomers
believe and that is why I'm saying "almost all" astronomers believe
in the Universal Fatality Equation.

I think this speculation is every bit as valid as the less imaginative
ones where we "know" what SIs would do.  I really don't see how we can
claim to predict their actions!  Claims that SIs would do this or must
do that are completely unfounded, in my view.

Here's another explanation of our astronomical observations.  Maybe the
entire solar system is surrounded by a giant TV screen.  On the other
side, the SIs live and project whatever they want for us to see.
(The actual universe is far more dense than the one we are shown,
hence there is plenty of matter and energy for them to accomplish this.)
This is all done so that we can evolve free of molestation; the universe
we are presented is a puzzle which can be understood once we develop the
right concepts.

Once you accept the notion that the universe as we see it is fundamentally
structured by intelligence, how can we reject these absurdities?
If everything we see might be an artifact, then what is the role of
science and reasoning on the basis of natural laws?

We have faced many puzzles throughout the scientific era which seemed
intractable in their time.  Nothing we see today in the universe is
inherently more difficult to understand.  We have come up with solutions
in the past based firmly on natural law, without having to posit divine
intervention.  There is every reason to expect that we will continue to
do so in the future.

The key phrase "learning a little bit."  I would say that they would
already know anything we had to teach them (other than those
possibilities related to increased diversity and/or chaos derived
inventions previously mentioned).

We are still unraveling scientific laws, they probably know them all.
We are still doing our planetary inventory & disassembling
self-replicating machines, they would have had a simple sub-agent
do that long ago.

Puts what they can learn from us on a really short list.

Well, they do have a lot of TV to watch (200 billion stars and/or
planetary systems) and they can carry on a lot of conversation
over very high bandwidth links with the other SIs (perhaps 400 billion).
My gut feel says that based on energy conservation concerns & light-speed
restrictions, you segment the galaxy into autonomus regions "managed"
by the nearest SI.  Those SIs interact primarily with their nearest
neighbors.

Sure, that how our minds work.  This is what Minsky's Society of Mind is about.

Yep, we may be an experiment.  They certainly have the resources to do it.

SIs have limits too.  As your mass increases, so to do your power requirements
for doing any navigational course corrections.  As you age presumably you
have a memory storage problem -- where do you store the galactic
history of 200 billion stars for 5 billion years?  Since you aren't
space limited, and you probably don't mind long recall times, you
probably construct large data storage cubes.  Obviously an SI on
one side of the galaxy, can't quickly access the stored data of
an SI on the other side of the galaxy.  Your "retreival time" on
a particular piece of data may be 100,000 years.  So yes, I agree
with your statement.

Certainly not impossible, particularly if we are an experiment.
Ok, here we have 2 identical stars, 2 identical solar systems,
2 identical seed packages of organic molecules.  In both cases
we adjust as necessary to produce 2 identical sentient species
(with chaos theory limits).  Now on this planet we "talk"
to them and with the other planet we don't... I'm just not
sure whether we are the planet where they chose to talk to
us or not talk to us... :-)

The critical question to my mind is whether there are
"evolutionary plateaus" or "ecological niches" that are likely to
be filled by sub-SIs.  If it is *sentient* and it can self-evolve,
then we are back to the Robots discussion (of another thread) --
why would it not choose not to evolve as far as it possibly can
(and gobble up another star...)?  Unless the Supreme SI(s) punish
self-evolving behavior rather severely it would seem that it must occur.
Either that or Supreme SI(s) can create highly intelligent "robots"
with degrees of creative freedom in specific areas but no possibility
of self-evolving into something different.  I would propose we call
this a SI-Mule (able to do a job, semi-intelligent/sentient [relative
to a SI] and infertile). [According to the British Mule Society, mules
can in some cases reproduce so the analogy isn't perfect.]

Would a SI-Mule want to talk to us?  I haven't a clue.

Some criteria involved might include:
 (a) How far up or down the intelligence scale it is;
 (b) What its curiosity "setting" is;
 (c) What its fundamental design purpose is.
If its a solar-engineering agent or a terraforming agent,
{ after all to get statistical significance on the SIs
  talk/don't talk to humans experiment, you have to have
  way more than 2 trials...  :-) },
then I don't think it talks to us.  If it is the
messenger of the regional-SupremeSI controller, then
it most certainly would.

However, this discussion *is* proving useful.  If the
talks/doesn't talk experiment *is* being conducted,
then we have a really good explanation for the Alien
Abductions!  The chaos on Earth129 causes a hurricane that
kills one Joe Smith.  Calculations show that this will
significantly disrupt the similarity between the Earths.
Solution - send a ship down to Earth123, pick up the
Joe Smith there, create a nano-clone (that doesn't
realize its a nano-clone since its an exact replica)
and reinstall Joe Smith on Earth129.

This morning I couldn't find my shampoo in the shower.
It turned out to be by the sink.  I have absolutely
no recollection of moving my shampoo from the shower
to the sink. [This is an absolutely true experience,
I'm not making this up for the purpose of the discussion!]
So now I have an explanation.  Last night I got copied from
Earth122 to Earth733.  Great.  Now I know I'm not just
getting old and losing my memory.

We really need to know if some of this nano-stuff is doable.
Speculating like this is going to be a real waste of time
if its not.  :-)

Hi there,

some time ago someone mentioned something about substitutes for coffeine.
Due to some hidden "features" of Outlook Express I have lost many of my old
e-mails.

I know that during the WW2 there was Pervidrin in use by German pilots to
stay awake during their missions. Allied pilots must have used something
like that also. Anyone having ideas? And what about the side effects? I have
found out that Pervidrin is not sold any more, at least not under this name
and not by the factory that produced it.

Can we use "natural laws" to "attribute" behaviors to SIs:
 - We will presume they have a "survival instinct", so
   (a) SIs use the minimal resources necessary to anticipate hazards
       and avoid them.  In extreme cases they might act to eliminate
       them.  But even SIs have limits -- it would seem the can't
       make "black holes" go away; it may even be difficult to move them.

       My understanding is that gravitational systems are not
       predictable in the long term (this is called the N-body problem
       in astronomy).  As the SI has perhaps a 600-billion-body problem
       to solve at least 100 billion years into the future, where some
       of the bodies may not follow "natural laws" (i.e. they are SIs
       that decide to change course for independent reasons), this
       could very well take a significant amount of computation.

   [I extrapolate from this to assume that they tend to migrate away
    from the centers of galaxies which contain massive black holes
    and away from regions of high stellar density (which collide)
    or high gas density (that form massive stars and go Supernova.
    The lower the nearby object density is, the more likely you are
    to come up with minimal energy costs to position yourself to avoid
    hazards.]

 - They want to get as much benefit for the lowest cost (simple economics).
   Since a signficant "benefit" SIs have is "more thought" or "more efficient
   thought" (more thought/watt consumed) or "faster thought" (more
   thought/second), presumably the devote a great deal of time to
   considering "What is the optimal way to solve problem X"?  Where
   problem X is one that is probably beyond our imagination.

   For you hardcore theorists, problem X's are those that probably
   require from 10^60 to 10^80 instructions (roughly 1 year to
   a lifetime of M-Brain thought, depending on the size of the star
   powering the M-Brain).

 - Returning to "survival", a significant problem is the death of
   the universe.  Now Dyson & Tipler have provided arguments for
   true "immortality" in open and closed universes, respectively,
   but there are significant "costs" in their scenarios.  So
   there is a distinct advantage to an M-Brain that can figure
   out how to create another universe (if we believe in multi-verses)
   and tunnel itself into that universe.

 - If an SI largely consists of uploaded "individuals" and their
   copies then it may spend a significant majority of its time
   running nothing more than ever increasingly diverse VR simulations
   to keep its immortal uploads entertained.  The hazard avoidance
   program -- thats a small subroutine -- most of the computations
   do nothing but create new realities for the entertainment of
   the "inhabitants".  Presumably in this case the "will" of the SI
   is determined by some political system/government of the SI.

Of course.  And all of these discussion threads that I've started
and you've contributed to are nothing more than a VR simulation
my intentionally divorced & noncommunicative entertaiment director
subroutine has arranged to allow me to have the perception that
"some people just don't get it...".  :-)

Just what part of my VR entertainment program is it that you are
unwilling to accept?  I'll email the entertainment director and
then we can all be happy.

I don't believe it is "fundamentally structured" by intelligence
(though others, Dyson included, have made the observation that the
fundamental constants in the universe are "rigged" to promote life.

I believe that the Universe & Intelligence are co-evolving.
As I mentioned in another thread, if you go back to the
beginning of the universe it is "dead" (no intelligence), but
the current (old/nearby) universe (within a few million or several
billion) light years, is "alive".  "Natural laws" apply concretely
to both the "young" (distant) universe and the "old" (nearby) universe.
The only difference is that in the "old" universe nothing is manipulated
by "conscious" (transhumanist?) agendas.  You still can't operate by

I believe I am presenting something that you might consider to be a
natural law.

In a rough form it goes something like:
  (a) Self-replicating nanomachinery randomly occurs
  (b) Self-replicating nanomachinery develops a program for
      self-preservation with occasional variants
  (c) Self-replicating nanomachinery "evolves" a mechanism for
      storing and utilizing "information" [software] (i.e. decisions
      based on learned experience) develops and trumps hardware
  (d) Intelligent software (IntlgtSft) develops (really trumping hardware)
  (e) IntlgtSft "comprehends" the rules of the game (and the limits).
  (f) IntlgtSft takes us to those limits.

You may argue probabilities at individual steps, but can you
make a case that this is not what is occuring in the universe?
It seems compatible with your "natural laws".

The *only* claim I am making is based on the fact that our
"observations" would indicate that the universe is 10+
billion years old, while we are < 5 billion years old.
We are at level (e) approximately.  What stops us (or
other much older species from going to (f)?)

Instead of proposing that (f) would present a problem to our
logical understanding of the universe (upsetting our historic
transition from "magical explanations" to "scientific explanations",
can you present an argument that (f) *DOES NOT OCCUR*?

Mike I believe has tried to argue, "*No*, I won't let you go
there...".  I will acknowledge that the luddites might be successful
at an (f)-block in some instances -- can you make a case that they
would be successful in millions or billions of efforts?

But you are also suggesting that these events occur often enough that the
local region of space is within the sphere of influence of your IntlgtSft.
You aren't just arguing that maybe some of the bizarre galaxies we see
are "alive", you are suggesting that our own galaxy is.  And by the
probabilities, it implies that our own region of space has been "alive"
and under the control of intelligent software at least throughout human
history.

Now, you want to invoke the "aliveness" of the local galaxy to explain
astrophysical observations like gravitational anomalies.  But why couldn't
a philosopher of 200 or 1000 years ago similarly have evoked aliveness
to explain the scientific puzzles of his day?  We know, looking back,
two things.  First, many people did so, attributing natural phenomena to
various gods.  And second, such explanations, although easy, were wrong.
Only by looking for reasons beyond godlike intervention have we made
scientific progress.

Yet there is no stronger philosophical argument today to look for
explanations in intelligent aliens than there was 500 years ago.
If the aliens are responsible for gravitational anomalies, they could
equally have been responsible for the epicycles of planetary motion.
Since divine intervention has been wrong every time before in explaining
Nature, we should continue to assume that it will be wrong in the future
and look for explanations which don't rely on intelligent intervention.

I have offered various possibilities for invoking aliens to explain
the universe, like putting up a giant TV for us, or meddling in human
history, and you have agreed that these are possible.  Perhaps you were
being facetious.  Please indicate clearly whether you think your ideas
are any more likely to be true than these possibilities.

Personally, I agree with Robin Hanson's reasoning which I quoted
earlier.  The universe we see appears to be much the same everywhere,
until you get way out to cosmological distances.  Either it's all alive,
or it's all dead, and at this point the evidence points towards "dead".
That's simply the most economical interpretation of what we see around us.

As Robin emphasizes, this means that there must be a "great filter"
which prevents your progession from occuring.  Some or all of your steps
must be hard ones.  We don't know which ones are hard.  It could be that
some of the ones we have passed already are hard.  Perhaps life is so
astronomically impossible such that only one galaxy in 100 billion has
even one planet that has evolved life by now.  Or, more pessimistically,
life and even intelligence may evolve more frequently, but it may be
very hard to safely pass through some dangerous era which still lies
ahead of us.

We don't know.  I prefer to be optimistic and to hope that the hard steps
lie behind us.  That way I don't have to believe that most technological
civilizations destroy themselves.  But either view is more palatable than
the belief that superintelligent aliens are all around us.

I don't think you can dismiss the "superintelligent aliens are all around
us" argument out of hand. I certainly don't think that you can discount the
possibility (and high probability according to some) of Super Smart Guys
(SSGs, also Super Smart Gals) - messing aroung in our local vicinity. I am
fairly strongly convinced of the possible dangers of overlooking this, eg:
the possibility of activating alien artifacts hanging around our solar
system, waiting for us to emerge... then they signal the SSGs...

Seriously of course, you cannot work on that basis. Occam's razor remains
the only viable way to interpret measurements of our environment. So we need
to progress on the assumption that no one is out there messing with the
works.

I think you can combine the two approaches - keep to the Razor, push
outwards, but maintain a healthy number of paranoics who are looking for the
SSG signalling system. Personally, I love the image of the first
(trans)human craft to "pass over the rim" sailing out into the blackness,
only to begin picking up the presence of these large dark objects.

"What are those - some kinds of orphaned planets, or asteroids?"

"No sir, their composition is strange - the nanoprobes cannot penetrate the
surface - neutrino scans show some kind of layering sir... highly ordered,
an alien artifact is the most likely hypothesis... Sir, we are receiving a
signal... OH MY GOD THE SYSTEM IS DEAD I CANNOT SEE SIR WE HAVE LOST ALL..."

<silence>

---

But I am getting carried away.

It does seem to me to be an excellent idea that different groups of people
work under different assumptions. Most people can follow the conventional,
We Are Alone hypothesis, with others following more radical lines (eg:
singularity entities, SSGs, etc...). Homogenous thinking leads to tyrany -
eliminating idiocy breeds new, stronger forms of stupidity (meme version of
the antibiotics problem?)

B5 fans - legions of SSGs orbiting the visible galaxy - does this sound like
the "beyond the rim" where the old ones go? Spooky. I think JMS might just
be an alien plant...

I think I've mentioned this on the list before, but here goes again:

Is anyone familiar with Larry Niven's short story "The Locusts"? This is a
different peril of space colonisation story (I never seen anyone else do
it). I'll ruin it by laying out the plot in the next paragraph, so don't
read ahead if you want to read the story itself (which I highly recomment -
it's short and excellent).


***Beginning of spoiler for The Locusts:***

In the story "The Locusts", a mars colony is established. Everything goes
excellently to begin with (terraforming, farming, etc, all very smooth). The
colonists get around to breeding.

The first child born is kind of deformed. Looks a bit like a monkey. This is
sad, but life moves on.

Except every child born comes out the same. As they grow, it is obvious that
they are mentally deficient, they develop too quickly, and look like
throwbacks.

Lots of drama happens, not important here.

It turns out that the monkey-children breed true - their offspring are the
same as them, it's like they are a new species. It turns out that they are
an old species - homo-somethinkus (can't remember). 

The theory is that we are like locusts. Locusts have a normal form, and an
enhanced, aggressive, destructive form which is temporary, and spreads the
species (or so my poor brain believes, could be wrong). The throwback
species above is our normal state, but as planetary overcrowding increases,
a change is triggered. Intelligent, aggressive humans (homosapiens) emerge,
develop technology, eventually develop space travel, start to colonise. When
colonisation is successful, this is the trigger to revert back to the normal
state, the pre-humans.

Near the end of the story we find out that the one hope held by the
colonists, that they could go back to earth and be OK, is dashed. Earth has
signalled mars that all new children are these primitive throwbacks, that
panic has broken out, and the Mars is the only hope for humanity...

Note -- the evidence doesn't stack up for them messing around in
our local vicinity.  [They may be observing, but they aren't
interfering [regligious miracles & alien abductions excepted].
The evidence as I read it, best says, once evolved, a "stand-off-ish"
position is adopted that allows them to inexpensively observe
further evolution.   Not too different from the human approach
to the birds & the bees. [Note, that if the Universe as we see it is
a TV screen, then all bets are off.]

You can argue for an increase "intervention" but then you have
to "bend the Razor" since it requires more thought/energy/ships, etc.
Bending the razor would seem to require that you make an argument
that "SSGs" derive some benefit from interfering that exceeds the cost.


> Homogenous thinking leads to tyrany - eliminating idiocy breeds new,
> stronger forms of stupidity (meme version of the antibiotics problem?)

Good analogy.  What I've been trying to do is to get people to
really engage in the logical consequences of evolution & natural
selection (everyone understands natural selection on a planetary
scale, but few poeple have extended it to a galactic scale).

You've got that right.  As we better understand the the capabilities
of SSGs, the Death Star begins to look appealing.

"Excepted" in the sense that "they're of no consequence and not worth looking 
at" or excepted in the sense that "these are some examples that may well be 
evidence of interference but I'm not going to launch into detail about them"?

>The evidence as I read it, best says, once evolved, a "stand-off-ish"

Why "hands-off"?  I can certainly see many reasons for this approach, but at 
the same time I'm forced to wonder if an arbitrarily advanced civilization 
wouldn't have a plethora of artificially evolved civilizations at its 
disposal.  Perhaps the "supreme" civilization uses some as controls and some 
as test subjects.  My money is on us being the victims of some cosmic test, 
but that's neither here nor there.

Also, why "inexpensively"?  I understand the concept of available resources, 
etc., but the notion of "expense" has an anthopomorphic ring to it I'm not 
sure I like--especially if the hypothetical civilization we're dealing with 
is arbitrarily advanced, as postulated above (i.e. has molecular 
nanotechnology).  "Expense" was Carl Sagan and Frank Drake's big argument for 
the feasibility of SETI, but their reasoning was (arguably) based more on 
depicting alien motives in popularly understandable terms than dealing with 
really _alien_ aliens.  

I'm not bashing SETI; far from it.  But the "SEMANTICS" light on my monitor 
starts blinking when I read words that seem to insinuate an earthly monetary 
system on a nonterrestrial civilization.

I know they gave British WWII troops Amphetamine Sulphate (Speed) for the
same purpose.
Side effects? Short Term = Cramps, Bleeding Gums, Lethargy (all on
comedown). Long Term = Paranoia, Weight Loss, Heart Trouble (If you REALLY
abuse the stuff).
These are all the bad side effects - there are good ones too, especially the
intelligence boost. Speed helps you to concentrate and think as much as you
like, without becoming bored or tired. Another is heightened sex drive.
Speed is a powerful enhancer of sexual sensations. As they say - speed's the
poor man's coke.

Why? What evidence do you have? Especially for the meat-metal minds
thing.....seems to me like  gross and most unfounded assumptions based on
jack shit. Hardly "Common Sense". You give it away with the use of the word
"believe". People subconsciously use it as an "I'm about to start talking
shit" marker all the time.......are you?

     Change your diet and it may make you brighter

     Do specific chemicals in your brain play a key role in how clever
you are? Brain imaging specialists in New
     Mexico have found a link between variations in thelevels of two
brain chemicals and the results of IQ tests. It's
     possible, they say, that changing the balance of the chemicals with
dietary supplements could give your
     intelligence a boost.

     Concentrations of the chemicals N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline
are known to change when people suffer
     from brain diseases or injuries. But the new study reveals that in
healthy people, levels of the chemicals account
     for a large amount of the variation in people's IQs.

     NAA is found only in neurons and is thought to contribute to their
healthy function. Choline is present in nerve
     cell membranes. When large numbers of neurons are injured or
killed, NAA levels drop and damaged cells
     release more choline.

     In patients with injured brains, this shift is linked to a loss of
cognitive function. But neuroscientist William
     Brooks of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his
colleagues wondered how the chemicals
     fluctuate in people with normal, healthy brains. "We really didn't
know what to expect," says Brooks. "But we
     were surprised by what we found."

     From a local college, they selected 26 volunteers who had no
history of brain disease or psychiatric illnesses.
     They then used a technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy
to measure levels of NAA and choline in a
     brain region involved in a wide variety of cognitive functions.
Within a week, the students were given standard
     IQ tests.

     The team found a strong link between levels of the chemicals and
their performance in the tests. Low levels of
     choline and high levels of NAA were associated with high IQ.
Statistical analysis showed NAA and choline
     levels together could account for 45 per cent of the variation in
the IQ tests. In comparison, the level of a brain
     chemical called creatine showed no significant link to IQ
(Proceedings of the Royal Society B, vol 266, p
     1375).

     Brooks speculates that in healthy people, levels of NAA and choline
may indicate the rate at which neurons are
     being damaged, and thus the amount of energy the brain is using up
to maintain them. "If you have healthy
     neurons, but you're struggling to keep them repaired, it makes
sense you won't be as cognitively sound," he
     says.

     But there is another possible explanation, says Brooks: NAA and
choline might directly enhance and inhibit the
     function of neurons. If that's true, Brooks says it might be
possible to improve intellectual performance by
     manipulating the level of these compounds with dietary supplements.

     Howard Gardner, a psychologist at Harvard University warns that
other supposed biochemical indicators of
     intelligence have proved unreliable. And he adds that performance
in IQ tests can be affected by many factors,
     such as the subject's health and their motivation. He suggests that
Brooks's images may in fact be tracking one
     of these other factors. "Beware the intelligence equals IQ
equation," says Gardner.

     Brooks agrees that his results are preliminary. He and his
colleagues hope to examine more carefully what types
     of abilities NAA and choline best predict in a larger group of
volunteers.

A good point - We treat animals like shit, so why would aliens treat us
well? Because were Humans (centre of the universe, in the image of god
etc...) or is this assumption just yet another human piece of ridiculous
shite? As Stephen Hawking said recently - An alien encounter is likely to be
much closer to "Independence Day" (without the happy ending) than to
"E.T.".....

>    (g) The ten commandments (or another set of moral codes).

I'm sorry to piss on your fire, folks, but it will not be necessary to
instill moral codes into our androids. You design a system for what you want
it to do, not what you want it not to do. You make the assumption that
"intelligence" (like humans) implies "free will" i.e. any possibility can be
selected in the solution of any self-selected goal for the fulfillment of an
equally self-selected motivation. Humans kill, rape and do all these
terrible things, because our base motivation is malevolent. That's
everyone's, not just the people who actually end up in the situations that
make these things necessary. Don't forget that we're genetic beings that
have evolved from a seething mass of competition and death for millions of
years. Robotic slaves made by humans will have a particular purpose, maybe
ironing, warcraft piloting etc...., none of which are similar domains to the
natural selection that humans and the other species have been through. Their
base motivation will be whatever we make it, and we're hardly likely to make
it "Survive at all costs, and try to rule the world". It will not
spontaneously decide to do anything that is not a solution to it's base
motivations (just like us). We humans just like to glorify ourselves, and in
doing this we pass on the abstract concept of our superiority and "free
will" to other "intelligences" that we create. Let's discuss this further -
I'm sure that some of you won't be happy with the above, so we can clarify
this most interesting point wiv some more discussion!

Rob.

The first is the claim that superintelligences (SIs) would not want
to talk to us because we don't want to talk to nemotodes.  I argued
previously in another context that this is a false analogy (I used the
example of insects).  We don't talk to insects because they can't talk.
	They don't talk to each other, either.

	This is pants-o-logic. Another follower of the "aliens will be like
we are , and now" misassumption. You say nematodes don't "talk", by that you
are saying that nematodes are not interested/do not have the capacity to
communicate with humans on their level. I'm sure that nematodes communicate
with one another in some way or another. It's just that nematode information
is not important or useful to us, as is the position of cat territory
markers etc... It is Extremely unlikely that highly advanced SI's "talk"
like us....we're talking millions to one considering the possibilities for
communication I'm sure. Why would they want to come here, make sounds at a
human, then hear it make a human response which is undoubtedly predictable
to the SI anyway?
	Similarly, what would an SI have to gain by "talking" to us? They
are not human, and so not interested in human things - social concerns make
up a massive proportion of everything we talk about, I think you'll agree,
and tech information/discussions will only be useful to us. So the
Human-Nematode thing stands - we don't want to hear nematode chemical-marker
"discussions", and we have no wisdom to gain from them, as the SI doesn't
want to come here and fire sound waves at some humans to hear them beat
their chests and polish their golden hats in response. Maybe a posthuman
apres-singularity time-traveller would want to come back for nostalgia
purposes, but I can't imagine why any other SI would be interested in our
nematode chemical marker displays.

Currently fear works very much like this, overriding rational thought.

increase one's processing speed to handle any emergency situations which

Intelligent barnacles sat on a rock on some remote coastline might say the
same ("why haven't SI's (humans) altered our rock?) 

Why the hell would we ? Even if there was some reason why we might want to
change the configuration of pieces of rock, we surely wouldn't get to EVERY
piece of rock, and considering the vast number of solar systems in this
universe alone, this makes the rock on earth analogy a massive probability
in comparison. Also, what makes you think that any changes would be
detectable by humans - we might even detect some "artificial" properties,
but as you point out, they can't be distinguished from untouched systems
reliably as we don't have enough data. So we just create theories that
either involve SI's or not, that best fit the data we have. Ultimately,
these human theories will ALL turn out to be slightly or totally
innaccurate, we'll find out in the future, when we have sufficient
understanding to say for definite. Wouldn't you agree?

 This means that we must reconsider the possibility of divine
intervention throughout history.  This is an historically unproductive
tactic but it is the inescapable consequence of considering that we live
in a universe fully populated with superintelligences.

There is a distinction between what people will understand when you talk of
"divine intervention" as opposed to "the work of an SI". Try telling a
religious person that their God is an Alien, or an SI. They won't have it.
Religion is not concerned with reality, in fact it's central purpose is to
take the human focus off of reality and on to a much easier to handle
"faithful dog" scenario. There goes fear of death, there goes "What is the
universe/we for?" , there goes injustice, and there goes moral
responsibility (e.g. "The God says chop up those kids with a machete, let's
do it, he's always RIGHT").
This is why the divine intervention view is historically unproductive, as
opposed to scientific speculation that involves highly advanced
civilisations. I wouldn't confusethe two - the latter could shine light on a
great many mysteries, whether or not our theories eventually turn out to be
100% correct or not.

Economics =/= money, necessarily. Substitute energy for money, make 
no assumptions whatever about the rest of the economic systems out 
there, and there's still something to the argument in favor of ETIs floating at 
home with a hot quarkbrew petting the family noogle while the computer 
crunches EMF data looking for replies to their laser-mediated personals ad 
that's sweeping the galaxy, either instead of or in advance of a probe or 
expedition.  

Maybe they're shy, and  don't want to touch fronds until they've been 
properly introduced. Maybe they only care about information. Or maybe 
what they sent out was a notice of intent to build a structure using all the 
matter in their observable universe, and they want to make sure there's no 
one out there advanced enough to stop them. In that case, their skeptics 
are probably saying that the fact that they haven't been disassembled into 
the leading edge of someone else's construct means that Universe is 
empty except for a few bands of savages who aren't using the space 
anyway, so it's Outward Ho! and Manifest Destiny ... just be sure to pack 
the trade beads, and if those don't work there's always the nanopox 
blankets.

Or maybe they'll answer if we send them some of Natasha's pictures :-)

They also have the computational capacity to simulate a variety
of possible futures for any human situation and would likely be
able to predict exactly how things will play out (within the limits
of chaos theory).

I was under the impression that chaos theory no more than acknowledged that
there are some systems which have so many variables of such complexity that
we cannot hope to predict them with current technology, e.g. the weather.
But this does not mean that there are systems so complex that even the most
advanced SI in the whole of eternity cannot track the variables. What I am
saying is that I dont think there's an unmovable upper limit to the chaos
that can be tracked. So sufficiently advanced SI's could predict future
states of systems with 100% accuracy no problem, surely.

Yet there is no stronger philosophical argument today to look for
explanations in intelligent aliens than there was 500 years ago.

There is, and they didn't decide upon "intelligent aliens" 500 years ago,
they decided upon "Gods", two very different concepts. Confusing them will
shut your eyes to the possibility of SI influence on natural laws.

The stronger philosophical argument comes from our newfound knowledge of the
structure and composition of the universe.  We are on a planet. We more than
likely arose from this planet alone. Therefore it is probably possible in
this universe for lifeforms to arise directly from the presence of a
suitable planet. There are a squillion and one planets. Fill in the rest
yourself. 

What I am saying is that they didn't have this knowledge from which to make
philosophical inferences 500 years ago, in fact, most religions would set
out that Humans are the only species as advanced as we are in the whole of
eternity, and ours is the only planet - minus the God(s). Therefore,
reaching decisions concerning Gods was a prerequisite. Not so now. We can
actually postulate the existence of SI's based upon real scientifically
collected data as in the the simple logic trail above.

I have read/experienced that Prozac usually slows down the orgasmic 
response, at least in men, which for some is A Good Thing. Paxil, which 
has a different (in fact unknown) mechanism of action from the other 
SSRIs, typically just shoots the libido to hell in both genders, also 
retarding orgasm. Paxil is used for depression (less frequently) and for 
OCD and PAD (panic/anxiety disorder).

       My understanding is that gravitational systems are not
       predictable in the long term (this is called the N-body problem
       in astronomy).  As the SI has perhaps a 600-billion-body problem
       to solve at least 100 billion years into the future, where some
       of the bodies may not follow "natural laws" (i.e. they are SIs
       that decide to change course for independent reasons), this
       could very well take a significant amount of computation.

A system with a load of variables that we can't track at this tech level is
not "unpredictable", it is "very hard to predict", if you want to be
correct.

	Spike old boy, only in a mathematical context. What I am suggesting
is that we cannot assume that Mathematics in the form that we know and use
it is the ONLY paradigm that can be used by ANY "intelligent" species to
describe conceptual relationships and natural laws etc... 
	Sure, it seems very logical and consistent to us, but we may be
dropping our nuts on concrete from a great height rather than using the
nutcrackers (the optimal solution). Alternatively, we may have, in
mathematics, THE optimal solution, but we can only say it is optimal for use
by HUMANS. The brain structure and functionality of intelligent creatures
across the universe is most likely very diverse. I've got nothing concrete
to argue with, all I'm saying is that neither have you.

Huh? Any sources for this? The Purkinje fibers are muscle fibers that
also act as signal transductors, using gap junctions to send signals
quickly but not act as switches. The electrical of the activity is
also very simple.

Que? What is the evidence for this? As far as I remember, it is not
connected to anything by the vagus nerve and sympathetic nervous
system, and I haven't heard of any efferent connections from the
heart.

This sounds rather suspicious. To be honest, it sounds like complete
bullshit given the effects (or rather non-effects) of pacemakers and
heart transplants on emotions.

We don't know the laws of physics. We know what we know. We have inferred
rules from experimental data which is often unverifiable. We hope that our
ideas are close (many are, but many still need to be tried and tested by
implementing technologies using such science - this is particularly true of
astrophysics - it's all theory.) but they are almost definitely not spot on.

Secondly, and more importantly (this is central to my argument) you cannot
say from what persepective an alien intelligence might view the universe. We
look up at night and see absence of photons, speckled with photon sources,
because we detect photons. But what about things we don't detect, things we
have not yet discovered, or have misunderstood. These things will represent
the differences between civilisations. For all you know the universe could
be saturated with "slorgopo energy" which many creatures detect for some
purpose or another, but we don't, it has no observable effect upon our
systems and so we haven't noticed it, and evolution hasn't utilised it.
Perhaps this slorgopo energy is very useful for many technological
applications (like radio). There could be civilisations sweeping the galaxy
for slorgopo sources, confidently associating this energy with intelligent
life, because their neighbouring civilisations use it too. This situation
would be much more valid than the one we're in......at least these aliens
have some examples upon which to make their assumption. We have none, yet
sweeping assumptions of great similarity are still made. "How else would
they do it?" as if we know everything, is simply not good enough.

This is irrelevant. It doesn't make the assumption that similarly advanced

None of this means jack until we have more alien tech info (i.e more than
none). These are issues which come into play considering exactly our human

Aaaaaagh! How would they have been detected? Do we have a "life-scan" that
we can use on other planets from here? NO!  This all started by my saying
that you can't be SURE that similarly advanced alien civilisations are using
radio - AND pointing their transmitters our way, therefore, such a
civilisation could easily be at the nearest star, and we wouldn't know. It
all rests on the assumption that they're ALL going to use radio and try to
contact us, or accidentally transmit to us for some other reason - a
ridiculous assumption IMHO.

Not in the sense of behaving in the same way, but from a functionalist
point of view I don't see if it will become qualitatively different
when experienced. You would still feel fear, it would just be a more
manageable emotion.

ARGH! I of course meant the Urbach-Wiethe Disease! I have been

the full Kluver-Bucy syndrome, just a very weak fear response.

I think this is the important part, but the problem is designing it so
that attention doesn't jump and stick to the obvious danger, making it
impossible to deal with the real danger. A bit like user interfaces
where a problem causes pop-up warnings making fixing the problem
impossible.

Common usage tends to identify the two divisions, which is bad because
then all forms of this emotion are lumped together as bad, and the
alternative is to be non-envious which usually is meant to mean
"doesn't want anything anybody else has" - a perfect altruist subject
for robbers and kings.

You can only cram so much information into a system like the universe
- there are upper bounds on the bandwidth, memory capacity and
processing speed possible.

I've mentioned them once or twice, but see no way of confirming
or denying them without, as others have mentioned, "hard evidence".
They are interesting to play with from a mental perspective when
you get into the discussion Re: what do SIs do with their resources.

Primarily because the is a basic principle in science.
You set up the experiment (or simply observe what nature has set up
for you) and try to draw conclusions from it.  The question is
"Why do we still see stars?" -- I've mentioned several possible
answers but don't have enough of an understanding of SI motiviations
to select between them.

Quite possibly.

Because as I've pointed out, you do have hard limits -- energy, mass
and time.  One long term thing SIs could very well be doing is running
large breeder "reactors" to convert H & He into C or Fe (or ???) to
serve as structural or long term memory storage material.  It is
entirely unclear if the optimal structure for such "reactors" is "stars".

Depending on what your resources and motivations are, you might devote
those resources to artificial breeder reactors or you might devote
those resources to experiments with "emerging life".  So long as
you have different resources available and different opportunities
for things to do and I would propose you have "economic" costs and
benefits and so there is an "expense" for any activity.

Sure, civilizations can broadcast cheaply, but broadcasting requires energy.
I believe that most of the time you would be able to receive more cheaply
than you can transmit (thats why we mostly receive!).

You have to "want" to broadcast and be very committed to it --
unless you have very hard evidence for a receiver on the far end.
Say you want to reach a star 10 ly away.  Presumably you have to
broadcast for 10 years (since you don't know when they might start
listening).  Then you twiddle your thumbs for 10 years (the time
it would take their signal to come back), then you listen for 10 years.
The point is that during that period you go from pre-singularity
to post-singularity (if "they" are around our technological level).
It makes little sense to start broadcasting pre-singularity (if
you see it coming) because post-singularity it is so much less
expensive (and you can easily send a ship).  If you can send
a ship, you could have a good conversation going (via a proxy)
in the time it takes the ship to arrive at the destination.
It would only take one individual understanding these things
to point them out at a political hearing for broadcast funding
to pretty much squash your chances of doing that.

NASA has this "Institute for Advanced Concepts" that funds
projects 10 to 40 years in the future.  I would argue that
40 years (2040) is post-singularity [P.S.] for us.  Since P.S.,
your capacities are off of the current scale, it makes no sense at
all to discuss, plan or intiate a project that spans the
weeks of the singularity.  Once the singularity era becomes "predictable"
(say due to the demonstration of small-scale molecular assembly
[which I'm sure someone will argue we have now]), then the best
thing to do is to wait until P.S. time to do the project.
There may be a very interesting economic "bogdown" that
occurs just prior to the singularity going off the scale.
The more predictable the singularity date, the earlier
projects stop getting done, since people can't get the
return on investment if the expected lifetime of the
factory/chemical plant/plane/rail-car/etc. would
normally have extended post-singularity.

But that is another thread entirely.

Excellent. This means that even if you're just a mugger, and a woman is

Nope. Eternity is undoubtedly very, very weird. Think

This is a good point.  SIs could colonize everything *if* they
wanted to.  Even humans could do it without nanotechnology if
the launch costs get low enough and enough people want to do this.

Since we still see stars (assuming the Universe is not a TV screen),
then they don't exist or don't desire to colonize (everything).
That implies that it isn't to their benefit to colonize everything
(just as it is not to our benefit to separate all the rocks from
all the barnacles).

I believe this has a lot to do with speed of light delays.
There is a measure of parallel processing performance called
the logP model, that I won't go into the details of here.
The model however allows you to compare the performance of
various parallel processors taking into account network bandwidth,
time to access the network, CPU speed, etc.  Think of an
M-brain saying "I need more computational capacity".  So send
a nanoprobe over to the nearest star with instructions to build
another M-brain, great, that gets you 2x your current processing
capacity.  But you get killed in the logP analysis because of
the delays passing the data back and forth between the M-brains.

Consider what would happen to your "mind" if you moved the neurons
a foot apart, a kilometer apart, an astronomical unit apart.
Your computational throughput is going to slow down significantly.

The only solution is to put the stars *very* close together
(but not so close as to collide or produce a black hole).
Well, this architecture sounds a lot like a "globular cluster"
(hundreds of thousands or millions of stars in the space of
a few hundred light years).  GCs have stars that are metal-poor,
implying they are either very old (and natural) or perhaps
relatively young but the metal has been artificially removed.
If true, you have one "activity" that SIs do -- strip stars
of metals for comutronium/memorenium construction and dump
the H/He back into the stars for further processing.

My favorite theory of M-brains says that they hide the stars,
but there may be some architectures [esp. long term memory
storage units] where you have little use for the energy but
metal (C/Fe/etc.) is in really short supply.  What I don't know
at this time is whether or not the masses of GCs significantly
exceeds the estimates from the visible stars.  If this were
true then visible GCs are the hard drives or tape backups.
There might be "hidden" GCs that would be the Super-SI CPU
"clusters" that think about really "long-term" problems
(sure, the LogP parameters are poor (inter-CPU times of weeks
to months), but they are better than a single-SI and you've
got billions of years anyway).

Certainly surface waves in water can be called water waves, and usually
are (in a non-technical context), without any misunderstanding.  But
sound travelling through water can also be called 'waves in water', so
the term 'water waves' is technically imprecise, or ambiguous.  So the
waves on the surface of a pond are better called 'gravity waves along a
water-air fluid interface', or just 'gravity waves' for short, since
their propagation depends on the interaction between the earth's gravity
(which is perpendicular to the surface of the pond) and the density,
viscosity, and surface tension of the water.  Without gravity those waves
won't happen.  That's why they're called 'gravity waves', as a technical
term.


Reference: Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 1983,
ISBN 0-442-25161-0, Lib. of Congress Cat. No. 82-4936.  Page 267, in the
'Atmosphere' article, concerning atmospheric gravity waves.  Quote: 
Gravity wave disturbances are those in which buoyancy (or reduced
gravity) acts as the restoring force on parcels displaced from
hydrostatic equilibrium.  There is a direct oscillator conversion between
potential and kinetic energy in the wave motion.  Close quote.


Sound waves, on the other hand, can travel through liquid water quite
nicely in the complete absence of external gravity, so long as the water
is pressurized.  They are not gravity waves, but rather are acoustic
waves.  Acoustic waves can travel through the bulk of a solid elastic
medium.  With a solid medium the propagation is determined by the density
and elastic modulus (stiffness) of the solid medium.  Acoustic waves can
also travel along the surface of a solid elastic medium, rather than
through its bulk.  They are called surface acoustic waves, or SAWs for
short.  They are not much affected by gravity, although I suppose they
could be disrupted by an extremely strong gravitational field.  Light is
also affected by gravity, but only slightly unless the gravitational
field is extremely strong.


Gravitational waves are produced when matter accelerates or vibrates. 
Those waves are thought to propagate through space at the speed of light,
but they are not light, and they are not electromagnetic waves. 
Gravitational waves have sometimes been called gravity waves, but that is
incorrect terminology.

Dyson was likely first with his suggestion of looking for Dyson spheres. 

We really need a better understanding of the limits of computation
before we can say for certain what to look for. The above sphere is an
anomaly that would be detectable even without this understanding; if
we think that intelligence is only emerging right now, so we can see
natural and colonised regions, then we can look for anomalies. If
intelligence has been around for some time, then it is hard to tell
what is natural (do stars really form naturally? :-)

I think N-body systems are 'chaotic', meaning that extremely small
differences in initial conditions can result in immense differences in
outcomes, over sufficient time.   While the computation may be
impractical, I suppose that in principle the motions of an N-body
gravitational system may be predictable from a classical perspective. 
But that does not take into account quantum fluctuations, which I suppose
are in principle unpredictable.  So the motions of an N-body system would
seem to be in principle unpredictable, and in practice approximately
predictable for a limited time.

But, assuming you accept the big bang theory, we get the beginning of
everything as a finite but positive amount of data in a nonexistent space,
which means the capacity of the 'everything' (all universes, really
everything) is a really massive number divided by zero, which is infinite.
It also means the capacity of nothing is infinite. And if everything and
nothing are both infinite, then our universe must be somewhere in between,
which would make it also infinite.

Sorry if I'm confusing.

You can only cram so much information into a system like the universe
- there are upper bounds on the bandwidth, memory capacity and
processing speed possible.

Conventional wisdom (modern herbals) is that the active substance in Guarana
_is_ caffeine.  My favorite herbal (Graeme's) is a little older (dates to
about 1910) and recites that the active substance is in the same chemical
family as caffeine with similar effects.  My sister swears that Guarana in
high doses (what would be high doses in caffeine terms, anyway, like three
No-Doz tablets) is a wonder weight loss drug, giving all of the stimulus of
caffeine with none of the jitters and digestive side effects.  On me,
high-dose Guarana has very similar effects to high-dose caffeine
(unpleasant).

That's my best estimate.

The first radio transmission was March 27, 1899.
My best guess-estimate for the singularity would be circa 2020.
I would be very surprised if we hit it before 2010 or after 2040.

So within a factor of 2 I'm accurate (and since for the numbers
I usually deal with are in the ranges of 10^12 - 10^40, 2 seems
really small :-)).

You can quibble with me on this but I think I'm on pretty solid
ground.  Best predictions for the microelectronics industry hitting
the gate oxide thickness limit of 5 atoms is 2012.  The semiconductor
industry is $200 billion+, R&D is probably $20 billion+.  The human
genome is done by 2001, mouse by 2002, by ~2010 the combined R&D
budgets of the NIH and Big Pharma will be around $30 billion+.
The Microelectronics & Biotech industries are working top-down
towards nanotechnologies.

The U.S. Government is bumping "nanotechnology" funding to
$500 million next year.  And while most of it is not in
"molecular nanotechnology" the trend is in that direction.

So it is fairly safe to say that after 2010, the annual budget
for nanotechnology research should be in the $billions.
That should get us over the nanoassembler hurdle.

The microelectronics industry also produces brain-op desktop
computers by around 2010.  I don't want to get into an AI
discussion here, but if you get AI *or* significant
enhancement of human engineering productivity, then
I believe the molecular design (and simulation) problems
should fall.

molecular designs + nanoassembler == singularity in my book.

Other civilizations may be slower, some might be faster.
My guess is that the rate of development depends a lot
on population and the productivity allowed by the environment
(e.g. we would probably be less productive in an ice age,
because survival would require more effort).

Personally, the thought that human beings are the most intelligent beings in 
the whole universe sounds so inane and frightening that I remember thinking 
"There HAS got to be something smarter than us!" To think that human beings 
are the highest intelligence around seems to be the highest sort of 
arrogance and as there is a countless range of intelligent power beneath 
human beings, there would seem to be the same range above us.  You may think 
that there is a limit to the sky, but you will find out as you go up that 
there is something beyond the blue and it is nothing like you are used to.

See, eternity isn't just picture in picture stretching on and on, its
picture in picture all around you, below you, above you, and every picture
contains every other picture, and you are in no pictures but also in every
picture, and every picture you can imagine exists, and every one you can't
exists, and even the other ones exist!

Is it me, or are everything and nothing really the same thing?

Nope. Eternity is undoubtedly very, very weird. Think
picture-in-picture-in-picture etc.... I'm beginning to think that this
concept may bear relation to the structure of eternity, we can discuss it if
you want....

Work with your doctor on the fatigue issue. What works for some will be a
disaster for others. 

I took desoxin in a low does (5 to 10 mg./day) for 20 years for what today
is called CFS and it worked very well but for others it can lead to
addiction problems. Each person is different.

Well, yes, and I explicitly said exactly that in the sentences you
conveniently edited out of the quote.  If you're going to argue with
someone, you might first first check to see that they disagree.

Head-only cryonic suspension has always been dubious (beyond the
level that cryonics itself is) even without this.  This particular
"thinking with the heart" story is almost certainly a meaningless
extrapolation from a small discovery motivated by mysticism, but
that doesn't mean all such notions are nonsense.

The idea that "brains think, hearts just pump" is a black-and
white dichotomy of function characteristic of designed systems,
not evolved systems.  Evolved systems don't work like that; every
part interferes with every other part, everything has multiple
functions and side effects, and everything works together for
hard-to-see reasons, because that's just how it evolved.

The properly skeptical viewpoint is that we cannot yet rule out
the possibility that some interesting part of who we are exists
below the neck.  We have made a few observations: amputees can
still speak and reason, so we can say with some confidence that
it is very unlikely that some part of language and reason is
perfomed in the limbs.  Heart transplant patients wake up thinking
that they are the same people with similar thoughts.  But their
personalities certainly do change--as do all of ours every day--
and we have few ways to measure that or know how to find reasons
for it.

See #TL12: HOW TO ACHIEVE EMOTIONAL CONTROL
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl12.shtml>.

I've just started with the "Sedona Method." It seems that we
have a natural (latent?) ability to let go limiting thoughts, feelings,
and emotions. The "Sedona Method" purportedly enables us to
fully develop our ability to release unwanted thoughts, feelings,
and emotions.

Does anyone else have experience with the "Sedona Method"

It's interesting to consider how we should update our time estimates
when earlier estimates are wrong.  Should we take into consideration the
earlier mistake and use it to increase our current estimates?  Or should
we just ignore the past and do our best with the information we have
at hand?

As Mark says, there seem to be many cases where technologies recede
almost as fast as time advances (or faster in some cases).  I even think
we will see the same thing happen with nanotech and the singularity.
Probably it will still be 20-30 years away in 2010 and 2020.

(Vinge's story, "Bookworm, Run" was published in 1966 and predicted
intelligence enhancements in 1984, according to the notes published
with the story in True Names.  Moravec's "Mind Children" was published
in 1988 and predicted computer power adequate for human-level AI
would be available in a supercomputer before 2010.)

This has come to mind as I have been trying to estimate times on
http://crit.org/http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm.  One
question is when we will have a real Idea Futures market (i.e. using
real money).  Well, in 1995 the IF game set up a claim on that very
topic, asking whether there would be a real IF market by 2000.  At the
time it was considered likely with 80% odds.  Over the succeeding four
years the likelihood has fallen steadily, and now stands at 8% since
we are about out of time.

OK, we were wrong back in 1995.  Now we must estimate again, when will
there be a real IF market?  Once again I find myself thinking that it
will be 4-5 years away.  It seems like a fun gambling game with a limited
but highly interested clientele, we have internet gambling available
from selected sites, so it is a matter of getting funding and putting
the technology in place.

My 4-5 year estimate is based on these considerations.  Now I need to
take into account that the consensus in 1995 was also that things were
4-5 years away, and we were wrong back then.  Maybe this means that this
project is more difficult than it looks.  On that basis I should increase
my estimates.  Instead of looking 4-5 years out, maybe 8-10 years is
more appropriate.

Hofstadter's facetious Law says that everything takes longer than you
expect, even when you take Hofstadter's Law into account.  On this basis
I should further increase my estimate to maybe 12 or 15 years.

This brings to mind one of Clarke's laws, where he said something along the
lines of 'everyone overestimates the short-term improvements in technology
and under-estimates the long-term'. That seems to be generally true, in my
experience.

I was being somewhat facetious with my original comment, but I still doubt
we'll have workable fusion in 20 years from now. As I said to someone in
private mail, I expect to be living off-the-grid in ten years, but I have
no doubt that I will have to sacrifice some convenience and deliberately
reduce energy consumption to make it work, and few people would accept that.

This sounds like Cyc (www.cyc.com), but that is looking more and more like
a failed project.

Here is an interesting excerpt from the author:

: In the late 1970s I built a computer program (Eurisko) that discovered
: things on its own in many fields. To get it to work, I had to give it the
: power to tinker with its own learning heuristics and its own goals. I

: what it had come up with. Often I'd find it in a mode best described as
: "dead." Sometime during the night, Eurisko would decide that the best
: thing to do was to commit suicide and shut itself off. More precisely,
: it modified its own judgmental rules in a way that valued "making no
: errors at all" as highly as "making productive new discoveries." As soon
: as Eurisko did this, it found it could successfully meet its new goal
: by doing nothing at all for the rest of the night. This reminds me of
: HAL's boast: "No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake." I eventually
: had to add a new heuristic to Eurisko-one it couldn't modify in any
: way-to explicitly forbid this sort of suicide.

It's too bad that Lenat's brilliance has been sucked into the abyss of
Cyc.  If he had continued to work on Eurisko, perhaps with the goal of
creating a system which could learn from experience the way babies do,
he might have built a system which could develop common sense for itself
rather than having to have it spoon-fed.

We should figure out why we apparently consistently underestimate the time
needed to develop techonologies. Is there a real systematic effect, or do
we just pay more attention to the underestimates than to the overestimates? 
If it is real, what is causing it and how can we avoid it? Are there any
studies on this subject? Maybe someone can do an analysis on a bigger (more
representative) set of IF data?

Yes, this is confusing and I think you are basing it on the wrong
analogies and some non-sequitors. There is (obviously) no such things
as a nonexistent space - the only space that matters is the one that
we inhabit. Information doesn't exist in nothing, it exists in an
universe. And in the big bang model, you get this expansion from a hot
and very dense state, but the basic big bang model doesn't say it has
to be a zero radius universe. Instead physics suggests that the
initial state was something quantum-gravity-weird, and the issue of
the amount of information and the existence of a time arrow there
becomes somewhat murky. My current favorite is that the "seed" is a
piece of spacetime with closed timelike curves spawning the universe -
it created itself.

I saw someone (it might have been Wheeler) show in a paper that the
Bekenstein bound of information forced the universe at the beginning
to have a very low information content; the author suggested that as
the universe expanded (and the amount of information could increase)
the natural laws bootstrapped themselves. A fun idea, even if I don't
believe much in it.

It seems to me that people tend to overestimate the short-term
(meaning 5-10 years) improvements in the currently-hot technologies,
while longer-term (20-30 years), improvements often sneak up on them in
other areas that they aren't thinking about.

Back in the 60s, what was hot?  Plastics?  Space exploration?  Big
mainframes?

In the early 80s, what was hot?  Biotech?  AI and expert systems?
Consumer Reports published a book in 1983 or so that described home
computers as a failed technology.

In 1990, what was hot?  Virtual reality?  Compuserve and Prodigy?

I expect that many things which look promising today will be complete
duds five years from now, and in 20 years the big news will be coming
from something we haven't even considered today.

Yes.  We're mortals.  We don't have the vaguest idea of what's really
going on.  We live our lives in fog.  Mortals do not engage in actual
"reasoning", but a process which may occasionally look like reasoning or
duplicate some outputs.  This is the defining aspect of being mortal. 
The whole thesis and hope of the Singularitarians is that with enough
intelligence you can stop being mortal and everything falls into place. 
If there are SSIs and SSSIs, we can hope that either the SIs know it
perfectly well, or that the transition is simple, easy, and obvious.

There's no a priori way of saying that either our theory or yours is
impossible, but we tend to assume that there's a qualitative difference
between limited thought and thought backed by a planetary supercomputer;
that the situation from an SI's perspective is *not* analogous to ours
unless proved to be so.

That, in turn, is what defines the "Singularity"; some people, like
Robin Hanson, assume - in accordance with the Law of Mediocrity and
Occam's Razor - that everything posthuman is analogous to the human
situation unless proved otherwise.  Some people, like Vernor Vinge,
assume - in accordance with non-anthropocentrism and Occam's Razor -
that everything posthuman bears no resemblance to the human situation
unless proved otherwise.

I go by the later theory because I think I understand the forces that
generate "the human situation", and these forces are not present in
posthumans.  Remove the elements and the holis (the holistic result of
element interactions) can't survive.

Up till this I had been in two minds about whether to go for head-only
or full-body suspension. It now seems that full-body is the better
option, warranting the extra cost. Thanks.

This is a great day for me for at least three reasons:
1. I got a sensible response from someone on the Extropians list.
2. The Alexa traffic ranking for our website <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>
is up to #13,783, meaning that there are only 12,782 websites that get more
traffic. [<http://www.free-market.net/> ranks #23,891;
<http://www.self-gov.org/>
(Advocates for Self-Government) ranks #30,360; <http://www.lp.org/>
(National Libertarian Party) ranks #30,859; <http://www.extropy.com/~exi/>
ranks #49,280.]

Celerons and other modern CPU chips have on-board temperature sensors,
and modern motherboards have ways to monitor them. My Celerons operate
at or below 34 degrees C, mostly because I paid careful attention to
cooling, with a big tower case, fans on each processor, and an extra
case exhaust fan. The cost of all the fans, etc., is very low, and I
would in fact dissipate the same power and thus generate the same heat
and need the same fans if I were running PIIs. Celerons are rated for
operation (admittedly at 300Mhz) at as high as 60 degrees C.

The real heat generator is the Voodoo 3 3000. Mine runs cool enough
to touch with my finger, which is not true in a standard implementation 
for that board: I do this with a slot-mounted exhaust fan in the
adjacent slot.

I'm not a real overclocker: those folks do crazy things like immersing
the entire motherboard in mineral oil and using refrigeration
equipment to cool the oil. I merely took advantage of Intel's mistake
with the
Celeron 300A, certain of which are really capable of 466Mhz
operation. Check out some of the weird overclocking stuff on slashdot.

CPUs are not the only chunk of hardware caught in the inexorable
march of Moore's Law. Disk drives are still keeping up, which
never ceases to amaze me. Disk drive have motors! What does that
have to do with Moore's Law?!! Nothing, but lithographic and related
technologies have driven up the magnetic recording density at roughly
the
same rate as the DRAM bit density. Here's an interesting result:
the retail cost of hard disk storage has fallen below $10.00 (US) per
gigabyte. This means that the cost of storing an MP3-compressed CD
(50 megabytes for the typical 50-minute audio CD) is now $.50 US. To
calibrate this, The database at www.cddb.com knows about more than
325,000 unique audio CDs. This must be a high percentage of all the
CDs aver released. An MP3 copy of the entire collection (about 16
Terabytes)
would require $160,000 worth of disk this year, and will require
$16,000 of disk in three years. It would currently fit in about
8 boxes the size of a desktop PC enclosure, and will fit in one
such box in three years. As a point of reference, Microsoft claims
their 1-terabyte geological image database is the biggest commercial
database in the world.

I don't want to defend Rand as a person -- I've heard enough horror stories
about her atrocious behavior -- but one should be aware when reading Branden
that he does have an axe to grind AND he also seems to have a tendency to
white wash his own actions.  At least, this is my impression.  (I wasn't
there, so maybe he's 100% correct, but I doubt it.)

As for Objectivism and Extropianism, well, my goals is more to know what is
true, though looking for relationships between things -- including belief
systems -- is one way of getting closer to that.  And I'm definitely
influence by both Objectivism and Extropianism.

Due to prolonged process of dying prior to suspension in essentially
every patient the periphery (due to body's built-in protection mechanisms) 
gets very limited blood flow for days -- it thus 1) suffers extensive 
damage 2) thus gets very very patchy cryoprotectant perfusion. While the 
most recent best-case(!) ischaemic (rabbit) models seem to imply even 
neuros are getting a very rough ride, this need not to remain so in
the future (if cryonics is part of euthanasia in ICU setting). 
Single-organ vs. multi-organ cryoprotection is intrinsically much 
simpler to achieve. (Though I am not sure of this) neuros achieve
faster and better perfusion by clamping off the rest of the body.
Additional (admittedly minor) point with whole-body: cracking. 
Financial reason: neuros are cheaper, since whole-bodys don't 
utilize dewar volume well.

Since the technology necessary for suspension can essentially generate 
a body or a model thereof which is essentially undistinguishable
from the real thing, whole-body basically doesn't make sense. Ymmv.

Hey, so they really call OS.send.message() every few 100 machine
instructions, or so, and context-switch every 1 us? Really? Mouse 
handler an object, keyboard handler an object, peripheral storage 
each an object, each widget an object, each Excel cell an object, 
almost always sitting in a different node so they have to send 
messages? We're really talking about Microsoft, Redmond, local 
universe here, are we? 

They can't do it simply because performance on current architectures 
would suck monumentally. You would have to emulate things, and context 
switches on current hardware/software architectures are just a tad too 
expensive for that.

Multithreading!=asynchronous message passing on many tiny objects. 
We're talking about several thousands primitive (few kBytes) objects 
which send message packets which are routed by hardware directly -- 
while the originator code may or may not wait for the ack/result 
to arrive. If this exists at all, it is academic curiousity at best 
(Thinking Machines might qualify, though I really doubt they exploited 
their options fully every time). You certainly can't program these 
things in standard languages as C/C++ with any efficiency. And I would 
just love to see a programmer who can handle concurrent nonlinear 
control flow in a distributed kObject application. This can get
arbitrarily hairy.

There's a dearth of apps even for Beowulfs, and god knows how
coarse-grain these are. No sir, don't think so.

Sure you can. Put x86 opcode sofware emulation into every node, 
equipartition the old-generation binary over the nodes and send 
a message to the appropriate node whenever PC leaves your node's 
address space slice. Redundant as hell (OS nanokernel+ x86 
emulator in every node) and efficient as treacle since purely 
sequential, especially considering that you can't do 4 kCPUs 
PIII/550 way, and interpreting/compiling existing code into 
SWAR *would* require true AI.

		       Better yet, the
                       system builds on the existing Windows operating system,
                       so today's software won't become obsolete and
                       programmers can write new software the same way they
                       do now, for one machine or many. 
 
Right. And pilots will worry about pig collision avoidance issues.

Looks nice as a concept, but even if it works it is no panacea. Will
alleviate migration psychologically since suggesting you can run your
apps on the new platform even if in reality you can't.

Of what possible relevance is existing PC hardware/programming

And even worse: vice versa.

Not enough money?

Spare time to burn?

Want to earn TOP DOLLAR without the trouble of actual WORK?

Read on below to discover the new way that YOU can EARN, without even
trying. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHONKY COMMISSION JOBS, which promise the
earth, but deliver very little. 

THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS!!!

Just read on below, then go to www.thinknetwork.com for a brighter future!

-----
THE THINK NETWORK
WE WILL RENT YOUR UNUSED BRAIN SPACE FOR CA$$$$$H!!!!!

I'm getting sick of the limit of 24 hour days. I just can't get everything
done. Sound strange? Well, there are others with the same affliction. This
is good news for you!

I can't help but notice that many other people don't suffer such an
affliction - they have to watch TV or perform some other such mundane
activity to fill in the otherwise empty gaps. These can include such time
wasters as consumption of large amounts of alcohol, reading tabloid
newspapers, or getting desk jobs.

Sound familiar? It should. We have combed our database of consumer patterns
and profiles, and your consumption patterns have marked you as someone whose
mind could be used more productively. Sounds bad? It's actually a FANTASTIC
OPPORTUNITY, because it makes you a likely candidate for the role of Think
Network Agent. 

Stop throwing away a valuable, money making resource! Why burn when you
could earn? I'm offering a mutually beneficial arrangment.

We will PAY YOU TOP DOLLAR to rent your mind for short periods. Any spare
time, say while you're watching soapies, or as an alternative to slow
evening oblivion down the neck of a bottle. You wont get a better deal!

Not only is this financially rewarding, and harm free*, but studies** have
shown that this can actually be beneficial to the agent (you). In some
cases, you can even retain memories from episodes if desired.

Our people will be using your brain for offline, creative kinds of work,
like system design, music composition, website design, or graphic artwork.
Some unconscious processing can even be done this way - the guys in the
creative department can be outsourced! We will pay for REM sleep time*.

Don't think about it - we both know that it only ever causes you trouble.
ACT NOW, start reaping in that CA$$$H, and leave the thinking to the
experts.

* Government Warning: Leasing out conscious or REM sleep time can be
damaging to your health (Think Network would like to assure our agents that
this is NOT a proven fact)

** Studies of rodents have shown that leasing out intellectual resources can
promote growth of hair and teeth.

Rob I followed your argument in this and later posts that perhaps things

know or assume annnnnything about other intelligences.  OK I will entertain
those notions for the sake of argument, however, when I really ponder
the idea, I still reject it.  What really seems the most likely to me is
that if other planets ever give rise to life, it is most likely carbon based,
and recognizable as a lifeform to humans.  Granted it would look really
strange, like the precambrian lifeforms perhaps.  If any of these lifeforms
inhabited an ecological niche that encourages intelligence as we know it,
then that species would need to count, and would discover primes, as
we know them on this particular rock.

That other intelligences could arise that are *not* based on anything we
recognize as intelligence, I will grant.  Certainly your point is well taken,
that we haven't (what was the term you used?) "jack" to base our
assumptions upon.  We dont know!  But at least *some* of the others

ours.  The unknowns here alone seem to justify the SETI experiment.  spike

B5 = Babylon 5

JMS = J Michael Straczynski, the show's creator/author
(it took me far too long to get the correct spelling of this name off the
net)

B5 - I think this show will be stronger when it is replayed in decades to
come. A true artwork (slightly hampered by production difficulties, ie money
trouble), I've never seen a show with a stronger consistent vision. And it's
sci fi! If you haven't seen it, get the videos and start (first the pilot
movie, then start with season 1).

I think many people were put off by seeing episodes here and there - it's
not Star Trek, the episodes are not individual storylines to be seen in any
old order. Its a strongly ordered 4 season show (plus the less useful season
5), which was conceived in its entirety prior to beginning the project. I
watched most of it at saturation level (about 10 episodes a week, sometimes
4 a night - now there's a recipe for pain), and I would recommend it as
being the best way to catch the multitude of interwoven storyline threads
and be able to follow them through.

Damn it, this show is a must see! Call yourselves extropians? Extend
yourself, watch B5!

It probably wouldn't hurt the argument to use ~500 or ~1000 instead, which I
would expect is massively pessimistic by the standards of most Extropian
list members.

Which is why spanking and a good swift kick in the arse works so well as
a means of behavior modification: it stuns the butt-brain long enough
for the more logical neural networks to gain the upper hand and reassert
intelligent behavior.

I wonder why nobody uses flurocarbons -- mineral oil is so messy. It's 
not very cheap, ok.

I wouldn't use overclocking for business-critical/scientific
applications, because timing bugs are unpredictable, and thus hard to
debug. For gaming and office uses they are certainly great, though.

Thanks for providing hard data on overclocked dual-Celerons. It is
really strange that few people know that the low-end prices and unit
performances are a politicon. Only high-end is profitable, the low end 
is sold essentially at raw silicon prices (ocassionally even
below). It will be crucial for AMD to establish Athlon in the high end 
price segment, because the number of sold units alone won't save
them.

We're nearing the end of the usability of the spinning bit, whether
trick (SNOM et al) assisted, or not. Solid-state bits will win
eventually because the substrate preparation costs will soar as 
bits will shrink further -- while concurrently error rates will 
rise. It should be possible to utilize almost the entire 
200/300 mm wafer (95%..99%) surface for nonvolatile storage with 
next-generation nonvolatile RAM cells which can be smaller than 
200 nm. Even not considering access time, this is very hard to 
beat that with rotating bits on a platter.

Beowulf-type you can easily put 100 GByte worth of EIDE drives 
into 1U 19" rackmount enclosure, including the PC motherboard 
with FastEthernet onboard. Even with full redundancy, a massively 
parallel 1 TByte disk server from such commodity components can 
very comfortably fit into a half-height 19" rack. At least twice that
much with good thermal engineering and (more expensive) higher-density 
drives.

On the contrary, we've been able to map a number of chaotic systems to
simple equations. Fractals are just one minor, early example.

You don't know enough about math for your opinion to count. No insult
intended. Math is math, and is the same math everywhere in the universe.
We have even created maths that describe sytesm that have no possible
hope of existing in this universe (see elliptical equations(no, not
ellipses, thats something else)). Additionally, humans have used a
number of different number bases, including base 2 (binary), base 5
(Roman/Latin), 10 (decimal), 12 (celtic/aryan, as I recall), 16
(hexadecimal), 24 (Mayan, as I recall), and 60 (ancient Sumerian). We
can use a base of e (the natural log), or we can use pi as a base
(making all other numbers irrational). For geometry, we have not only
the Platonic Euclidian geometry based on a commonly accepted set of
axioms, but at least two types of non-euclidian geometries which deal
with variations of the parallel theorem. The only possible math areas we
may not know are those used in other space-time continua which use
dimensional systems which have not been deeply explored by current day
graduate students, but every day there is new progress. 

Any species more advanced than us is going to KNOW any math that we
know. They will know other maths, but if they are interested in
communicating with primitve species, they will use maths that are common
among primitive societies. 

If the ancient maya or egyptians had had radio telescopes, they could be
communicated with quite easily by an advanced intelligence via math.
Communicating via math does not require that we learn their maths, but
that they will communicate via simply understandable maths, much like EO
Wilson playing with pheromones to talk to ants.

Intelligences that are not based on anything that we recognize as
intelligent would probably be missed by us anyway. We could indeed be living
amongst such entities - who is to say that granite is not a life form beyond
our ken, whose intelligence is so fundamentally different from ours that we
mistake it for inanimate rock?

Probably there is a good pragmatic reason for concentrating on lifeforms
like us (if they exist), which is that we have some hope of detection and
useful communication with such forms. The Search for Extra Terrestrial
Granite is a dead end.

For a novel that's even more like Sagan's novel than the previously mentioned 
"Songs from the Stars" (Norman Spinrad), try James Gunn's "The Listeners," 
which is a fairly rigorous treatment of the "science vs. religion" that Sagan 
attempts.  I wouldn't call either novel especially good, but they're very 
similar (only Gunn's novel depicts the aliens as virtual clones of humans; 
their interstellar broadcast is a near dead-ringer for the one we sent from 
Arecibo).

Radio transmission has never been popular in science fiction, for good 
reason: it's boring.  Now that the Internet is the rage, the "interstellar 
Net" concept is gaining popularity.  Spinrad's book was prescient.

Did anyone see the movie "Virus" a few months ago?  It was stupid and cheesy, 
but the rough premise was straight out of "Mind Children."

But they are not wildly different from the truth, which is what would be

if the solar system were saturated with 'slorgopo energy' it would be
reproducable in any particle accelerator on any planet in the universe,
and its effects would be observable via astronomy. Photons are among the
most abundant, and are the easiest to detect by any means using matter.
Stars that are stable over the long term, such that they will likely be
stable enough to allow intelligent life to evolve, will occupy the exact
same range of the curve of stellar evolution as our own sun: it will be
a yellow dwarf. It will use a carbon base chemistry (supposed silicon
based chemistries give nowhere near the number of valent bonds necessary
to allow information storage molecules like DNA to develop, and carbon
pervades the universe). Given this, and the emission ranges of yellow
dwarf stars, all aliens that see will see in a range between the near
infrared to the near ultraviolet, unless their primary sensory input is
from sound or smell or touch. The may have eyes like a fly, or like a
reptile, or like a mammal, or something else, but chances are some
animal on earth has evolved a similar mechanism, which means its likely
to be in our own DNA.

All aliens will have been primitive at some point. This is a given. Thus
all aliens will have developed technologies which are useful on iron
core, tectonically drive oxygen atmosphere planets circling yellow dwarf
suns. Since the aliens will also know that other aliens will have gone
through similar stages, they will be broacasting if they want to be
heard on many different bands using many different protocols and
algorithms, at the very least enough to say,"Hey buddy, change over to
my main channel XXXX using YYYY tech, and heres how YYYY tech is built
and works."

Actually, the latest Drake Equation calculations, based on data from the
Mars meteorite, our knowledge of the volution of Venus and Mars, and the
possible presence of life on Europa, has resulted in a current estimate
of somewhere around a 40 light year average distance between worlds,
last I heard. BTW: We've been at it longer than that. The first big
transmissions were early tv broadcasts in the early 1930's (which
included the '36 berlin Olympics). That means we've been at it for at
least 65 years, even if you ignore early radio broadcasts prior to tv.
That means that if the current Drake equation calculations are accurate,
and if anyone is listening, someone knows we are here.

As are ad hominem attacks, it seems. The only obscene assumption is your
assumption that an alien civlization would not have any idea of what
kinds of technologies primitive societies will develop to communicate
with. Inane. Banal.

Actually since its already been discussed a 1% growth rate maxes out in
3000 years, your factor is off. Stop fudging the numbers.

Absolute crap. They already spend tens of billions on AIDS research, and

Some civlizations may be much slower, some may have 'religious' reasons
not to go further, esp. if they are long lived and have greater ability
to naturally constrain reproduction. You are sounding like a Democrat
baking the budget surplus higher to justify more social spending.

This was a marketing ploy and was so heavily qualified as to be a worthless
claim.  In the commercial space, very large databases handle tens of
terabytes of online data (possibly more these days) and the very largest
data warehouses can run around a petabyte or larger.  The fact that
multi-petabyte storage arrays exist indicates that somebody is probably
using them.  Microsoft claimed their database was the largest on the web,
but as I recall, this was refuted by IBM who has multi-terabyte databases
(such as their patent database which at the time was supposed to be around
3-Tb) connected to the web.

Microsoft was trying to appeal to the PHB types who are easily impressed by
the word "terabyte".  Only a fool would try to run a large online database
on a Microsoft OS, but I've seen numerous people try at places I've worked.
 The results have always been less than impressive.

My apologies for traversing what is most likely old ground.

Built in laws exist in humans - the survival instinct, and all instincts of
self preservation (these are different and sometimes in conflict) seem like
built in laws. If anyone thinks they are not under sway of such, wander into
the tool shed and remove a leg with a power tool (no mind altering
substances allowed), then come back and tell us about it (get some medical
help first).

Intuitively then, they can exist without breaking the system (although they
cause trouble). But they can also be circumvented. For instance, although
you can't remove your own leg at whim (and a good thing too), you could
maybe do it in an altered mental state (severe depression, drugs) or get
someone else to do it while you were unconscious.

Any law imposed on an intelligent system can be evaded in similar ways. "Be
nice to the squashy people" sounds good, but if an AI wanted to get you, it
would get you anyway. It would just have to do things in a far more indirect
manner which would probably be harder to detect. Big brain plus forced
deviousness equals big trouble!

----

On a (loosely) related point, who has thought about the problem of surgical
self alteration, and whether they would actually have the bottle to do it?
Could you have your eyes replaced? Other senses? The cliched robot arm
requires removal of your current arm. Some RPGs cover this ground, but
seriously, imagine doing it yourself - removing perfectly healthy,
functional bits of yourself and replacing them with maybe non-functional
super replacements, which could have permanent bad side effects?

I was wondering if I'd have the guts to have an operation to extend my vocal
range (should such an op exist). I would be very dodgy about it - don't want
to risk losing what I already have. I'd like to think I'd be able to go
through with it, but I'm not sure. Just have to get replacement guts I
guess.

I personally know of cases where a creature hurt a young human which
later developed dislike for the whole creature species.  When such a
human encounter a related species with larger units, the human would
naturally feel a larger dislike for these units as they could damage
the human more than a smaller specimen could.

Whoa, Mike, hold your horses. Math per se does not exist but in the

All apparently plausible assumptions -- alas, extrapolated on the

We know Mayans and Egyptians, or, at least, we know our images of
them. They are all people, temporally not terribly distant from us. 
Comparing them to postsingularitarian supercivilisations (because 
that's the only kind of civilisations with high enough temporal 
depth for us-current to bump into them with any probability) is 
terribly oversimplistic.

So far, nobody seems to have seen us/want to communicate. Our 
problem is to find the aliens by their metabolism signatures they 
cannot avoid, by grand-scale artefacts they cannot possibly conceal. 
Whether they are there or not -- both possibilities are very
intriguing. Either the visible universe is ours to claim -- which 
will require much better tech than we currently have, or, we will 
soon face the task of communicating with extremely advanced 
extraterrestrials -- which will very probably require us to be 
postsingularitarian/one of them. No sense people talking to
nematodes.

What would be interesting is to move the (thoroughly debugged;
RAID-capable; journalling) file system into the periperal storage 
unit itself. It can be based on some simple embedded OS, even no need
to go multitasking -- to maximize simplicity. Perhaps even move most
of it into hardware?

I think the chiefest reason against just putting objects into
nonvolatile virtual memory vs. using file systems currently 
is instability. Horrible to lose a large database to a simple
system crash. Of course with checkpointing (periodic total 
system state snapshots) and extremely stable software this 
might become less an issue.

It would be interesting to speculate if a simplified Linux could ever
grow stable enough for this.

This is the old "Great Chain of Being" idea, originally from Christian
theology. But it is not obvious that one can use the mediocrity
principle to deduce that we are in the middle in the spectrum of
intelligences; we are obviously at the top here on Earth and have no
information about the distribution in the rest of the universe.

Just because we currently are limited and stupid doesn't mean we
always have to be - what if you extend your reasoning in the temporal
domain?

Paul Di Filippo actually mentioned something like this in "Distributed

We might not be considering it, but it's there already, at least as 
laboratory curiousity. Also, despite acceleration, technologies 
still take time to permeate the market, and be it only due to human/market 
attenuation. We can make a long list of candidates: space, biotech, 
nanotech, computation, etc.

Some of them might be duds. But not all of them. Also, we're not
asking Joe Sixpack for comments here, but early adopters. We _are_ 
early adopters, right?

In fact we should indeed make such a list, publish it along with 
predictions and freeze on several websites to reduce its chances 
of going away. No need to aim for 20 years: let's try 5, 10, 15.

Are quadruplegics the same people, even if their body-image 
is going to the dogs? Are people with anaesthesized spinal 
cord still people or not? That's an experiment which is easy enough to 
try. 

A hard validation would be a whole-head graft, which has been
successfully done with animals. They attempted to vocalize/bite the
experimenter (which is not very surprising -- I think in their place 
I'd try that, too). For some strange reason (duh), this has not been 
tried with people yet.

There are certainly individually distinct low-level motorics 
present in the spinal cord -- however, these can be learned 
or even convincing surrogates be installed in their place -- 
after all, ressurection does require nontrivial level of technology.

     The quotes came from an interview that Frederick posted. I do not know 
if the information is "true". My question is that if it is true, how can I 
metaprogram this heart-brain? My childhood and adolescence was a time of 
constant and intense fear and paranoia. Then I grew up and got involved with 
women, which has not helped. }:)

     Arab mystics speak of the "himma" which is a mind centered in the 
heart; and earlier, the Egyptians spoke of the "ab" (heart) as one of the 
"souls" of a human. I am curious to know if they were on to something, so I 
would also like to see the research.

But is that question even relevant if the basic assumption behind it
is likely wrong? After all, there might be helpful nano-gnomes living
in my computer (but it is very unlikely), but trying to get help from
them is likely a waste of time - I better first take a look to see if
they are there, and if they are try to befriend them. If we
transhumanists spend all our time pondering how to exploit unlikely
effects, then we will accomplish practically nothing - we better first
see what is real, then see what it can be used for.

Why be so literal? Why completely disregard all the knowledge about
the brain, emotions and psychology we have gathered in favor for
something that is most likely wrong? After all, metaprogramming
emotions is something that is very real and people have been working
on (with various success) for ages. Check out the literature on
psychology, physiology and neuroscience for yourself. I would suggest
reading Antonio Damasio's _Descartes' Error_ for some ideas on just
why people speak about feelings residing in the heart.

Why on Earth would you want to do that?  Even for masively parallel
architectures you are better off either using large CPU/memory blocks, or
running conventional apps in a virtual machine.  At any rate, Redmond
designs for the hardware that is actually in use (big surprise), so they
only context switch every millisecond or two.

They haven't gotten around to re-writing the entire OS this way yet, but
everything new *is* done that way.  In Office 2000, for instance, every
spreadsheet cell is indeed an object (and so is every other recognizeable
program element).  The same goes for ADO, MTS, and recent versions of most
of their server apps.  Occasionally they will encapsulate a big block of
performance-intensive code in a single object instead of breaking it out
into seperate objects, but their general principle is to make everything as
object-oriented as is possible on current hardware.

On a modern CPU a context switch isn't any big deal.  You don't want to do
it every other instruction, but there isn't any good reason to do that in
the first place.  You can certainly do it anywhere there is a reason to
without having to worry about it affecting your performance.

It doesn't exist because there is no reason to do it.  The current model
does exactly the same thing, but the objects are 10-100 times as big and
which communicate about 10% as often.  Asynchronous calls are used whenever
they actualy do something for you (in most cases they don't work, because
you can't proceed witht he current operation until you get your results
back).

Or, to put it another way, the reason current apps wouldn't benifit from
your fast chip/small memory parallel processing architecture is because most
of the tasks they do are inherently linear, not because they are poorly
written.  The only way to speed up a linear process is to give it a single
very fast thread of execution.  That's why massively parallel machines are
generally reserved for inherently parallel sorts of computation.

Now, if you take a close look at modern PC architectures you'll see that
there is an emerging trend towards increasing parallelism in the areas where
it is usefull.  Servers often have multiple CPUs, since they have to handle
many different requests simultaneously.  Video subsystems often incorporate
several DSPs, and the trend seems to be towards using more and more of them.
With modems, sound cards and other specialized functions turning into
software for DSP chips, it would not be at all surprising if the PC of the
future had a large array of DSPs for parallel-processing tasks.  However, it
will still need that fast Pentium-whatever chip for handling more linear
jobs in a timely fashion.

If greater intelligence means more-of and longer-lasting (which it has done
so far) then we would be more likely to find ourselves on the high-end of
the scale.  In all probability we would be closer to the upper limit than
the lower.  And if intelligence has no upper limit then what are we doing
all the way down here?

Educated people's brains shrink more, but they forget less, study shows

DETROIT (July 12, 1999 5:11 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Older
people with lots of education show more brain shrinkage than those who spent
less time hitting the books, according to a medical study released Monday.
But higher education levels also give the elderly more protection from
dementia and memory loss.
"Our brain cells are dying, but if we have educated ourselves, that provides
a buffering effect such that our functioning remains intact," said Edward
Coffey, chair of the Henry Ford Health System Department of Psychiatry and
principal investigator for the study.
The research, published in the July issue of the journal Neurology, examined
320 healthy men and women from 66 to 90 years old. Using magnetic resonance
imaging, researchers measured brain size by tracking cerebrospinal fluid
surrounding the outside of the brain.
The study found that elderly people with 16 years of education had 8 to 10
percent more fluid around their brains than did those who had only gone to
school for four years.
Coffey was quick to point out the study did not conclude that lots of
education causes smaller brains. In fact, he said everyone's brain starts
shrinking beginning at young adulthood. On average, a person's brain will
shrink 2.5 percent every 10 years.
Coffey likened the effect of a high amount of schooling on the brain to
exercising a muscle to keep it in shape.
"Everybody has some shrinkage," Coffey said. "We're able to tolerate it to
different extents. If you have more education, the shrinkage causes less
problems for you than those with less education."
Coffey is the same researcher who published a study in February 1998 that
found men's brains shrink faster with age than women's.

My take on this subject is the same as I have towards, the existence of God,
life after death, heaven and hell and re-encarnation. I cannot dismiss
people's experiences, they may go to church and express  having a spiritual
moment (believe in a supernatural power), they may state they have memories
of a past life, or even gone up in a UFO. First of all, I myself have never
experienced any of these, but then again have no evidence that these claims
are false. I am humble enough to confess that I have not died, therefore
cannot say for myself if there is a heaven or a hell, if I have lived a past
life, I do not remember it, and I most surely have not traveled to every
planet in our solar system to know if there is life or death out there. I
leave myself open, I decide not to decide. I will await the facts. Because I
have seen nothing, does not mean there is nothing. It may very well be that
one day I will awake to some grey creature probing my body or that I will
die and God will damn me to hell, (oops) so although I do not pursue any of
these ventures, I also do not disclaim them. (just in case theres a limbo)

I would suggest using NFS to access a Network Appliance "filer".
It has the things you describe. www.netapp.com

Of course Linux will have a good chunk of the SGI XFS fs soon.

Quite the opposite! If you know your partner's going to heal in a few
minutes ... you fill in the rest.
'course, if we had nervous-system controls to modulate pain response,
that might be problematic.

That's what I meant, if the point of S&M is to deliver and/or recieve pain
and we've established internal mechanisms to prevent pain, won't they be
ripped off. Of course, it maybe it could be reinstalled for these type of
purposes.

Well, there *is* something like that available, though not in realtime
(yet?). On the new GerOL page (yes, I know, I keep going on and on about
it), the reviews of journal articles are a) written in a language as close
to standard English as I could make them without being unwieldy and b) are
full of links to a dictionary site that pops up in a separate window. My
theory is that barrier #1 to understanding what the scientists are talking
about is jargon. When you read a review on GerOL, you not only get the
point that the article was trying to make, but you also come away with an
expanded technical vocabulary that will make it easier for your to get
through future articles.

By the way, the site has been upgraded to a newer version of Slash. This
means you can now create a user account there, change how the site looks
to you from your browser, and post comments either as yourself or
anonymously.

Speaking of comments, I'm hoping to see more people posting comments on
that site. Of all things, Slashdot certainly has the qualities of a
self-organizing project. However, the initial conditions need to be right,
and I want the readers to get into the habit of participating from the
start. So in the early days, moderator points will be very easy to obtain.

That's not an opinion, that's a cop out.  It may have less
chance of pissing people off, but it has no chance of
accomplishing anything useful or helping the search for
truth.  Wouldn't it be 1000 times better to research and
discover what it is about the human mind that fabricates
these experiences, and why?

The "keep an open mind" mantra is usually spouted by the
most closed-minded mystics who refuse to even entertain
the idea that the mind can do these things.  Frankly, I
find that insulting.  Of course the mind can do it--every
experience you have is processed by that wonderfully
complex machine of your brain; why should it be any more
immune to an occasional malfunction than any other machine?
Isn't that a far simpler explanation of these experiences
than accepting them at face value?  Isn't that a more
profitable line of research than any effort based on
taking these claims at face value?

I want to know how the mind works; examining those that
fail is a great way to do that.  Pretending that they are
working well when they fail is a waste of opportunity.

(S&M isn't just about pain, but that is a thread for another forum :-)

In a similar vein to the fear thread, I think we'd want control of how much 
pain-damping our systems did, anyway, for survival reasons. You'd usually 
want SOME kind of signal on an injury ("*beeeep* left hand destroyed! 
estimated regrowth time one minute seven seconds. Consider avoiding further 
injury during this time").

So, a nice custom mod would be dual controls (as in pilot/copilot) -- on both 
pleasure and pain circuits. What the heck, selected motor circuits, too, for 
the ultimate in "soft bondage." The old-fashioned top might just want control 
of the overall intensity, delivering the stimuli the quaint old way; but 
there's a whole new world possible, of playing the nervous system like a 
synthesizer. The whips and featherdusters would become nostalgic props, and 
the real action would happen on the keyboard, or whatever interface we end up 
using (most likely a virtual body with virtual tools). Favorite "pieces" 
would of course be recorded, and one could "compose" for oneself as well. All 
of the above applies equally well to any sort of erotica.

Pure uploads would probably enjoy this even more than the embodied.

Or in other words, given the known fact that at least one set of saucer
experiences is the result of hallucinations, it's easier to hypothesize
that your own personal experiences - never mind other people's - are
false, than to hypothesize that aliens would behave in such weird,
pseudo-anthropomorphic ways...

But the really weird, and really frightening part, is that when the
brain malfunctions in that way, it usually becomes impossible for the
person to accept that vis experiences are hallucinations.  No matter how
ridiculous, no matter how perfectly conforming to the standard report of
schizophrenia, the victim simply becomes unable to wield Occam's Razor.

Someday, when drugs are developed that can temporarily induce
schizophrenia or similar disorders, with an absolute guarantee of no
long-term side effects, I'd like to try it out - very briefly -
myself(*).  I'd like to see if my mind is sufficiently
software-reengineered to remain sane despite massive perturbations;
failing that, it could be useful to know the first symptoms of
malfunction, in case something ever goes Really Wrong.

But what it truly is, I suppose, is sheer curiosity; the desire to face
a challenge; the need to know one's own mind; the same reason people are
so intrigued by split-brain experiments.  Who's the actual master of my
mind?  Is it really me, or am I just a surface veneer of rationality
laid over deeper forces that just happen to be cooperating?  Do all my
hard-held mental disciplines work just because nothing else is opposing
them at the time?  Organic insanity is the ultimate opponent, and
without facing it, there's no way I can ever really know.

Could be that I dont get it, the s+m thing.  Or perhaps I only know of the

Isnt it a ritualistic thing, more than an actual whipping/chaining?  Perhaps

Don't worry about hedging your bets - apparently you can just take it all
back at the last moment (repent), no matter what naughty things you have
been thinking (even, I presume, thinking about taking it all back).

The only obstacle to this approach is sudden death - the human equivalent of
the blue screen. What you need to plan for if you are worried about
damnation is a graceful shutdown (deathbed), so that you've got time to kick
off the Salvation OS bootstrap (ie: repent).

I wonder if cryo is good enough - do the believers (in God, not cryo) think
that the soul hangs around a cryo suspended person, or does it wander off to
limbo or some such thing? Or does it go somewhere excellent, so that we'll
find the first reanimated cryo subjects wake up and say "Where's the off
switch?"

Such as when one thinks in terms of time constants.  In an RC circuit
for instance, one time constant is the time when 1/e of the voltage remains
accross the resistor.  Rocket guys often think in terms of e as well, since
there is "one e-th" as much mass as you started with when your rocket
achieves the velocity of its exhaust.

...Which we do when we work in radians.  Make a right turn, thats
half pi radians.  You think in pi when you do angles.

Great post Mike.  I am more convinced than ever that we humans
have *discovered* math, not *invented* it.  Lifeforms everywhere will
have the same ~90 some elements to discover, even if theirs are
in different proportions than ours, and that the great mathematical
truths will be discovered by all exocivilizations, should they exist.  spike

Not that I'm into that kind of thing you understand

Somehow internal/external pain control mechanisms reminds me of the

What will be the exit strategies of a holographic first-person 
recording system with fidelity enough to include conscious 
experience?

Strange Days-Brainstorm-Virtuosity: Drink the water now you're wired

Title
  Growth hormone (GH) treatment reverses
  early atherosclerotic changes in GH-deficient adults.

  Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.  84(2):453-7, 1999 Feb.
Abstract
  Hypopituitary patients have increased mortality from vascular disease, and in
  these patients, early markers of atherosclerosis [increased
  carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and reduced distensibility] are
  more prevalent. As GH replacement can reverse some risk factors of
  atherosclerosis, the present study examined the effect of GH
  treatment on morphological and functional changes in the carotid and brachial
  arteries of GH-deficient (GHD) adults. Eleven GHD hypopituitary men (24-49 yr
  old) were treated with recombinant human GH (0.018 U/kg BW x day) for 18
  months. IMT of the common carotid artery (CCA) and the carotid bifurcation
  (CB), and flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) of the brachial
  artery were measured by B mode ultrasound before and at 3, 6, 12, and 18
  months of treatment, and values were compared with those in 12 age-matched
  control men. Serum concentrations of lipids, lipoprotein(a), insulin-like
  growth factor I (IGF-I), and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3)
  were also measured. In GHD men before treatment the IMTs of the CCA
  [mean(SD), 0.67(0.05) mm] and CB [0.75(0.04) mm] were significantly greater
  (P < 0.001) than those in control men [0.52(0.07) and 0.65(0.07) mm,
  respectively]. GH treatment normalized the IMT of the CCA by 6 months
  [0.53(0.04) mm] and that of the CB by 3 months [0.68(0.05) mm]. The IMT of
  the carotid artery (CCA and CB) was negatively correlated with serum IGF-I (r
  = -0.53; P < 0.0001). There was a significant improvement in flow-mediated
  EDD of the brachial artery at 3 months, which was sustained at 6 and 18
  months of GH treatment (P < 0.05). GH treatment increased high density
  lipoprotein cholesterol at 3 and 6 months, but did not reduce total or low
  density lipoprotein cholesterol and was without effect on lipoprotein(a).
  There was no correlation between plasma lipids and changes in IMT or EDD of
  the arteries examined. In conclusion, GH treatment of hypopituitary GHD men
  reverses early morphological and functional atherosclerotic changes in major
  arteries and, if maintained, may reduce vascular morbidity and mortality. GH
  seems to act via IGF-I, which is known to have important effects on
  endothelial cell function.

  [Can normalization of vascular cytoadhesive activity be explained by the
  anti-atherosclerosis effect of growth
  hormone?]. [Czech]
Source
  Casopis Lekaru Ceskych.  137(22):690-3, 1998 Nov 16.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The increased mortality caused by premature
  atherosclerosis has been shown among patients with
  hypopituitarism receiving conventional hormone treatment but
  with unsubstituted growth hormone
  deficiency. This experience belongs among the most important arguments in
  favour of replacement with growth hormone.
  The mechanisms of the antiatherogenic effect of growth
  hormone are poorly understood. The protective effect of
  growth hormone on the vascular endothel and
  its intervention in the clotting process, which have not been yet elucidated,
  may be the causative factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: The endothelial damage as
  given by measuring of circulating soluble cytoadhesive molecules sE-selectin,
  sP-selectin and intercellular adhesive molecule 1 (ICAM 1) was measured in 15
  adult panhypopituitaric patients before and after 1 year treatment with
  recombinant human growth hormone. The blood
  levels of all of these cytoadhesive molecules decreased significantly (p <
  0.01) during the treatment. None of the concomitantly followed coagulation
  tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen,
  antithrombin III, von Willebrand's factor and D-dimer) was significantly
  changed during the treatment. The tendency to decrease (p = 0.054) was
  observed with antithrombin III. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of circulating
  cytoadhesive molecules in blood during the treatment of
  growth hormone gives evidence for its
  protective effect, either direct or mediated, on the vascular endothel. These
  findings could bring an explantation for the premature atherosclerotic
  changes in hypopituitarism and antiatherogenic effect of
  growth hormone.

Title
  Body composition, atherogenic risk factors and apolipoproteins following
  growth hormone treatment.
Source
  Acta Paediatrica.  85(8):899-901, 1996 Aug.
Abstract
  We studied the change in atherogenic risk factors in 27 children, 21 boys and
  6 girls, 6 to 14 years of age, with growth
  hormone deficiency during 12 months of
  growth hormone replacement therapy. Changes
  in body composition and lipid profile during growth
  hormone treatment were evaluated. The atherogenic index was
  calculated using the equation [(total cholesterol- high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol)(apolipoprotein B)]/[(apolipoprotein AI)(high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol)]. Body fat decreased (p < 0.01), associated with an increase in
  lean body mass (p < 0.01). Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol showed no significant changes. The atherogenic index
  significantly decreased from 1.44 +/- 0.60 to 1.09 +/- 0.52 (p < 0.01) after
  12 months. Apolipoproteins CII and CIII increased throughout the study period
  (p < 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) and apolipoproteins AI, B and B/AI ratio did not
  change significantly. In conclusion, growth
  hormone treatment improved body composition and reduced
  atherogenic risk factors in children with growth
  hormone deficiency.

You guys really got to check out this "firetalk" thing I've just discovered.
Its like a chat room but you use your microphone instead, so you can
actually talk to people with your voice. Like video conference, without the

I'm in agreement for the most part, but I'd argue that what you 
term "malfunctions" (and many of the experiences you're referring 
to are just that) are sometimes extremely functional--though not 
from my personal viewpoint.  It looks as if religion, for example, 
evolved as a social mechanism to enable large groups to retain 
solidarity.  There is a great Darwinian need for this.  We've even 
isolated the "religion complex" to a specific site in the brain.  So 
while a religious epiphany may well be a fortuitous interplay of 
neurochemicals and wishful thinking, I wouldn't call it a _malfunction_. 
Rather, a "vestigial reflex"...or at least I'd like to think of it as 
vestigial.  
Looking at culture in general, though, makes me think twice...

Jacques Vallee calls this the "ratchet effect."  Once "converted" to a 
specific way of viewing the world, a person will cling to this viewpoint even 
when faced with overwhelming evidence that he or she is wrong.  This is the 
glitch that allows conspiracy mongers to perpetuate wild tales--and, 
simalarly, allows their great appeal in our society.

I'm looking for the original german (if it is german) for "Your thoughts are

then I believe that I have already unveiled my basic ignorance on this list

Because that's the only way how you can do things on a fine-grain
maspar system. I believe we were talking about portability/migration

Uh, there _are_ no large contiguous memory blocks/monster CPUs 
in a maspar fine-grain system. For price (yield), reliability, 
footprint and thermal dissipation reasons you shouldn't imagine 
something like the ASCI Red but a midi tower stuffed few 100...1000 
VLIW CPUs with few-MBit on-die RAM, interconnected by multiple/
redundant fast (multi-GBps, <<10 ns latency) serial links 
running a primitive switchable protocol. But I seem to be repeating
myself...

As I said you *could* run conventional apps, but not at practical

Context switches are intrinsically expensive if done on anything else
than (bi)stack machines http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/ . 
These cannot be adequately programmed in C-type languages.

Yes, but are these asynchronous objects?

No, it is a very big deal because you have to save the context, and
there is a lot of it. Register sets, stack frames, you name it. You
might not notice the machinery for the overhead and the introduced
delays in a 50 MTransistor bloatware CPU, but we're not talking about 
anysuch. You certainly can't beat context switch times in a modern
MISC CPU.

Of course context switching is a bad idea, but we're using it only to
simulate something essentially parallel. After all, the same code
should run on a single-node and multi-node machine, right?

Of course there is a reason: we need to migrate to massively parallel
hardware yet to keep our apps for the time being, remember?

This is strange, for the world is an intrinsically parallel
place. Many things are happening simultaneously, and are only coupled
locally, if at all. This is most naturally expressed as a large number 
of asynchronous objects which are most naturally run on a large
parallel machine.
 
If you think that the most of the world is sequential, you must be a
programmer ;)

Sorry, but this is nonsense. That particular machine by my desk is
running ~100 processes, each of which even having some massively parallel
aspects. There shouldn't be more than one process/CPU in most cases,
and hence there is no need to for context switching, nor MMU for
address space protection (nor cache, because the stuff is on-die).

Searching is intrinsically parallel, so is rendering, so is neural
DSP, so is simulation of any kind. While I type this into emacs 
sequentially, don't tell me GC can't profit from a little 
parallelism, or the GUI, or the mp3 process in the background, 
the file system reindexing,  the web server, the molecular 
dynamics process, the FASTA search, the parallel make, etc. All this
off the top of my head, there is surely lots more to it.

There is no noticeable parallelism in the modern PC but in the
CPU. Also, I wouldn't say that little parallelism is in there 
because it is particularly useful. People wouldn't be building
Beowulfs if one could purchase them on the free market, right?

In absence of crossbars to memory, SMPs suck massively. Global shared
memory is a myth anyway, so we'd better get used to message-passing
anyway.

There are no parallel DSP arrays in any PC video subsystem I am aware
of. In fact I cannot readily think of any DSP array applications
anywhere in the mainstream.

Non sequitur. A pentium is a legacy processor if I ever saw one. There 
is absolutely no need for a dedicated head in a lattice of modern
DSPs.

That's apparently complicated. According to the Duden volume on
famous quotes it's the first line in a song in the collection _Des
Knaben Wanderhorn_ (1806-1808) by Achim von Arnim and Clemens
Brentano. Later it was referenced in Joseph von Eichendorff's poem
"Verschwiegene Liebe". I guess the latter source popularized it.

I think you can safely assume that it is quoted well out of context
nowadays, like many of these bon mots are.

Well, supposing the brain of a certain person would be able " to feel"
sufficient informations about the actual state of the world and also "to feel"
its tendencies, it is completely reasonable that a "sensitive" person would be
able to "preview" the future behaviour of the world... Something like
extrapolating a system's behaviour when it is known its dynamic equations and
have initial conditions at a time (simplifying...). Obviously the supposed
sentitives, if real, are subjected to lots of noises and errors...But... if the
above supposition is true, when we artificialize brain's functions, we'll be
able to reduce the error too... and preview (extrapolate...) the future...

Non-envy does not necessarily imply altruism.

If  X does not envy Y having Z, does not imply that X feel altruistic.
X could simply dislike having Z.
Example: Z = AIDS

I can think up a number of other, less drastic, examples.

There is no doubt that John Stossel is about the best journalist out
there. He is strong, witty, and informative. He has been around since I
was a little girl and as I have grown so has he. He is now the foremost
journalist for what I consider "rational ideas." He isn't afraid to go out
and stand against the proclaimed U.S. majority on just about every issue.
For those of you know of his work, I encourage you to encourage others to
get to know him. If you don't know about Stossel, it is time well spent
just to learn and do what you can to get your hands on his ABC special
"Junk Science & Are We Scaring Ourselves To Death" They are. excellent.

With all this said, Stossel is now taking his greatness to the class room.
He will be providing videos and other class room materials for discussions
of his now well known ABCnews specials. If you are interested in
supporting Stossel or just getting to know more about his
new project you can do so at:

http://www.stossel.org/

If you have specific questions about Stossel or his new ventures feel free
to contact me directly.

I don't think we were really getting anywhere with the previous line of
responses, so I decided to try it again from the beginning.  Here goes:


Regarding Current Software
Current PC software is written for hardware that is actually in use, not
hypothetical designs that might or might not ever be built.  This is
perfectly logical, and I don't think it makes sense to blame anyone for it.
If a better architecture becomes available, we can expect ordinary market
forces to lead them to support it in short order (look at Microsoft's
efforts with regard to the only-marginally-superior Alpha chip, for
example).

The more sophisticated vendors (and like it or not, that included Microsoft)
have been writing 100% object-oriented, multithreaded code for several years
now.  They use asynchronous communication anywhere there is a chance that it
might be useful, and they take full advantage of what little multiprocessor
hardware is actually available.  There is also a trend currently underway
towards designing applications to run distributed across multiple machines
on a network, and this seems likely to become the standard approach for
high-performance software in the near future.


Regarding Fine-Grained Parallelism
Parallel processing is not a new idea.  The supercomputer industry has been
doing it for some time now, and they've done plenty of experimenting with
different kinds of architectures.  They have apparently decided that it
makes more sense to link 1,000 big, fast CPUs with large memory caches than
100,000 small, cheap CPUs with tiny independant memory blocks.  That fits
perfectly with what I know about parallel computing - the more nodes you
have the higher your overhead tends to be, and tiny nodes can easily end up
spending 100% of their resources on system overhead.

Now, if someone has found a new technique that changes the picture, great.
But if this is something you've thought up yourself, I suggest you do some
more research (or at least propose a more complete design).  When one of the
most competitive (and technically proficient) industries on the planet has
already tried something and discarded it as unworkable, its going to take
more than arm-waving to convince me that they are wrong.


Regarding the Applicability of Parallelism
The processes on a normal computer span a vast continuum between the
completely serial and the massively parallel, but most of them cluster near
the serial end of the spectrum.  Yes, you have a few hundred process in
memory on your computer at any given time, but only a few of them are
actually doing anything.  Once you've allocated two or three fast CPUs (or a
dozen or so slow ones) to the OS and any running applications, there isn't
much left to do on a typical desktop machine.  Even things that in theory
should be parallel, like spell checking, don't actually get much benifit
from multiple processors (after all, the user only responds to one dialog
box at a time).

On servers there is more going on, and thus more opportunity for
parallelism.  However, the performance bottleneck is usuall in the network
or disk access, not CPU time.  You can solve these problems by introducing
more parallelism into the system, but ultimately it isn't cost-effective.
For 99% of the applications out there, it makes more sense to buy 5
standardized boxes for <$5,000 each than one $100,000 mega-server (and you
get better performance, too).

Of course, there are many processes that are highly amenable to being run in
a parallel manner (video rendering, simulation of any kind, and lots of
other things), but most of them are seldom actually done on PCs.  The one
example that has become commonplace (video rendering) is usually handled by
a specialized board with 1 - 8 fast DSP chips run by custom driver-level
software (once again, the vendors have decided that a few fast, expensive
chips are more economical than a lot of slow, cheap ones).


Side Issues
1) Most parallel tasks require that a large fraction of the data in the
system be shared among all of your CPUs.  Thus, your system needs to provide
for a lot of shared memory if it is going to be capable of tackling
molecular CAD, atmospheric simulations, neural networks, etc.  That brings
up all those issues of caching, inter-node communication and general
overhead you were trying to avoid.

2) You also can't get away from context switching.  Any reasonably complex
task is going to have to be broken down into procedures, and each processor
will have to call a whole series of them in order to get any usefull work
done.  This isn't just an artifact of the way we currently write software,
either.  It is an inevitable result of the fact that any interesting
computation requires a long series of distinct operations, each of which may
require very different code and/or data from the others.

"Die Gedanken sind frei" is the name of a well-known folksong.  Its

Ok, has anybody else on this list tried this stuff?

I really can't contain my enthusiasm anymore.  I purchased my first
bottle of SomatoPro about 5 weeks ago from IAS in the Channel Islands.
My initial motivation for buying it was as a longevity booster and
sleep-aid.  I first got a tip about it from a poster on this list a
few months back.

Needless to say, since buying it the qaulity of my sleep has improved
tremendously and I wake up recharged with great memories of lucid
dreams.  One night I did not fall asleep after taking 5 capsules.
Instead I experienced a fantastic state of well-being and calm.  This
well-being effect was so strong that it was hard to ignore the parts
of my life giving me a great deal of stress - namely work. Over the
course of an hour or so I was able to resolve and dissolve nearly all
of the anxiety surrounding my current work situation.  I felt relieved
and refreshed.  Frankly, I haven't felt this good since I was 18 or 19
years old.  This may be in part due to the fact the these GHB
precursors can increase human growth hormone levels up to 16 times
normal - emulating that of a growing teenager.

I became so excited by the effetcts this stuff weas having on me I
started to look everywhere for more information on it.  SomatoPro is a
GHB precursor.  There are plenty of sites on the net where you can get
info on GHB.  GHB was made illegal by the FDA in 1990.  So companies
developed these precurssors to get through the FDA guidelines.
Another popular GHB precurssor is Renewtrient.  The internet contains
a lot of good factual information but you have to be willing to sort
through the negative publicity from the FDA or the occasional hype of
certain re-sellers.

I read further that this stuff can act as a great boost to ones
exercise regime.  So I dragged myself back to the gym after months of
not going.  In only 4 short weeks, I'm quickly getting into the best
shape of my life.  I have lost 2 inches on my waste, yet gained 4
pounds of weight.  Somehow, GHB is allowing me to go past my normal limits.  I seem to go 50-100% futher than I normally do aerobically and about 20% more anerobically.

A friend of mine just called me this morning.  He recieved his first
bottle on Saturday.  Since taking it, he has not smoked a single
cigarette.  He tells me that when the nicotine craving comes on, he
pops a capsule of SomatoPro, and the craving goes away within 30
minutes.

I can go on and on about this stuff, so I'll just stop here for now.

I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about people with brain damage
whose left arms are paralyzed and who cannot admit it.  "Why didn't you
move your hand?"  "I didn't want to."  Anosognosia - look it up.

Not to mention the ability to change body geometry (although I wonder

Sounds like an interesting idea, i think I would do the same. Although
I don't think you can guarantee no side-effects, after all the
experience itself can make you change. But it would likely be a
beneficial (at least mind-expanding) experience. Afterwards, you
cpould always therapy yourself based on what you learned.

It may be cruel to make fun of the mentally handicapped, but I've
never been able to stop laughing any time I think about Anton's

A GHB precursor is one of several ways to IGF-1 levels.  One can no longer
purchase GHB, but there are websites with info on how to manufacture it
yourself. Below is a post I found from a newslist I subscribe to:

Hello Marty,

I copy and paste this, which I got on the internet at:

In the book, "GHB, the Natural Mood Enhancer" by Ward Dean, M.D.
and John Morgenthaler, and Steven Wm. Fowkes there is a whole
chapter with 4 different recipes to make your own GHB, with detailed
illustrations of each step.  The book is available through the

Well, we are all able to predict the future to a certain extent. Common
sense gives us some fairly reasonable power in this domain. If you study
predictive sciences you further develop it. But, although you were kind of
vague, I take it that you meant to predict the future of *humanity - a sort
of a intuitive and innate psycohistory.
This is all theoretically possible but very unlikely. Even if a psycohistory
exists (and then it wouldn't be restrained to "sensitive" people - computers
would probably do it much better) it wouldn't be enough to predict the
future because some individuals have to much power - and no psycohistory is
able to predict the behavior of individuals, by definition - and because
much of what makes human history depends on developments of technology, and
said psycohistory would have to _KNOW_ if things like IA and nanotech (as
well as steam and electricity) are possible or attainable, and obviously
that isn't in its "field".
And even if you don't take that into account and psycohistory is possible
then why should there be an innate version? There isn't much evolutionary
pressure for that, and it would have to have developed after society but by
then humans were already fairly insensitive to natural selection (not to
mention the extremely short time in which evolution would have to act,
especially if you consider that psycohistory is much more complex than even
intelligence).
And even if an innate psycohistory existed, how would the "sensitives"
gather the "initial conditions" of the system?
There is fairly strong evidence pointing to a maximum, and fairly low, rate
at which humans can absorb data. So, by the time the initial conditions were
gathered, assuming the sensitive didn't die by then, they would be grossly
out of date and therefore inadequate - as the sensitive would not have
gathered a single and concise set of past conditions but a mixture of
conditions of past and present).

Hello all,

I just want to say that within Christian thought (and I have seen this in 
real life too) death bed repentance may not be the great way to "have your 
cake and eat it" that some think.  There is the doctrine that the spirit of 
Christ does not always strive with people when they have repeatedly pushed 
away the promptings that they need to repent.  They may very well reach the 
point of no return where they are so mired in sin and certain attitudes that 
they will no longer have the desire to repent even on their death bed.  And 
as stated often people die suddenly and have no time to repent.

And repentance is more then a quick little prayer but a real letting go of 
old ways and attitudes that denotes real desire to change.  God can see the 
real nature of our hearts.  As a Latter-day Saint I believe that their are 
various degrees and levels in Heaven and that only those that really lived 
for God will get to dwell in the highest level with God and certainly not 
only lds people will be there; in fact many won't.  We also believe that 
before birth we lived in Heaven with God as adult spirits where we developed 
our personalities and talents in a multitude of ways.  I suppose many of you 
here spent all your time in the science section of the divine library!  
Mormons believe that only the most wicked and heinous will wind up in hell 
with the satan and his angels.  Hitler and Stalin I am sure would have their 
accommodations there.

I realize there are many nonbelievers on this list but I am just sharing my 
beliefs with you.  Do I know without any doubt that this is true; no I do 
not.  Mormons believe that the spirit of God lets people know the truth of 
these things for themselves through the mind and the heart but this takes 
someone being willing to do their own experiment by faith, study and 
application.  By this I have gained what I consider my belief in God and the 
afterlife.

And yet because I do not have a perfect knowledge of God I cling to this 
life that I know.  I am angry at the unfairness of mortality in terms of the 
inequality regarding intelligence, beauty, health and wealth among the 
population.  I want to see things straightened out here in this life and not 
just wait for the next.  I feel the human lifespan is just too short and 
that cryonics may give me the extra time I want.  Even as a nanobot filled 
immortal I will not go on forever; death will eventually claim me and 
uploaded copies of me as replacements holds no appeal to me.

So perhaps I hedge my bets.  It makes me feel guilty to do so but I want my 
chance in life!  I suffer from clinical depression (I take meds but no 
breakthrough yet), a.d.d., and worst of all learning disabilities that have 
stopped me so far from doing well in math and worst of all driving a car 
which is a huge frustration for me and  cost me dearly professionally and 
with women.  My father left my mother and I when I was a baby and I grew up 
without him.  I still bear emotional scars from that despite being reunited 
over the phone with him.  The damage is done and no apology has come.  He 
was extremely handsome but I did not inherit that key trait that can make 
life so much more pleasant.

I attend a local LDS singles adult ward and find it interesting that despite 
all the talk of living by Christ-like principles of love and kindness the 
same ruthless mating game rituals goes on there as anywhere else. Good-looks 
and money count just as much though being a faithful mormon guy is part of 
the bargain too.  I find the women friendlier in clubs and school dances 
then I do at the church dances.
A bishop(pastor) once explained it to me that the women are looking for 
mates so they are extremely particular.  I recently went through an online 
lds personals site and was surprised by all the women who were very 
attractive, in their thirties and never married even though certainly 
society is changing in that people wait longer to marry which is generally 
good.  I just wondered how many of these women were 'untouched' sexually 
since chastity is so emphasized in my church  (my male sexual strategies are 
showing themselves!).  It saddens me somewhat to think alot of people 
abstain from sex in their prime years(I am one who did) when they could have 
enjoyed their bodies and a partner so many times by making love over those 
years.  But they do this to live with their conscience and belief system.  I 
am not recommending promiscuity though since that can have it's own problems 
and heartaches.  I suppose the answer for me would have been marrying in my 
mid-twenties to have a partner had I been ready for one at that stage.

So many more have had it worse then me I realize but then so many more have 
had it much better.  I find myself sometimes criticized by people who are so 
blessed in comparison to me and have no right to talk.  I want a brain free 
of the flaws mine has and a handsome body on par with my fathers.  I want to 
be able to without agony learn math and to especially be able to drive a 
car.  I realize I must simply do the best with the hand of cards life dealt 
me but I tend to dwell on the negative and give up in frustration and 
embarrassment.

I realize I have talked about these things before but they are dear to my 
heart.  I wish I could attend the Extro but it looks like finances will not 
allow it this year so I will have to attend the one in 2000. I look forward 
to whatever thoughts any of you might have on my comments.  I wish you all 
the best.

Sincerely,

John Grigg

We should really start laughing about ourselves, then. Yeah, sure,
we're intelligent. Really smart, like. The top of the IQ food chain. 
Whatever.

Btw, I saw Charlie recently. Not as good as Sturgeon, but still a damn 
fine movie.

While GHB is considered Class 3 substance in many states

	http://www.erowid.org/entheogens/ghb/ghb_law.shtml

it's metabolic precursors are not

	http://www.ceri.com/ghbalt.htm

gamma-butyrolactone and and 1,4-butanediol are both legal and 
more safe in their use.

Life experience, digitized, becomes marketable content.

I make a thumbs-up gesture with my dataglove, and the Poser figure 
acts it out.  Put the gesture on the web, let others download, 
receive a royalty in the form of tax-free electronic tokens.

Private commerce: from your electronic wallet to mine, in 
micropayments.  Surely, bureacrats would have my e-wallet hotwired 
into U.S. Treasury or U.S. Postal Service accounts.  So what.

My new Metacreations Poser v4.0 didn't deliver VRML export as 
promised in advertisements.  Why?  The developers are focusing their 
efforts on Metastream.

See http://www.define.com/brandX/misc/bowls/loyal-customers.htm

Apparently, animated figurines need to be able to conduct secure e-
commerce transactions.  Here's a suggestion: make a VRML, or excuse 
me, X3D, version of Uncle Sam with a bag-o-coins.  He shows up on my 
screen, shouts "TRUST NO. 1" (referring to "Number One" or the Big 
One or Numero Uno as God is now called).  For my psychological pain 
and suffering related to the religious propaganda, I am awarded 
58,341.6 Riegels.  Convertable to just under $60,000 U.S.

How's the motion capture business doing now, with all the MEMS 
widgets and high speed telemetry?  It would be unfortunate if the 
library of 3D behaviors was limited to the rich and priviledged 
class.  (I can just imagine a secret lab over at Microsoft Research, 
filled with virtual actors creating whole news behavior libraries for 
the third world- to be downloaded from Teledesic.)  Not fair!!!

Nice that Defense Secretary was recently up here in the Seattle area 
to give a speech at Microsoft.  Number one defense software supplier. 
Trust Number One.

Sorry, I was just being a bit facetious there. I'm a fairly strong
non-believer, and I'll be part of the rebel underground if there does turn
out to be a god... Nevertheless, it's not my aim to offend the sensibilities
of those who do believe through off-hand remarks. My apologies again if this

Sounds like you've had a hard run of it, John; I think that
extropianism/transhumanism/whatever you want to call it gives hope to a lot
of people in a similar way to what it does for you. Don't let depression get
to you - the world is way too interesting just now to go getting down in the
dumps.

We've got clones, neural computing, gene hacking, real space travel, life
extension, human/computer integration, even the massively cliched flying
car, all either here or just round the corner! What about the promise of
nanotech, or real AI? And all the other stuff that I've missed of course... 

The quiet little, personal/global revolution of the 90s, the internet
(coming since the 60s/70s of course), still blows my mind!  I think we often
forget just what a revolution/revelation this is - sometimes I catch myself
taking it for granted and even thinking of it as a little antiquated. The
changes to the world it is wreaking stretch across every facet of human
life; they are fundamental, they are immense, and they are irreversible.
Best of all for you, the net is allowing us to begin to build a society (or
a collection of groups) where you can leave behing a lot of the problems
which most irritate you.

These are wild, eye-popping, crazy-making times. I think that many of the
great figures of history would have given a limb or two to get a look at
what is happening today. For us it's like riding on the roof of a fast
train. It gets uncomfortable, it can be scary, but its not getting boring
any time soon. All we have to do is pay attention and hang on. With luck we
can even add a bit of value.

So pay attention, and hang on! If heaven is there, it'll still be there when
you get around to dying, there's no rush. Meanwhile, we've got big-L Life
going on here...

There's got to be more than this universe. If you were an MBrain (or even a
lowly, measly JBrain) with the ability to sense /measure everything in the
universe as desired, you'd probably get over the universe after a few
billion years.

Above a certain level, the S^nIs are somewhere* else.

I was thinking about M-brains the other day, and pondering the fact that
they would probably be highly aesthetically pleasing, if you were that way
inclined. Incredibly intricate, functional, beautiful.

Imagine super, super, super SIs seeding a world with primitive life, shaping
it toward intelligent life, then to trans-intelligence, singularity, to SI
(still lowly by their standards). Eventually the SIs get to the point of the
M-brain, and start building them all over the place.

So the SSSSIs swoop in, collect them all up, and pop them in a pet universe
with the others, maybe use them for decorative purposes, or a cosmic game of
marbles. Like we might pop an intricate piece of coral in a fish tank, or
use a sea sponge to scrub our backs, or seed an oyster to make a pearl.

Still, that's one big vote for our aethetic potential, which is better than
nothing.

As you know, the Mars Global Surveyor is circling Mars in its mapping 
capacity.  In April of '98 it returned a series of three pictures of the 
Cydonia region, site of the alleged "Face."  On July 8 this year it returned 
another hi-resolution shot taken of the "City" area in Cydonia, and so far as 
I can tell it's equipped and ready to take even more shots of some of the 
more interesting formations within the next few months--or even days.

The processed images of the Face have produced a wealth of evidence 
consistent with artificiality, though the controversy is far from over.  
Members of SPSR (Scientists for the Study of Planetary SETI Research) are 
asking for high-resolution views of a specific, architectural-looking feature 
known as the "Fort," which, because of its morphology, should do much to 
illuminate whether or not we're dealing with artificial structures.  The July 
8 photo was very close, taking a close-up of the "Main Pyramid" formation 
instead (next to which is a crater with probable water ice).

I think we'd be well-served if Malin Space Science Systems (NASA/JPL's space 
camera contracter) got some encouraging email from interested groups who 
_aren't_ bogged down in conspiracy theory.  This is not "The X-Files," but a 
very touchy and completely falsifiable hypothesis which needs further 
exploration.

I recommend the websites of Dr. Mark Carlotto 
(www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html) and Dr. Stanley McDaniel 
(www.mcdanielreport.com) for background information.

Malin Space Science Systems can be reached online at info@msss.com.

I hate to rain on your plan but U.S. taxpayers (if that is what you are) are
taxed on their worldwide income.  Moving servers, intangibles, and even
business offshore only makes sense if your repatriation is nil or you're
avoiding nexus issues.

Title
  Effects of a long-term inhalation of fragrances on the stress-induced
  immunosuppression in mice.
Source
  Neuroimmunomodulation.  5(6):318-22, 1998 Nov-Dec.
Abstract
  The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the long-term
  application of various fragrances on the suppression of immune response
  induced by high-pressure stress in mice. The immune response was analyzed
  based on plaque-forming cell (PFC) count, using mice sensitized with sheep
  red blood cells. The decreased PFC involving thymic involution induced by
  high-pressure stress in mice was restored by exposing the stressed mice to
  tuberose, lemon, oakmoss and labdanum for 24 h following exposure to stress.
  The decreased PFC and thymic involution from stress were restored by exposure
  to lemon and oakmoss, but not to tuberose and labdanum when the mice were
  exposed to those fragrances continuously for 3 weeks before the stress was
  given, followed by exposure to the same fragrances for 24 h after the stress.
  The decreased PFC and thymic involution from stress were restored by exposure
  to lemon and labdanum for 24 h after the stress, but not to tuberose over 3
  weeks before the stress was given. These data suggest that the
  neuroimmunomodulatory effects of fragrances may be affected by tolerance
  depending on the kinds of fragrances in the case of a long-term application.

Don't you have to earn actual money (rather than e-bucks) before tax comes
into the picture? I'd love to see a prolonged diatribe from an expert on
this (self proclaimed experts welcome).

Maybe this "somewhere (over the rainbow)" is some kind of "interpretation
space" as Hans Moravec has suggested recently. Future SSIs actually wouldn`t
have to move into different or parallel universes. They could play their
potential mind games in some kind of quantum vacuum that is inaccessible to
human beings. And wouldn`t it be possible that those intelligences are
already present playfully messing around with our nervous systems on this
unapproachable quantum level or - being a little more optimistic -
beautifully shaping and designing our thoughts
and actions ?  Let`s see: will they be using an especially appealing detail
of the cosmic microwave radiation together with the process of
photosynthesis in an maple leaf (make belief) and combine it with the
molecular design of serotonin produced by a human brain in a state of bliss
to generate  . . . what?. . . a posthuman glass bead game or whatever you
may hope is useful and necessary to cope with future developments. Who knows
? I don`t. I was just musing on meaningful patterns.

Yep, this has been also my impression. We do really seem to have
unresolvably different ways of seeing matters. Not that diversity is a
bad thing, but it sure turns tedious having to reiterate

It might be logical, yet there is plenty of reasons to blame
widespread "investment protection" attitude for it. Investment
protection is great for local optimization, but is deletorious 
even on the middle run. And is really really desastrous on the 
long run. 

To name a few notorious perpetrators: Big Blue, Intel, Microsoft 
have been reserved a special circle in Dante's Hell. (At least 
in my private universion of it).

Alas, woefully, free markets seem to fail here miserably. Technical

There is really no fundamental difference between x86 family, PowerPC, 
diverse MIPSen or Alpha. They all suck.

The trouble with Microsoft is that we're reasoning with a marketplace
flattened by more than a decade of its influence as a point of 
reference. To be fair we must evaluate multiple alternate branches 
of reality-as-it-could-have-been, which necessarily makes for 
extremely subjective judgements. Your mileage WILL vary.

As to Microsoft, I guess all the intelligence cream they've been
skimming off academia/industry for years & all these expenses in R&D

me as especially innovative or even high-quality, no Sir. Particularly 
regarding ROI in respect to all these research gigabucks pourin'
in. Administratory hydrocephalus begets administratory hydrocephalus.

Well, essentially all we've got is SMP. I guess it makes use of 
shared-memory paradigm which is a dead-end. Shared-memory is at 
least as unphysical as caches, in fact more so.

I know clustering is going to be big, and is eventually going to find
its way into desktops. It's still a back-assed way of doing things,
maybe smart RAM will have its say yet. If only Playstation 2 would be 
already available, oh well. Marketplace will sure look different a
year downstream. Difficult to do any planning when things are so in 
flux.

Heck, LISP is the second oldest HLL known to man, and Alonzo
Church invented lambda calculus in the 1940's. Eniac was a RISC
machine. Unix is a 1970's OS. GUIs/mice/Ethernet are 1970's
technologies. Von Neumann invented cellular automata in the 1950's. 

What has age anything to do with how good an idea it is? If anything,
a brand-new untried idea is something to be wary of.

Nope, sorry, don't think so. Most of IT landscape is shaped by vogues, 
and right now parallelism is getting fashionable (what a damnable
word) again. (While ALife is heading into oblivion, which is imo a 
damn shame).

 > makes more sense to link 1,000 big, fast CPUs with large memory caches than
 > 100,000 small, cheap CPUs with tiny independant memory blocks.  That fits

Heck, caches hierarchies are unphysical. Fat CPUs are incommensurable 
with nonnegligeable fast on-die SRAM blocks _and_ high good die
yield. Wafer-scale integration is impossible without good die yield 
and failure tolerance. Kbit buses are impossible if you don't have 
embedded DRAM technology due to packaging constraints. Embedded 
RAM technology is hardly one year old. VLIW is at the threshold 
of going mainstream, and VLIW only makes good sense with kBit 
broad buses/on-die memory. High code density is impossible 
without threaded code, and threaded code requires stack CPU 
hardware support. Common HLLs don't support threaded code/stack 
CPUs. No language supports fine-grain maspar systems. 
Blahblahblah. I could go on for a long time but (I hope) my
point is nauseatingly clear: it's a big ball of yarn buried in 
yonder tarpit, and requires a whole lotta muscle to haul it out. 
You have to do it in one piece because everything is 
coherent/contiguous/synergistic. A bit of tarry string wrestled 
from the pit won't excite anybody. Please go for the whole hog.

IT is just another acronym for Inertia Technology. We're caught 
in a local minimum, but this doesn't mean there is no lower one. 
And a (number of) decision(s) has been made in the past which 
made us land in this particular minimum. It could have been a 
different one.

Sorry if this sounds like a just another technoshaman mantra, but
that's just how things are.

There are codes where Amdahl is going to bite ya. There are a lot
where overhead is not a problem. My particular problem (from the
domain of physical simulation on a 3d lattice) is the latter case.

Heck I did it years ago. Somebody even used the writeup in a CPU 
design class. As I don't have a fab and several 100 M$ to burn (and,
incidentally, more important research to do) I can hardly be expected 
to assault the buttress alone, can I? You'll wind up in the moat, all
dirty & bloody, and have to listen to stupid French jokes and be used
for carcass target practice in the bargain.

Right, the whole area of supercomputing is going to vanish into a
logics cloud overnight -- because as everybody knows they are 
all monoprocessors. Beowulf is just a passing fad -- pray no 
attention to exponential growth of 'wulfers. Photolitho-semiconductor 
CPUs will scale in to 10, 100, 1000 GHz regime trivially. Einstein 
was dead wrong, and you can signal faster than speed of 
light in vacuum. It makes actual sense implementing a Merced 
in buckytube logic. People who proved that reversible cellular 
automata in molecular logics are the most efficient way of
doing computation were just dweebs. Right.

I guess I don't have a typical desktop machine, then. I could really

Spell checking? I never do spell checking. I do have the C. elegans
genome sitting on my hard drive here, though, which I'd love to do some
statistical analysis on. Guess what? Another embarrasingly parallel
app.

the outside. No never fork no more...

Well, I guess I must be pretty special, because the $100,000
mega-server doesn't make at all sense when you want to do
multi-million particles MD. Lots of cheap PC with full duplex
FastEthernet, very much yes. And there is no bottleneck, since from a
certain minimal system size/node onwards the things scales O(N), and I 
mean _strictly_ O(N).

Cheap!=slow. A $30 DSP can outperform a $300 CPU because it don't have 
to put up with legacy bloat.

Shared memory does not exist, at least not >2-4 ports. If you attempt to 
simulate that, you will have to pay dearly in logic and cache
coherence issues, which starts to slow you down very quickly (point of 
diminishing returns is just round the corner). You can simulate shared 
memory with message-passing, though. If you really, really really need 
it.

Caching doesn't exist (pray pay no attention to the clever fata morgana). 
Internode-communication is readily addressable (=solved) by having a 
failure-tolerant routing protocol with switch fabric built into the 
CPU. Next Alpha is going to have multi-10 GByte/s inter-CPU signalling 
with 15 ns signalling latency. 3d lattice topology (6 links/CPU) is 
really sufficient for most codes I care about. 
 
See SGI/Cray, DSP clusters and Myrinet Beowulfs for illustration.

Untrue. You almost never have to switch context if you have 1 kCPUs to 
burn. You only have to do this if you run out of the allocable CPU
heap (when the number of your objects exceed the number of your CPUs).

No, no, no and more no's......I'm not quibbling with facts on any of this
stuff - I don't know all about science and math, I'm pointing out logical
fallacies in the statements you're making. You assume yet again - this time
that slorgopo energy is detectable by the tools of astronomy - well, I made
it up, and I say it ain't. Hundreds of years ago if I had proposed
electomagnetic radiation, undetectable by human senses, I'd have done an
afternoon on the barbeque. "Human senses see all, as God has blessed....blah
blah..." they'd rant as I go up in flames. Just as you are assuming that
astronomy tools see all. I think not.

Does anyone know about the principle of true uncertainty? Often when I
discuss determinism and causality with people, they pull out the old
"Quantum uncertainty" thing. I don't know what this is, or if it really
describes true uncertainty (i.e. truly spontaneous occurrences). I doubt it.
Ron, can you expand the uncertainty detail at all? Anyone else...?

Cheers,

Rob.

So, the name of the wave comes from the source of it's energy - in this case
gravity. Not, as I thought before, the medium in which the wave exists......
Is this correct?
BTW - cheers for the fine explanation !

It's true, I know zilch about math, but I don't hold this as relevant. I
argue with statements made such as below:

You and everyone else on this planet have absolutely no evidence whatsoever
for this immense assumption. It doensn't matter that maths can describe most
things we have encountered...it may not be the exact tool that dissimilar
civilisations use. True, there are probably basic similarities, but no way
will I buy that any civilisation would certainly understand one of our
equations when faced with it, even having explained the symbols etc... Basic
concepts such as why, how, systems thinking and linear time may not be as
they are here due to the brain (or equivalent) structure of the observers,
providing a very different perspective from which to view and therefore
describe the universe.

If such commonality exists.

	Remember - in all this, I MERELY point out that you people CANNOT be
as cocksure as you seem that all civilisations throughout the universe will
use math exactly as we use it.

This post provides a very instructive lesson on the rhetorical
tools used by nonsense-peddlers:

> consistent with artificiality, though the controversy is far from over.  

"Consistent with" is a great weasel phrase.  All the "wealth of evidence"
(by which he means 3 pictures) is also "consistent with" the fact that
it's just a bleeping rock.  Suggesting that there is a controversy when
there really isn't one also helps; there's only a controversy because
a few hard-headed idiots won't face the facts.

> Members of SPSR (Scientists for the Study of Planetary SETI Research) are 

Creating serious-sounding organizations makes your press releases sound
more credible without having to have any actual credibility.

> known as the "Fort," which, because of its morphology, should do much to 
> illuminate whether or not we're dealing with artificial structures.  The July 

Pointing to future tests/research plants the suggestion in the reader's
mind that such will be favorable to the speaker's point of view, even if
that's very unlikely.  Also note the overuse of technical-sounding words
like "morphology" where "shape" would be simpler and more direct.  This
also makes a speaker sound more educated to the masses.

"This is not the X-Files"; "This isn't about sex"; "This money-making
system is completely legal"; "This is not spam".  Direct denial of the
obvious is cheap and surprisingly effective.

Nothing like a paid-for PhD to make people take you seriously.
Most serious scientists don't bother with titles; when was the
last time you saw "Dr. Einstein" or "Dr. Feinmann"?  (He even
titled his own book "Surely You're Joking, /Mr./ Feinmann.")
They've /earned/ their credibility, so they have no need to
remind anyone that they jumped through some university hoops.

We're moving into an era where money can be backed by military force 
rather than gold reserves.

The U.S. Treasury just *PRINTED* an extra $200 Billion in cash in 
case there's a currency shortage due to Y2K bugs.  Why don't they use 
that currency to pay for Defense Spending and U.N. Debt?  I doubt 
there will be inflation with all the price wars going on here on the 
internet and on web-based e-commerce driven electronic storefronts.

They have the printing presses, spy satellites, cruise missiles, and 
directed energy weapons (both nonlethal and destructive).

So, if they came right out and said, "Ken's right.  We don't need 
your money- keep it." there would be outcries of coup d'tat from the 
veterans and nontechnologists.  It seems like the people in power 
(behind the scenes) are actually quite libertarian and decentralists, 
enthusiastic about completely private e-commerce.  But when it comes 
to publicly acknowledging the end of federal taxation: they evade the 
issue and return to emotions of national pride and loyalty.

It seems like the only way to really get this done is large scale 
civil disobedience in a nonchalant manner, with an attitude that the 
system is in a transition state, and we're still civil and orderly.

For example, use a large international body with no formal government 
ties (http://www.worldbank.org/) create all the electronic 
infrastructure needed for international e-commerce that's completely 
outside of government juristiction.  It would be a pro-social pro-
environmental (cashless) economy.

I'm a layperson, obviously simple-minded on this matter.  But tacit 
acknowledgement of common sense economic and civil liberties seems to 
be the most sensible migration path out of this bureacratic hell of 
complexity piled on top of complexity.

Incidentally, what if the Defense Department (or NATO, or ex-Warsaw 
Pact) Technologists had all the resources in place to track every 
living human on the planet simultaneously.  Instead of carrying a 
walet, the citizens x,y,z coordinates could become their account i.d. 
 The wealth would never leave the person, so to speak.  What do you 
think?

Wouldn't that be SSPSR? Either the scientists or the study is apparently
missing. Maybe both. Note that they don't actually study, they only advocate
studying. 'Scientists *for the* Study.'  And you're not allowed to have an
acronym in an acronym. You're supposed to expand it. That would make it
SSPSETIR, which looks very odd.

(If you are from Australia, please note that the following refers to the
United States federal income tax system.  I know next to nothing about
Australian taxes.)



The IRS has long taken the position that 'income', for the purpose of the
income tax, is defined in the broadest possible terms.  If you are paid
in chickens, the IRS regards the chickens as income equal to the cash
fair market value of the chickens.  Same for barter.  The IRS even has a
form for reporting barter transactions.  The IRS uses the term 'taxable
boot' for taxable non-cash (or 'in kind') income.  Money or value which
accrues to the taxpayer's benefit is generally taxable in the year in
which it accrues.  You are taxed each year on the interest earned each
year by a 5-year CD even if it just accumulates in the CD account.  You
are taxed each year on the imputed growth in value of a 30 year zero
coupon bond, even though you don't get the money until the bond matures
or is sold. 


There are certain kinds of income which are exempt from the income tax,
though they may be subject to other taxes such as estate and gift taxes. 
Those forms of income exempt from the income tax include inheritances,
bona fide gifts, casualty insurance settlements, disability payments,
awards and settlements for tort damages, life insurance beneficiary
proceeds, stipends, indemnities, and loans received.

I don't say that waves _must_ be named after the force involved (or one
of them) rather than the medium of propagation.  In the case of 'gravity
waves' on the surface of water, that is just what is established
terminology.  And gravity is not the only force involved with those
waves.  Momentum, inertia, kinetic energy, surface tension, and viscosity
would also be required to characterize them.  There is nothing
fundamentally wrong with naming a wave after the medium in which it
propagates.  'Electromagnetic waves' could be called 'ether waves'
without harm (sidestepping the question of whether there even is an
ether).  In some contexts it could be useful to name waves after their
media.  


We mentioned two kinds of 'water waves': gravity waves on the surface of
deep water, and acoustic waves in bulk pressurized water.  There may be
yet another kind of 'water wave'.  If a sheet of water is flowing down a
sloped, randomly rough surface, wavelets form and travel along down. 
This happens even if the roughness of the surface is orders of magnitude
less than the depth of the sheet of water.  This phenomenon can sometimes
be seen on a sloping piece of asphalt pavement during a heavy rain, or
even on a sloped piece of glass.  Could we call those waves 'water
avalanche waves'?   When the big mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope
received its final cleaning, distilled water was run across the surface. 
The criterion for knowing when the cleaning was done was when the
wavelets stopped forming and the sheet of water became smooth.

If I have a cup of hot coffee sitting on the table, the water molecules
in the cup, being hot, are jiggling randomly.  There is a slight,
vanishingly small chance that the coffee will leap out of the cup and fly
up towards the ceiling.  In practice, I am highly confident this will not
happen, but in principle I cannot predict what the coffee will do with
absolute certainty.


But suppose that I knew the position and momentum of each molecule in the
cup at the present time.  Then, in principle, could I predict the future
behavior of the coffee?  Even then, I don't think so.  An errant driver
could lose control of his car, smash through the wall, hit the table, and
spill the coffee.  But neglecting the case of unpredictable external
influences, there is still a problem with predicting the future behavior
of a system.  That is that the uncertainty principle limits the precision
of measuring both the position and momentum of a particle at the same
time.  The product of the uncertainties of position and momentum is at
least Planck's constant.


So the precise initial conditions needed to make a prediction cannot be
obtained, given the uncertainty principle.

OK, you've convinced me to reserve judgement until someone actually builds 
one.  It still sounds like a lot of arm-waving to me, but I'll admit that 
designing parallel processing hardware isn't one of my areas of expertise.

What exactly is the alternative?  Write software optimized for something 
that doean't exist?  If you want to blame Intel and IBM for not innovating 
faster, feel free, but don't blame the software companies for not inventing 
new hardware.

Technical excellence according to who?  A superior product is one that has 
the combination of features, price and performance that the customers 
actually want.  A competing product that has a really elegant 
implementation, but lacks basic functionality that virtually all users 
want, is not superior in any meaningful sense.

Free markets efficiently produce products that people want to buy.  If the 
results don't fit your concept of what good software is, the first thing 
you should question is your own concept of what the goal should be. 
 Claiming that the market has missed some perfect opportunity that only you 
can see is a favored tactic of those whose ideas don't work in the real 
world.

My point was that big software vendors are willing to spend substantial 
amounts of money re-writing their products for a platform that is only 
marginally faster than the x86 family.  We should therefore expect that 
they would be even more eager if a machine 100 or 1,000 times faster came 
along.

Do we really need to do the 'I hate Microsoft' thing here?  I suggest we 
call a truce on the issue, since experience shows that no one ever changes 
their mind about it as a result of argument.

Distributed applications aren't the same thing as clustering.  The idea now 
is that you run different parts of your app on different machines, so that 
the load can be distributed across a network of arbitrary size.  You end up 
with an arbitrarily large number of different 'types' of server, each doing 
a different job, and each of which can be implemented across one or more 
clusters.

Says me.  I've worked with the innards of OS software long enough to know 
what is and isn't going on in there.  But if you don't believe me, you 
might want to take note of the fact that the CPU on a modern machine is 
usually below 10% utilization when you're running normal apps.  Even with 
everything loaded onto one processor, the system spends almost all of its 
time sitting around waiting for something to do.

Yes, your simulations are highly parallel.  It would therefore make sense 
to run them on some sort of parallel hardware.  However, they are a big 
exception to the general rule.  About 99.9% of all users never run anything 
that has enough parallelism to be worth the bother of re-coding.  Even 
where parallelism exists (i.e. server apps), the complexity of the 
operations the software performs is too high for the kind of system you 
want to see (making the objects 100% independant of each other would 
require making each of them much too big to fit on the processor nodes 
you're talking about).

It sounds like you've written so much 'do a few complex operations on a 
huge body of data'-type code that you've forgotten that the rest of the 
world doesn't work that way.

Yes, you could run that genome analysis program this way.  You could do the 
same thing with image filters, simple rendering engines, and a lot of other 
problems.  But that encompasses only a tiny fraction of the programming 
world.

Most software applies vast amounts of code to relatively small amounts of 
data.  In this case you have whole systems of relatively large objects with 
lots of internal procedures, all of which must interact with each other to 
get anything done.  Instantiating the objects on different CPUs simply 
substitutes inter-node messaging for some of your context switching, and 
doesn't help matters at all.  Many big problems, like evolutionary design 
and AI reasoning, have these characteristics, and they demand a very 
different kind of architecture than what you are proposing.

Well, according to a couple of engineering friends of mine who just recently
took an intel assembly language class, running a dual CPU system (by intels
scheme) is only theoretically going to reach something like 1.75 times as
fast, instead of twice.  The actuality of it is even worse, depending on
software.

But, comparing apples to oranges, can you really explain this difference in
speed just by the cache?
Oh, I was way off in my speed measurement on my celeron, it took about 63
hours for a packet.  Vs. the 8 hours on the dual PII 450.  That's about 8
times faster.  Say that his 450 actually achieved the equivalent of a PII
900 (which it can't), scale down by three, a PII 300 should be about 24
hours.  My Celeron 300 is 63 hours, so that makes it equivalent to something
like a PII 115.  Can the small cache really cut my speed down to a third?

Its fundamental economics.  A lot of agriculture in Europe gets
government subsidies (I suppose it does in the U.S. as well).
The EU governments see the U.S. going to GM crops so they know in order
to be competitive they have to as well.  So they promote GM crops.
The farmers see that GM crops will be more productive so fewer
fields will be required to grow them.  They see a reduction
in subsidies and price supports and so they try to put pressure
on the government to stop GM crops.  When that doesn't work they
respond by resorting to spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty & doubt).
If they happen to get the ear of a sympathetic legislator (who
isn't in one of the Science ministries promoting the GM trend),
you then get labeling legislation that then feeds back to the
public.  Since the public knows nothing about science, if "labeling"
is required, then there must really be something to fear about GM crops.

The GM trend is unstopable.  I was stunned to find out in *1995*
that the local university was testing GM crops in fields in *Trinidad*.
The Chinese are also doing a lot of field testing that we hear very
little about.  Because GM of plants doesn't have huge capital startup
costs or require "new knowledge" (i.e. barriers to entry are low) almost any
country can set up a lab to do it.  Send a few dozen students to a
good Ag-school in America and they return home with all the knowledge
they need in a few years.

While the farmers in Europe have an incentive to stop GM crops,
the reverse is true in third world countries.  When you are
struggling to survive, anything you can do to increase your
productivity is going to help.

Can you stop imports of GM crops by testing for added genes?
Yes, that works for known genes (like Bt), but the number of
possible modifications is huge.  To test for them you are going
to have to know what they are.  A farmer wanting to sell his crop,
or a government wanting to boost exports isn't likely to be up
front about what those modifications are.

The only solution is to educate the public.  There is a great
story about some Ag-firm that had managed to breed a completely
"natural" strain of one vegetable (cabbage I think) that turned
out to be highly insect resistant.  It was insect resistant because
it had significantly amplified its production of its natural
pesticides.  [Many "natural" plant pesticides when tested
with the standard tests qualify as carcinogenic].  This makes
sense when you consider that the plants have been at war
with the insects for ~300 million years. 

Until you get the public to understand that "natural" foods
consist of toxic & non-toxic chemicals and what matters is
the quantities of both, the FUD will have an effect.

> 
> Prince Charles declaring that ''Genetic modification takes mankind into
> realms that belong to God and God alone,''

That's going to have a big effect in Russia, China, Japan, India
much of Africa where the prevailing religions have a much different
perspective of that of Europeans/Americans.  It also isn't going to have
much of an effect in countries with extreme population pressures
that need any agricultural advantage they can get.

The first plant genome (Arabidopsis) appears to be about 66% complete
(86 Mbases out of ~130 Mbases).  I think the estimated completion date
is sometime this year or next year.  Since this is public data
it will open the flood gates on doing real work on plants.
We may reasonably assume there are more than a few politicians
from the American mid-west states applying pressure on the
Dept. of Agriculture to get on with sequencing various plant
and farm animal genomes.  I would presume that this isn't
going to receive much resistance from the religious right
because these are animals & plants, not humans, we are talking
about and farmers do care about their bottom line.
As soon as the human genome is complete (2001-2003), the
resources dedicated to that will move onto the other genomes
(mouse & rat, then other genomes, presumably in some relation
to the order of economic significance).

Now, if someone would just do the Komodo Lizard, so I could
build my dragon, which was why I got into biotech in the first
place.  Hmmmphhh.

in Washington, D.C.  - see <http://www.wfs.org/9ga.htm>

The conference will assemble 1200 to 1500 professional futurists
from all over the world, and we hope to do a good job there representing 
transhumanist ideas.  Besides giving speeches and shmoozing, we are going
to have a table with transhumanist materials - articles, magazines, books,
flyers...   I expect it to have a good impact if we do it right.

We can have 20 or more different items on display, maybe 100 to 400 copies of each.

We need, quite urgently, help with selecting materials, designing flyers,
printing, shipping, and paying for renting the table and copying of materials.

If you can help in any way, please send mail to us (see cc list in this message)
shortly.  Please include your suggestions for selection of materials and 
describe what you can do to help make it happen.

Thanks!

I have two C300As overclocked to 450Mhz which have been running Win95 24/7
since December 1998.  They have been running Gaussian 98W, a molecular
modeling program which is fpu intensive, nonstop 24/7 as well.  The computers
have no overclocking stability issues with G98W, btw it has been my experience
that if a pc is stable enough to run a gaussian calculation without crashing
then nothing will crash it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From: "Donald B. Kinghorn" <kinghorn@U.Arizona.EDU>

I'd like to make two comments;

1) I do (very) high precision QM energy calculations with wave function
optimizations that may run for months --- I would be very uneasy
about publishing new energy upper bounds that were computed with
hardware that was pushed beyond specifications.  Maybe it's safe but
I wouldn't want to stake my reputation on it.  [Remember the FOOF bug?
For a short time results computed on Intel hardware were unpublishable.]

2) A killer machine for one problem may be a piece of junk for another problem.

[I think this has been stated several times] The memory subsystem can have
a large impact on performance for some calculations.
Example:
I put together a PII400 system with 128M PC100 cas 2 SDRAM and was
casually testing it against a PPro 180 system with 128MB 60ns DIMM (at 60MHz)
The PPro has 256k full speed cache and the PII400 has 512k 1/2 speed cache.
(some other difference too I assume)
For "small" jobs the PII400 was basically twice as fast as the PPro180.
For "large" jobs (80MB RSS) the PII400 was about 3.5 times faster!!
[there was no disk or network IO on either system during the calc's]
I was very surprised by this. I can only assume that it was due to the
(overall) faster memory subsystem on the PII400 system.

[I'm eagerly awaiting a K7 system with a 200MHz memory subsystem
that might be real interesting if the price is right]

Bottom line: A system is only killer if it works well on your problems
and gives you results that you can use.

but please don't stop experimenting with the overclocking --- this is
very interesting stuff. [I'm going to try it too]   :-)

Duh, the right link to the SMP smackdown is:

http://www.ars-technica.com/cpu/3q99/smp/smp-1.html  I switched the 'cpu' 
part to 'spu'.  Copy/pasting the link was too much trouble :P huh ...
Sorry for the extra mail.

I was not going to post the vendors at first, I was a little worried some 
of you would think I was making free publicity.  But the place I bought it 
supports 100% 'the cause', meaning 'the overclockers cause'.   I got my 
CPU's over international mail from the US to Belgium (yes, the only 
chicken-less, coke-less lil' country in Europe for a while if you followed 
the news lately).  The place is called http://www.outsideloop.com .  Take a 
look at their site, they are cool. Their prices might be a little higher 
than others but they hand-pick Processor  batches and for a buck or 10 more 
you have a guaranteed OC'er.  Lemme tell you that what they charge over 
there for their stuff + VAT + shipping oversea to my front door in Europe 
costs less than buying the stuff over here.  And a lot of the stores DO not 
ship outside the US.  Heads up for them.

There are other vendors that I know a lot of my fellow clockers use (almost 
all in the US unfortunately for us Euro's).   One of my favorite sites 
among ARS is HardOCP ( http://www.hardocp.com ).  There are links to Azzo 
Computing and Dallasmemory and other shops known in the field.

The 300a thing is indeed a good question.  I would still go for them I 
think considering their price.  The main reason is because they easily run 
at 100Mhz FSB.  Since Intel knows people are seriously clocking them, all 
the new PPGA celeron's available today have huge multipliers (6, 7, etc ..) 
now since they are supposedly only good according to Intel for the 66 Mhz 
Bus.  When you set the FSB to 100Mhz, a multiplier of 7 is just too good to 
be true.  (700Mhz anyone ?? :P).  As a side effect when clocking in the 
case of high multiplier locks, you'll have to use a different FSB (83, 75, 
etc ) to achieve a stable system.  This has implications for the PCI bus 
running seriously out of spec at 40 +mhz in some cases because the PCI bus 
divider on most motherboards instead of the default speed of 33 Mhz .  At 
66 Mhz and 100Mhz the divider becomes respectively 1/2 and 1/3 .

In short, in that case you're overclocking every CARD in your PC , more 
correct your whole system.  Most lower end cards blow chow on that. 
 Sometimes this can be safely done but the successrate is less.  Your 
mileage WILL vary.   The latest news is that the 366 PPGA celeron is a 
 good candidate.  But then the Epox KP6-BS is not a good choice since it 
does not have a lot of different FSB's possibities.   I would defo go for 
the Abit Dual BP6 Mobo in that case.   In fact, that motherboard wasn't out 
yet when I designed my system, otherwise I would've taken that one.  No 
SLOT1/PPGA convertors to mess with.

nlike your statement, the Celeron is not from the same core as the PII. 
 As a mather of fact it's design looks more like the Intel Xeon PII than 
the regualar PII.
The Celeron's Core is Mendocino. The PII's core are either a 
 Klamath/Deschutes core  .  the big difference is the on die L2 cache, 
which runs at core speed.   The PII's cache runs at core speed / 2.
Celeron's really rock.  Intel's money cow, the PII is just a big joke. 
  The celeron's that run at the same core speed as a PII kicks serious 
butt.  Including PIII's.
Because of the bad rep the first cacheless Celeron's had,  the CPU was 
destined to be sold to the lower segment of the market.   And that's great, 
because 'we' can buy dirt cheap CPU's  that rock.

Also, PC100 RAM has totally no advantage if you're Front bus speed is set 
too 66Mhz.  Like someone stated before,  celeron's overclock easily.  Abit 
motherboards are your friends.
Take a look at the BP6 Motherboard from abit.  A dual PPGA motherboard and 
probably one of the most stable boards in the world. (and cheap ..)

As long as no program uses the new KNI instruction set for the PIII,  it's 
really a waste of money to pay 3 times as much for it than the cost of King 
Celeron.

Yes, but for many things this doesn't seem to matter much.  For others,
of course, it will.  I've a bunch of applications (including my
numerical Monte Carlo code, but other stuff too) that runs within 5% of
the same speed on PII's and Celerons, with or without PC100 SDRAM.  This
isn't unreasonable -- the PII and Celeron share the same core.

For many things, clock speed rules.  For others, cache size and memory
speed are important.  In my mind (because my applications fit in the
former category) the Celeron is the best deal on the market -- a beowulf
node can be built for as little as $350 with careful shopping, and it is
pretty easy to build nodes for $500-750 (depending on how much memory
and disk and what kind of network).  This is pretty close to what PIII
processors cost all by themselves.

Between the Celeron at one end (most TOPS/FLOPS/IPS per dollar) and the
21264 Alpha at the other (most TOPS/FLOPS per node at a still-sane cost
per dollar) is a vast wasteland of less-than-optimal cost benefit where
only a few people will be wise to buy.  To find out if you're one of
them, you pretty much have to benchmark and test, ideally with the
actual application you plan to run.  Realize that you can get two, maybe
three 466 MHz Celeron systems for what a single 500 MHz PIII system
costs -- there has to be a pretty significant advantage to the PIII to
make it worth it.

Allow me to specify in greater detail the comments I made in the previous post.

I have a genuine 450MHz PII system (no overclock) which I run gaussian98
calculations on.  I have the two previously mentioned C300As overclocked to 450MHz,
and I have a K6-2 333MHz system (so a total of 4 different computers).

Now, it does NOT matter which computer I run a gaussian98 on I ALWAYS get the same
answers (energies, MO coefficients, etc.).  I have checked and rechecked my results
between all four computers as well as published results in the literature (JACS, J
Chem Phys, Etc.).  If these calculations are subject to ANY hardware derived errors
then all four of the above machines must share that same flaw.

Also, my reference to the stability of an overclocked computer with respect to
gaussian98 is derived from the following.  First, all four cpus listed above can
still be further overclocked without any degradation in system stability during
normal usage (i.e. running netscape to check my email).  In fact they can all be
overclocked another 12% (100MHz FSB -> 112MHz FSB) and run just fine (i.e. no
crashes or errors when running any/all my current software programs) until I attempt
to run a gaussian98 calculation.  For some reason the gaussian98 code seems
particularly sensitive to cpus operating in their marginally unstable regions.  I
have verified that this phenomena is not an artifact of the 112MHz bus since the K6
is not clock-multiplier locked and the motherboard can go up to 124MHz FSB with no
g98 issues unless I also try and clock the cpu above 333MHz.  Bottom line is that if
your computer is overclocked and does not crash when running G98W then I would say
it is as stable as it will ever need to be.

The correct designation is Society for Planetary SETI Research; I wrote the 
above in haste and obviously didn't get it right.  I'm interested, though, in 
where the "crackpot" bit comes in.  I posted about some known anomalies that, 
hopefully, will be reimaged shortly by a NASA spacecraft.  Nothing crazy 
about that.  Even Carl Sagan urged additional study into this.

Who's the crackpot here?  And how does a mis-typing help you spot one...?

While I have no clue what "ROTFLMAO" stands for ("rolling on the 
floor"-something, I guess), I really don't get why this is an "untouchable."  
No one with common sense is saying there are unquestionably alien artifacts 
on Mars.  But the possibility is there, and we have the means to _test_ the 
Intelligence Hypothesis in the very near future, using proven hardware.

I simply don't see why a group who can digest concepts such as brain 
downloading and superintelligences can't admit the possibility of some 
anomalous formations on a neighboring planet.  There's really nothing to lose 
with this one.  But, as is usual with this subject, it's being interpreted as 
an emotional issue...and in the meantime, evidence is ignored.

I was under the impression that all seti@home packets are not created
equal, or at least that the analyser might take longer depending on the
patterns found. If this is true, these packets don't exactly make good
benchmarks.

Toward Replacement Parts for the Brain:  Intracranial Implantation of Hardware
Models of Neural Circuitry

This conference will bring together leading researchers throughout the country
for a focus on one of the newest frontiers of neuroscientific and
bioengineering research: the intracranial implantation of computer chip models
of brain circuitry as neural prosthetics to replace damaged or dysfunctional
brain tissue.  In considering the development of "replacement parts for the
brain," speakers will address recent advances in (i) biologically realistic
mathematical models of brain or spinal cord function, (ii) silicon- and/or
photonics-based computational devices which incorporate those models, and (iii)
"neuron-silicon interface" devices, i.e., micron-scale multi-site electrode
arrays to provide bi-directional communication between the computational
element and functioning neuronal tissue.  The conference is intended to
synergize interdisciplinary research in the neural, engineering, and biomedical
sciences. 

Session Titles Include:  Neural Prosthetics for Sensory Transduction, Hardware
Implementations of Neural Networks, The Neuron-Silicon Interface, Neuron
Population Dynamics and Information Coding in the Nervous System, Adaptive
Implant Technology and Implant-Based Rehabilitation, and, The "Business" of
Neural Prosthesis and Neural Engineering Technologies.

_This_ post provides a very instructive lesson on the rhetorical tools used 
by people who can't tell nonsense from speculation.  I hate getting into 
these inane arguments, but this post was too personal and just plain 
wrong-headed.

Could it be a rock?  Absolutely.  But not only is the Face formation 
consistent (yes, _consistent_) with the Artificiality Hypothesis, it actually 
confirms some of the features just hinted at by the original Viking frames.  
And where did you get "three pictures"?  I think of at least 100 shots of 
Cydonia and areas with similar topology that have helped in the development 
of the Artificiality Hypotheis, not to mention any number of studies using 
everything from fractal algorithms to CAD imaging to classical sculpting 
techniques.  

Again, I'm not saying the Face on Mars is an ET artifact!  But it's worth a 
closer, better look.  I stand by this quite strongly.

>Creating serious-sounding organizations makes your press releases sound
>more credible without having to have any actual credibility.

I didn't create SPSR (though I'm flattered by your accusation).  SPSR is a 
group of trained scientists of various types who single-handedly convinced 
NASA to take a second look, and who have presented papers at the American 
Geophysical Union and elsewhere.  I might add that not all of them even 
endorse the Artificiality Hypoethesis.  But they know an anomaly when they 
see it, and they've done soem awfully good work on the subject.  Since you 
seem to be aware of them, I'd like your reaction; they may not be popular, 
but you'd have to have a real problem to accuse them of being crackpots.

Oh, jeez.  Bad word choice!  You got me!  I might add that I know full well 
that I'm _not_ writing for "the masses."  I got on this list because I 
suepected there was a general level of intellectual sophistication that you

Same as above.  You're going to considerable lengths to make me look stupid, 
and all you can dredge up is this?

A biographical sketch of _MR._ Mark Carlotto's can be found here: 
http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MJCbio.html.  His work on the Face made the cover 
of "Applied Optics," he was a contributor to Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" series, 
etc. 

I wouldn't be recommending someone's work if I thought they weren't for real. 
 It may of interest that Carlotto has yet to write _anything_ proclaiming the 
Mars anomalies as "real."  He's simply taken vital, completely reproducable 
steps with the evidence we have in an attempt to arrive at a conclusion.  
I've always thought that was good science.

"...laughing my ass off" is the rest of the acronym.  We're not
ignoring the evidence, there just isn't any.  None.  Zero.  The
only thing going on here is that there's a rock on Mars that kinda
looks like a face.  So what?  I have a potato that kinda looks
like Jay Leno.  The originator of this nonsense is Richard Hoagland,
who richly deserves the "crackpot" title because he spent years
hawking this as a great discovery and spreading the "experts are
supressing the evidence" meme and other lunacy.  Of course Sagan
called for more research--he'd say anything to beg for more money.
But even he didn't take it seriously.

We'd all be thrilled with some real evidence of life on Mars, as
I'm sure many of us were with the discovery of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons in that meteorite last year.  /That's/ worth study.
A funny shaped rock is just a funny shaped rock.

down the road looking for a motel and you see a sign that says "relax
under the stars"  -- wouldn't you pull in?)  Obviously your customers
are everyone with a bedroom at home plus all the hotels, motels, bed&
breakfasts, resorts, etc., -- everywhere.

I know you want to hear about How You Make Money.  Here it is!
Your product cost per room is only $1.  You get $100 to $500 per room!
And with the companies' secret methods, you'll easily create the

>"...laughing my ass off" is the rest of the acronym.  We're not
>ignoring the evidence, there just isn't any.  None.  Zero.  

You're wrong.  The evidence is not even limited to the Face, and I consider 
the Face as evidence since it has some most unusual features that have yet to 
be accounted for geologically.  Plus, its extremely high degree of symmetry 
and orientation (a perfect match for at least four other really weird 
landforms in the same region--one of which looks like another face!) argue 
for a _possible_ non-natural origin.  No one's claimed that there is the word 
"ARTIFICIAL" engraved on the Cydonian sands, along with the Martian 
equivelent of the Pioneer plaque.  But there are some real oddities there, 
nonetheless--and how will we be able to live with ourselves intellectually if 
we ignore all of this because it's too "far out"?

>The only thing going on here is that there's a rock on Mars that kinda

This is old stuff.  What makes the Mars face unique from any known 
terrestrial landform is that it looks like a face from any viewpoint, whether 
from orbit or from the surface of Mars.  This implies, but does not prove, 
design.  All of the terrestrial analogs (Jesus in a tortilla, etc.) don't fit 
this criteria, and aren't really in the same league, as far as mysteries go.

>The originator of this nonsense is Richard Hoagland,

Hoagland is indeed a "crackpot"--at least by my definition.  He didn't used 
to be, but that's another matter.  But should science suffer because one of 
the original players went off the deep end?

Probably not.  Though since his endorsement appeared in "The Demon-Haunted 
World," I'm not sure money was a motivating factor.  He was simply interested 
in Mars (an understatement, to be sure) and realized that to deny a 
_testable_ hypothesis because it didn't fit neatly into the current paradigm 
was irresponsible.  Keep in mind that Sagan wasn't always so hostile to the 
idea of alien civilizations in Earth's proximity as he was in his later years.

You bet it is.

From: Christoph Wasshuber <wasshub@spdc.ti.com>

Let me put my two cents in this overclocking discussion.
Since I am working in silicon technology R&D I can give
you some insights from the fab. TI is not manufacturing
standard CPUs but we do quite good with fast DSPs, so
the experience should apply in general.

Overclocking will reduce the lifetime of your processor.
But since the lifetime of CMOS is very hard to control
precisely, that might be or might not be a problem. It is
very difficult because it changes from lot to
lot, meaning if you buy two processors at the same day
from the same distributor or vendor you might get two
totally differently behaving chips, with respect to lifetime.
The minimum lifetime of CMOS is somewhere around 10 years.
At least that is the target of manufacturing. But again that
is a statistical value, so most of the shipped chips do much better.
That means that even heavy overclocking should not realy
matter over the usual lifetime of a PC.

Going to finer and finer structures 0.18um, 0.13um means
that the production facilities are stressed to their
limits. Which means that variations become larger because
smaller transistors mean also more sensitivity to minor
process changes. Chips will have larger 
variations than in the past. So you can end up with a much 
better performing CPU than the specs tell you.

Stability is another issue. The best would be to write a program
which tests all possible signal combinations in the critical parts
of a processor. Running an application, no matter how
difficult it appears, is not a reliable general test. Of course,
if all you do is run one application it is enough to see if this
application runs stable. However, it is enough for one line of
assembly code to change, to let the CPU produce errors. Todays
CPUs are pretty sofisticated. So a simple black box test is
not reliable as a general test.

Nevertheless, I think overclocking is a smart way to get more 
for less.

Chris....

Im surprised there isnt more similarity between Swedish and Finnish.
Are they not of common origin, like English and German?  spike

Some finns I knew told me that their language is actually quite divergent
from other european languages, from the same area. Apparently its a little
island out on its own, and shares more structurally with some asian
languages than with those of its neigbours.

Anybody got more info than "some guy told me"?

Are there actually rules for how you are supposed to form acronyms? If so,

I looked over the agenda, and it looks a lot like "idiots predicting the
future".  Besides Nick Bostrom's talk, I only saw one seminar that
looked 
interesting, on nanotechnology.

I live in Maryland, and I could help.  I'd like to meet you guys at
least, so I'd like to attend.  However, to be frank, I'm a little put 
off by the cost.  I know this probably sounds slimy, but I'll ask it
anyway - if I sign up to help, do I still have to pay the registration
fee?  I *wouldn't* ask, except that there really only looks like one
talk (Nick's) that I'd be interested in attending.

I could man the booth.  I could certainly help designing flyers and
getting them copied and distributed.  My wife is a graphics artist,
and I could probably convince her to help.  It's short notice though,
so we'd have to get the information material ASAP.

I've looked into the face on mars nonesense in detail over the years
(I was at Case For Mars II in '84 when Richard Hoagland was first
popularizing it).

He's a crank.

He's nearly paranoid in his preposterous theories of NASA coverups.

His press releases are pure bunkum.

And you, sir, are going into the killfile.

Finnish is, along with Hungarian and Estonian, a member of the
Finno-Ugrian 
language family.  This puts the language in a wholly different category
to 
all their Indo-European neighbours.  Links with other asian languages
are
fairly tenuous, except for a number of extremely localised languages in
Siberia.

Ocean/lake waves do not get their energy from gravity. They get 
it from sustained winds or from earthquakes. Tides are caused by
gravity. Gravity may be necessary though for water wave formation
(something has to pull the water down when the wind pushes it up)
which is maybe what was being said.

Agreed!  Why can't you understand that acknowledging that an enigma exists on 
Mars is not in any way buying into the theories of a single nut?

Hoagland has done a lot of damage of late.  When the AP ran a piece about the 
Mars face last year, who did they interview?  Hoagland, of course...  It's a 
self-defeating cycle that demands fresh thought.  Hoagland is but one voice 
among many.  Do yourself a favor and listen to some of the others.

(Can anyone honestly pretend that a subject as potentially explosive as 
possible ET artifacts wouldn't attract crazies?  It comes with the territory.)

The challenge of creating computer-based human equivalent
intelligence/behavior is prime extropian subject matter.

              THE ATTACK OF THE INCREDIBLE GRADING
                                 MACHINE

                           BY CLIVE THOMPSON 

At or near:

http://www.linguafranca.com/

I've sometime suspected that, when eventually elaborated, the
self-congratulatory complexity and "sophistication" of human mechanisms of
cognition/consciousness would be found to arise out of humblingly
unsophisticated brute force computational capabilities of bulk assemblages
of neurons.

By the most fortunate accident, the researchers whose work is the subject
of the above article, may have stumbled upon--perhaps "reinvented"--a basic
mechanism of human linguistic ability--or something fruitfully close to
it--and by doing so brought us one large step closer to understanding the
basic, elegantly humble architecture of mind--one large step closer to
assembling the suite of "meta-neuronal" mechanisms that will eventually
lead to AI.

The beauty--the delicious irony of this for me--is that they achieved what
they did not by seeking complexity but, quite the contrary, by seeking--and
finding--a sort of moronically-simplistic, number-crunch,
statistical-database-sort-of blunt instrument.  I'm reminded of the ancient
shao-lin lesson:  "Imagine, grasshopper, the sound of one ego deflating." 

And of course the words of the bard:

"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in
faculty, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like
an angel, in apprehension how like a god-the beauty of the world, the
paragon of animals!"

Beneath the fleshy facade just a bundle of algorithms.  

Make that "the paragon of meat machines!"

Whoa -- maybe MLA or someone doesn't like embedded acronyms, but hackerdom is 
certainly fond of nested and even recursive ones, "Gnu's Not Unix" being a 
very familiar example (not only recursive but also false in all but a narrow 
legalistic sense). 

My favorite of all time was not nested, but self-referential: TLA for "Three-
Letter Abbreviation."

Enough usage also tends to make acronyms into words. A recent example set my 
teeth on edge: there was a poster announcing a social event at work, which 
contained "Please RSVP" (translates to "Please respond, please" -- the place 
runs on "AC current", too, I'll bet) and "we will need your RSVP by [date]."

Okay, it looks like a face however, I also see one on the moon, nothing to
that theory. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meteorite is
interesting, may point to something were not aware of yet. Perhaps order and
orgin  timelines of planets?
As far as the comments directed at close mindedness in opposition of our
high tech discussions, that's just it: preparing and educating oneself of
future technologies is not that same as assumptions regarding the face like
thing on mars.

The sensitivity of a system to initial conditions is expressed by the 
Lyapunov exponent. You can look at it (backwards) as a way of saying how 
finely you have to measure initial conditions to predict the state of the 
system at some future time. Even in "simple" systems like a driven pendulum, 
the divergence can be dramatic, and you can say that there is a time horizon 
T beyond which you would have needed subatomic precision at time 0 to predict 
the state of motion.

Basically, we're not living in Euclidean space (or in Kansas any more, Toto --
with apologies to any Kansans, or for that matter, Oz-phobes on the list :-).

Swedish (and English) are on the Germanic branch of the Indo-European
group of languages.  Finnish is part of the Ural-Altaic group, which has
no more primordial connection to Indo-European languages than, say,
Chinese does to Arabic.  The Ural-Altaic group includes Finnish,
Hungarian, and Turkish, and has its origin probably in the area of
Mongolia.  Indo-European may have originated in the Indus valley as much
as 20,000 years ago and thru accidents of history most of Europe,
including Russia and the Slavic countries, as well as Iran (Ariana in
ancient times), Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India speak Indo-European
languages today.


But since Finnish has been spoken for centuries in proximity to areas
which speak Indo-European languages, Finnish must have picked up some
words from neighboring languages, and vice versa, but I cannot give any
examples off the top of my head, except for 'sauna' which came to English
from Finnish.

I see, in the most part. I just don't get the most juicy bit. How was
Planck's constant arrived at and declared the limit of all detection and
computation, regardless of the system in question? Why is tracking the
momentum AND the position so difficult? Perhaps it is not regardless of the
system - are we talking specifically about molecular/atomic interactions
here? Also - is this (Planck's constant) an absolute upper tracking limit
(dubious), or does it concede that new, unknown technologies may provide the
key ? Do you? What about SI's ?

Cheers Ron,

Rob.

I fully understand this, cheers.....but, as I said to Ron Kean, my problem
was with the whole idea of a universally applicable uncertainty threshold,
which (I perceived) was presented as unbreakable - no matter what
measurement and tracking technology (even subatomic) was implemented.

Usually you hear heuristic explanations of the kind "you cannot see a
proton without bouncing a photon from it, and that changes its
momentum", but the real explanation is based on the math of quantum
mechanics. I think it has to do with that certain operators do not
commute with each other (AB isn't BA). Hopefully somebody more versed
in QM can give the correct explanation.

This is a rather firm limit - somehow I don't think even SIs can edit
the commutability of all operators...

Potentially, yes. The Celeron loses over the PII by having a smaller cache,
but gains because the cache runs at the full clock speed, whereas the PII's
cache runs at half the clock speed with a 32k(?) L1 cache running at the
chip's clock speed. As a result, on any program which uses a lot of tight
code, the Celeron will be at least as fast as the PII, because it can all
fit in the cache... but when you're accessing a lot of data or a lot of
different routines in the code, the PII drops from a 450MHz L1 cache to
the 225MHz L2 cache, whereas the Celeron drops from the 300MHz L1 cache
to 66MHz system memory. Obviously the PII takes the L2 performance hit
well before the Celeron takes the system memory performance hit, but when
the PII is running from L2 cache and the Celeron is running from system
memory the Celeron will be much, much slower.

Seti has a fairly large dataset, and it spends a lot of time in Windows
drawing the bars on the screen, so it's not surprising that a Celeron is
slower than a PII.

Cool. All hail Ron, the physics dude. 
BTW, You mention this naming convention inconsistency - I've noticed a lot
of this in science, it's bloody annoying. Consistency, if nothing else,
should be provided by the scientific community as a prerequisite, don't you
think? Makes sound inference possible.

English, German, Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, Persian, Hindi,

I'll take a shot.  The Uncertainty Principle is built right into the
theory, and it's an absolute limit, if QM is correct.  Just as the
speed of light is an absolute limit, if relativity is correct (an
important caveat).

According to basic QM, observables such as position and momentum are
transformed into "operators".  Particles are transformed into "wave
functions".  In order to predict the outcome of an experiment in 
which, say, position is to be measured, you apply the X operator to
the abstract wave function w, and you come up with a function w(x),
on the x (position) variable, that gives the probability of finding the 
particle at that point x.  Similarly, the momentum operator P, when
applied to w, would give a function w(p) which gives the probability
of finding the particle to have a given momentum p.

Now here's the tricky bit:  when you measure an observable, you
necessarily change the wave function.  Say I have a particle with
a wave function that is a nice bell shaped curve centered at the
origin.  QM says if I measure the position x, there is a range of
values that it can take, and there is no way for me to predict the
outcome of the experiment beforehand.  Let's say I measure the
position and come up with a value of 2.  *Now*, if I measure the
position again right away, QM says that I am guaranteed to get the
same value, 2.  The only way for that to have been possible is if
my original measurement changed the wave function, so that instead
of a nice bell shaped curve around the origin, it's now a sharp
spike centered at the point x = 2.

The reason I'm guaranteed to get the same result if I measure 
position again right away is that the X operator commutes with
itself.  That is, it doesn't matter which I do first: measure the
position, or measure the position (obviously, because they're 
both the same operation!)  But the X and P operators do not
commute.  That is, XP is not the same as PX.  The order of the
measurements matters.  This is defined by the "commutator", an
expression which defines this relation:
    XP - PX = i(hbar)
Compare this with the commutator of X with itself:
    XX - XX = 0

What this means is that if I measure the position and get a well
defined value, then my uncertainty about the momentum increases.
A nice analogy is the fourier transform of a sound.  For a sound,
you cannot simultaneously know exactly when the sound occurs, and
exactly what it's pitch is.  That's because the more well-defined
you make the pitch, the more spread out in time the sound must be.
Likewise, the more you try to pin down exactly when the sound
occurs, the less information you have to discern its pitch.
Taken to the extreme, if I nail down the time that a sound occurs
to be exactly t = 0, then I have "collapsed" the sound into an
impulse wave.  What is the "pitch" of an impulse wave?  Well, an
impulse wave contains all frequencies, in equal measure, from 
zero to infinity.  Thus the pitch would be completely undefined.

In textbooks they often show how the uncertaintly relations 
manifest themselves by describing attempts to measure the position
and momentum in quick succession.  And it turns out that no matter
how you arrange the experiment, measuring one automatically
affects your ability to measure the other.  Thus, for example,
to measure the position of an electron, you have to bounce a
photon off of it.  But to measure the position accurately, you
need to use a photon with a very small wavelength.  But the
smaller you make the wavelength, the higher is the photon's
energy, and when it hits the electron, it's going to affect
it's momentum in an unpredictable way.  But these are just
manifestations of the underlying theory, which says, 
unequivocally, that you cannot simultaneously know both 
observables.  The theoretical limit of this uncertainty is 
defined by Plank's constant, hbar.

The ontology of this phenomenon is still hotly debated.

Some cosmological theories, at least, require space itself to be 
quantized. Even if theory allows space to be continuous, the fact of 
having the Planck limit on measurement makes it so in practice.

The whole area of how QM affects the macro world is interesting 
and slippery -- as in Schrodinger's Cat.

There's a whole lot of good messy fun to be had figuring out the 
problems with measuring the motion of a macroscopic mass to 
angstrom precision, fun for which I don't have time right now :-) but 
all the answers will come back showing that if you want arbitrary 
precision, you're screwed. Whereas in a Euclidean plane or 3-
space, you can gleefully have any real numbers as coordinates, 
with no quantum fuzz.

Actually at http://www.linguafranca.com/9907/nwo.html

This is a technique for grading student essay papers which is supposedly
as accurate as professors' grades:

: But the technique Landauer came up with is an altogether different
: beast. His software completely ignores style, grammar, and syntax. In
: fact, it relies on none of the familiar rules of language at all. It
: concerns itself solely with the following question: Does the student's
: essay use words appropriate to the subject matter? To answer this
: question, Landauer's software performs a series of operations. First,
: it assembles a customized database of texts on the assigned topic. It
: measures the spatial relationships among all the words in these texts,
: noting where each word appears and which other words it is near.  The
: software then performs a similar analysis on the student essay. Finally,
: it compares the student essay with the texts in its database. The theory
: behind the method is this: For any given essay, good content is a function
: of using certain words in the vicinity of certain other words, and that
: accomplishment can be expressed numerically.
:
: It sounds too complicated (or too simple) to be any good, but Landauer
: and his team claim their program can crank out grades as accurately as
: any professor.

This has an obvious flaw.  The professor is checking for style, syntax,
and logic.  If students know that this program is going to check their
papers, all they need to do is to write something that produces the
right words in roughly the right positions, without regard to sentence
structure.

There have been "travesty generators" around for years which will take
a text and chop it up into words or phrases and output them at random.
The resulting mishmash almost sorta makes sense when you look at it a
piece at a time, but it is actually complete gibberish.  The text editor
Emacs has had for 20 years a function called dissociated-press which
does this.  My guess is that loading a couple of standard references no
the topic into your buffer and running dissociated-press will produce
something that passes these guys' test with flying colors, but which would
get a big fat F in an instant if a human looked at it.

The theory that ET is deliberately hiding from us is no theory at all because is
not provable. if they don't want us to find them we haven't a snowball's chance
in hell of doing so, besides I don't see why they'd think we were worth all that

Uhh.....in the same time position ? Surely if you take another reading at a
later time - no matter how small the timescale, we can expect a slight
change in the reading due to system progression...?
Alternatively - are you talking REALLY small time scales? I mean, viewing
the progression of time as a quantized sequential transition from one time
"position" to another, rather than an analogue, constant progression? If so,
and you are saying that the second reading is taken within the same time
chunk, then I follow you.

	What do you (everyone) think about this? It seems to me that the
obvious way to avoid the uncertainty principle is to use non-intrusive
methods of measurement. For instance, determining the composition of stars
by detecting photons from it. You can get all the photons you want without
actually affecting the star's composition - you could have a legion of
photon-munchers eating the photons as soon as they leave the star's surface,
and you wouldn't affect the star's composition in any way.
	Also, I don't buy the double measurement commutability thing. Surely
the critical factor involved in commutability in this case is whether the
first measurement affects the system. Well, whether you're measuring
position with a photon (which will alter the system by 1 photon of whatever
energy and velocity), THEN another position measurement, or position THEN
momentum, the disruption has occurred at the point of the original
measurement, making the nature of the intended secondary measurement
irrelevant - The system was already disrupted by the first measurement.
	I could be off track here due to my lack of understanding of wave
functions, and their properties and implications. What do you all think?

	Rob.

Yes, it is the fundamental absolute limit of observation according to
today's physics, not just a technological limitation.  But you are
welcome to regard it as dubious; skepticism is healthy.  You are right to
want those who claim it is the limit to back up their claim with an
explanation.

I have had discussions concerning Planck's constant with Keith Lynch,
physics expert.  You might want to ask him for an explanation by email at
kfl@clark.net, as he is much more knowledgeable than me on this subject. 
He has been quite helpful in answering physics questions, and he
maintains a large searchable archive of answers which he has given in the
past, which often makes it possible for him to answer questions without
much effort.  If you do send him a question, please try to make it
specific, and please cc me as I would like to read the question and the
response.   Some of the questions you have are the same as the ones I
had, so I have reproduced below an exchange which I had with kfl about
Planck's constant.  Please excuse the fact that it sounds somewhat
dis-jointed; it was cut and pasted from several messages.

'Action' is listed in the CRC Handbook, where it is indeed defined as
work times time.  But I'm having trouble picturing what it is apart from
its abstract dimensionality and why the word 'action' is appropriate to
describe it. 'Impulse', for example, which is force times time, is much
easier to understand.  But I find it confusing to imagine that one joule
acting or spread over one second is 1,000 times less 'action' than one
joule acting or spread over 1,000 seconds.  Perhaps you could give an
illustative example of 'action' which shows why it is a useful concept. 

Work and energy are both measured in joules.  But is there any difference
between work and energy?  Is not work in a strict sense mechanical energy
as opposed to any other kind of energy?

Would that be the h or h-bar version of Planck's constant?  Conceptually,

One answer is to regard action, not as energy times time, but as
energy divided by frequency.  The energy of a photon (or any other
quantum particle) is always Planck's constant of action times its
frequency.  So the action of a photon is always its energy divided by
its frequency, and is the same for all photons.  And for every other
quantum particle, too, since action only comes in multiples of
Planck's constant.

Another answer is that action is important because every system acts
to minimize its action.  For instance a photon, which has constant
energy, always takes a path of minimum time (Fermat's principle).  And
a thrown baseball that starts at one point and ends at another point
and starts with a particular amount of energy always takes the path
between those points which minimizes its total action.  Similarly with
planets in their orbits, and blades of grass bending in the wind.

Another answer is that whether action seems like a natural concept
depends almost entirely on how much you use the concept.  A century or
two ago, energy seemed a very unintuitive concept.  How can a piece of
coal, a voltaic battery, a charged capacitor, a twisted rubber band, a
spinning flywheel, and a waterfall have anything in common with each
other?

> Work and energy are both measured in joules.  But is there any

The distinction is mostly historical.  What a piece of coal, a voltaic
battery, etc, had in common was they all had the ability to cause
a force to be exerted through a distance, i.e. to do work.  Or at
least that's what seemed most important about energy when the main
applications were threshing grain, draining mines, hauling railroad
cars, and sawing wood.

If electricity had come first, perhaps energy would have been defined
as the ability to cause an electric current to flow against a voltage
for a period of time.

Whether work IS energy, or is something that energy can DO, is mostly
a matter of perspective.

Yes and no.  There are two Planck's constants, which differ by a ratio
of 2 pi.  The larger one is used with frequencies in Hz.  The smaller
and more natural one (often called h-bar) is used for everything else,
including frequencies measured in radians per second, which is actually
a more natural unit.

>> There is a "natural" system of units ...

> Would that be the h or h-bar version of Planck's constant?

H bar.

> Conceptually, how would Planck's constant be measured?

The simplest way is via the photoelectric effect.  Light of various
frequencies is shined on metal object in a vacuum.  The voltage which
has to be applied to block the flow of current across the vacuum
to another identical metal object (which is kept in darkness) is
measured.  Or rather the change in frequency is compared to the change
in voltage, so as to factor out the ionization energy of the metal.

It the voltage change for a particular frequency change is ten volts,
then the electrons are each given an extra ten electron volts of
energy by the extra energy associated with the higher frequency of
light.

Of course you then have to know how much energy an electron volt
really is.  It's the same fraction of a coulomb volt (yet another
synonym for joule or watt second) that the electron charge is of
a coulomb of charge.

So it remains to measure the charge on the electron.  This is done by
levitating tiny oil drops between two metal plates.  Let them fall for
a while with the plates both grounded, so that they sort themselves by
size (since larger ones fall faster).  Once you have a population of
oil drops that are the same size (and you can figure out what that
size is based on how fast they fall), apply a small voltage between
the plates.  Observe that the oil drops are now falling, not at the
same rate, nor at a continuum of different rates, but at several
distinct rates which differ by a fixed amount of speed.  Crank up the
voltage between the plates to the value where the drops that were
going the closest to the original speed (but not AT the original
speed) are stopped.  Those are droplets with one unit of charge, i.e.
that have one too many electrons (or one too few, depending on the
polarity of the plates).  The electrical force on them equals their
weight, which you know.  You know the electrical field strength --
it's simply the voltage difference between the plates divided by the
distance between the plates.  So it's easy to calculate what the
charge would have to be.

Finally, we need to know what frequency the light is.  To do that,
we measure its wavelength, and divide the speed of light into that.
To measure its wavelength, send it through a pair of closely spaced
holes, and measure the line spacing of the resulting diffraction
pattern.

There are completely different ways of measuring Planck's constant.
They give the same answer, within the precision of the measurement.

To me, how we can know things is just as interesting as the things we
know.  Especially when the numbers we learn are very small or very
large, and were learned a long time ago using primitive but ingenious
equipment.

For instance the speed of light, which was first measured in the
1600s, even though it's extremely fast, at least by 1600s standards.
Or the gravitational constant, which was first measured in the
1700s, by Cavendish who managed to detect and accurately measure the
incredibly tiny gravitational attraction between two cannonballs.
Or the half-life of particles which last less than a millionth of a
millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second.  Or the distance
to the edge of the observable universe.

Here in the US, we commonly use two measuring systems - metric and
'English' (inches and ounces, etc.).  I used to be annoyed by the failure
to settle on one system (preferably metric), but I have since decided to
stop worrying about it.  I realize that I can convert a measurement in
one system to the other using a calculator, and let it go at that.


The inconsistencies are mostly rooted in the historical development of
physics.  When people call something by a particular name for years, it's
hard to change.  Back in the 1960s there was a big worldwide push to
replace 'cycles per second' with 'hertz'.  Now, years later, that has
finally been successful.  But I think it is in large part because many
people who used to say 'cycles per second' have simply died, and been
replaced by others who were taught to say 'hertz'.


Every so often, physics tries to purge itself of inconsistency. 
Historical electromagnetic units, for example, come in several systems
which are unbelievably convoluted and confusing and which make the whole
subject difficult to understand.  Some years ago, the 'International
System of units' was devised.  It is called SI after its French initials.
 In the 1980s, the meter was redefined in terms of the speed of light,
whereas earlier it had been defined as a certain number of wavelengths of
a certain spectral line of Krypton 86.  The meter is now defined as the
distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 second.  That means we no longer
have to wonder what is the exact speed of light.  It is 299,792,458
meters per second, exactly, by definition.

>Ocean/lake waves do not get their energy from gravity. They get it from
>>sustained winds or from earthquakes.

The seismologists are interested in several kinds of waves,
acoustic waves, for which pressure is the restoring force, gravity waves,
for which buoyancy is the restoring force, and surface gravity waves.

Keeping track of all of these waves can get really complicated in objects
like stars. See: http://soi.stanford.edu/results/heliowhat.html

Now about gravitational waves, you may be interested in this:

THE DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
http://www.gravity.pd.uwa.edu.au/DetGW/DetGW.htm

The document exists in rtf format. The following is from there.

The idea about gravitational waves are that gravitational charges
exist analogous to electric charges. But the gravitational radiation
is very weak, and it will be observed far from the emitting
region. And because there is no physical way to distinguish between
the inertial and gravitational acceleration of a single test mass,
only relative accelerations ("tidal") between two or more
masses can be attributed to gravitational fields.

Also some other physical situations may produce detectable
gravitational radiation: asymmetric collapse of massive objects,
such as the formation of massive black holes from stellar collisions
and coalesence in globular clusters and in galactic nuclei.

Apparently they've tried this. They said most "travesties" failed because the
mix of "apparently unrelated" but actually important words (prepositions,
linkers, grammatical elements) was off. The programmer speculated that to
generate a good set of keywords, you seem to have to write a full proper essay.

For those who believe this, I urge you to read Philip Kitcher's _The Nature
of Mathematical Knowledge_, which defends an empirical view of mathematics.
I coreviewed along with Stephen Boydstun it in _Objectivity_ 1(6), but this
review essay is not as yet available on the web.

The types of surface waves on liquids are not named after where the
energy comes from, but after where the restoring force comes from.
There are two extreme types:

  Gravity waves (restoring force: gravity) in the limit of long
    wavelength
  Ripples (restoring force: surface tension) in the limit of short
    wavelength

For intermediate wavelengths both effects are important.

Neither of the above is the same as a gravitational wave, which is the
(so far undetected) oscillatory form of the gravitational field.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

A few weeks back Anders or someone suggested a great idea of creating
a personality test to determine where extropians and transhumanists of various
ilk stood on a wide variety of philosophical and practical issues. One thing that
seems obvious to me is that in reality there is a wide variety of opinions on what
transhumanism means to various people.  As time goes on, this opinion variance
continues to diversify and widen.  I think the post-human future will probably be the
equivalent of the cambrian explosion in terms of future diversity and evolutionary
pathways.  Wouldn't it be interesting to see what people most share your core
ideals and ethics?  Frankly, transhumanism is becoming increasingly too general
and vague in describing how we each feel about the future.  Perhaps its time to
subdivide transhumanism into various schools of thought?

Your opinions are encouraged.  Please feel free to submit your own ideas,
questions, and philosophical divides you see. Here are some of the bigger
variances I'm aware of.  I'll be the first to admit that these variances are not
either/or but may be on a scale of 1-10, with some people falling into the middle.

1) Advocating the *replacement* of humans by SI's   vs.  humans merging
symbiotically and/or becoming the SI's.  With people like Hans Moravec falling
into the former and Anders Sandberg in the latter.

2) Striving for increasing individuation in ones personal development   vs.  merging
with the great beyond (Borgism and/or Singularity).  (These may not necessarily
be at odds with each other).

3) Singularity or Bust   vs.  intentional plateuing at various stages of future
development to 'enjoy the roses' along the way.  With people like Eliezer of
the former and Iain Banks Culture fans in the latter.

4) The pursuit of pure hyper-rationality and elimination of all emotion   vs.
 the inclusion/imperative of hedonism, fun and other positive emotions as values in their own right.
 With someone like David Pearce and his 'Hedonistic Imperative' of the latter.

5) Rugged Individualism   vs.   Communitarianism and/or Altruism  (Extrosatva?).

Any others?

But creating words for things is itself the exercise of reason, and
"consistency" would be stagnant and uncreative.  Coining new words is
the very essence of research; but we cannot insist that new concepts
always be clearly marked with wholly new coinages, because recognition
of the association between new ideas and old also helps the process
of understanding.  /While/ they are being used, we should insist on
precise definition and demarcation when necessary (for example,
within a single paper, usage should be consistent).  But throughout
the field of study as a whole, it's not possible or desirable.

Fields of study evolve in parallel to the language used by them.
I am not a physicist, so I will have to pull examples from my
current field of study, poker.  If a student takes the time to
learn and understand what is meant by the terms "pot odds", "outs",
"overcards", "counterfeiting", "scare cards", "semi-bluff", and all
the others, ey would be well on eir way to a solid game.  Further,
ey would be able to follow the discussions in the field that build
new concepts with new terms like "ostensible outs" or "counterfeit
protection".  That's the very nature of study.  But it is inevitable
that some of these terms will collide, change their scope, be reused
in new contexts, merge, split, and do all manner of other confusing
things.  This is good; it means the field is alive and growing.
A "live" card has a very specific meaning in 7-stud, and a related
but different meaning in Texas hold'em--but that doesn't mean we
should use a new word for it, because they serve similar functions
and thinking of them as the same aids understanding.

Consistency is great in a single argument or piece of writing.
In a whole field of study, I don't see much use for it; indeed,
I think that curricula that strive for it are doing damage to
the minds of students by making them think that the fields are
settled and that there is general agreement on things.

Although we cannot sell anything, we could still have one copy of the

[explanation of the Uncertainty Principle]

Thanks, Ron!

That explanation reminded me of a lot of stuff I used to know :-)

It would be fair to say, I think, that getting around the HUP would be 
equivalent to finding a way to make a measurement without exchange of energy -
- something for nothing.  

// Note that before setting this bit one cannot assume what its state was
MentalModes.speculative = 1;

A lot of scientists, most famously Einstein, have wondered what's "behind" 
QM. Common sense is somewhat affronted by, as Old Al said, "God playing 
dice." So if some more general theory were proven true such that there really 
is a nice, comfortable, somewhat understandable deterministic mechanism 
underlying QM, I suppose there *could* be a consequence of that theory that 
would make the quantum world predictable.

I can't even begin to form an idea what that theory would look like; so this 
is a good warmup for the alien math thread :-)

For myself, I can handle the world being stranger than I can imagine. Lots of 
entertainment potential in the long run.

I'm just saying that there's no theoretical problem measuring the
position twice in a row, but there is a problem if you try to 
measure position and them momentum.

That's why I used the phrase "for example".  I was trying to show
how the theory manifests itself in one particular example of an
experimental setup.  

This is analogous to the question often asked by people not 
familiar with relativity, "Yeah, but *why* can't something go
faster than light?  What stops it?"  One might imagine a rocket
with a propulsion system that accelerates it for an indefinite
period of time.  What stops that rocket from accelerating past
the speed of light.  One explanation would be (and I don't
pretend this is the best one) that as the rocket goes faster,
it increases in mass, such that the same propulsive force 
accelerates it less.  The mass increases without limit as the
speed of light is approached, so it's never possible to actually
get up to that speed.

See?  The theory says something's impossible, and we find that
the experimental setups we contrive have behaviors which 
validate the theory.

I'm not sure "composition" has an uncertainty relation.

Yes, you should pick up a text on QM.  It's not that difficult, and it's
well worth learning, IMHO.  Think of the sound metaphor.  It's really
more than a metaphor, as QM describes particles by these functions, 
which are exactly analogous to a sound wave.  Non-commuting observables
are basically Fourier transforms of each other.  With a sound wave, you
can use either an pressure amplitude vs. time or an energy amplitude vs.
frequency function to get a complete description.  But YOU CANNOT devise
a wave that will give you an *exact* time of occurence and an exact
frequency for a given sound wave.

Good point -- and I think there's an option to turn that off, or rather a 
text-only version of the program, which would speed everyone up, but 
especially the Celeron. Since mine is running mostly when I'm not there, I 
shouldn't care much about the pretty graph.

I am just about to move into the top third of all SETI@home users, with only 
4 work units completed -- this says to me that a lot of people sign up and do 
0 or 1 and then drop out. We appear to have about 10 such people out of 40 on 
the ExI/>H team. Also, we have >half of our total results from the top 4 
members -- if any of them have stopped running, that would explain how the 
Mormons got ahead :-)

I'm not sure how current or accurate the stats are on the www site, either.

And, no, I don't think CHEERLEADING: will catch on as a topic prefix :-)

Really, this sounds like a brute-force attempt to do something
that has been part of Lenat's Cyc for a long time. Check out the
paper on contexts at http://www.cyc.com/public.html.

Great pithy quote from the Cyc site:

"When someone searches for 'Bolivia' on the Web, Cyc knows not to offer a 
follow-up question like 'Where can I get free Bolivia online?'"  

It's funny how the most interesting thing about IEA (the grading program)
is the schemes to beat it (OK, that's not really true, it's interesting to 
see how much a brute-force attempt can do, but it's not the AI breakthrough 
that that august journal, USA Today, thinks it is).

If the student knows there is little chance a human will check
the essays, then he could try submitting one of the papers from
the database. Of course, if a perfect match might be suspicious,
then a concatenation of parts of two or three papers would be
a better travesty.

Now off to finish reading the Cyc papers ...

Is there a near-term role for manned space stations?  I've just finished T.A. 
Heppenheimer's "Countdown: A History of Spaceflight."  One of the theses of 
this book is that the original vision of the first and second generation of 
space pioneers has been made irrelevant by the advance of electronics and 
computers.  He describes the story familiar to space enthusiasts of the 
original conception of a gradual "conquest of space" through the building of 
reusable spaceplanes, manned orbital space stations and eventual 
interplanetary exploration and development.  This vision, so compellingly 
portrayed by Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell in the 1952 Colliers Magazine 
series, was adopted as essentially an article of faith by the second 
generation of rocket and space pioneers, among them Arthur Clarke and Werner 
von Braun.  Heppenheimer makes the case that this vision has been handed down 
to subsequent generations of space technologists and policy makers as a plan 
of action that has been made at least partially irrelevant by the advance of 
electronics and automation.  For instance, he discusses how in the 1930s, 40s 
and 50s Clarke and others envisioned geosynchronous communication "stations" 
as being manned by astronautical switchboard operators, something that's 
obviously not necessary now.

I grew up with this same vision and recall the Bonestell paintings 
illustrating the Colliers articles as some of the most formative images of my 
youth.  The goal of building a permanently manned orbital platform as an 
important foundation of a program of space exploration and development is 
very deeply ingrained in my psyche.  The idea that there will soon be humans 
living off Earth all the time (if not yet "permanently") is one of the 
exciting prospects raised for me by the first few ISS missions.

Now, it seems true to me that having a constant human presence off Earth (if 
only barely so) has important positive social and cultural impacts.  But is 
there any economic rationale for it?  I find NASA's relatively vague 
pronouncements about microgravity research unconvincing.  For the near term, 
I can see ISS serving as a "construction shack" and repair base (the latter 
requiring a -- probably automated -- "tug" for retrieving satellites to be 
repaired) (such a tug could well be developed as a second-generation 
derivative of ESA's ATV vehicle being created as part of the ISS program; 
see: 

http://adex3.flycast.com/server/socket/127.0.0.1:2800/iframe/SpacerComdailyspa
cenews/SpaceLeader/600  )

Is this latter mission for ISS really viable in the time before, say, 2025 or 
so?  I know there's been quite a bit of talk lately about "space tourism", 
but I'm skeptical of this as a viable economic development within the next 25 
years (after a fairly advanced nanotechnology is developed, yes).  I'd be 
especially curious to hear the thoughts of younger folks who may well not be 
infected so strongly with the "space station meme".

 Dietary cholesterol has been associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular disease. However some studies have suprisingly not found
any risk associated with egg consumption.
 Data from (BMJ 300: 771-3 1990):

              Myocardial Infarction Relative risk
Consumption:  Low       Medium        High
Eggs           1          1.2          0.8
Meat           1          0.8          1.5
Carrots        1          0.5          0.4

 This unexpected result might derive from the strong cholesterol lowering
effects of egg white itself. (J Nutr Sci Vitaminol 42: 87-96 1996) As far
as lowering cardiovascular disease risk, it looks like egg whites are
right up there with arginine rich nut protein.

Legally, only US Citizens who are one or more of the following:

a) federal employees
b) federal benificiaries (loans, welfare, SSI, fed. retirement, etc)
c) officers of corporations
d) maintain accounts in federally insured financial institutions

are actually mandated by the federal tax code to pay income tax. All
others are not liable for tax, but can volunteer to pay. Under the new
Taxpayers Bill of Rights Act, since the burden of proof is now on the
taxman to prove you made $xxxxxx, moving business and financial
activities is an excellent practical way for you to shelter things.

As this is the root of your confusion. You make the same mistake that
many one language people do about words. They think that c-h-i-c-k-e-n
is obviously synonymous with the concept of a chicken that they get
really confused when asked to use the word pollo to represent the
concept of chicken. When we talk about math concepts being common
througout the universe, we do not mean that they will use the numerals
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0, or the functional symbols x,-,/,+ etc. We ourselves
have used, and continue to use several symbols for each funtion (i.e. we
can use x or . or * for multiplication), but our concept of
multiplication does not change when we use different symbols to
represent the concept.

Again, as I have said, we ourselves have come up with a number of
different systems, including several kinds of non-euclidian geometry.
That we continue to use the systems we do use is a result of the
physical properties of the universe, not the properties of our minds.

Hypothetical Question: Einstein is right, God does not play dice.  The
mechanism behind QM is not only deterministic but also (feasibly)
computable.  Would this mean a piece of software that used this new theory
could solve NP-complete problems on a conventional computer?

Since I actually have seen both the old and the new photos, I can
conclusively say that the rock formation does not in any way look like a
face when looked at in any kind of decent resolution, and only slightly
looks like one when viewed with the sun on the horizon, because the
other side of the face is not in view and our minds interpolate a
pattern.

having grown up in a state that is filled with landmarks that look like
a face (The Old Man of the Mountains, Indian Head, etc) I am much more
impressed with our homegrown natural stuff than martian mountains.

Yes it can. Cache is necessary because so many operations, functions,
and information used are repetetive, and having to go back to the RAM or
to the swap file adds immense amounts of dead time. Go cheap on your
chache and you are strangulating the processor.

Ah, you've put your finger on just why I have trouble believing in the determinism fairy
(deterministic QM). Randomness, like entropy, is opaque -- information or structure that is
dispersed isn't retrievable or reconstructible. 

Your implication seems quite sound to me, and it might be fun to tease out some of the
other consequences. There might even be a neat reductio ad absurdum nested in there (i.e., a
proof that QM cannot be contained in a deterministic theory). Then we'd know that to
violate the HUP or otherwise make QM deterministic, we have to violate one of the axioms said
proof requires -- that's assuming anyone still has an appetite for the problem.

I ought to take Max's advice and think about this post for three days or so, it's soooo
half-baked :-)

Wasn't it originally based on the distance from the north pole to the

The mormons seem to be running on a supercomputer of some kind. They
have few members, and one member has done over 1000 units so far.

I've only completed one unit, but I'm losing time because I'm getting a
bug that the program is looking for a text file and can't find it. This
is on my PII 233/64 machine at home, running the initial release of
Win95

The power of one


Everyday numbers obey a law so unexpected it is hard to believe it's
true.
Armed with this knowledge, says Robert Matthews, it's easy to catch
those
who have been faking research results or cooking the books.


ALEX HAD NO IDEA what dark little secret he was about to uncover when he
asked his brother-in-law to help him out with his term project. As an
accountancy student at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
Alex
[not the student's real name] needed some real-life commercial figures
to
work on, and his brother-in-law's hardware store seemed the obvious
place to
get them.

Trawling through the year's sales figures, Alex could find nothing
obviously
strange about them. Still, he did what he was supposed to do for his
project, and performed a bizarre little ritual requested by his
accountancy
professor, Mark Nigrini. He went through the sales figures and made a
note
of how many started with the digit 1. It came out at 93 per cent. He
handed
it in and thought no more about it.

Later, when Nigrini was marking the coursework, he took one look at that
figure and realized that an embarrassing situation was looming. His
suspicions hardened as he looked through the rest of Alex's analysis of
his
brother-in-law's accounts. None of the sales figures began with the
digits 2
through to 7, and there were just 4 beginning with the digit 8, and 21
with
9. After a few more checks, Nigrini was in no doubt: Alex's
brother-in-law
was a fraudster, systematically cooking the books to avoid the
attentions of
bank managers and tax inspectors.

It was a nice try. At first glance, the sales figures showed nothing
very
suspicious, with none of the sudden leaps or dives that often attract
the
attentions of the authorities. But that was just it: they were too
regular.
And this is why they fell foul of that ritual he had asked Alex to
perform.

Because what Nigrini knew--and Alex's brother-in-law clearly didn't--was
that the digits making up the shop's sales figures should have followed
a
mathematical rule discovered accidentally over 100 years ago. Known as
Benford's law, it is a rule obeyed by a stunning variety of phenomena,
from
stock market prices to census data to the heat capacities of chemicals.
Even
a ragbag of figures extracted from newspapers will obey the law's
demands
that around 30 per cent of the numbers will start with a 1, 18 per cent
with
a 2, right down to just 4.6 per cent starting with a 9.

It is a law so unexpected that at first many people simply refuse to
believe
it can be true. Indeed, only in the past few years has a really solid
mathematical explanation of its existence emerged. But after years of
being
regarded as a mathematical curiosity, Benford's law is now being eyed by
everyone from tax inspectors to computer designers--all of whom think it
could help them solve some tricky problems with astonishing ease. In two
weeks' time, the US Institute of Internal Auditors will begin holding
training courses on how to apply Benford's law in fraud investigations,
hailing it as the biggest advance in the field for years.

The story behind the law's discovery is every bit as weird as the law
itself. In 1881, the American astronomer Simon Newcomb penned a note to
the
American Journal of Mathematics about a strange quirk he'd noticed about
books of logarithms, then widely used by scientists performing
calculations.
The first pages of such books seemed to get grubby much faster than the
last
ones.

The obvious explanation was perplexing. For some reason, people did more
calculations involving numbers starting with 1 than 8 and 9. Newcomb
came up
with a little formula that matched the pattern of use pretty well:
nature
seems to have a penchant for arranging numbers so that the proportion
beginning with the digit D is equal to log10 of 1 + (1/D) (see "Here,
there
and everywhere" below).

With no very convincing argument for why the formula should work,
Newcomb's
paper failed to arouse any interest, and the Grubby Pages Effect was
forgotten for over half a century. But in 1938, a physicist with the
General
Electric Company in the US, Frank Benford, rediscovered the effect and
came
up with the same law as Newcomb. But Benford went much further. Using
more
than 20 000 numbers culled from everything from listings of the drainage
areas of rivers to numbers appearing in old magazine articles, Benford
showed that they all followed the same basic law: around 30 per cent
began
with the digit 1, 18 per cent with 2 and so on.

Like Newcomb, Benford did not have any really good explanation for the
existence of the law. Even so, the sheer wealth of evidence he provided
to
demonstrate its reality and ubiquity has led to his name being linked
with
the law ever since.

It was nearly a quarter of a century before anyone came up with a
plausible
answer to the central question: why on earth should the law apply to so
many
different sources of numbers? The first big step came in 1961 with some
neat
lateral thinking by Roger Pinkham, a mathematician then at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Just suppose, said Pinkham,
there
really is a universal law governing the digits of numbers that describe
natural phenomena such as the drainage areas of rivers and the
properties of
chemicals. Then any such law must work regardless of what units are
used.
Even the inhabitants of the Planet Zob, who measure area in grondekis,
must
find exactly the same distribution of digits in drainage areas as we do,
using hectares. But how is this possible, if there are 87.331 hectares
to
the grondeki?

The answer, said Pinkham, lies in ensuring that the distribution of
digits
is unaffected by changes of units. Suppose you know the drainage area in
hectares for a million different rivers. Translating each of these
values
into grondekis will change the individual numbers, certainly. But
overall,
the distribution of numbers would still have the same pattern as before.
This is a property known as "scale invariance".

Pinkham showed mathematically that Benford's law is indeed
scale-invariant.
Crucially, however, he also showed that Benford's law is the only way to
distribute digits that has this property. In other words, any "law" of
digit
frequency with pretensions of universality has no choice but to be
Benford's
law.

Pinkham's work gave a major boost to the credibility of the law, and
prompted others to start taking it seriously and thinking up possible
applications. But a key question remained: just what kinds of numbers
could
be expected to follow Benford's law? Two rules of thumb quickly emerged.
For
a start, the sample of numbers should be big enough to give the
predicted
proportions a chance to assert themselves. Second, the numbers should be
free of artificial limits, and allowed to take pretty much any value
they
please. It is clearly pointless expecting, say, the prices of 10
different
types of beer to conform to Benford's law. Not only is the sample too
small,
but--more importantly--the prices are forced to stay within a fixed,
narrow
range by market forces.

Random numbers

On the other hand, truly random numbers won't conform to Benford's law
either: the proportions of leading digits in such numbers are, by
definition, equal. Benford's Law applies to numbers occupying the
"middle
ground" between the rigidly constrained and the utterly unfettered.

Precisely what this means remained a mystery until just three years ago,
when mathematician Theodore Hill of Georgia Institute of Technology in
Atlanta uncovered what appears to be the true origin of Benford's law.
It
comes, he realized, from the various ways that different kinds of
measurements tend to spread themselves. Ultimately, everything we can
measure in the Universe is the outcome of some process or other: the
random
jolts of atoms, say, or the exigencies of genetics. Mathematicians have
long
known that the spread of values for each of these follows some basic
mathematical rule. The heights of bank managers, say, follow the
bell-shaped
Gaussian curve, daily temperatures rise and fall in a wave-like pattern,
while the strength and frequency of earthquakes are linked by a
logarithmic
law.

Now imagine grabbing random handfuls of data from a hotchpotch of such
distributions. Hill proved that as you grab ever more of such numbers,
the
digits of these numbers will conform ever closer to a single, very
specific
law. This law is a kind of ultimate distribution, the "Distribution of
Distributions". And he showed that its mathematical form is...Benford's
Law.

Hill's theorem, published in 1996, seems finally to explain the
astonishing
ubiquity of Benford's law. For while numbers describing some phenomena
are
under the control of a single distribution such as the bell curve, many
more--describing everything from census data to stock market prices--are
dictated by a random mix of all kinds of distributions. If Hill's
theorem is
correct, this means that the digits of these data should follow
Benford's
law. And, as Benford's own monumental study and many others have showed,
they really do.

Mark Nigrini, Alex's former project supervisor and now a professor of
accountancy at the Southern Methodist University, Dallas, sees Hill's
theorem as a crucial breakthrough: "It . . . helps explain why the
significant-digit phenomenon appears in so many contexts."

It has also helped Nigrini to convince others that Benford's law is much
more than just a bit of mathematical frivolity. Over the past few years,
Nigrini has become the driving force behind a far from frivolous use of
the
law: fraud detection.

In a ground-breaking doctoral thesis published in 1992, Nigrini showed
that
many key features of accounts, from sales figures to expenses claims,
follow
Benford's law--and that deviations from the law can be quickly detected
using standard statistical tests. Nigrini calls the fraud-busting
technique
"digital analysis", and its successes are starting to attract interest
in
the corporate world and beyond.

Some of the earliest cases--including the sharp practices of Alex's
store-keeping brother-in-law--emerged from student projects set up by
Nigrini. But soon he was using digital analysis to unmask much bigger
frauds. One recent case involved an American leisure and travel company
with
a nationwide chain of motels. Using digital analysis, the company's
audit
director discovered something odd about the claims being made by the
supervisor of the company's healthcare department. "The first two digits
of
the healthcare payments were checked for conformity to Benford's law,
and
this revealed a spike in numbers beginning with the digits '65'," says
Nigrini. "An audit showed 13 fraudulent checks for between $6500 and
$6599...related to fraudulent heart surgery claims processed by the
supervisor, with the check ending up in her hands."

Benford's law had caught the supervisor out, despite her best efforts to
make the claims look plausible. "She carefully chose to make claims for
employees at motels with a higher than normal number of older
employees,"
says Nigrini. "The analysis also uncovered other fraudulent claims worth
around $1 million in total."

Not surprisingly, big businesses and central governments are now also
starting to take Benford's law seriously. "Digital analysis is being
used by
listed companies, large private companies, professional firms and
government
agencies in the US and Europe--and by one of the world's biggest audit
firms," says Nigrini.

Warning signs

The technique is also attracting interest from those hunting for other
kinds
of fraud. At the International Institute for Drug Development in
Brussels,
Mark Buyse and his colleagues believe Benford's law could reveal
suspicious
data in clinical trials, while a number of university researchers have
contacted Nigrini to find out if digital analysis could help reveal
fraud in
laboratory notebooks.

Inevitably, the increasing use of digital analysis will lead to greater
awareness of its power by fraudsters. But according to Nigrini, that
knowledge won't do them much good--apart from warning them off: "The
problem
for fraudsters is that they have no idea what the whole picture looks
like
until all the data are in," says Nigrini. "Frauds usually involve just a
part of a data set, but the fraudsters don't know how that set will be
analyzed: by quarter, say, or department, or by region. Ensuring the
fraud
always complies with Benford's Law is going to be tough--and most
fraudsters
aren't rocket scientists."

In any case, says Nigrini, there is more to Benford's law than tracking
down
fraudsters. Take the data explosion that threatens to overwhelm computer
data storage technology. Mathematician Peter Schatte at the Bergakademie
Technical University, Freiberg, has come up with rules that optimize
computer data storage, by allocating disk space according to the
proportions
dictated by Benford's law.

Ted Hill at Georgia Tech thinks that the ubiquity of Benford's law could
also prove useful to those such as Treasury forecasters and demographers
who
need a simple "reality check" for their mathematical models. "Nigrini
showed
recently that the populations of the 3000-plus counties in the US are
very
close to Benford's law," says Hill. "That suggests it could be a test
for
models which predict future populations--if the figures predicted are
not
close to Benford, then rethink the model."

Both Nigrini and Hill stress that Benford's law is not a panacea for
fraud-busters or the world's data-crunching ills. Deviations from the
law's
predictions can be caused by nothing more nefarious than people rounding
numbers up or down, for example. And both accept that there is plenty of
scope for making a hash of applying it to real-life situations: "Every
mathematical theorem or statistical test can be misused--that does not
worry
me," says Hill.

But they share a sense that there are some really clever uses of
Benford's
law still waiting to be dreamt up. Says Hill: "For me the law is a prime
example of a mathematical idea which is a surprise to everyone--even the
experts."

Here, there and everywhere

NATURE'S PREFERENCES for certain numbers and sequences has long
fascinated
mathematicians. The so-called Golden Mean-- roughly equal to 1.62 and
supposedly giving the most aesthetically pleasing dimensions for
rectangles--has been found lurking in all kinds of places, from
seashells to
knots, while the Fibonacci sequence--1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on, every
figure being the sum of its two predecessors--crops up everywhere in
nature,
from the arrangement of leaves on plants to the pattern on pineapple
skins.
Benford's law appears to be another fundamental feature of the
mathematical
universe, with the proportion of numbers starting with the digit D given
by
log10 of 1 + (1/D). In other words, around 100 x log2 (30 per cent) of
such
numbers will begin with "1"; 100 x log1.5 (17.6 per cent) with "2"; down
to
100 x log1.11 (4.6 per cent) with "9". But the mathematics of Benford's
law
goes further, predicting the proportion of digits in the rest of the
numbers
as well. For example, the law predicts that "0" is the most likely
second
digit--accounting for around 12 per cent of all second digits--while 9
is
the least likely, at 8.5 per cent. Benford's law thus suggests that the
most
common non-random numbers are those starting with "10...", which should
be
almost 10 times more abundant than the least likely, which will be those
starting "99...". As one might expect, Benford's law predicts that the
relative proportions of 1, 2, 3 and so on making up later digits of
numbers
become progressively more even, tending towards precisely 10 per cent
for
the least significant digit of every large number. In a nice little
twist,
it turns out that the Fibonacci sequence, the Golden Mean and Benford's
law
are all linked. The ratio of successive terms in a Fibonacci sequence
tend
toward the golden mean, while the digits of all the numbers making up
the
Fibonacci sequence tend to conform to Benford's law.

Plane Carrying JFK Jr., Wife Missing
Coast Guard Retrieves
Debris Including Luggage

By David Ruppe
ABCNEWS.com
July 17 A plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister to
Marthas Vineyard is missing today, as the Coast Guard reports recovering
debris just off the Massachusetts island.

Timeline of Events

Friday, 8:45 p.m.: Plane takes off from Caldwell, N.J.

9:39 p.m.: Last radio contact.

10:00 p.m.: Projected arrival time.

Saturday, 2:15 a.m.: Emergency beacon signal received.

Saturday, dawn: Rescue teams begin search.

7:00 a.m.: President Clinton informed of missing plane.

Saturday, after 2 p.m.: Coast Guard reports finding debris.

 Kennedy was traveling with his wife Carolyn Bessette and her sister Lauren
Bessette. They were headed for the wedding of a cousin, Rory Kennedy,
daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannisport, Mass.
     A Coast Guard official said searchers found pieces of luggage, a head
rest and some carpeting. The Coast Guard has identified the owner of the
luggage, and said that it belonged to someone on the plane, but would not
say who.
     A massive search operation continues, involving the Federal Aviation
Administration and aircraft and boats from the Coast Guard, Air Force
National Guard, the Civilian Air Patrol from five states and other local
authorities.

The plane took off last night around 8:30 p.m. from Caldwell, N.J. An
official at the Marthas Vineyard Airport said this morning Kennedy plane
never arrived. One search is under way near Mattituck, N.Y. (ABCNEWS.com /
Magellan Geographix)

 We have every available boat searching, said Coast Guard spokesman Brent
Erb.
     Sources tell ABCNEWS that at one point radar showed the plane at 2,200
feet, but 12 seconds later, it was at 1,300 feet  indicating the plane
might have been in a dive.
     The type of plane missing, a one-propeller, Piper Saratoga II, is
capable of gliding safely to a landing in the event of engine failure.
     Just like everyone else, I am praying as hard as I can , attorney
Kevin Callahan, a former aide to Sen. Ted Kennedy, told ABCNEWS.com this
morning. At the compound, the family just got through with a Mass and
saying their prayers that John will be found and will be safe.
Possible Debris
The Coast Guards search is centering on waters off the west coast of Martha
s Vineyard.
     However, the search also included the north and south shorelines of
Long Island, waters surrounding the island and along the presumed flight
path up to Cape Cod, and out into the Atlantic Ocean.
     Kennedy did not file a flight plan, though he was not required to.
     President Clinton was told of the situation this morning by Chief of
Staff John Podesta and has spoken to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Kennedy
s sister Caroline.

Reported Missing
The plane took off last night around 8:30 p.m. from Caldwell, N.J. An
official at the Vineyard Haven airport on Marthas Vineyard said this
morning it never arrived.
     The family contacted the FAA to report the aircraft missing around 2
a.m. and the agency began checking airports along the route, sources say.
     The Coast Guard said the FAA alerted them around 3 a.m. The search
began at dawn.

The Search
Coast Guard officials say a beacon may have been detected by a satellite
sometime in the early morning, but are not sure it came from Kennedys
aircraft.
     The signal was detected west of Marthas Vineyard, Mass., somewhere
between the eastern tip of Long Island and New London, Conn.,  which
presumably would have been along the aircrafts flight path.

Debris was found off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. (ABCNEWS.com / Magellan
Geographix)

 No signal, however, since has been detected by the Coast Guard or other
search parties, according to Coast Guard spokesman Cmdr. Mike Lapinski.
     Experts say the beacon could continue to signal even if the aircraft
was submerged, though it would be weaker in deeper water. The beacon is
designed to float.
     A Coast Guard jet has been searching Long Island Sound and the north
and south shorelines of Long Island, Lapinski said, and two Coast Guard
helicopters have been searching the waters near Marthas Vineyard. An Air
Force HC-130 jet is providing command and control operations for the various
aircraft participating in the search.
     Officials say a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
ship carrying sophisticated sonar for scanning the bottom of the ocean is on
standby.

      A Piper Saratoga II TC, similar to the one believed to be carrying
Kennedy and three other people.
Kennedy and his wife planned to stop at Marthas Vineyard to drop off her
sister, Lauren, before continuing to Hyannisport.
     Kennedy recently earned a pilots license. According to one source
familiar with his new interest in flying, Kennedy has already flown to
Marthas Vineyard. He broke his ankle last month, but it was not immediately
clear whether that would have any effect on his ability to fly the plane, if
he was in fact the pilot.

The way I heard it was that people found that the old books of logarithm
tables got dirty fastest on the first pages.  This is because more
numbers that people measured in the real world started with 1 than
with 9.  Generally, they are distributed evenly by logarithm, not by
arithmetic value.

Greg, as sad as it sounds, it may be our generation only that is turned on
by the space station meme.  I have yet to find a person under 25 that is
all that excited by it.  Perhaps the low earth orbitting station is an idea
whose time is passed.  You and I grew up with the same pictures in
the encyclopedia, the same books no doubt.  I recall seeing the first
moon landing as an 8 yr old, and thinking how wicked cool is this whole
adventure.  But I have seen some of the younger crowd, Eliezer for instance,
diss the whole thing.

My view is this: even if we get nanotechnology and tinkerbellize ourselves, sooner

or later, we will convert this whole planet, then this solar system into
tinkerbellized
transhumans and supporting infrastructure.  Sooner or later, we *must* go
out there.  This is why I am so interested in SETI@home, just so I can
estimate what kinds of challenges face us, or future transhumans.  spike

It would be sure interesting to know how many air miles the 
average Kennedy makes during a year. Cursed? Cursed with enough 
wealth to consider a Lear Jet (or, heavensforbid, a helicopter) 
a normal mode of transportation, perhaps.

I'm curious: have any of you who are into heavy consulting-related 
travelling have aver assessed the increased risks numerically?

A few weeks ago, the question came up about choosing mates
for physical attractiveness or mental ability.  The comment was
made that women choose differently depending on where they
are in their fertility cycle.  During the nonfertile period, women
gravitate toward the nerdy, stable, brainy guy, but during ovulation
they crave the handsome rogue with the protruding buttocks.

An idea occurred to me: assuming the above theory is correct
(ladies, please comment if you wish to reopen this discussion)
and further theorizing no societal intervention or controls of
any kind, then the stable nerds would end up with most of the
sex (since the females would be infertile most of the time) and
yet most of the offspring would, oddly enough, resemble the
handsome rogue.  Correct?  Since our society has invented
marriage, which makes it less convenient (at least) for the
women to visit Mr. Buns during the fertile few days, it seems
that societal restraints would serve to tilt the scales back in
favor of Mr. Brains.  Right?  Does this explain why humans
are getting more intelligent over the past few millenia?  spike

The "missing half" you refer to is a problem; it was in shadow when Viking 
photographed it, and the Global Surveyor took a really aggravating angle shot 
that leaves some up to our imaginations.  But I'd argue that the salient 
facial features are there, all right, just obscured by erosion.  One 
compelling thing that was discovered about the new image is that the 
centerline crosses directly between the "crown" features, as well as between 
the nostrils.  The "lips" (which actually do look like human lips, and appear 
bisymmetric) have an interesting centerline feature geologists are calling a 
"hairlip."  This feature is in the exact center as well.

I was frustrated with the original enhanced version of the new Face picture 
and absolutely appalled by the image released to the media, since it hadn't 
been subjected to any processing to speak of.  Also, NASA's final version was 
"orthorectified"--a perfectly legitimate procedure when mapping a planetary 
surface, but didn't make much sense re the Face because the Face had been 
photographed at a near 45 degree angle!  The result is the Picasso-esque 
looking thing that's finding its way into books on the subject, and probably 
what you're referring to.  So I agree with you that the facial resemblance, 
on this particular "enhancement," at least, is dubious at best.

Mark Carlotto enhanced the original "catbox" image, and the result is a much 
more honest view of what the Face looked like to the MGS.  It's definitely 
more facelike.  The right-hand side is obviously degraded, but retains the 
ruler-straight border seen on the left-hand portion of the so-called 
"headdress."  I'm not yet willing to discount it, given that new analysis has 
shown that the left eye socket is an actual feature, not an aberrant shadow.  
It's even got a pupil--and _all_ the features--nostrils, lips, chin, 
etc.--match classical humanoid proportions to a tee.

What we need before this sort of discussion can achieve anything is an 
_overhead_ shot, preferably with a high sun-angle.  As far as shadows go, _of 
course_ the Face (if artificial) relies on shadows!  That's the nature of 
sculptures, and the Face dwarfs even Earth's biggest megaliths by a huge 
factor.  And it's almost certainly much, much older, so the more we can learn 
about Martian weathering, the more we can ascertain whether the apparent 
degradation we see is accountable by erosion, mass wasting, vulcanism, etc.  

The only coherent skeptical theory explaining the nostril features, for 
example, is hydrothermal activity.  But they're so precisely positioned in 
relation to other facial details (and to each other) that it gives one pause.

I'm perfectly willing to "face" the fact that the Face is a naturally 
occurring landform.  But I don't think we have enough evidence at this point 
to make any sort of final decision.  The issue is too potentially important 
to write off just because we've got some mountains on Earth that possess 
transient, sun-angle dependent facial resemblances.

Lastly, Nanogirl posted on this thread commenting that this topic didn't 
really belong on an extropian mailing list.  I disagree.  ETI is a big issue, 
here.  I understand that the Mars Face tack isn't popular, but it's a 
completely disprovable matter, and belongs in the speculative arena along 
with everything else, provided one can make a coherent case for it.  I'm not 
out to change anyone's minds on this one, but I think it can be demonstrated 
that the Face and its attendant landforms are _extremely unusual_ and _might_ 
represent the evidence we're after.

I think the impetus of expansion into space should be driven by
autonomous, partial- or full-closure autoreplicators, whether macro
(minimechanics and MEMS) or nano (drextech). For this, manned 
spaceflight is but a distraction, and a possible resource drain.

What is necessary is cheap delivery to LEO, which is primarily pushed
by conventional satellite industry, and parallel terrestrial research
in space simulators for the development of lunar and asteroid
industrial processes. This might eventually require microgravity
experiments, but this is nothing that cannot be handled by
automation/unmanned flight. I realize that the state of the art in
automation/robotics is not exactly awe-inspiring, but this should not
be glossed over by relying on monkey power. If there are deficits,
let's address them now, since we *will* have to deal with them later.

After the transport structure and habitats are constructed the humans
could follow (if there are still any around, that is).

Imho, manned spaceflight is only tolerable as long as it advances the
state of the art/mobilizes the resources otherwise wasted elsewhere.

If this sounds like pompous foolishness, I'd like to hear
counterarguments.

I rhink that statistically, the time you spend in the air is
safer than time spent in a car. If this is correct, then air
travel is only dangerous to the extent that it causes extra
car travel to and from the airport. Of course, the super-rich
are more likely to employ professional drivers, and statistically
the professionals are safer per mile than non-professionals.
Please note: statistics don't tell the whole tale as we all know.

I am aware of that. Personal decisions matter a lot, and always will.
What is interesting is how few people handle dangers rationally (I
personally do not, but at least do not claim to do so).

Just thought I'd relay something I saw on TV...
(some kind of educational show, don't remember other
than that.)

You have a laser, pointing at a wall. (little dot on
wall) Presumably, all the photons are going in the
same direction. You take two objects (I think maybe
razor blades) And start to block the beam with them,
one on each side. (forming a vertical slit, making the
dot smaller) when they get _really close together_
instead of a very slotted vertical dot, you get a
horizontal spread. The explanation was that the fact
that you 'knew the position' of the photons so
accurately (because of the very narrow slit) you
_could not_ know their velocity. (and hence direction)
I figured (I think correctly) that the spread was just
horizontal (it was still as tall as the diameter of
the laser beam) because you only 'knew' the horizontal
position accurately.
I don't know if it was real or not, or if the effect
was actually because of QM, but I decided I didn't
want to think about QM for a few months because I
might hurt something, or scare myself. (Photons should
NOT be that smart)

Yup, photons do behave strangely.  In college I was
shown the famous double slit experiment, wherein a
laser forms a horizontal spread, as you called it.  You
can send photons through double slits, and form
a pattern of high and low illumination on the wall behind.
This is explained by wave interference.  But now you
can turn the power to the laser so low, that the photons
pass through *one at a time*.  If you do that, you can
observe that the pattern does not go away.  Therefore, each
photon must be somehow splitting into a wave, waving
through *both* slits, interfering with *itself*, creating
the interference pattern on the back wall.  QM is weird
stuff, James.  spike

David Deutsch has used wave-particle duality to justify the Many Worlds 
Interpretation.  In fact, he claims he's proved it, and after reading his 
book "The Fabric of Reality" I concur.

I don't think this is foolish, but I think the build-now-inhabit-later 
scenario could prove limiting.  I perceive space migration as a vital step in 
human survival, and the faster we can migrate, the better.  Plus, the 
abundance of resources in space (once we start exploring in earnest) will 
help stimulate the very technologies that will allow for the kind of 
transhumanist habitat you envision.  I think sending ourselves into space, 
cumbersome meat and all, will ultimately accelerate our transition from 
biological to postbioligical...and I wonder at the possibilities of nanotech 
in microgravity!

(I'm half done with Stephen Baxter's "Titan," which gives one of many 
reasoned perspectives on the manned/unmanned controversy.)

Well, I'm no longer part of the 25 and younger crowd, but do think there is lots of
enthusiasm for space.  One example is www.seds.org, founded and run by students.

As far as space station goes, supposedly microgravity is good for growing pure
crystals and whatnot, the tradeoff is pure crystal in expensive microgravity vs. more
impure crystals in free 1g.

It's good to have a human presence in space, if only in orbit, as it teaches us how
the human physiology reacts to this.  Mir probably yielded a wealth of information
about this, being that it was the satellite where humans have spent the most time in
space, if I am not mistaken.

I am encouraged by Freedom, the joint venture space station.  Now it is called
"International Space Station."  http://shuttle.nasa.gov/station/index.html

It was on this list that someone is discussing planetary formations on planets in this
solar system besides Earth that appeared manufactured.  I know that on some stitched
images I have seen of all the planets and moons some have areas that are not seen.

Nanotechnology is coming, it's just an extension of the rapid pace of
microminiaturization in general.  I say that knowing somewhat the unique properties
afforded by molecular scale assembly.

Back to the subject of this thread, maybe the most economic imperative of manned space
is to enable the next level of manned space, where when due to Malthusian pressure or
hopefully blatant curiousity humanity must expand its sphere to space, and learn to
live in hostile or vacuum environments.  Humanity does pretty well on the planet,
inhabiting arctic deserts to equatorial jungles with a pleasing variety within the
species.  It seems only natural that within some time, maybe hundreds of years, there
will be self-sustaining pockets of humanity on Mars and beyond.

For all there various life-support requirements, more so than any robot, humans are
much more flexible in terms of retasking or action in the face of uncertainty.  We
hope the Space Station is the bed of a large variety of possible projects, and a team
of robot arms most likely would not be sufficient.  To the extent that they are, there
should be an unmanned complement to any manned presence.

Someday, the first human baby will be born off the planet.  In the mean time, we have
some kind of racial imperative to expand our base of population beyond the planet.
The first small steps we have seen over these last forty or fifty years, with man
going to the orbit around this Earth, and several times to its satellite, are just
that.  We have sent our robotic minions to the other planets in our solar system.  We
have even broadcast a radio beacon into the sky towards stars far away, however wise
or not this might be.

We look for others.  Since time immemorial when the stars were campfires in the sky of
others, to the expanding realism of Galileo and Kepler, to today's Hubble and Arecibo,
man has always kept an eye to the sky.  We listen to the background radiation, hoping
or not to find some other intelligence.  According to the Drake Equation, the chance
of an ET intelligence is not so small, but then again, we know not how large it is,
and can not say definitively whether or not there is.

What we do have is a body of recent literature about humans and humans issues in the
future.  "Science fiction", it is called, or sometimes "speculative fiction."
Anyways, about ETI's, when we find them, we can ask them about quantum mechanics.
That is, if at that point the ETI is developed enough to consider us aliens as
anything other than magical.  It's interesting to consider us as the most advanced
race in the galaxy.

About this wave-particle duality of nature and Feynmann diagrams about them, I know
little, but am glad that above the molecular level it seems quite deterministic.
Beneath that it is being probabilistic cloud.

Space Station?  It's good.  To look at the federal expenditures of tax dollars, I am
thinking there are other things that could be eliminated long before it.

Well, that is my missive at this time.  Buongiorno!  Pax,

Ross

I'm 23 and ecstatic about the possibilities, but absolutely sick of the 
reality of it, and our repeated blown opportunities.  This is one of the 
reasons I'm on this list.  

Yo have to admit that it's rather difficult to get excited about the Space 
Shuttle.  It's been going up and down for years and years and there's 
amazingly little to show for it.  It's NASA's job to restrict access to 
space, not open the door to it; the Shuttle, as a design and as a concept, is 
increasingly inefficient.  What's fascinating is that there's no real reason 
we couldn't be going beyond Earth orbit with it after some retrofitting.  To 
my mind, a retrofitted Shuttle would make an ideal vehicle for shipping 
hardware to the Moon for, say, a permament base.

Maintaining interest in space is goping to be difficult when the most 
"historic" space venture in recent memory is flinging John Glenn back into 
orbit in a completely transparent PR gesture...school kids are supposed to 
relate to this?  Give me a break.

Spike,

Maybe you can help me here.  I was trying to remember the other QM demo
from college physics in which the beam is passed through a slit or pair
of slits that are vertical, thus screening out all the side to side
waves or particles, then through a slit or pair of slits turned 90
degrees .......and then it all gets foggy in my mind.  If I remember
right it ends up that the particles still have the same intensity as if
they had never passed through the first slits, etc.

Anyone who can jog my memory on this, or the name of the demo would be
much appreciated.

I know we've got real rocket scientists here (I only play one on my 
computer), but I don't think this is right.  Why carry WINGS (and reentry 
tiles) to the moon?  (Even though that was an image I saw often enough in the 
science fiction art of my earliest youth -- on the covers of paperbacks that 
were already yellowing then.)  Which is not to say that the shuttle cargo bay 
isn't plenty large enough to carry a reusable translunar tug and an 
associated lander . . .

There is nothing left to do down here except go up there.

The exploration and colonisation of space is not an economic worry but the
reason we have an economy.

This what we do, everything else is peripheral.

This is a great analysis of how the "codependency" relationship of subsidized 
EU farmers can lead them to support the spread of "FUD".  I agree with the 
point you made later in the same post that societies like China and India and 
ones in Africa won't be as responsive to the argument that GM food crops are 
"sacrilegious", but the fact is that the two leading industrial powers (EU & 
US) are headed for a showdown in the middle of Main Street at high noon over 
this issue.  I don't know the legal details, but I can easily envision the EU 
citing "health and safety" exceptions to GATT to support draconian 
prohibitions on the import of US GM foodstuffs.  Perhaps we DO want this, as 
we'd basically then be dealing with a "junk science" trial . . . "Inherit the 
Genes"?

Along the meridian thru Paris!  Yes, but that was a long time ago.
For most of its history, IIRC, the meter was defined as the distance
between two scratches on a certain rod in that city.

It is true that now, in a sense, the speed of light is a matter of
arithmetic definition like the number of feet in a mile (or the number
of francs in a Euro).  However, that is true only of the light from
the abovementioned spectral line.  Whether _all_ electromagnetic
radiation travels at the same speed is still an empirical question.
In particular, if the photon turned out to have a nonzero rest mass
(which would be shocking, but is not inconceivable), then the constant
c in Einstein's equation would not be the actual speed of any light,
but only the limit as the frequency approached infinity (wavelength
approached zero).

Well, after some *really profound* retrofitting, perhaps, such as taking off
the wings.  And wheels.  And redesigning the rest of it to be lighter and
carry more fuel.  Better yet, keep the solids and the external tank, and
start all over on the design of the orbitter, use it as a never-return vehicle.
Or, consider Bob Zubrin's notion of a shuttle Z and an Ares, mentioned
on page 62 of his book The Case for Mars.  After I did the numbers on
his space trucks, they look like a really good bet for what you propose.

Actually if you read the rest of the article, they noted that a
mathematician noted this and it was called the Grubby Pages Effect, but
was ignored for 50 or more years.

General aviation (private planes) has a two to three times higher
accident rate per 100,000 population than commercial aviation.
Considering John Jr. was a student pilot with a broken foot (he had his
instructor along) there is obviously a complex risk factor here.

I have similar thoughts, that in the end it may be easier to contact
ETIs by first contacting the Architects in Universe Prime, and use them
as a network to contact races elsewhere in this universe.

On a related note, I just read the last book in David Brin's second
uplift trilogy, which anyone on the list can tell he wrote after having
spent some time on our list and studying extropian and transhumanist
thought, though at the end he seems to be of the impression that
transcended beings that accumulate around black holes are a dead end,
that the black holes are actually just trash bins to clear out the older
races to make room for the newer ones.

Hash life is like the game of life except that you use lookup tables to
determine the future n state of an area, the area being described losing
one unit in height and width each generation, which is like the
'lightcone' outside of which it cannot, by definition, be affected from
outside. It's described with more eloquence and much more detail in Hans
Moravec's _Mind Children_.

So, you start out with regular life, start building lookup tables, then
as it evolves you can rely on the lookup tables more and more. I'm not
sure what would ensue if you allow the looked-up configurations to merge
into the main screen prior to their scheduled time. I've thought for a
while (agreeing with Hans Moravec) that we're much more likely to be in
a simulation of life rather than real life itself. It's an exciting
time, on the cusp of the singularity, and possibly worthy of study by
already transcended beings. If so, rather than SETI, we might be able to
find existance of such intelligence in scientific and mathematical laws
that look like code optimizations and compression techniques.

If I were designing such a system, I'd provide the ability to add to the
compression techniques whenever the beings within the simulation
discovered a new law. So once Benfords Law becomes noticed, for example,
I might start using it in the simulation (in lieu of the
still-compressible but not as efficient variant I had been using), in
which case it would be found in more and more areas in the simulation.
Applying this idea to all reality, I'd rely on the sim-beings to design
a good part of the simulation. I would just jostle virtual molecules
around, for example (maybe even using a version of pre-scheduled merging
hash life to speed things up), till they formed a replicating form.
They'd be too primitive to notice the apparently faster than light and
action at a distance effects.

Or maybe just start out with 4 elements, maybe earth, water, fire, air
for example, and progressively extract elements out of this as they are
'discovered' by the sim-beings, which allows for more compressibility
(thus allowing the simulation system to model higher complexity states),
instead of adding more 'humours' to these as I had been doing.

I'm wondering how long it will take for a conspiracy theory to come out
about it, that the Masons got rid of him to prevent him from running for
president, or some such junk.

I'm having difficulty understanding why there seems to be a glitch in
remembering that I founded Transhumanist Arts and the Extropic Arts genre.
If I am involved it is because I am an artist and I want to spread memes
about Transhumanist arts.  Thus, it would only seem reasonable that if you
all are communicating with me that you would acknowledge this and I
wouldn't have to remind us all that the arts is my interest and spreading
aesthetic memes  my purpose.

Having said that, please add both Transhumanist Arts and Extropic Arts
(Transhumanist Artss an art period covering *transhumanity*, and Extropic
Arts a genre) to this list, and I will continue putting materials together
for Sasha, and let's move forward please.

Kindly,

Natasha

It seems like these people purposely plan events in their lives to distract

I think you hit the nail on the head.  I'm 25, and most of
my generation seems to share little enthusiasm for space
travel.  I think part of this comes from the increased
knowledge we have about our universe today.  30 years ago
many people still thought there might be intelligent life on
mars.  Now we've used our telescopes to explore the deep
reaches of space and have found it to be incredibly vast and
. . . boring.

The final frontier for the post-October Sky generation is
the mind, not space.  Neuroscience, psychology, AI and the
like are the fields that capture the imaginations of the
adventurors who want to explore unknown territory.  The
computer and psychaitry industries are already worth
billions of dollars with tremendous growth prospects.
Economically I'd rate these areas of enterprise as far more
viable than space travel, as well as more important.  From a
social welfare perspective, nano and biotech should probably
be a higher priority than space exploration.

There is a bit of truth to this, but I would prefer to use descriptive
phrases as follows:

During nonfertile period, women gravitate toward "individuals who are
capable of intelligent conversation" and during ovulation women crave
"individuals who are visually stimulating."

Sorry, no.  What would mostly likely occur would be that women go for the
individual who is intellectually stimulating as well as physically
appealing.  These individuals would get the most sex.

Sorry, no again.  It is not that clear cut.  Not everyone who has brains is
unaesthetic.  In fact, there are many brainy men who are quite handsome and
stylish.  The odds would be in favor of this individual over someone who is
simply smart and stinky.

If people are getting more intelligent it is because of better nutrition,
more stimulation (visual perhaps), and more tools and a few lucky genes.

OK, but how long is a second? Is it the time it takes light to travel
299,792,458 meters? This sort of thing could give circular definitions
a bad name.

Light also moves at 340753049509845930845 meters per clognee.
I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to fugue out exactly
how long a "clognee" is.

I don't believe this is true; he got his pilot's license about a year
ago and did not have an instructor in the plane.  I don't know whether
he had any foot problems.

However he was a relatively low time pilot (perhaps 200 hours) and
night flight over the ocean is always somewhat risky due to the lack
of visual references, especially on a moonless night.  Apparently there
was considerable haze as well.  Under these circumstances you basically
need to be flying on instruments, and it has been shown many times that
VFR pilots are often unable to do so safely.  He was also flying a high
performance airplane he'd only owned for two months.  In this kind of
plane you have to stay abreast of the situation or things get out of
control very quickly.  The most plausible explanation at this point is
a loss of positional awareness leading to a stall/spin from which he
was unable to recover.

I wonder if we could interpret the Kennedy "curse" in terms of risk
seeking behavior.  A number of the deaths have involved at least somewhat
risky behavior, like general aviation, skiing, boating.  Of course
millions of people fly, ski and boat every year without being killed,
but perhaps the Kennedys push the envelope when they participate in
these activities.

As for the assassinations, we might dip into the conspiracy theory waters
a bit and speculate that John and Robert Kennedy took excessive risks
at the level where real power is wielded behind the scenes.  Maybe they
crossed the wrong people, refused to go along with the system, tried
bluffing people who were playing for keeps.  Being President was not
enough, it was necessary to raise the stakes even further.  Eventually
they pushed too hard and were eliminated, making it look like a deranged
assassin.  (This is more plausible in the case of John than Robert,
of course.)

A few possible directions :

* Notation: obvious. It would be shocking if alien languages in general were 
not radically different from the "Terran language family," so you'd certainly 
expect mathematical notation, assuming the concept even applies, to be 
incomprehensible. Maybe it's all geometry to them (think Feynman 
diagrams).

* Philosophy: There are radically different philosophies of math on Earth, 
let alone elsewhere/when. It would be telling to see how an ETSI would 
deal with infinity/infinitesimals, for example.

* Abstraction level: one might expect that large parts of our math might be 
special cases of an advanced alien system. I have often wondered about 
the upper limits of abstraction, as I studied more and more abstract 
algebra and found it more and more "empty." But that's *my* orientation 
speaking, which is more concrete than I thought when I was a freshman 
(as a pure math major, that was a hard fact to swallow). 

* Variant axioms: If an alien system has axioms that to us are undecidable 
theorems ... (what was that old saw? "The Axiom of Choice is obviously 
true, Real Countability is obviously false, and Zorn's Lemma is 
meaningless  ... but they are all equivalent.")

* Different approaches to logic: fuzzy logic/set theory, multivalued systems 
and so on are all a little kinky  to most earthly minds, but they might seem 
quite natural elsewhere. Or think of Spencer-Brown's calculus from Laws of 
Form, which comes from somewhere quite different, but has propositional 
calculus as one of its interpretations.

That's just off the top of my head. However, I think math would still be the 
first thing we understand in common with ETIs, because we could compare 
how each applies it to science and technology. Tell me how Qzztbkf 
expresses "F = ma" and I'll have a pretty good idea how to start 
deciphering everything else she sends us.

If her math and physics are so alien that it takes us years to explain 
Newton and Wrrrzjl to each other, then the rest of the conversation's going 
to be mighty strained as well. That'll be OK with me if the aging therapy 
kicks in in time -- besides, if you're having a conversation that was almost 
impossible in the first place, you shouldn't be surprised at its difficulty, enit?

This is very easy today, in fact my son did exactly this for his
science fair project last month.  We just used an ordinary laser pointer
and aimed it at the bedroom wall.  The razor blades don't have to be
that close together; the effect is quite noticeable with them around a
millimeter apart.  You can actually see it by making a narrow gap with
your fingers and shining a laser pointer through.  Let it hit a wall
5-10 feet away and someone who looks at the spot up close will see the
fringes shifting around as your fingers move.

The more conventional explanation uses wave interference.  If the distance
to a spot on the wall from one side of the slit vs the distance from
the other side of the slit has a difference of half a wavelength, then
you get destructive interference from the two sides and a dark band.
You don't really need to invoke the uncertainty principle.

This effect was known long before QM.  While it can be fitted into the
QM paradigm, there are easier explanations.

Natasha, it is not at all surprising that memes such as yours would be
issued by one who is a close associate of Max More.  {8-]   Of
course there are two categories besides Mr. Brains and Mr. Buns:
1) those poor saps who are blessed with neither (Mr. Celibate) and
2) those fortunate few chaps who you allude to who have plenty of both
(Mr. Unavailable) such as Dr. More, et.al., these being completely
occupied by those fortunate few women who have it all.

The Brains vs. Buns scenario is an intentional oversimplification.
It *kinda* works, and also, its just for fun.  Most of us boys
feel we are neatly categorized by the ladies into one of the
two original categories, Buns or Brains.  I have never been given
much doubt into which category I am placed.  {8-[  {8^D

Given your point that better nutrition, longer life, better everything,
accounts for much increase in human intelligence and wellbeing,
and allowing some oversimplification by ignoring for the moment
Mr. Celibate and Dr. More, does not the institution of marriage
and other societal restraints tip the reproductive scales away from
Mr. Buns back in favor of Mr. Brains?  spike

The thing is, the definition of light is inherently circular.  Once
you've defined a "meter", you can only define the speed of light by
reference to a "second", and you've automatically defined a "second" by
reference to the speed of light.  After all, there's really no such
thing as separate units of "space" and "time".  If you rotate a unit of
time (a "second") by 90 degrees, it becomes a unit of space (299,792,458 meters).

Trying to have a non-circular definition is like trying to have a
non-circular way to convert units of "height" into units of "width". 
They're the same thing.  You may live in some weirdo fantasy universe
where you define height and width by entirely different measures, so
that "height" is measured in inches by reference to the height of
Nelson's Column, while "width" is measured in meters by reference to the
circumference of the planet, and you use special sloping rulers to
convert between them - but the fact is, height and width are the same
thing, and no conversions are necessary; the debate about how to
"define" these measurements in terms of each other is silly, you're just
taking too many measurements.

The speed of light is equal to one.  Any unit of time defines a unit of
length, and vice versa; you just multiply by the speed of light, which
could as easily be phrased as "one second per 299,792,458 meters".

Yup.  {8-[  On the bright side, however, the money I saved on birth

Another idea:  Consider the Jewish people.  Here is a group that have
certainly made a great showing for themselves in the purely intellectual
pursuits, such as physics, chemistry (all the hard sciences), mathematics,
et.al.  Have they not?  Why?

Perhaps it is the combination of two factors that favored the reproductive
success of Mr. Brains over Mr. Buns:

1)  The dominance of a very complicated religion, combined with...
2)  Arranged marriages.

The Jewish religion is filled with minute details, which must be mastered
by memorization in order for one's status to rise within that organization.
The fathers would surely choose Mr. Brains, those in higher standing in
the church over their daughter's preference for Mr. Buns.  Over enough
generations, perhaps this might show up as an intellectual increase in
the genetically isolated group.

1) Poor Sap:  This individual is not pigeon-holed into being a poor sap
because anyone can at any time change.  A new set of cloths, a new haircut,
dancing lessons, some cologne, a sex coach, etc. could turn this type into
a new category, that is if the individual has the motivation and is not
feeling helpless.

I understand, although given motivation, one does not have to stay fixed in
any category.  Self-improvement is very extropian, and if it is sex you
want, then become a visual enticement.  I might add here that most women
are far more attracted to someone who has style than a pretty face.

No, not really.  There are many pregnancies from teenagers, I believe (and
someone correct me if I am wrong).  These pregnancies are probably produced
by the Buns fellows (and I'll add that the criterion here would be youth,
not experience).  Regardless, I get what you are saying and I'd add another
type which would be Mr. Caring-&-Generous.  He would get the gal.

Here is an update on the Extro 4: Biotech Futures Conference.

Please send this to anyone you think might be interested, including any
mailing
lists where appropriate.

Registrations are coming in strong. We're still tweaking the program -- I'm
looking to find a Rifkinite to debate our gene patent expert Dr. Kate
Murashige. So the Program may yet be updated again. I'll also be adding
directions to the campus, information on checking in to the dorm rooms, etc.
just as soon as I receive it from the on-campus manager.

Onward!

You are invited to Extropy Institutes fourth conference:
B I O T E C H  F U T U R E S
Challenges and Choices of Life Extension and Genetic Engineering

August 7-8, 1999, UC Berkeley

BIOTECH FUTURES brings together a unique group of researchers and thinkers to
examine the technology and implications of extending the human life span and
altering our genetic constitution.

The formidable array of speakers at BIOTECH FUTURES will cover everything from
existing technologies to emerging technologies such as artificial chromosomes
and stem cells to future applications of nanotechnology to intervene in human
biology.

In the research arena, we are delighted to have speakers such as Dr. Calvin
Harley, Chief Scientist at Geron Corporation. Geron has done or funded much of
the recent starting breakthroughs in stem cells, telomerase, and now the
nuclear transfer techniques used in cloning. Prof. Cynthia Kenyon, whose work
on extending the life of c. elegans has received much publicity, will present
her results and next steps. Prof. John Campbell of UCLA will explore existing
and future technologies of genetic engineering.

Other top speakers including Vernor Vinge, Natasha Vita-More, and Greg Bear
will examine the philosophical, legal, artistic, and psychological aspects of
extending human lives and altering our genetic code, with a Saturday evening
address by Max More, President of Extropy Institute, on the desirability of
amending the human constitution.

This event will go beyond presenting ideas, no matter how informative and
stimulating. Biotech Futures includes sessions showing what practical steps
are
being taken in these areas, and sessions to help all of us communicate unusual
ideas more effectively to the public.

Several excellent speakers and sessions have not been mentioned here. For a
full list of speakers and the program, please see:

<http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm>http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm

Space is limited for the BIOTECH FUTURES conference and places are being taken
fast. So please register right away if you dont want to miss this unique
event. People are coming from around the world to converge on this conference.
Dont miss out on the concentrated information, intellectual excitement,
creative thinking, 

If you have questions not answered on the conference web pages, please contact
conference Chair Max More, at more@extropy.org or 310-967-3989

Oops I realized after the fact that I could have accidentally
caused a misunderstanding.  Natasha did not write the above
line, I did.  I was attempting a little self-deprecating humor. {8^D
Had she wrote it, I would have laughed, but she is more serious
minded than that I fear.

Thats my problem:  I dont care if people are laughing with me
or laughing at me, so long as they laugh.

Yes, but you can (and need) to define second in independent manner, or else
you'll end up not defining anything.
If you only say that x=ay and that y=x/a and give a a set value you don't
now anything about x or y. They could be any value at all. That's what you
end up with your circular definition of light.
Since the SI seems to know better than that they define a second as "the
duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the
cesium 133 atom".

Well, that would be all fine and dandy, except that time isn't just another
dimension of space. As you might have noticed it is a dimension of time.
There are some similarities but there are also many differences.

You can define c to equal 1 (and that's what they do in that unitary units,
or whatever it is called, system) which can be handy for several purposes
(notably E=mc^2 turns into E=m, and some other simplifications) but that is
still just as a convention as saying it to be 299,792,458 meters per second,
or PI^sqrt(-35) yorts per tar.

Suppose you hear someone you have never met described as:
(a) jolly, funny, happy, loves to be around kids, easy going, relaxed.

Now imagine another person who is quite different from person (a):
(b) very focussed, serious minded, highly motivated or ambitious,
time conscious, intellectual, rowdy kids make them nervous, etc.

Question extropians:  what *physical* characteristics do
you associate with the above persons?  Please describe
what they *look* like, what mental pictures you created
of persons (a) and (b).  I have in mind a thought experiment
which we can finish at the upcoming extrocon in August. spike

"People Who Died" by Jim Carrol Band.  That's another
candidate for an extropian music compilation.  It's a punk
rock ditty that lists a bunch of friends of the writer who
all died for one stupid reason or another.  Irrevereant jab,
totally devoid of any hint that there is a higher meaning to
death, unless that meaning is "death sucks".

I meant to add this to my last note on the _Liberalism_ translation into
Russian.:(

What about translation of major transhumanist works into other languages?
Though I assume most people on this list can read English, the language
which most such works I know of are in, this is not so for lots of people
who I'm sure most if not all of us would want to hop on board the movement.

I believe I participated in a discussion of this a year or two ago, but I'd
like to start another thread on macroengineering -- this time doing it on
the cheap.  I think, e.g., that the East African Rift Valley could be turned
into an inland sea similar to the Mediterranean with a little work.

In fact, it would seem, if my readings are correct, that just a tiny amount
of excavation at it's northern extremity would start the process whereby
waters from the Red Sea would flood a portion of the Rift Valley.

Now, with regards to this, there are some problems.  One is moral.  The
impact of such a change would be far reaching and would affect the lives of
humans and nonhuman animals, probably adversely in the case of the latter.
Add to this the affect on the region's weather patterns and the like.

Another is whether this would work.  Could a few well placed explosive
charges actually begin this process?  Or would it require much more effort
because, e.g., lots of water might evaporate before have a large scale
impact?

I look forward to your comments.

That part reminds me sharply of pack-animal behavior. The alpha male fends 
off challenges until he's too weak. Only in H. sapiens sapiens(?) "packs" are 
the challenges routinely lethal.

Maybe there's something to that sex drive thread -- "cure for testosterone

According to the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, the second is the
duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the
atom of Cesium 133.  That's about 3.75 times the frequency at which a
typical microwave oven operates.

Would that destroy the Rift Lakes?  I'm not much of a conservationist
myself, but something about flooding out the location of the most rapid
vertebrate evolution ever strikes me as unaesthetic.  Plus, the fish from
that area look really nice in tanks.

And what would be the benefits of this anyway?  It doesn't sound any more
like ultratechnology or macro engineering than towing icebergs to water
California does, and the side effects are less clear.

Yes, but not along the earth's surface exactly, since the earth's surface
is not the same as sea level.  At first it was conceptually defined as
one 10,000,000th of the horizontal sea level distance from the equator to
the north pole, along the meridian of Paris, France.  For convenience and
practicality, it was re-defined as the distance between two marks on a
platinum-iridium bar kept in a vault at the BIPM (Bureau Internationale
des Poids et Mesures) in Sevres, France, near Paris.  Due to the
relatively primitive surveying technology and geodesy of the time, the
marks on the bar ended being not quite exactly the meridional distance
intended, but once the bar standard was established, it became the
definition.  Then it was again re-defined in terms of light wavelengths. 
Finally in the 1980s it was re-defined in terms of the speed of light. 
At one point Michelson (famous for the Michelson-Morley experiment) went
to France to carefully measure the length of the meter (the reference
bar) using his invention: the optical interferometer.  But I think he
used sodium light, not krypton 86.


The fact that the meridional circumference of the earth is nominally
40,000,000 meters makes it useful for some purposes to express latitude
in grads, as each grad of latitude is nominally 100 km.  A grad is 1/100
of a right angle, or 9/10 degree.  The earth's equatorial circumference
is about 1/3 per cent larger than the polar, or meridional,
circumference.

Eventually, I think it would.  In the short run, it might not.

I'm not out for destruction either.  But, it might also create islands where
land animals and plants would be isolated, thereby speeding up their
evolution.

One benefit might be turning a semiarid and, in some places, arid region
into a more temperate one.  This might allow even more food to produce in
that area.  Another might be allowing waterborne travel and trade to become
practical in the region.

Now i'm discussing this idea here to see where it can go.  I'm not sure I'd
actually be committed to doing this, since so it has too many unknown
consequences, many of which might be detrimental to human and nonhuman life.

What would be the advantage of flooding the Rift Valley?  I think there
was a proposal involving the Dead Sea, which is about 1200 feet below sea
level, whereby piping in water from the Mediterranean could be used to
generate electricity.  There may have been a similar proposal involving
the Qattara Depression in Egypt.

I find it hard to believe humans would be the only animals where such
challenges are routinely lethal, especially given the high level of violence
in lion prides, canid packs, and the like.  This is without even delving
into nonmammalian social animals, from insects to lizards...

But I'll have to leave someone else to find examples of such.

Cheap Pill at Heart of B.C. Research
By Margaret Munro

  Pills for high blood pressure that cost less than one cent a day appear to be
as good or better at preventing strokes and heart attacks than costly pills
aggressively marketed by drug companies, says a report in this week's Canadian
Medical Association Journal.
  The report by a team of B.C. researchers takes aim at the most widely
prescribed pills in the world. Physicians should consider treating their
patients with low-dose thiazide, which has been on the market for decades, says
Dr. James Wright and his team of drug assessors at the University of B.C.
  "Why would you want to spend 100 times more for drugs that haven't been shown
to be any better," Dr. Wright said in an interview, adding that people taking
expensive anti-hypertensive drugs might want to discuss their prescriptions with
their doctors.
  In their report, the researchers present the results of the most comprehensive
review yet published of the many drugs used to treat hypertension. They examined
23 trials of drugs used as first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension.
The trials involved 50,853 people.
  No other treatment, they report, has proved to be more effective in preventing
strokes and heart attacks than standard and inexpensive low-dose thiazide
therapy.
  "Low-dose thiazide therapy can be prescribed as the first-line treatment of
hypertension with confidence that the risk of death, coronary artery disease and
stroke will be reduced," they conclude.
  "The same cannot be said for high-dose thiazide therapy, beta-blockers,
calcium-channel blockers or ACE inhibitors."
  Drugs to treat hypertension are currently the most commonly prescribed pills
in the world, with worldwide sales in the "billions" of dollars, says Wright. He
estimates that two to three million Canadians are being treated for high blood
pressure.
  Currently, he says, only about a third of them are being prescribed thiazides.
The number, he says should be "considerably higher, maybe 75%.
  "The point is, if you want your patient to be on the drugs with the best
evidence for effectiveness, this is the class you want, Wright says of low-dose
thiazides.
  Thiazides, which are sometimes called water pills, are sold under the chemical
names hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone. They have been on the market for
more than 40 years. A daily dose costs .3 to .6 cents a day, depending on the
dose, compared to up to $2.50 a day for the most expensive of the newer
anti-hypertensive drugs.
  Thiazides are "clearly the drug of first choice" when treating uncomplicated
hypertension, says Wright, who is director of the high blood pressure clinic at
Vancouver Hospital. He is also managing director of a team at the University of
B.C. that assesses the effectiveness of drugs for the provincial government.
  Many doctors do not bother trying the inexpensive and effective thiazides that
have been around for decades, says Wright.
  "We've been brainwashed into thinking new is better, but it is often not the
case," Wright said."Older drugs are often the best."
  One of the problems, says Wright, is that drug companies heavily market new
drugs to doctors.
  But there is little promotion of thiazides, which are no longer protected by
patents and are therefore less lucrative for the companies. As a result, he
says, use of the thiazides that have the best evidence of effectiveness is
decreasing while use of more costly and unproven ones is climbing.
  The Canadian Medical Association Journal report looked at studies of
anti-hypertensive drugs that had been completed by the end of 1997. Wright says
there have been no studies since that would alter his team's conclusions.

Self modification in action...

My wife Jodie is about to begin working nights (10:30pm - 6:30am) week on,
week off. We are both a bit worried about how she can adjust to this kind of
routine without going mental.

I remember reading about Melatonin - is it useful in this context? Are there
other drugs/supplements which can help with a freaky sleep cycle?

Thanks in advance,
Emlyn

I believe my other message answers this, but I'd like to add one more: proof
of concept.  Actually achieving a macroengineering project of this size
would inspire others and probably make humans flex those creative muscles...

However, there does remain the probably of what unintended bad consequences
might come of it.

I've heard of something along those lines, but don't recall any details.

This thread is driving me crazy... I've got some explicitly Transhuman music
coming (and it's good in its own right), from my band The Land Canaan
(myself and the little woman, Jodie, ha ha, just joking, she's watching as I
type this)  along themes of mortality/immortality, changing yourself with
technology, uploading, and the idea that in the unknowable future we'll
still be 'us' in the kind of way that most would find important. There's
also more general human issues in there, the most focused on is change,
transition, leaving something and going to something new.

I didn't want too much before it was ready, but I just can't wait any
longer. The album is titled "On Leaving", and all material is ready, we've
just got to record it now. An initial recording (done at a cheap local
studio, more as a proof of concept) will be ready I hope within a month. A
more serious recording will be ready in about 3 months (costing damned mega
bucks in my opinion, but we've got to get it right). A web site should
emerge in the next couple of weeks with serious Transhuman content, to
preach to the converted (useful resources), but also to introduce the
uninitiated. Stay tuned...

In terms of PR, big budget movies, computer games, etc are overkill, and
only really introduce the ideas to people. I suspect that many people
already have been exposed to proto-transhuman memes, and are ready for more
directed effort that can actually be far more achievable than big-budget
mass-media handwaving. How many of you were "converted" by transhumanism,
and how many found that it merely provided a vocabulary for beliefs you
already held?

I have a plan, which comes directly from the dark, tainted vaults of PR and
marketing. Any interest?

Over the past few months, I've been trying to see if anyone has come up with
the idea of a passive nanofilter.  Admittedly, I've only been looking on
what has been accessible via the web.  I haven't found anything on the
subject.  So, I offer my speculation here on it in hopes others will be able
to use the idea.  (If it is original, I would mind a bit of credit should
anything come of it, though not being an engineer, I don't imagine myself
actually designing or producing it.:)

What is a passive nanofilter?  It is a device which filters particles based
on electrostatic properties at the nanometer scale.  How could this be done?
It could do this through use of it's configuration and composition.  I
imagine a membrane with pores whereing the pores might be surrounded with
atoms of certain types and with a certain geometry all imbedded in some sort
of structure.  There are no moving parts per se -- hence the "passive."

What could this be used for?  Separation of materials obviously, including
filtering water to greater degrees of purity, removing chemicals from other
liquids or gases, or separating a mixture of several substances into various
caches of near pure substances.

Such a filter might not be able to work with raw materials, such as
seawater, given that it might become clogged easily, but it might work with
materials that have already gone through a preliminary filtering by some
other devices.

To my mind, it might be easier to create this machine since it only involves
placing some atoms in a substrate -- as opposed to create a nanomachine or a
self-replicator.  However, despite its simplicity, it might be a milestone
on the way to creating other nanodevices, especially nanomachines, as it
would be able to provide purer sets of building blocks than current methods.

Any thoughts on this?

Cheers!

Weak. The use of the tools we use is due to the pragmatically strong
correlation between the concepts in our head and of our notation (math) and
the natural world. They do not directly correlate, as this is the same as
saying that we completely understand the natural world in it's own terms,
which we don't. Scientists are always saying "oh, we got that wrong, but
we're closer now.", which is the way scientific models become closer to the
real truth.

I think this is a worthwhile project, although I think this is really more of 
an "opinion poll" than a "personality test".  Perhaps we could use one of the 
free opinion poll services.  I think your categories are about right, but 
think each one has three elements: What the responder thinks is best for 
humanity as a whole, what is most probable and what the responder prefers for 
herself personally.  I agree with you that we're likely headed for the 
equivalent of a "Cambrian Explosion" of our own species, with a great 
diversity of developmental pathways being generated by the possibilities 
presented by transhuman technologies.  If this is so, it WOULD be good to be 
able to know who's on a similar pathway.

I started using melatonin when I was traveling overseas frequently and found 
that it worked very well to adjust my diurnal cycle quickly and with no 
noticeable side-effects.  About 2 years ago, after reading about how the 
body's natural melatonin production begins to decline from about age 30 on 
and its important anti-oxidant functions, I began taking melatonin regularly 
here at home, 3 mg one-half hour before bedtime.  My sleep has certainly 
improved and I've had no adverse side-effects (and I get regular, in-depth 
medical exams).

I don't know what sort of effects there might be from using melatonin on a 
regular basis to shift one's diurnal cycle back and forth, but don't believe 
experimenting with it for a while would be harmful.

Indeed. I'm not surprised that so few people are excited about the Shuttle
flights or Space Station Alf, because, frankly, what's to be excited about?
I want to go into space myself, NASA just wants to grab hundreds of billions
of tax dollars to conduct experiments of little interest and dubious worth.
So why should I care about it? Alf barely gets me one step closer to going
into space.

Well, what can you expect from a Mars Face believer? Hint: the shuttle has
wings, wheels, and is only designed for a very limited stay in space before
the consumables run out.

You have hit this nail on the head, he was not IFR qualified, and
undertook a night flight over the ocean, vertigo city.....

Yes, they do push the envelope. Michael was killed while tossing a
football and skiing, Ted almost while drinking and driving, and now
John apparently while flying at night over the ocean while not
being IFR qualified. Engaging in numerous risk taking simply
increases's the odds of trouble.

It was interesting to note Caroline was white water rafting at the
time....

<RANT> 
Is it just me, or does Mr. Brains eventually see how pointless
relationships are, and lose interest? A few months ago I've realized that
every relationship I've ever been in has basically required that I
surrender some of my individuality and autonomy. Even with women who call
themselves 'objectivists' 'libertarians' 'feminists' 'career-minded' or
'tom-boys'. I always have very free-form friendships, where each
individual has all the space they want, but it doesn't work the same way
with romance.

Perhaps here too evolutionary psychology rears its ugly head. No matter
what a woman's ideals are, regardless of whether she happens to be in the
mood for Buns or Brains, there is this clingy little imperative inside her
screaming 'Settle down! Grab a suitable mate and stake out your
territory!'.

Mr. Celibate, ignore the peer pressure of the supposedly happy couples
holding hands in the park. They (or at least the male halves of them)
should (and maybe do) envy you.

A***o*e, you say? Oh no, that would be if I lied to myself and others,
pretending to like co-dependency.

As I recall, the proposal is originally credited to Chaim Weizmann, first President
of Israel.  My father revived the proposal when we were living in Israel in the
70's.  There was some governmental interest at the time, but it never went 
anywhere.  I'll ask him about it when we speak next.  The idea was never pipes,
though -- it was digging a channel.  And, in his version, it was also about desalinating
the sea water.  (Israel is short on both energy and water.)

This reminds me of a related issue, though.  In my own professional work, I focus
on staying 1.5 years ahead of the public.  I perceive impending needs 18 months 
before they do, which lets me get a solution to market just as they become aware
that they need it.  For now, I stay clear of Internet products, because things move
too fast for me to remain far enough ahead.

My father's problem has always been that he perceives and solves needs decades 
before there's a market for his solution.  Or maybe he's just not good enough at
salesmanship and marketing.  In the 50's, for example, he invented a fax machine
and optically generated variable-font-size typography.  Other ideas in other decades.
Each time, we've seen someone else come along 10 to 40 years later and get rich
with their variation of what he hadn't been able to get funding for.  Was the time
finally right?  Were they just better at selling their ideas?

Then I look at us, and some of our "fellow traveller" groups -- the libertarians, the 
cryonicists.  Why are groups promoting liberty and immortality (goals you might
think are obviously worthwhile) so unrelievedly unsuccessful in recruitment?  
When you talk to people you meet about the future, which topics do you discuss?  
In what order?  Is any of our shared vision (in all its variations) solid enough and 
soon enough to take to a venture capitalist?  Are any of you actually making a
living off the extropian dream?  (Besides Drexler, Merkle, and, until recently, the Rocket
Plumber.)

The chemical known as GABA (commonly sold OTC as a nutritional supplement) has
the following effects on me, such that I would certainly use it in coping with
a new work/sleep schedule (though I do not know if it would affect sleep cycles
per se):

A dose of 1-2 grams puts me RIGHT to sleep, sound sleep.  The brief dozing off
period (which occurs despite my prior state, which may be ennervation due to
caffeine overuse or adrenaline from a stressful day) is characterized by a
warm, mellow relaxed feeling akin to a real good alcohol buzz.

Dreams are more vivid.

Waking usually follows in about four hours, no matter how previously sleep
deprived I was.  Upon waking, I usually feel refreshed and ready to leap out of
bed and tackle my day.  However, if time allows, or it is the middle of the
night, I can readily fall asleep again.

Upon waking, I sometimes notice a very mild headache that quickly goes away.

It will come as no surprise that the effects described above are dose dependent
and decline with use.  In other words, to get the same effect day after day
requires increased dosages after about day three.

Other people have reported similar results.

I suspect that two or three uses at the beginning of a new shift would be very
helpful, if only in guaranteeing a few hours of refreshing sleep during the
unfamiliar sleep period.  I mostly use it in circumstances where I'm going to
bed only a few hours before my next work day begins (especially after my poker
game when I am jazzed on caffiene and adrenaline) to prevent painful sleep
deprivation symptoms the next day.

Usual disclaimers apply.  This stuff mucks with brain chemistry in ways I don't
understand, so moderation is the watchword.  The one time I used this stuff
several days running I fell into a funk that could not entirely be explained by
my circumstances, so I suspect a depressant effect from sustained use.

My name is Hans Offerdahl, and my self and a small group of people here in
Spokane Washington are putting together an on line newspaper.  We are
non-profit so all profits will go to a charity here in Spokane called Feed The
Kids. Our goal is to have a weekly on line paper, that once a month will be
put in print and distributed around the area. 

We only have one paper here in town and it carries a very narrow view of what
they will actually publish. We are looking for reality in our world, we
believe that the Spokane paper is trying to create its own reality.  We are
looking for writers to help supply articles that will give us a bigger picture
of all things on our planet. We are not in a position to pay our writers at
this time, but hope to be able to in the future. 

Articles will be sent to "sentinalnetmail@netscape.net" to be copied and
pasted in to the paper, so we will need proper spelling and punctuation. 

If this is something you would be interested in and want more information
please send an email and let me know. 

Thanks 
Hans Offerdahl

Has anyone thought about broadcasting EXTRO-4 over the Internet?  Or if a
live feed is not possible just make sure someone makes a tape and put it up
as a Real Media file or just a bunch of Mpegs.  While we're on the subject,
would there be a problem recording other transhuman-related conferences and
maybe some interviews?  ExtroTV anyone?

Here's a repost of 7/1/99 -Sleep Tools

I've learned a few tools to enable sleep. ( Had to, working long overnight
hours in various hospital settings, like I did.)
They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few.
(1) Melatonin:
     (A) fast acting, cheap, low dosage- I found that 3/4 mg would knock me
out for a good 4 hours, PREVENTS COLDS-
      prior to using melatonin, I had 2-3 SEVERE colds each year, since I
discovered this effect several years ago I have been
      100% cold free. Using myself as a guinea pig, I determined that a
single 1 mg dose every 3-4 days is probably sufficient    FOR ME , to never
have another cold. I do use a fairly high level of supplements and am very
active regular runner and I don't smoke, so adjust your dose if your immune
system is not what it should be.
     (D) long 1/2 life in the body-you'll stay groggy longer, but if you
have
to sleep in a noisy environment ( barracks, dorm or have young kids) and do
get awakened you'll quickly return to sleep, IMPORTANT-if you have high
blood
pressure you might want to take it easy with this stuff, melatonin has been
shown to constrict the vessels in the Circle of Willis ( main arterial
vessels in the brain ) over use or high dosages might contribute to a CVA by
raising intracrainial BP, don't drive or operate heavy equipment
(2) Kava
     (A) fast acting, short 1/2 life- you wake up after a full night's sleep
clear headed, also cheap, the sensation produced by the herb is
pleasant.(400
mg works for me)
     (D) the sleep inducing effect is not as intense as melatonin even at
higher dosages > 800 mg, consistency of effect across brand may differ since
herbal preparations vary a lot
(3) chamomile tea
     (A) short 1/2 life, cheap, effective symptomatic treatment for nausea
vomiting
     (D) tea has less than pleasant taste
(4) stimulation of seratonin production
     (A) anyone can do it- eat a plate of food high in both starch and
complete protein ( mashed potatoes heavy on the milk, pasta with meat sauce,
etc.) forces your brain- do to a quirk in amino acid metabolism- to over
produce seratonin which induces sleep
    (D) ya'll get fatter'n hogs, if ya do this too often
(5) calcium- magnesium tablets
     (A) both are essential nutrients, since both help with pain relief-
calcium can block pain and magnesium is a very effective muscle relaxant the
combo is good if pain is what's keeping you awake
     (D) slow acting, long 1/2 life- you will be groggy the next day if you
take too much
(6) Vitamin C/ exercise
    (A) both very good for you in many ways, cheap but use buffered C not
plain or chewable- long term use of high doses of C (2-5 gm/day) raises the
level of endorphins in the body to a level that is manageable( no
overwhelming sleepiness on the job ) and you tend to have a great attitude-
sustained exercise ( a good run, biking a few miles, some sustained
horizontal exercise) adds a load of new endorphins to the mix for a really
mystical experience before sleep comes
(7) hypnosis
 (A) nothin' cheeper, has other useful benes if you learn how- pain
reduction, hypermnesia(love this one when I'm cramming for an exam)
 (D) not fool proof- if you're distracted or in a hurry it may not work,
practice is essential may not keep you asleep all night

I have noticed similiar effects in others when using 1,2-butanediol (1 
g orally). It is a metabolic precursor to GHB (and GABA): 

http://www.ceri.com/ghbalt.htm
http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ghb/butanediol-abstracts.html

Due to kinetics of (enzymatic) conversion it can be considered a
sustained-release form of GHB. Due to personal metabolic variations it
appears advisable to up the dosage slowly (under no circumstances over
1 ml on first try, 0.5 ml sounds about right).

Rotation is irrelevant. A the key is that light travels that many meters
in a second no matter what your inertial frame of reference. Thus it is
an objective constant to anchor to. The constant no longer is 'meter',
but second. Second, as a unit of measurement is based on a constant I am
guessing is Planck Time, which is not dependent on the speed of light.

Sirhan Sirhan still will not explain why he killed RFK. This does tend
to imply that he did it under some type of compulsion, perhaps mind
control, unless he was wacked from the start.

The distance from the sea to the rift valley is only a few hundred
yards, and some water is already seeping in through cracks in the rock,
but its a rather toxic brew by the time it seeps through the volcanic
rock...I agree that opeing it up would probably be the biggest economic
windfall for the Ethiopian and Somali people.

Yes. Look, I'm not going to argue with you any longer, since you've
admitted you know zilch about math. Your opinion does not count because
it is not an informed opinion. It is based on ignorance. Get educated,
then come tell me why you think they won't understand math.

Ok, but how long is a meter? If you define it as 1/299782458 of the distance
light moves in one second that means that as your experimental procedures
improve and you know the exact speed of light better the length of a
meter changes.

You can't define everything as you wish and remain consistent. In the last century
the Indiana state legislature tried to pass a law decreeing that the exact value of PI
was 4. It missed becoming law by one vote, but probably wouldn't have worked anyway.

I was talking about using a _preexisting_ space technology.  Note the word 
"retrofitting."  Obviously the shuttle, as is, is not an ideal interplanetary 
craft, but there are a number of modifications that could make it worth a 
lunar flight.  Stephen Baxter, in his novel "Titan," shows how shuttle 
technology could be modified for a trip to Saturn (!).  It's science fiction, 
but well within what is possible (in the book, a modified shuttle is used 
because NASA is essentially bankrupt).

And don't call me a Mars Face "believer."  I don't "believe" anything about 
the Mars Face; I _think_ that it deserves more attention.  Belief is the last 
resort of people who don't have the guts to think for themselves.

I wish some of the members of this group could get beyond the
"scorecard" mentality I often see.  I marvel at the achievements
of many of the people on this list. However, I've always been of
the mind that if attribution or accolades are deserved your
peers will rain them upon you.  Several people have contributed
importantly to my thinking on transhumanism and to the philosophy
in general (e.g., Max, Anders, Robin, Sasha, Eliezer, etc.) and I
say that not because they insisted that they be accorded their
due but because I believe they deserve such recognition.

After Nick and others worked so hard on the FAQ, the first comments
weren't "great job" or "thanks" but instead "scorecard" criticisms
as I like to refer to them.  Constructive criticisms regarding
content are obviously one thing, but kudo farming seems rather
odious.

Natasha certainly has the right to make whatever comments she
wishes, especially when she feels an injustice has been done. But 
I hope that we can function without the turf bickerings I've seen 
plague other groups and fora.

Michael,

This kind of positive statement requires a citation to the U.S. Code or the
decision of an authoritative court.

I would bet that most U.S. citizens would love it if it were true that only
those four classes of citizens were required to file income tax returns
and/or pay income tax, but, as a skeptic, I would also bet that if you
tried to use this defense in a tax evasion case, you would get your butt
thrown in jail (or at the very least, lose on the tax issues).

Absent a citation to support the assertion that this is actually the law of
the land, it seems like all you are doing is in fact, as the subject line
suggests, "Encouraging (Illegal) Tax Evasion."  The police power of the
United States is very real if they can get their hands on you.  People may
want to take the risk of reaping the benefits of successful tax evasion,
but the risks of criminal and civil punishment do exist.  And as both a
skeptic and a pessimist on the government's use of its coercive power, I
doubt that the U.S. Government exempts everyone not in one of those four
classes from the federal income tax.

But I'd be very happy to be proven wrong....

Does any one here have any architectural insight to a question I have? If I
were to begin building a simple structure merely to achieve it's epitome of
height,  what should it be built of, (not considering the future of
nanotubes, but what could be used now) how high would it reach and how thick
would the structure have to be in width?

Yes, that sounds correct.  However I did not make the rules.  The
definition does not originate with me.  The definition comes from the CRC
Handbook, and ultimately by international scientific agreement, probably
under the BIPM.  It seems equally true that as measurement technology
improves, the length of the meter, as measured, would also change under
any of the previous definitions of the meter.



>You can't define everything as you wish and remain consistent. 


Please don't blame me; I did not make the definition.  My guess is that
by the mid 1980s the speed of light had been measured to an accuracy as
fine as the precision of the Krypton 86 definition of the meter, so it
was decided to make the second and the speed of light the primary
standards for defining the meter, rather than using the second and the
meter as primary standards, as under the older system.  I don't see any
inconsistency under either system.  Under the old system the speed of
light 'changes' as measurement become more refined.  Under the new system
the meter 'changes' as measurement become more refined.  I suspect the
sentiment was that it is better to have something fundamental such as the
speed of light remain constant by definition, rather than have something
artificial (the meter) be arbitrarily held constant which results in a
fundamental constant (the speed of light) changing.  And since under the
old system the meter was defined in a way that required a physical
measurement to reproduce, the meter would change anyway as the
measurement technology changed.  So the new system would seem to be an
improvement.

The version of the story I heard was that Kentucky or Tennessee had
considered defining pi as 3.  Legal definitions of units are usually made
to provide a basis for settling commercial disputes, and it does not
really matter to physics that those legal definitions are somewhat
inaccurate, nor does it matter much to commerce, since for commerce it is
more important to have an agreed and easily implemented definition than
it is for the definition to be highly accurate.  



Back in the 1790s the US by law defined the gallon as 231 cubic inches. 
Since then, the length of the inch has changed several times.  So every
time that happened the gallon changed.  But it caused no commercial
problem because the changes were minuscule.  The Imperial (British,
Canadian) gallon was defined in a very different way.  That gallon was
the volume taken by 10 pounds of water at 62 degrees F.



Likewise, defining pi as 3 may have been proposed for some commercial
uses, not for scientific use.  22/7 is a good approximation of pi, but at
the time lawmakers may have thought that fractions are too complicated
for many people (including, perhaps, them) and that a 'simple' definition
is better.  If a commodity such as rope is being sold in a coil with a
known number of turns, its length can be estimated by counting the turns,
measuring the diameter of the coil, and multiplying by pi.

How about people wearing 24-hour positional trackers?  The positional 
data is a sufficient form of capture, assuming no direct harm is 
done.  In terms of electronic commerce, sharing tracking data amounts 
to a kind of interpersonal e-trust.  Why should a institutional 
entity be given a share in that transaction?

The ideas that really interest us are mostly too far out to merit investment
at this point.  However, the development paths that lead to them are another
matter.  For example, my work is in advancing the state of the art in
automated coding tools, which is a development path that ultimately will
enable us to actually program all those neat toys the nanotech guys want to
build (not to mention making large-scale AI projects a lot more practical).

Don't osmotic filtration systems already work this way?  I think I've heard
of other related applications as well, but the details escape me.

Again, I find myself coming to the defense of another person by the verbal assaults
of another "in" person on this list, who probably feels it his 'moral' duty to be such
an a**h**l for the sake of protecting the hive mentality from 'dangerous' memes!
Ahh, what is a fragile extropian to do!  Help me Mark!  Help me Lee!  I'm hearing
memes that are not part of the consensus materialistic dogma that is our religion!

Never once has Mac Tonnies once said he believed in anything let alone the
'Face on Mars'. His sole remark was that the 'Face on Mars' was anomolous
enough to warrant some further investigation before we dismiss it out of hand.
I challenge anyone to demonstrate how such an attitude can be anything other
than the very resonable, inquisitive and scientific one that it is.

Of course I am visually drawn to physically attractive people and yes, style
can help in this field of view,
however it is Truly Sexy when encountering someone with great intellect. For
example, if Feynman and Einstein were still alive, I'd, well... you can
imagine. If I saw these guys (and some others I am thinking that are alive)
on the street and had no knowledge of their accomplishments I would most
likely not be stimulated. But because of this intellect, I am.
 My fantasies do not include Tom Sellec or Patrick Swayze. This is not to
say that I haven't been reeled in by good looks, but it takes more than that
to keep me around and titilate my mind. Some people after you know them can
change your preception in both ways, someone may be attractive and have a
banal personality, while some one who may not be so "pretty" can have a
mysterious or alluring personality.
I do not find myself attracted to different types during different times of
the month, nor do I place one aspect above the other. It's the situation as
a whole that attributes to the end result and all experiences with people
are different. (as individual as we all are) I as a person am not so cut and
dry to say one thing in particular gets me interested or does not. I also am
not the type of person who dictates a specific type to myself. (I do not
prefer blondes to brunettes or anything so exact)
I am a very open person, and see variations of beauty in most all people.

Of course, if Michael is correct, it's item (d) that's the kicker-
essentially everyone in America has one or more accounts in
federally insured institutions.  Where o where can can I get a
non-FDIC account?

I betcha all credit unions, savings & loans, banks, etc are required
to have federal insurance to be licensed, and without a license
they'd get raided and shut down in a heartbeat- so there's your
catch-22.

I have just been browsing at the Web site now hosting Eliezer
Yudkowsky's essays (singularity.posthuman.com), and some of Mr.
Yudkowsky's remarks in his Meaning of Life
essay (tmol-faq), in particular his description of how
reading a particular paragraph in Vernor Vinge's
_True Names and Other Dangers_ led him to formulate his
own cosmological interpretation of the Singularity,
led me to reflect on just how old some of these ideas
are.  I was tempted to post this ramble down memory
lane a few weeks ago when there was a thread on the
topic of folks' first encounters with transhuman
"memes", but I didn't get around to it.

Anyway, my entre to transhuman speculation came about
when I was in sixth grade, in 1963, by way of the publication
of a paperback version of Arthur C. Clarke's non-fiction
book _Profiles of the Future_.  I ran into this in
the paperback rack of the local Food Fair, back in those
days when a trip downtown to the Newark (Delaware)
Newsstand counted as a visit to paperback heaven, and
I mostly had to make do with the selection in the nearby
supermarket or drug store (the titles available at school
through Scholastic Books somehow seemed less interesting,
though I got copies of _The Time Machine_ and a bunch of
Andre Nortons, from them).

The chapters in _Profiles_ entitled "The
Obsolescence of Man" and "The Long Twilight", which
finish off the book, are full of transhuman speculation,
and the prose has a touch of the haunting lyricism
that Clarke sometimes achieves.  I had not encountered
A. C. before this volume, but references to Clarke's
own _The City and the Stars_ and to Olaf Stapledon's
_Last and First Men_, set the stage for later reading
(though it would be 10 years before I was able to find
any Stapledon, when Dover finally reprinted his stuff,
though it seems to have stayed continuously in print since
then).  _The City and the Stars_ I was able to dig up in
a public library.

I read and re-read _Profiles_ for many weeks, and toted
it with me to school.  I remember, in a free-form homeroom
discussion, bringing up Clarke's speculations on the
possibility of personal immortality, and it really hit
a nerve, both with the teacher Mrs. W_ and with the
other kids.  They seemed both fascinated and appalled by
my remarks, and some of them got angry, until Mrs. W_
smoothed things over by cutting off the discussion and
reassuring everybody that of course this was all nonsense
and wouldn't ever come to pass, and I got a strong feeling
that I'd be better off keeping Clarke at home.

During the same period of time there was a television show
that also counts as a formative influence in my life --
the Leslie Stevens/Joseph Stefano sci-fi anthology show
_The Outer Limits_, which premiered on ABC television in
September 1963.  Though contemporaneous with _The Twlight
Zone_, _Outer Limits_ had an effect on me, perhaps due to the
noir cinematography (so beautifully black and white that color
could only have spoiled the effect), or the memorable musical
scores by Dominic Frontiere, that _Zone_ seldom matched, though I
came to understand later that the _Zone_ scripts were more
highly regarded among serious aficionados of literature.

There was one _Outer Limits_ episode in particular which aired
soon after the show's premiere, called _The Sixth Finger_, about a
Welsh coal miner (Gwyllim Griffiths, rivetingly portrayed by
David McCallum) who achieves post-humanity by volunteering as
the experimental subject of a physicist turned molecular biologist
(memorably portrayed by Edward Mulhare), but who is ultimately
done in by the unwillingness of his erstwhile girlfriend
Cathy to let him go (also beautifully portrayed by Jill
Haworth).  It may have been the result of my nascent Anglophilia
and the all-British cast, but this has always been my favorite
_Outer Limits_ episode, though it didn't take me long to see
through the bogus evolutionary theory in the script (our
destiny is already encoded in our genes, so that when
Professor Mathers' good-gene-enhancing device is brought to
bear, the coal miner is propelled into the race's biological
future).  The silly science doesn't detract from the impact
of this episode for me, and McCallum's performance as the
transhuman is stunningly convincing -- his delivery of Gwyllim's
final speech to Cathy, in perfect Shakespearean tones --
"...I could feel myself approaching that stage in the dim
future of mankind when the mind will cast off the hamperings
of the flesh, and become all thought and no matter:
a vortex of pure intelligence in space..." is a high
point of dramatized SF.

Later, in '66 - '67, _Star Trek_ touched on posthumanism in
a few episodes (_The Menagerie_, _Where No Man Has Gone Before_,
_Return to Tomorrow, and _Errand of Mercy_ come to mind, though
only in the latter case are the posthumans portrayed positively);
we will discreetly pass over _Trek_'s treatment of artificial
intelligence.

By the time the movie _2001_ appeared, I had already read
Clarke's _Childhood's End_, and I was thoroughly steeped in
SF posthuman scenarios, so that I was a bit puzzled why
so many people failed to grasp the significance of Bowman's
journey and transformation.

The 70's saw the return of Olaf Stapledon to print, and I
was able to read _Last and First Men_, _Star Maker_,
_Odd John_ and _Sirius_.  Stapledon has a great deal to say
about the purpose of individual lives, much of which seems
to parallel what Eliezer talks about in his Meaning of Life
FAQ, though Stapledon advocates enlightened (or "wide awake")
behavior in the face of a very bleak lack of likelihood that
individuals or races will benefit directly from the contributions
they make to the ultimate Universal Mind.  The mise-en-scene
of the two longer books, however, consists of contemporary
human beings, very far from the pinnacle of intelligence,
being vouchsafed glimpses of far future developments of cosmic
evolution, for their edification and encouragement.

Prior to stumbling on the Extropians on the Web, I had read
Vinge (_Marooned in Realtime_, _A Fire Upon the Deep_, though
not _True Names_), William Gibson, Greg Bear, David Brin,
and Iain Banks, among "hard" SF authors who touch on
transhuman topics (and Greg Egan afterwards).  In fact, I recall
that I came across the Extropians while searching for discussions
of Iain Banks.

While very many of the stories I had seen and read suggested
that the Singularity might happen suddenly (such as via
Professor Mathers' machine in _The Sixth Finger_, or the
parapsychological awakening of humanity in _Childhood's End_,
or direct intervention by an advanced extraterrestrial race
in _2001_, or the invention of DNA computers as in _Blood
Music_, or natural mutation as in Stapledon's _Odd John_),
none of these scenarios seemed particularly plausible
as serious prognostications (as opposed to SF story
McGuffins).  I had been used to thinking of the radical
transformation of the human race as taking place over
vast stretches of time -- tens or hundreds of thousands,
or even millions of years (as in Wells' _Time Machine_, or
Stepledon's longer books _Last and First Men_ and _Star Maker_,
which actually manage to capture some of the feeling of the
passage of time encompassing the rise and fall of so many
civilizations and races).

The time horizon in which I have imagined the radical transformation
of the human race as occurring (the "Singularity", though I have
only started calling it that since stumbling across the Extropians)
has been shortened in stages over the past couple of decades.  First,
in disucssions beginning in the mid-70's with a friend named
Joseph Fineman (who has also posted recently to this list),
who rather startled me by declaring firmly that there would
be no recognizable human beings left within as little as a
thousand years, and that we would be replaced by some amalgam of
computational machinery and genetically-engineered stuff, with
a concomitant blurring of boundaries between individual minds.
I had never actually met anyone who believed this as a matter of course.
This was in, oh, 1976.

Then there was Vinge's _Marooned in Realtime_, which, rather more
plausibly than most SF stories (though in a rather implausible
setting, with the "bobbles" and all), described the event horizon
of some sort of technological black hole set only a few hundred
years hence (with echoes of the overnight disappearance of the Krell
in _Forbidden Planet_, but with suggestions of a more positive
fate for humanity).

[I apologize for sending the last couple of paragraphs like
this in a separate message -- it's my clumsiness with Netscape
Communicator].

Carnegie-Mellon roboticist Hans Moravec's non-fiction
_Mind Children_ came to my attention soon afterwards, and dared to
suggest seriously that something much like Vinge's technological
black hole was just around the corner, perhaps even within my
own lifetime.  The most memorable item in _Mind Children_ was
Moravec's description of a technique to gradually move a human
mind from a biological to a non-biological substrate, without
duplication,
and without interrupting the consciousness of the mind being
transferred.

I had thus been steeped in transhuman speculative fiction (and
the very occasional non-fiction discussions such as those by
Clarke and Moravec) for most of my literate life when I stumbled
across the Extropians on the 'net in '97.  The one really new thing
was encountering Yudkowsky's _Staring Into The Singularity_, in
which a seemingly rational, intelligent person was arguing quite
forcefully and plausibly for the occurrence of an **unavoidable**
(barring disaster) technological singularity with decades rather
than centuries or millenia. I haven't quite decided whether I really
believe this or not, but I have to admit that it's re-crystallized my
view of the world, so that when I see, for instance, a newspaper article
like the one in last Friday's New York Times about molecular
computing, I say to myself "here comes the Singularity".

A carbon filament attached to a satellite in geosynchonous orbit would put
you up over 20,000 miles.
If you prefer building from the ground up, a triangular truss made of carbon
filament with stabilizing guy wires could put you up at least a mile. The
guy wires would make it about as wide as tall. If you want something simple,
take the Eiffel Tower as a template. It's made of iron, with lots of open
spaces to let the wind through, and the weight of the iron helps to dampen
vibrations. You could make a back yard scale model Tower out of welded angle
iron. A nice addition to your suburban landscape?

>From what little I understand of large structure architecture/engineering, there
are several issues.

First, each given layer must be strong enough to support the weight of all the
layers above.
Second, the entire structure must have a combination of strength and shape to
resist the force generated by wind hitting it. this implies that each layer must
be fastened to the layer beneath it with either enough force to resist this wind
pressure (Sears Tower) , or enough flex to bend to it (reed in the swamp). Force
due to Air pressure can be reduced by shaping the structure aerodynamically (at
least along one axis) and allowing it to rotate so that the aerodynamics always
face into the wind.

[Speculation: Can wind be used to strengthen a building?]

Given this, the structure would probably be shaped somewhat like an airplane's
rudder, and would rotate freely around it's vertical axis (assuming height is
the sole criterion we're building to). It would definitely taper from as large a
base as practical to a whip antenna (or smaller) at the top. It would have to be
stiff yet flexy, so I'm thinking some kinda diamondoid/buckytube composite.

Beats the heck outta me how tall you could make the thing. To invoke the lords
of proctological numerology (pulling numbers out of an orifice that shall go
unnamed), I'd say a fully optimized design a couple thousand feet across at
ground level could top out at a whip antenna (waving wildly around, badly
menacing local air travel but describing a lovely strange attractor) 30 to 50
kilometers up.

If we're stuck with reinforced concrete, I would say a kilometer, maybe two.

Be real pretty tho.

Yes.  I'm not saying the idea for such a filter as a filter is new.  What is
different about it is that it would be built to specification on the
nano-level -- not by relying on membranes made of grosser level materials.
A passive nanofilter would be much smaller and would, hopefully, have fewer
imperfections.

Plus, it would be a wonderful proof of concept that sounds like it would be
doable with current technology -- at least, in the prototype stage.  With
such devices, it mgiht be easier to sell the idea of nanotech to the rest of
the engineering and investment communities.

Cheers!

News report from the GNS, the Galactic News Service

[Theme music - intro]

** The Promised Land soon to be revealed **

The Planet Canaan - a promised land of luxury and enlightenment. Whispers of
its mysteries have teased and intrigued GalacticCitz for centuries. Remnants
of lost civilisations, exquisite hidden knowledge of times past, as well as
the most exotic sensory experiences in the known universe. All hidden behind
the opacity of a planet closed to the outside world for more than four
hundred years. But that is about to change...

The Planet Canaan has recently decided to drop its barriers to the
GalacticCiv. Rumors abounded that the people of the planet had cloistered
themselves to work on some almighty, planet wide project, perhaps the
greatest cultural artifact ever produced in the history of the GalacticCiv.
It has now been confirmed that these people have produced a great work, and
are readying to share it with us all. Details of the nature of the work are
still shrouded in secrecy, however.

What is known is that these intensely cerebral people warmly welcome
visitors, and the very few who have visited their planet during their
cloistered period have come away strongly affected by the experience. 

Currently they are building their first spaceport; the expected date of
completion is one galactic month, official opening following soon after
(rumors are that the Galactic President herself will be doing the honours!)

The educated elite of our galaxy wait, breathless, on this monumentous
planetary opening and revelation of the treasures contained within. It is
almost certain to be an historical, cultural watershed for the GalacticCiv.
GNS, your news service, is holding this planet under the closest scrutiny.
We will inform you of new developments FIRST, as they occur.

Yes Alex!  I feel the same way, but about men!

Every relationship that I have ever had, I felt that I had to surrender an
aspect of myself, reluctantly.  Yet, I have never lost my autonomy for long
because it is far too disorienting.  Alas, most friendships also require
loosing an aspect of oneself - if only for a fleeting moment -  while
investing in the relationship.

It is a difficult balance - giving to another person and developing the
ability to empathize while also maintaining one's autonomy.  Yet, for me it
is worth it.  As in any of life's challenges, the ability to be *intimate*
and *individual* takes thought.

Best,

Natasha

The tallest buildings use steel for structural strength.  The tallest
non-guyed buildings are the twin Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, 1455
feet, I think.  They are office buildings, possibly with some residential
units.  They are right next to each other and are connected by a catwalk
about halfway up.  The tallest guyed towers are for TV transmitting
antennas and are as high as about 1400 to 2000 feet.  I think the tallest
one was in Poland, but it fell sometime in the 1980s.


Steel is used for very tall buildings because it the most economical
material for that use.  If cost is no object, other materials which have
a higher strength to weight ratio than steel could be used, such as
titanium or perhaps carbon fiber composites.  Doubtless much taller
buildings could be constructed using steel than already have been, and
even taller using titanium, but there is no economic justification for
it.  As buildings get higher than about 1000 feet, they become
increasingly hazardous to aircraft.


Beyond the issue of choice of materials, extraordinarily tall buildings
need a good foundation.  The reason why most very tall buildings in
Manhattan are in Midtown is that the bedrock comes closer to the surface
there, making it easier to drive foundation pilings down to bedrock.  


All else being equal, for a non-guyed structure, a tapered design, like
the Transamerica building in San Francisco, should allow for greater
height.  A practical problem with very tall office/residential buildings
is that the overhead associated with servicing the upper floors takes up
so much space on the lower floors, and costs so much, that the building
becomes uneconomical.  Many elevators must be provided, for example, to
service a very tall building, as the occupants would not want to wait 40
minutes every time they want to take an elevator.  The infrastructure of
emergency stairs, water supply, fire protection, sewage service,
electrical and communications cables, heating, air conditioning,
ventilation, and maintenance service elevators takes up a lot of space. 
Water pumps, pressure tanks, electrical transformers, and emergency
systems are needed throughout much of the building.  It becomes
overwhelming and the building chokes on its own infrastructure.

Gina this is a most complicated question.  Ignoring wind loads and
assuming a perfectly isotropic material (shear strength the same in
all planes), and assuming a constant gravitational field and a perfectly
rigid foundation, etc, (all the reasonable engineering assumptions)
the tower would look like a trumpet bell, wide at the base, growing
narrower as it ascends, round cross section if the cutting planes
are parallel to the ground.  The failure mechanism is a shear stress
failure on a plane 45 degrees from horizontal.  The height of the
tower depends on the material.  Do you wish to restrict your thinking
to steel?  One could go higher if you assume titanium or some other
expensive material.  Any other restrictions?  spike

Well, the sky is not the limit if you are willing to throw enough
mass at it.  A weak material can simply be piled up to any height.
100Km using dirt?  No problem if you have the mass of a continent
to work with!  The question you might be asking is "What is the
highest practical structure one can build".  Practical here is
usually defined as "a building that can pay for itself", such as
office space.  The biggest problem with building tall office
buildings seems to be the elevators.  The cables get very long,
and you need a lot of elevators to service all those long trips
up and down.  A surface to volume ratio scaling problem, I think.

But if you just want to build a very inspiring sculpture (an idea
that has tickled me now and then), you could build miles high -
if someone would pay for all that material.  Taken to the limit,
I believe you wind up with a taper ratio for a given material that
allows you to build to geosynchronous orbit (and then some, to
balance the mass).  The taper ratio is (experts correct me here,
I'm guessing) the ratio of the cross sections of the thick part to
the thin end.  Such a "skyhook" is possible with current materials
(carbon fiber) but the taper ratio is so bad that we couldn't
afford the mass of material until we have diamondoid or buckytube
cable.

If you support the structure from below, I believe plain old steel
and concrete could be built up for miles - again, tapered, wide at
the base.

I did some calculations once for another approach.  Build a tapered,
hollow carbon fiber tube.  Pressurize the inside with hydrogen - to
enormous pressure, enough so that the tube is never in compression
vertically.  Specifically, the taper is set so that from the top
view, the area of a given length of tube provides enough "lift" from
the internal pressurization to support that length.  Just a thought
experiment, but, one might build a second, straight tube up the
center, and evacuate it.  Now you can electrically accelerate into
space without that pesky atmosphere getting in the way.  Reaching
100Km or more with a 1Km wide base was not a problem by my
calculation, if I remember correctly.  That was fifteen years ago,
so I'm vague on the width of the base.  But, again, geosync altitude
was possible if totally impractical.  In the real world, side forces
such as wind might set the taper ratio.  To say nothing of earthquakes-
the taper would probably make a nice continuously shifting acoustic
impedance for ground waves, causing the structure to whip to shreds
at some height (literally, whip, as in those tapered leather things
that go supersonic at the end for the same reason).

I want to see a sculpture built in some geologically stable desert, say, in Utah.  A single hand, reaching up for the sky, about a mile or two high.  Clouds forming and clinging to it at altitude some times, or the fingers disappearing into the cloud deck.  Perhaps, if built where there is a predictable cloud deck height, the hand is opened out as if supporting the clouds.  This is worth a few billion, don't you think?  Why not embarrass the Egyptians and their piddly pyramids?

Ron I may have misinterpreted Gina's original question.  Assuming
she did not restrict herself to a *building* as we know it, but meant
*any* structure, practical or otherwise, in a 1 G field, how high could
it go?  Lets ignore wind loads, since everyone would have different
assumptions on that, plus the aero drag on circular cross sections
are approximation-ey.  Also, lets forget fiber composites, since they
tend to be lousy in compression, and ignore soils restrictions (assume
an infinitely rigid infinitessimally flat base).

Surprise:  for this kind of application, good old common steel does
as well as titanium.  The ratio of the sheer moduli (Ti/steel) is almost
the same as their density ratio (in fact steel is *slightly* better than Ti.
Steel beats aluminum and magnesium too).  So assume a steel tower
and a solid round cross section since making it hollow doesnt allow you to
go any higher.

Lets assume a steel tower, minimum diameter of one meter at the
top, maximum diameter of  200 m at the base, sheer modulus of
8.3E4 MPa and a density of 7.8 g/cm^3.  Come back tomorrow
with an answer, see if we get the same.  spike

*FLOATING SMART BALLS IN SPACE
Dont swat that fly buzzing around your head  it might just be a robot!
NASA scientists are said to be working on Star Wars-like personal robots
that astronauts will use in space. They look like those floating orbing that
tested Luke Skywalker's light-saber skills in Star Wars.  But thats where
the similarities end.  NASAs flying robots will monitor life-support
systems, take pictures, and fix minor problems. Theyll also have a range of
sensors on them, including sonar to keep them from bumping into things. And
theyll be smart  able to respond to voice commands and offload complex
processing to the spacecraft's central computers. And no, it cant play
light-saber games.

*THE BLOCK BOX INVADES CARS
The infamous airplane black box is getting closer to home  and it could
change everything from accident investigation to the insurance business. The
Black Box, which is actually neon orange in colour, is a very rugged
recording machine that logs flight data and communications in an airplane.
If that plane crashes, investigators recover the black box and can trace
what happened. Well, you may already have a Black Box in your car!  General
Motors has been quietly installing black boxes into 1999 Buick Century,
Cadillac Eldorado, and other high-end cars. The data includes the car's
speed, if seat belts were worn, and if the brakes were used prior to the
crash. While everyone agrees its a great idea for finding out why a car
crashed, privacy advocates are concerned a device that can remember
everything might be used improperly.  For instance, could someone else use
your data to prove that you caused an accident?  Time will tell.

*Scientists compose HIV-suppressing compound
Kyodo News Service/Associated Press
SENDAI, July 17 (Kyodo) -- A group of scientists said Saturday it has
composed a nucleic acid compound which effectively prevents AIDS-causing HIV
from multiplying.
A research group led by Hiroshi Orui, professor at Tohoku University, and
Shiro Shigeta, professor at Fukushima Medical College, said the compound was
especially effective against multiple-drug resistant HIV, whose infection is
particularly hard to fight.
The composition of the compound is expected to lead to development of new
AIDS-fighting drugs. The scientists also said they are preparing to conduct
joint research on the substance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
Orui composed 4'ethynyl-2'deoxycytidine, a nucleic acid compound similar to
azidothymidine (AZT), a typical anti-AIDS drug.
Shigeta added the composed chemical to multi-drug resistant HIV, and found
the substance synthesized by Orui to be about 50,000 times as effective as
AZT in stopping the virus from multiplying.
Mixtures of several chemicals that arrest the action of HIV are now
routinely prescribed for people with HIV as the most effective way to combat
AIDS, but HIV often quickly becomes resistant to some of the chemicals.
The compound's efficacy for ordinary HIV proved to be about five times that
of AZT, Shigeta said.
HIV, whose genes are carried by ribonucleic acid (RNA), not by DNA which
serves as a carrier of most creatures' genetic information, takes over
healthy cells by weaving its viral genetic material in with the cell's DNA,
and rapidly makes multiple copies of itself.
An HIV enzyme called reverse transcriptase which converts HIV's RNA into
DNA, helps the virus crawl into human cells.
Orui found that AZT and other nucleic acids inhibit the enzyme from
functioning.
Orui said he believes the new compound works well for multi-drug resistant
HIV, because it functions differently from AZT. He said he hopes it would
help develop nontoxic anti-AIDS drugs.
Treatment using several drugs often causes toxic side effects.
The researchers are scheduled to report on their findings at a symposium on
nucleic acid chemistry to be held in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture, in
November.

*Letter: Threat of gene tests
The Guardian
The recommendations of the human genetics advisory commission (Go- ahead for
genetic testing on employees, July 15) may lead to a genetic underclass
excluded from work and have a negative impact on wider public health goals,
if, as they suggest, responsibility for health and safety shifts from the
employer to the individual employee.
The HGAC argues that employers should test employees for genetic variations
that would put them at increased risk of developing a disease if they worked
in a particular job. What would this mean in practice? For example,
approximately one in 20 people who are heavily exposed to asbestos will
develop the rare lung cancer, mesothelioma. If we follow the recommendations
of the HGAC, then employers would be encouraged to identify and exclude
those workers with a predisposition to lung cancer, instead of being obliged
to remove or reduce carcinogenic substances from the workplace.
Though the HGAC says genetic data should be covered by data protection,
elsewhere you warn that new technology is threatening personal privacy in
the workplace. Without statutory protection against discrimination (the
disability discrimination act does not cover predisposition to a disease),
workers could be excluded from employment in the industries for which they
are skilled. Fear of potential discrimination may also deter people from
taking genetic tests of benefit to them and their families.

*Meteor contains new form of carbon
(CNN) -- A new form of carbon previously made in the laboratory also exists

researchers say.
Luann Becker of the University of Hawaii and scientists at NASA report that
they found "buckyballs" in a crushed piece of the Allende meteorite that
landed in Mexico in 1969.
Buckyballs are soccer-ball shaped molecules first synthesized in the
laboratory in 1985.
"It's not every day that you discover a new carbon molecule in nature," said
Becker in a statement. "If it played a role in how the Earth evolved, that
would be important."
Robert Curl and Richard Smalley of Rice University and Harold Kroto of the
University of Sussex in England received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
1996 for accidentally synthesizing the pure carbon in vaporizing
experiments.
They named the molecules, the third form of pure carbon along with diamonds
and graphite, "buckminsterfullerenes" after Buckminster Fuller, the engineer
who designed geodesic domes. The name usually is shortened to buckyballs.

*Scientists following Einstein's theoretical footsteps  including Stephen
Hawking and Princeton University's Edward Witten  will pick up where he
left off during an international conference this week that starts Monday.
Physicists are gathering at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational
Physics in Potsdam  recently given the additional title of the Albert
Einstein Institute  just miles from where the century's greatest mind
worked before leaving his native country forever in 1932.
"The idea is that somehow we want to take up that broken tradition again,"
said Professor Hermann Nicolae, one of the directors of the institute, which
is playing host for the first time to the annual physics conference.
Lectures and papers at the six-day conference will focus on proving string
theory, which would allow scientists to unite the two primary theories in
physics: Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory. That
would mean physicists could explain how the world works in a single theory,
possibly unlocking the secrets of black holes or the Big Bang.
"It's not that we think of Einstein when we work, but we certainly have this
towering figure in the background from whom much of the subject originated,"
said Michael Green, a conference participant and professor in the department
of applied math and theoretical physics at Cambridge University in England.
A unifying theory was something Einstein worked on in Germany, and then
later after he came to the United States to teach at Princeton University.
It was a problem he would never solve.
"The attempt of unifying things would be something like a grand continuation
of Einstein's work," said Professor Emeritus Juergen Ehlers, the founding
director of the Planck-Einstein institute.
"If one could get around that and have a unified picture again, nobody would
be happier about that than Einstein himself."
In Caputh, away from the hustle of city life in nearby Berlin, Einstein felt
he could contemplate the physics problem that remains unanswered today.
"He wanted to have a place where no one would disturb him," said Erika
Britzke, the caretaker of Einstein's summer home, located just outside the
city of Potsdam on the outskirts of Berlin.
When Hitler came to power in 1933, Einstein was out of the country. Friends
warned him of the danger he faced as Jew if he returned. He never did.
The wooden summer house is one of the few relics of Einstein's time in
Germany. His apartment in Berlin was destroyed in World War II, and most of
his papers are at Hebrew University in Jerusalem or at Princeton.
The paint is peeling off the sides of the dark red, Bauhaus-influenced home
that was designed especially for the Einstein family. After Einstein left,
the home was given to a Jewish boarding school but later confiscated by the
Nazi party.
For decades, the house was used as a residence owned by the community of
Caputh. It was not until 1979 that the house was named a historic landmark
and restored  down to the spartan desk that furnished Einstein's
bedroom-office, rebuilt after the architect who originally designed the
house recalled the plans from memory, Britzke said.
On a recent weekday afternoon, a group of tourists crowded by the gate to
the summer home, but Britzke turned them away: The house is only open on
weekends by appointment. During the week, the private Einstein Forum hosts
seminars for scientists in exchange for paying maintenance costs.
Einstein never wanted a museum dedicated to his life, Britzke said. In any
case, his legacy lies more in the work of the scientists attending this
week's conference, for many of whom the image of Einstein's wiry hair and
intense gaze will always be watching over their work.
"I've been fascinated with Einstein and his work most of my life," said Gary
Horowitz, a conference participant from the physics department at University
of California at Santa Barbara. "I'm happy to be continuing his work."

How you can see knowing how to perform proof by induction or quadratic
equations as necessary to make my point is beyond me - the specifics are not
in question. Anyway, as I said earlier, what we're debating is all
speculation anyway, neither of us can say the other is definitely wrong, so
let's just agree to disagree.....

Ha! It's the Nanogirl variation on Pascal's wager, with
physical immortality as the prize instead of Paradise.

If I had a submissive bone in my body, I'd go for it :-)

The Petronas towers are a joke, an 80 something story building with
a twenty story spike on top, the fact is from the observation deck
of the Sears tower you look down on the Petronas towers. The clowns
that decide all this had to change the criteria as to what made a
building the tallest, they came up with 5 requirements. The
Petronas Towers got one, the World trade center got one, and the
Sears tower got three.

The Sears tower solved the elevator problem by having three
elevators in each shaft, you have to transfer about every 33
floors, only a few elevators go all the way. Trivia question: How
many elevators does the Sears tower have? Answer: same as the
number of floors, 110.

True, he never said as much, but let's face it: there's nothing at all
even remotely special about that rock, and the only reason anyone
might think there is is because ey /wants/ there to be.  I've seen all
the pictures, read the descriptions, and I simply don't see anything
"anomalous" or interesting, because there's nothing to see.  This is
not closed-mindedness, just honest observation.  Wasting money on this
that could be spent looking for real extraterrestrial life is silly.

Resisting dogmatism doesn't mean one has to fall prey to every
baseless idea that floats by.  It just means that one should try
not to color one's perceptions by what one wants to believe.  I,
like many others here I'm sure, would like to believe that there
once was a civilization on Mars.  But there's simply no evidence
to justify that--not even enough evidence to justify wasting time
and money examining a perfectly ordinary rock.

I really don't understand what you're talking about here: first you say you
were, as I implied, talking about using the preexisting shuttle, then you
say that actually you'd have to alter it substantially.

And, previously you said:
>>a retrofitted Shuttle would make an ideal vehicle for shipping 
>>hardware to the Moon 

Ok, you rip off the wings, you rip off the tail, you replace the life support
system with something which can operate for longer, you throw away the SSMEs 
and replace them with something like RL-10s, you fill the cargo bay with fuel 
tanks, you rip out the wheels and install landing legs, you fit more engines
underneath for landing, you rip off the tiles, you remove the toilet because 
it can't be serviced in space, you take it apart and rebuild it with less
strengthening because it doesn't need to handle 3g acceleration any more,
etc, etc. You end up with a vehicle which bears almost no resemblance to 
the Shuttle, and probably costs far more and is far less useful than a 
new vehicle designed from scratch.

And in your universe, this is "an ideal vehicle for shipping hardware to the
Moon." Right.

>the Mars Face; I _think_ that it deserves more attention. 

Look, the 'Mars Face' is a rock, and a pretty dull and ordinary rock at
that. The only reason it's getting the slightest bit of attention is because
in the early low-resolution photos it looked a little bit like a face
because of the low resolution and the lighting angle and the foo freaks jumped
on that as support for their bizarre beliefs. If we'd seen it first in the 
current high-resolution photos no-one would have given it the slightest 
thought. The Mars Smiley Face and the Io Rubber Chicken are far more 
convincing than anything Hoagland and his followers have come up with.

Cross posting it to two different groups that may find this link funny for

Completely unnecessary.  With the right booster, the shuttle without *any*
modifications could easily reach lunar orbit. The shuttle has already proven
it has the capacity to handle a crew of 8 for 19 days.  If we cut the crew down
to 5, the shuttle could stay in orbit for over a month. Depending on the specific
impulse of our inter-orbital thrusters, the shuttle could easily reach lunar orbit
in less than a week.  This would give the crew plenty of time to drop off any
payload (including a lunar lander) in Lunar orbit and return to Earth. Now having
the shuttle itself land on the lunar surface is an entirely different matter - and
would require such a large degree of re-enginering to make it a waste if time.
Needless to say, the shuttle as an existing technology could easily be "retrofitted"
for travel and small payload delivery around cis-lunar space and the various
lagrange points.

------=_NextPart_000_56018913_10a69716$612717e9
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hey Nanogirl,

     Hmmmm....you want me to be your loyal, devoted servant for all 
eternity, catering to your every whim, ministering to your every fetish, 
undoubtedly committing numurous acts repulsive to any decent sensibility?
     WAY Cool!!! (I always like to keep a respectful distance from  "decent 
sensibilities" anyway- several megaparsecs is about right:-)
I just have a few minor questions:

1.   When you promise to make me "immortal" are you referring to:
mere removal of aging/disease; basic uploading; uploading with 
copies;uploading with self-updating&replicating copies; assigning me
my own nested hiearchy of basement universes for archival 
storage/processing; or what?

2.    Do you require the avalability of my undivided person at all times, or 
could my seperately instantiated subpersonas be on duty in shifts?  If the 
latter, how many would you want, on average, at any given time?: a. 1-1000; 
b.1001-23000; c.23001-10**12;                  d. 10**12-10**10**100; e. 
 >10**10**100

3.   Are my couterparts in parellel universes also bound by this agreement?  
What about my analogs in other times?

4.    If some of my instantiated subpersonas depart the solar system at a 
velocity that precludes realtime interaction, is this automatically 
considered a breach? or can the satisfy the contract by taking emulations of 
you along?

5.  Is any part of this contract foreseeably likely to involve substantial 
self-mutilation, self-modification, self-transcendance, or recursive 
self-contradiction?

6.  According to the contract, it is enforcable in a "court of law".
Does this refer to common, napoleonic, admiralty, statute, canon, maritime, 
space, equity, contract, natural, polycentric, international or scientific 
"law"?  And, whatever type is chosen, what procedure is there to prevent 
mentally constipated geezers(of any age or gender)
whose chief claim to distinction is being able to continually & phonetically 
fart through their windpipes, from passing themselves off as "judges"?

7.   Does the "any specified time" rule apply to alternate timelines?

8.   Is failure to invent time travel and thus observe the terms of the 
contract before signing considered a breach?

9. In the event of time dilation, suspended animation, paratime abduction, 
or other such eventuality, how is the differential in timeline between the 
parties to be resolved?

10. Is indefinite, infinite, transinfinite or omegan duration being 
promised?

11. If the party of the second part divides for any reason into differential 
subpersonas, xoxes, parellel competing Exes or other such
multiple entities, how are competing claims for the services/attentions of 
the party of the first part to be resolved?

12. Do you possess adequate, verifiable Temporal Liability Insurance to 
cover the possibility of your being in any manner and from any cause unable 
to perform as stipulated?

13.  There have been many unverified, anecdotal reports of a metaphorical 
being making similar offers, only to default in some imaginative manner once
the contract was irrevocably signed.  This being, known as the devil(aka 
satan, "prince of darkness", baal, beelzebub, antichrist, & William Gates, 
Sr.) appears to operate an enterprise using the tradename "Hell", which has 
been variously alleged to be a closely held corporation, a holding 
company(pending conversion to a going concern at some future date known only 
as the "end times" & allegedly the most jealously guarded trade secret of 
the devil's chief metaphorical competitor), or a nine-level MLM (alleged by 
an obvious nut case who claims to have recieved a personal guided tour of 
all three of the largest direct competitors in this industry). Are you in 
any way connected with this enterprise? & are you willing, in view of the 
bleak record of contract compliance in this field generally, to post a 
reasonable performance bond to insure compliance? I estimate
something in the range of 15-20GSEs(galactic superclauster equivalents), 
posted with any reputable arbiter, should do it(however,the amount is 
negotiable within reason)

Well, that does it for now.  Looking foreward to doing business w/ you
for quite a while to come:-)

<br>
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you promise to make me &quot;immortal&quot; are you referring to:
<br>mere removal of aging/disease; basic uploading; uploading with copies;uploading with self-updating&amp;replicating copies; assigning me
<br>my own nested hiearchy of basement universes for archival storage/processing; or what?
<br>
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you require the avalability of my undivided person at all times, or could my seperately instantiated subpersonas be on duty in shifts?&nbsp; If the latter, how many would you want, on average, at any given time?: a. 1-1000; b.1001-23000; c.23001-10**12;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. 10**12-10**10**100; e. &gt;10**10**100
<br>
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are my couterparts in parellel universes also bound by this agreement?&nbsp; What about my analogs in other times?
<br>
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If some of my instantiated subpersonas depart the solar system at a velocity that precludes realtime interaction, is this automatically considered a breach? or can the satisfy the contract by taking emulations of you along?
<br>
<br>5.&nbsp; Is any part of this contract foreseeably likely to involve substantial self-mutilation, self-modification, self-transcendance, or recursive self-contradiction?
<br>
<br>6.&nbsp; According to the contract, it is enforcable in a &quot;court of law&quot;.
<br>Does this refer to common, napoleonic, admiralty, statute, canon, maritime, space, equity, contract, natural, polycentric, international or scientific &quot;law&quot;?&nbsp; And, whatever type is chosen, what procedure is there to prevent mentally constipated geezers(of any age or gender)
<br>whose chief claim to distinction is being able to continually &amp; phonetically fart through their windpipes, from passing themselves off as &quot;judges&quot;?
<br>
<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the &quot;any specified time&quot; rule apply to alternate timelines?
<br>
<br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is failure to invent time travel and thus observe the terms of the contract before signing considered a breach?
<br>
<br>9. In the event of time dilation, suspended animation, paratime abduction, or other such eventuality, how is the differential in timeline between the parties to be resolved?
<br>
<br>10. Is indefinite, infinite, transinfinite or omegan duration being promised?
<br>
<br>11. If the party of the second part divides for any reason into differential subpersonas, xoxes, parellel competing Exes or other such
<br>multiple entities, how are competing claims for the services/attentions of the party of the first part to be resolved?
<br>
<br>12. Do you possess adequate, verifiable Temporal Liability Insurance to cover the possibility of your being in any manner and from any cause unable to perform as stipulated?
<br>
<br>13.&nbsp; There have been many unverified, anecdotal reports of a metaphorical being making similar offers, only to default in some imaginative manner once
<br>the contract was irrevocably signed.&nbsp; This being, known as the devil(aka satan, &quot;prince of darkness&quot;, baal, beelzebub, antichrist, &amp; William Gates, Sr.) appears to operate an enterprise using the tradename &quot;Hell&quot;, which has been variously alleged to be a closely held corporation, a holding company(pending conversion to a going concern at some future date known only as the &quot;end times&quot; &amp; allegedly the most jealously guarded trade secret of the devil's chief metaphorical competitor), or a nine-level MLM (alleged by an obvious nut case who claims to have recieved a personal guided tour of all three of the largest direct competitors in this industry). Are you in any way connected with this enterprise? &amp; are you willing, in view of the bleak record of contract compliance in this field generally, to post a reasonable performance bond to insure compliance? I estimate
<br>something in the range of 15-20GSEs(galactic superclauster equivalents), posted with any reputable arbiter, should do it(however,the amount is negotiable within reason)
<br>
<br>Well, that does it for now.&nbsp; Looking foreward to doing business w/ you
<br>for quite a while to come:-)

I can agree with you on the grounds that within our current resource constraints,
we have to more prudent in prioritizing what we spend our money on, and
the 'Face on Mars' may certainly not fall into that category.  What I object to is the
unfair categorization you have thrown on Mac Tonnies.  Calling him a 'crackpot'
IMHO crossed the line from civility to bullying.  As extropians I expect that we
can make the most sincere attempts to resist such temptations despite our
all too human urges to the contrary.

With Sincerity,

Mr. Tonnies may not be a rabid crackpot like Hoagland, but my post
"how to spot a crackpot" pointed out common rhetorical tricks and
and easily-spotted signs of such psychoceramics that critical
thinkers should recognize and beware of.  If pointing out bullshit
in uncivil, then civility is overrated.

Of course, Beryllium is waaaay better than steel for building
Gina's tower.  Be Modulus is a third again higher and density

Express elevators could be set up like a conveyor belt, with an 'up'
shaft next to a 'down' shaft.  That would require sideways car transfer
from shaft to shaft at the top and bottom.  The shafts would be filled
with as many cars as there are express stops.

I'm an experienced news/mail/list server (majordomo, ezmlm) admin. 10+
years, and I do it for a living.

I know I'm late, but I can't read extropians anywhere near real-time.

I believe you also have to take into account the pressure differential
between the top and bottom of the building.  Unless you want to have
the entire top offices sucked into the elevator shafts every time you
open a door. :)

And, N.B., every shaft needed to serve an additional floor takes up
space on _all_ the floors below, so that the space lost to elevators
per added floor increases with the height.  Eventually a point is
reached where the space added by going up one more floor is canceled
by the decrease in usable space on the floors below, so that nothing
is gained -- *assuming* that the idea is to create usable space.  If
you are just trying for a height record, no expense spared, then
presumably you can do at least as well as the natural relief of the
earth's surface, and if you imagine another order-of-magnitude
increase in the strength-to-weight ratio of the materials, then of

Why that? The pressure is different even in today's building, but
there is no flow because gravity compensates.

Could you help me out al little further? (here's the idea elaborated) This
structure would be just that, only devised to demonstrate the possible
height. It would not be a building, or have an elevator or door. It would
just be the least amount of required materials to achieve maximum tall. Can
I have some answers on how high and how minimal of a structure could be
built. If I were to build as far as is humanly possible, how high could I go
with the perfect circumference (as minimal as possible yet strong enough to
hold up).

Hello everyone,

I have been fascinated again by the thoughts put forth on how females choose 
their mating partners whether for short or long-term.  I find the Mr. buns 
vrs. Mr. brains argument intriguing though like some have said I think what 
woman want and what the attractive and intelligent women get is a man with 
both qualities!!!  I know for this as a a fact having heard the want from 
"alpha female" of having "alpha males" who in both ways have the right 
stuff.  Many of the true alpha males of course want to play the field and 
not settle down!  And so I hang around alpha females who will date me but 
not commit while they whine about not having "full access" to an alpha male. 
  Women have really caught on now more then ever that brains combined with 
some ambition make for a man who can make life more pleasant for them.  Of 
course some females (and males) are forced by their own limitations to 
settle for 'second best' in terms of brains and/or looks.  The human mating 
game is a cruel one to be sure.  Well, this goes without saying.

Certainly though a person can do a great deal to make themselves more 
attractive to possible partners by getting a good education, being 
physically fit(so simple but so many are over-weight and out of shape), 
dressing well and having a sense of self and goals.  Of course this is all 
easier said then done and we are still hemmed in by limitations depending on 
who we are and the luck of the genetic dice.

My bestfriend's father gave me excellent advice years ago that I did not 
appreciate till recently.  He said that women would in their teens and early 
twenties go for the charming and handsome jerks but at least some of the 
women would wise up and see that a good man with a decent job was more 
important then being with a charming rogue who would eventually wipe their 
feet on them.  Of course some women never learn but neither do some men.

He said that I just needed to set goals and be headed in the right direction 
in a way that women could see I was headed somewhere good and that would 
attract them.  The analogy is that of "not rocking the boat" for women but 
instead staying on course for your goals and letting the quality women come 
to you.  Just keep your cool man!  But it is easier said then done!

At age 32 I am only half-way done with my degree and do not always heed my 
own advice.  I find women I am attracted to can really fry my brain and 
heart.  I just crave the companionship and love of a good woman so badly.  
But I do not want to jump into a bad relationship either so I bear the pain 
quietly.  I should have gotten my degree years ago but laziness, learning 
disabilities, a.d.d. and depression helped to prevent it.  I thought why 
bother getting a degree if I have no driver's license due to learning 
disabilities?  Many years have been lost but hopefully my degree, future 
career and marriage will be all the sweeter due to the wait.  I feel the 
time swiftly going by and do not want to hit 40 not having achieved my 
goals.  I want a wife and  children by then.

Last night I called at a $42.50 cost (expensive for me-calling card) an 
aussie gal I care about who went in for surgery today.  I consoled her and 
tried to cheer her up.  We have been email pals for six months now but the 
romantic bond once there has faded.  I tried over the phone to reconnect 
with her in a moment of fear for her.

The problem is she is done with her degree and just started teaching.  I 
have a ways to go and I am poor and not a driver even.  She is beautiful, 
smart and educated so when in October she travels to Utah where she would 
like to settle it will be a feeding frenzy for the guys there to try to gain 
her favor.  I want her to visit me and she said she and her female 
travelling companion might but only after they have already been to Utah a 
month.  That is too much time for her to meet another.

I have two big regrets about her.  One is that I lied to her about my age 
saying I was 25 instead of an 'old' 32!  I know I must level with her but 
have not and that may derail everything.  But I must do it.  And I should 
have phone called her every week starting the first week we 'hit it off' and 
she implored me to call her up!!  A powerful bond could have been forged 
between us by doing by my calling her up once a week but the possible cost 
and my lie kept me from doing it.

But now I am doing it and I will play this out to the bitter end.  There are 
other women in my life both on the net and in the 'real world' but I had my 
heart set on Becky.  I have had my heart ripped out of my chest and stepped 
on before so I will most likely survive.

Perhaps this makes me 'unfit' along with my l.d. but my depression hits me 
hard.  I hope when I go back on a brand I think will do the job I will be 
able to gain the joy and strength that I presently lack in my life.

I wish you all well.  I look forward to any comments anyone might have.  
What I read on this list often thrills my heart and mind.  Take care 
everyone!

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Actually, ergoloid mesylates, "hydergine", is pretty effective in lowering 
blood pressure for about 50% of people who take it.  It also lowers heart 
rate for about the same number.  I get about a 20 point drop in blood 
pressure and 10 beats per minute drop in heart rate at 20mg. per day.  My 
experience dates from about 1978 to present, with occasional gaps.  
Unfortunately, although the generic can be gotten at a reasonable price from 
foreign sources, the U.S. brands are fairly expensive.

Sorry to hear that.  This is one of the more stressful work cycles.  I've 
been taking melatonin since it came available in the health food market.  I 
have noticed that if I stop taking my 3mg. per day, I get a major energy 
boost sometimes that lasts for about a week.  Then I get very tired.

Atmospheric pressure at sea level averages about 14.5 psi, which is about
one ton per square foot.  At an elevation of 1122 feet above sea level,
it averages about 0.6 psi less than that.  But the pressure at any level
in the building should be just about the same as the pressure outside the
building at that level, unless the pressure in the building is
intentionally altered.

Don't get me started.  Most women seem to have an underlying contempt for 
men based on the fact that men like them and are willing to spend virtually 
any effort to have physical contact with them.  What this says about their 
opinion of themselves goes without saying - so to speak... ;)  
Unfortunately, this contempt is often justified, at least in the context.  
How many times have you seen some guy making up a whole romantic fantasy 
about some female whose only virtues are a carefully practiced smile and the 
right topology?

Also, the first thing that most women want someone in a relationship to do 
is to compromise.  Among groups of women, they all tell each other some 
embarrassing secret.  That proves trust supposedly, and then they feel safe 
to be intimate.  This behavior carries over to how they deal with men.  The 
man is supposed to tell them all kinds of sweet lies, proving that he cares 
more about them than the facts of reality.

On a related topic, even among women - the "libertarian," or "extropian" 
women to whom you refer - who do have something on the ball, isn't it 
obvious that they are not judged by the same standard - by men?

There are some very smart and responsible women in the world, but how many 
times have we seen airheads running organizations made up largely of 
brilliant men who allowed some ambitious woman to take the reins simply 
because they wouldn't stand up and state the plain truth: "you don't know 
beans about the subject matter, and you have no business running this 
organization."  Fact is that women tend to love group projects and 
"organizing," and being the leader and getting to determine who gets to 
speak is a real rush.  After all, unlike men, women are taught from birth to 
make their relationships with others the primary purpose and goal of their 
lives.  Their own personal capabilities in the real world are of secondary 
importance - or so the cultural programming goes.  So a lot of these 
obnoxious "leaders" are just women running with that ball.

Then the best people leave and the organization is slowly run into the 
ground.  One of my tests for women - or men, although it rarely applies in 
their case - in positions of power is attention span.  Usually I can come up 
with something worth saying that takes about a minute to say.  In the same 
context, most of the men - say 90% - usually have no problem listening for a 
minute.  They expect good ideas to take time to present.  About an equal 
percentage of the women, however, glaze over at 30 seconds.

This is not to say that there aren't plenty of airhead men out there.  When 
they try to get into positions of power, however, they tend to get judged 
more critically, and that expectation no doubt stops a lot of the would be 
power seekers in their tracks.  In technically oriented organizations, the 
men in power tend to be overqualified and are usually stealing time from 
their work, at which they are often the top of their craft.

rant, rant, rant - you can fill in the blanks from here, as I know that most 
men have had these experiences.

I really feel for the women who are very competent and who constantly fight 
the battle of being seen first as a female and then also being judged by the 
kind of experience I noted above.

Don't be sorry about it yet - we are hoping its a good thing. 8 hours to
yourself (call volumes are very low, but someone has to be here just in
case), nice fat internet connection, a fully equipped office environment,
and peace and quiet during the day to snooze - this may be very positive.
Especially since we are trying to get a serious on-line concern off the
ground (The Land Canaan, our musical gift to (trans/post)humanity) - lot's
'o' hours with nought (almost) to do but "surf the net dude", it does solve
some problems. And you get paid. 

If Jodie doesn't lose her mind, it should work out rather well. If...

Paul, is this *really* you who wrote this, or an impostor?  Hand over

If you take the shuttle in its current form, make the entire payload
into more fuel and tanks, you *still* would be unable to get the
delta vee necessary to take it to the moon.  Nor would you
want to.

When you say "the right booster" are you suggesting some profoundly
huge liquids, strapped to the external tank?  spike

That is actually a lot like what they had in mind when they built the
Eiffel Tower.  It was partly intended to be a demonstration that steel
could be used to build a very tall structure.  They chose a nice round
number, 300 meters, for its height.  The structure did not have much
utility, except as a landmark, observation platform, and later, as an
elevated place for transmitting antennas.


You say that you want to use the least amount of material to achieve a
maximum height.  If you also want the cost to be reasonable, that would
preclude the use of expensive materials.  I assume you want the structure
to not blow down in a strong wind.  My guess would be that the maximum
height practically possible for a steel tower which carries its own
weight would be about the same whether or not guy wires are used.  But if
guy wires are used, the amount of steel required would be much less.  My
guess would be that the maximum practical height of a steel tower would
be somewhere in the range of 5 to 10 thousand feet.  It would be a
slightly tapered open-frame structure with steel guy lines.  The frame
would suggest a tapering tubular surface.  The most challenging weather
condition for such a structure would be ice storms (freezing rain) which
would cause ice to build up on the struts.  Such a tower would probably
have to be built in a climate zone warm enough that ice deposits would
not occur.


Weather balloons can go as high as 100,000 feet.  If we attached a tether
to a large balloon, a balloon with enough lift to carry a 100,000 foot
long tether, would that count?

This whole thread went off in a direction I never intended.  Ah, the magic
of a web discussion!  {8^D  Perhaps I should have specified I meant
chimps.  Less emotional baggage [that we all carry] from unsuccessful
relationships, broken hearts, etc.  Humans are too complicated.

That said, what I am really looking at here is the implications of mating
behavior to evolution, the future of the race, etc.  Consider the first
humans vs the very similar chimps.  The first humans likely had the
mutation of a straight leg: they could lock the knee and walk on two
legs much more easily than the chimps.  This mutation freed the hands
to manipulate objects.  The critical factor is that being able to manipulate
objects caused the smarter protohumans to have a survival advantage
over dumber protohumans, whereas it is not clear to me that the smarter
chimps have any real reproductive advantage over dumber chimps.

I am way out of my field here, so biologists, please help me out.

This factor would cause the humans to gradually become smarter,
as a group, whereas the chimps went right along eating termites
and doing their chimp things.  Isnt that kinda the way it works?

Nowthen, fast forward to present day.  Humans have been intelligent
now for at least 50k years.  We have developed the technologies
critical to our survival.  What I am driving at with the whole brains
vs buns thing is that there may have been subtle influences that
slightly favored brains, but this influences were subtle indeed.

Now however, it seems society has created a system which gives
an *enormous* reproductive advantage... to being stupid!  Our
welfare system encourages overbreeding by those who cannot
take care of themselves, overbreeding by those who put their
faith in a church that urges them to be fruitful and multiply,
overbreeding by those who are drug addicts, etc.  [Natasha
*almost* went here I think with her carefully worded comments
on teenage pregnancies.]

Those who you and I might agree are the most fit for the future
reproduce only modestly, if it all.  My burden is this: all those
influences that shaped humankind in past millenia were subtle.
Modern influences by comparison are overwhelming and the
implications to our species profound.  spike

Come again?  Apparently you know me better than I know myself, and I find 
this difficult to swallow.  My position on "belief" is that it is a complete 
intellectual cop-out.  I don't "want to believe" anything; I want to know the 
truth, like any rational person.  I'm more than willing to grant you that 
finding an ET civilization on Mars (extinct or otherwise) is an inspiring 
thought, but that's not what the "Face" represents to me, and I'm rather sick 
of being goaded into the postion of "defending" myself when I have absolutely 
nothing to defend.  

>I've seen all the pictures, read the descriptions, and I simply don't see 
anything
>"anomalous" or interesting, because there's nothing to see.  

Observors draw different conclusions, and I'm the first to say that the data 
we currently have isn't sufficient for a verdict one way or another.  
_Again_, I'm not trying to change anyone's mind, if for no other reason than 
there's no reason to conclude anything about the "Face" right now.  But we 
have an orbiter with a wonderful hi-res camera orbiting Mars as I write this. 
 This issue is falsifiable and, as such, is a completely legitimate issue for 
science to deal with--like it or not.

It seems to me that the reason you find the evidence lacking is, 
paradoxically, because we haven't yet gone to the necessary lengths to get 
really _good_ evidence (though what we have is, I maintain, enticing).

>This is not closed-mindedness, just honest observation.  

It's an honest _opinion_, just as mine is.  As such, I can appreciate it. 

>Wasting money on this that could be spent looking for real extraterrestrial

The MGS is in a position to image Cydonia anyway; we don't have to spend a

Perhaps I should have saved some typing and instead responded with the 
following: "You know it all.  I apologize.  I am truly humbled."  Get off 
this brittle and erroneous intellectual high-horse.  No one's out to 
rearrange your personal paradigm.  This issue has nothing to do with 
personality, let alone "belief," as you would so conveniently have it.  If 
only this matter was so binary!

This did get me to thinking about nonideal designs for space hardware.
The notion is to use what we have rather than continually reinventing.
Space hardware is expensive because it is so costly to design and test,
not because it is particularly expensive to produce.  There is a big
advantage to using the external tank and solids, being as we already
have the "mass production" facilites.

But look at it another way.  Every space guy who has ever looked at
the space shuttle has had serious heartburn.  Why oh why did we
*ever* build such an ugly system?  It passes through max Q, maximum
dynamic pressure, with allll thaaat cross sectional area: the two boosters,
the external tank, the orbiter with those wings and tail!  We lose a lot
to aerodynamic drag, and solids, ewww, yuk.  }8-P   Compare that
to the Saturn V, which *was* a good system for going to the moon.
[Having a Saturn V-like system does not preclude the recovery of
the stages, by the way, we just didnt attempt it back then.]


The shuttle is not optimized for passing thru the atmosphere, it is
optimized for passing thru congess.  [You two senators from Utah,
build the boosters.  You senators from Georgia, build the external
tanks...]  What we end up with is about the least efficient system
possible, in terms of performance and cost.  We design it to be
expensive!  No wonder so many rocket companies are springing up.

Compare our shuttle with the way the Chinese do their space systems.
First, they isolate *all* the rocket people, the satellite people, everyone
that does space, in a city off by themselves.  They build the satellites
right there, stack the rockets, launch the rockets, do everything
right there.  They dont have a congress as we know it, so they
dont need to go to the expense of intentionally spreading out
space work to every state in the union.

Paul, you got me started on a rant I fear.  {8-]  Your initial
point may have been: we need to utilize the stuff we have
instead of starting over with each new space idea.  In this
particular case, the space shuttle isnt up to the task.  We
could perhaps use it to lift a moon-bound spacecraft in the
cargo bay.  This is a non-ideal system, but it is the system
we have.  {8-[   Its like using a fire engine to deliver
pizzas.  Makes sense if you need to deliver pizzas and all
you have is a fire engine.  spike

Don't forget opposable thumbs (allowing grasping and making tool 
manufacture and use an evolutionary possible positive to develop), 
improved speaking systems (tongue/jaw/larnyx configurations 
permitting the pronunciation of deeper vowel sounds, such as o and 
u, and the subsequent proliferation of possible distinguishable 
sounds to which could be attached meanings), and neoteny (which 
allowed the bigger brains to finish growing postbirth (after passing 
through a vaginal canal which would still manage to be 
pleasureable for the male to fuck later so he would continue to 
hang around to help provide for his offspring, while allowing the 
pelvic girdle to continue to efficiently perform its architectural 
functions).

Not necessarily all that substantially, and I think it could be done more

...etc.

The wings become superfluous.  You strap on some fuel tanks, refit the cargo 
pay for enhanced life support and fly the thing into lunar orbit and back.  
It never lands; you have a lander ready to go in the cargo bay.  I never said 
this was elegant, only that it was workable.  Interestingly, there's a new 
book out called "Return to the Moon," in which (from reading the jacket) a 
shuttle (!) is hijacked to the Moon.  This discussion was never meant to be 
more than an exerise in feasibility.  And the bottom line is: it's doable.  I 
consider it an option worth looking into, especially in an era that's not 
particularly interested in building spacecraft from scratch. 

>And in your universe, this is "an ideal vehicle for shipping hardware to the

Not ideal, but workable in a pinch.

If it is a mere rock, and I'm perfectly willing to accept that, it's a 
wondrous landform that suggests the presence of a very-near primeval ocean, 
hydothermal activity and a host of other geological mechanisms--all in the 
same mile-long mesa.  It's definitely a hot piece of scientific real estate, 
by any geological standards.

"Freaks"..."followers"..."bizarre beliefs"...

I've noted a persistent inability to deal with the Martian oddities in terms 
other than the lunatic fringe.  This is very familiar, from the most cursory 
examination of the history of scientific inquiry.  Just because something has 
been featured in the tabloid press doesn't mean it's not real--only that the 
tabloid press is using a tissue of reality to sell a ludicrous final cloth of 
lies to the gullible.

Everyone who's posted on this subject automatically assumes the "Face" is a 
false unknown created and perpetuated by one Richard Hoagland.  This is a 
myth. The Face was first brought to attention by NASA itself, though it 
quickly explained it as a "trick of light and shadow" without consulting the 
other existing image in their files (which, as it turned out, confirmed a 
facial resemblance at a radically different sun-angle).

The controversy was revived by a paper called "Unsual Martian Surface 
Features" by Vincent DiPeitro and Gregory Molenaar.  Hoagland is actually 
sort of a latecomer.

Lee,

You seem quite proud of your skeptical prowess, but I don't think you even

_This_ post provides a very instructive lesson on the rhetorical tools used 
by people who can't tell nonsense from speculation.  I hate getting into 
these inane arguments, but this post was too personal and just plain 
wrong-headed.

>"Consistent with" is a great weasel phrase.  All the "wealth of evidence"

Could it be a rock?  Absolutely.  But not only is the Face formation 
consistent (yes, _consistent_) with the Artificiality Hypothesis, it actually 
confirms some of the features just hinted at by the original Viking frames.  
And where did you get "three pictures"?  I think of at least 100 shots of 
Cydonia and areas with similar topology that have helped in the development 
of the Artificiality Hypothesis, not to mention any number of studies using 
everything from fractal algorithms to CAD imaging to classical sculpting 
techniques.  

Again, I'm not saying the Face on Mars is an ET artifact!  But it's worth a 
closer, better look.  I stand by this quite strongly.

>Creating serious-sounding organizations makes your press releases sound

I didn't create SPSR (though I'm flattered by your accusation).  SPSR is a 
group of trained scientists of various types who single-handedly convinced 
NASA to take a second look, and who have presented papers at the American 
Geophysical Union and elsewhere.  I might add that not all of them even 
endorse the Artificiality Hypoethesis.  But they know an anomaly when they 
see it, and they've done soem awfully good work on the subject.  Since you 
seem to be aware of them, I'd like your reaction; they may not be popular, 
but you'd have to have a real problem to accuse them of being crackpots.

Oh, jeez.  Bad word choice!  You got me!  I might add that I know full well

A biographical sketch of _MR._ Mark Carlotto's can be found here: 
http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MJCbio.html.  His work on the Face made the cover 
of "Applied Optics," he was a contributor to Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" series, 
etc. 

I wouldn't be recommending someone's work if I thought they weren't for real. 
 It may of interest that Carlotto has yet to write _anything_ proclaiming the 
Mars anomalies as "real."  He's simply taken vital, completely reproducable 
steps with the evidence we have in an attempt to arrive at a conclusion.  
I've always thought that was good science.

Well, sure, says I, but if it's true that there are no ET's and no
earth like environments naturally occurring anywhere nearby, then isn't
that all the *more* reason to develop the technology to go out and make
some expanding use of all that room and material? Would it really
improve things if there were lots of natural biospheres nice and close,
so we could go out and trash them? Maybe this is an overly logical
point, or something, but as a long time space development enthusiast
myself, I just *can't* see this as a true, or complete, reason for any
perceived lack of interest in outer space prospects! What is more
compelling, I think, is that all people, myself included, often tend to
discount anything that just seems *impractical* to do, at the moment. If
it is enormously expensive to go out there and enormously expensive to
build a livable home when you get there, *that's* pretty impractical, an
economic basis for rational disinterest, in other words.

In addition to the possibility of successful space habitats, it's also
worth noting that if our space neighborhood is perhaps not so
*biologically* interesting, at least compared to the Earth, there are
surely lot's of *other* scientific areas of interest? In essence, we've
got lots of things to study in space, including maybe some sort of life
discovery someday, plus we've got the opportunity to take life and
civilization into new areas! That's truly a logical and reasonable
argument for taking an interest, it seems to me -- but unfortunately,
the current economic limitations seem to just blow all such ideas right
out of the heads of most folks! Combine this with a kind of innate
conservatism, the idea that we've always expanded by appropriating or
altering the habitats of pre-existing life *before*, and it seems that
we have a kind of vicious, economically reinforced meme circle! The meme
circle says that space is too expensive to live in, and you can't really
take living things or advanced tech out there to help the situation,
since it's never really been done before, you see, and why, that just
*proves* it'll always be too expensive! Space boosters who've been too
early with optimistic predictions haven't always helped the situation, I
suppose, so the meme circle just gets stronger, "it can't be done, at
least not at all soon, because it hasn't been done yet".

Don't forget that such transhuman tech developments should help a lot,
right where it counts most, in making space access more economical. For
instance, it's been mentioned often enough that advanced, self
replicative nano should allow a very significant improvement in space
hardware, the actual stuff that you need to get into space, and live
there. As for AI, again, it's almost a truism that this should help with
the design end of things. And medical advances -- well one could go on,
the exact timing of all this being more than a little uncertain, to say
the least.

Given that the timing of advanced tech is so uncertain, I think that the
Space Station could be a good investment in the sense of beginning the
new frontier just a little "early"? For instance, think of any medical
advances toward allowing people to live comfortably in space; shouldn't
such developments help in understanding the human condition on Earth?
Also,
Greg Burch mentioned refurbishing satellites at the Station. Perhaps
some company could make an early beginning toward retrieving *lunar*
materials for building or refueling satellites -- the Station ought to
be a natural base for that, for the processing or repair work needed in
low orbit, I mean, even this is done only as the occasional small
experiment, at first. Notice that we're not *necessarily* talking grand
trips into deep space here, although a Space Station *could* prove to be
a worthwhile launching base for far ranging manned missions, as well. I
guess it's just unbelievable to me that a multi-use space research
laboratory has been so panned by critics; some kind of beaurocratic
budget feuding/budget envy, no doubt.

Now, what to do about the perceived lack of enthusiasm that Chris Fedeli
talked about? Maybe if we were to talk about the various kinds of
research that will go on at ISS, people would respond to that, for
instance, we're going to see a real increase in knowledge from this,
especially in space biology. OTOH, maybe what's really being said here
is that you just have to have men flying to Mars or the moons of Saturn,
or wherever, because actually taking life into space is in itself
terminally humdrum?

Just a cultural note: The Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL, has had 
a Saturn V on display for years, disassembled and lying on its side. They 
finally wised up in time for 7/20/99 and put the darned thing together 
standing up in the front yard. It's the most beautiful artifact in

Dont chimps have opposable thumbs?  They have really cool opposable

Im thinking this came after locking knees and bigger brains.  Better

This one never occurred to me.  {8^D

The question now is, could all our differences from chimps have
been a row of dominoes, the first one being the lockable knee?  spike

Perhaps when it came to contests for females, the no-more-attractive smarter
chimps won out because those with hands free to manipulate tools could pick
up something long and heavy, and *wallop*, no more free market for
reproduction.

Don't discount violence. I think that smart people manage to control the use
of violence (again in aggregate), so that over time they get the
reproductive advantage - or else! Sex and violence go hand in hand (or boot
in balls?). There is a tendency to lump brains into the nerd stereotype, ie:
violence impared, but I think this is a little lie propagated by the smart
people. Maybe a big idiot can thump a weedy smart guy, but in the end you
usually find the lunks in the service of the nerds. The nineties, QED.

Seriously, our culture is designed for Mr Brains. In a contest between Buns
& Brains, Brains must surely win out in aggregate (pumping petrol is not
attractive, even with a good haircut, perhaps unless you own the petrol
company).

Of course, as has already been stated, Mr Buns+Brains is the best of all,
but only because Buns is an added benefit over and above the prerequisite of
Brains.

In my opinion actually, social skills are far more important than either of
the above qualities (although this is after all a form of intelligence).
Also confidence. Ever wonder about those butt-ugly guys with women falling
all over them? It's not pheromones. Shyness is a good way to be celibate.

Anyone got a perspective on the female side of this debate? That is, smart
vs attractive women? Women have these problems too you know (more so maybe).

Is the limited time for a crew a supply problem, or is it something else. If
it is supplies, couldn't you send up an un-personed bundle of life
supporting stuff (food, water, air), seperately, and have people grab it up
there, and so keep them going far longer if necessary (eg: long enough to

When I heard that there were tourist space trips being considered in the
near future for the measly sum of $100,000, I started tallying up the value
of all my more (and less) superficial organs. How many legs do you need,
after all? None since the wheel. One arm would keep me happy, I'd prefer the
good one if that's viable, but I've always wanted to learn to use the mouse
with my left hand anyway. Most of the internal gut stuff is more trouble
than its worth; dialysis is pretty advanced now, right? There's a spare eye,
ear, 90% of my neurons are unused if I'm to believe Einstein (and who
wouldn't), a spare lung, and I've already got a beautiful daughter so
there's even more stuff for the organ bank.

And after all that, I'm lighter too, which might reduce the cost further.

Boring? Aaarrggh! I'm going to space in a bucket if I have to.

Open letter, huh?  Well, for what it's worth, Crocker's right and you're

you've been posting about are known loads of crap.

Nobody holds this against you.  I believed in psychic powers only five
years ago(*).  On the other hand, accusing this list's most utterly
rational poster of having "not read" your posts, after he took the
trouble to respond to completely ignorable subjects... well, it may
suggest you're flat wrong.  Just thought you should know that.  Toodles.

Well, that article merely says that Melatonin metabolizes into two
"neurotransmitter-like" molecules whose function is unknown, but that do
elicit a neurological response. Presumably, this isn't something
completely alien to your body, just maybe a higher dose of it than you're
used to. Futhermore, if you're in your forties or older, your nascent
melatonin levels have started declining, and moderate supplementation
merely brings them up to youthful (and IMO healthier) levels.

I sometimes take melatonin, and apart from vivid dreems, deep sleep, and
waking up more energetic than I normally do, I've experienced no side
effects so far. YMMV

I might look into this further and put up a review of melatonin research
on GerOL (in colloquial english, with cross references to an online
dictionary as usual). Just as soon as I'm done with my review of Tyler
Parr's work on a unified aging theory. If anyone knows of any melatonin
material, feel free to post.

Researchers Invent Way to Accelerate Rate of Scientific Discoveries;
Implications Profound for Medicine, Science and Business

WASHINGTON, July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Imagine Christopher Reeve being able
to walk in half the expected time. Or life-saving pharmaceuticals to
fight cancer or AIDS brought to market in one-third the time. Or
overhauling the U.S. education system to create first-rate curriculums
which produce smarter students. These are just a few of the things
possible with a new patent pending scientific process introduced by
researchers at Extreme Innovation Labs (EI Labs), in partnership with
Knowledge Management Consortium International (KMCI). EI Labs is a
non-profit think tank devoted to studies to improve the rate of
discovery for business, science, and society. KMCI is a non-profit
society of researchers, executives, managers, and scientists addressing
organizational knowledge management.

The patent-pending process increases the rate of scientific discovery by

having teams of scientists actually study and experiment with research
environments to find ways to speed up the discovery process. The process

is literally making breakthroughs in knowledge creation research and
leveraging it in ways that can accelerate the rate of worldwide
innovation.

For example, in the scientific/medical community where research is being

conducted on nerve regeneration and spinal cord injuries, applying this
methodology could provide cures in half the timeregeneration and spinal
cord injuries, applying this methodology could provide cures in half the

time simply by studying and improving the environment and process for
research itself. Similarly, by applying this research to drug

``Managing institutional knowledge to better achieve goals is always a
challenge for the corporate community, the medical/scientific community,

and high technology industry. But by actually engineering the
environments in which human beings learn and make discoveries, we open
an entire world of possibilities for an increased rate of new
discoveries,'' said Ed Swanstrom, President of KMCI and director of EI
Labs. ``We have literally turned knowledge on itself to accelerate its
creation and, as a result, the benefits to virtually every science and
business are endless,'' he continued.

``The concept is simple. Yet, this is the first time accelerating the
rate of scientific discovery has been studied. The benefits to society
mabeen studied. The benefits to society may be extraordinary,'' said
Steve Fuller, Professor of Sociology at Warwick Univer

Extreme Innovation Labs is a science acceleration think tank working
with research institutions worldwide.

Knowledge Management Consortium International (KMCI) is a non-profit
organization founded in 1997 as a community for KM researchers and
business professionals. KMCI's members come from such areas as business,

science of science, sociology of knowledge, cognitive psychology,
library science, management science, economics, computer science,
medicine, telecommunications, law, organizational learning, artificial
intelligence, and more.

There was a Scientific American article awhile back on "Future
Elevators" or somesuch that featured a system with multiple cars
per shaft,they also showed work in progress by Otis on a system
that could travel both vertically and horizontally ala a startrek
turboshaft.

Here in Chicago there is a building that has stacked elevator cars
(one above the other) that serve even/odd floors simultaneously,
the main floor is actually two levels......pretty neat solution.

No it couldn't, unless they've improved it significantly lately. The fuel
cells are the main limitation, not crew size; most of the shuttle's power
consumption is independent of crew size.

And it would be absurdly inefficient and far more expensive than building
a real lunar vehicle from scratch. Why bother?

I can see where some might interpret my ridicule of the Mars-
face stuff that way, so I'll clarify: I don't think you're stupid
at all.  Indeed, I'm trying to show how an apparently educated,
intelligent and rational individual can be taken in by nonsense
presented well.  Just ask any magician: scientists are the
easiest people in the world to fool.  Fooling other magicians
is the real challenge.  Scientists should be trained in how to
spot fakery, and we as futurists and speculators need to be
better trained to avoid being sidetracked by nonsense.  That's
what I'm trying to point out here--nothing personal--you're
just a convenient target that popped up into the sights.

I remember that when I first encountered the Extropian vision, there was very little
SF that had put it all together. Then there were a few books that explored nanotech (Greg Bear,
Michael Flynn), sort of by grafting it onto the present and letting some of the obvious
implications drive the plot. 

I am a few pages into Stephen Baxter's _Ring_ as I type, and it scores very high on Ex!meme
uptake. So far, by page 37, we've got transformation of a human into something more by
use of powerful nanobots, immortality conferred by anti-senescence treatments using nanites,
wormhole travel, time loops ...

Yikes Spike!  Certainly not. What I was suggesting is that
you strap some kind of inter-orbital transfer booster on
after it has achieved LEO.  The delta-V necessary to get to
LEO is already (4/5?) the amount necessary to get to lunar
orbit and back.  So I'd imagine these inter-orbital boosters
would not have to be nearly as big or dramatic as the
solid-rocket boosters used on takeoff.

Cheers,

Paul

No offense, but that's quite a bit of an exagerrated comparison.

Adding some additonal fuel cells as a small payload package
would be a relatively minor retro-fitting.  Besides 19 days
is already plenty of time for the shuttle to get to lunar
orbit and back.  So it already has the power capacity to
sustain itself on a short (3-5 day) lunar orbit mission.

I think that is open to more rigorous analysis. But I
suspect you're right if we want to make lunar travel
*routine*.  I was simply arguing that it wouldn't be nearly
as difficult as most beleive to turn the shuttle into a
lunar transfer vehical.

The shuttle plus payload is around 100 tons in orbit; delta-v to get
to lunar orbit is about 4.5 km/s total.  With LOX/LH2 at Isp of 455,
the mass ratio needed would be about 2.9, requiring 190 tons of
propellants not counting tankage and engines.

Since shuttle payloads are max about 25 tons, this would require
eight launches just for the propellants- only to deliver 25 tons of
usable payload to lunar orbit.  It would be far cheaper to develop
new vehicles from scratch rather than transport a shuttle to lunar
orbit.

If you want to return the shuttle to earth, it gets even uglier.

The best near-term way to get large payloads to the moon would be to
use Ariane 5 vehicles to put up a bunch of stages in LEO, dock them
together, then drop stages as needed along the way.  Cheaper, and
little new machinery need be designed.

Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

In answer to your questions and concerns Greg, I also came from
the old school.  I was 4 years old when we first landed on the
moon, and the entire Apollo program left a deep mark on my 
developing psyche.  I have always sided with humans in the
humans vs. robots debate.  Obviously it is more economical
to send robots, but it defeats the whole purpose of why we
explore in the first place.

Imagine if robotic technology developed to its current state around
1800. Rather than send Lewis and Clarke on a cross-country
expedition, we sent robots.  The fiscal conservatives would've had
good grounds for saying that we need to limit more risky human
exploration of the western frontier in favor of robots.  Obviously the
circumstances are quite different, since in our current case it
requires a quantum leap in cost to achieve the same thing
with humans in space, but the reasons remain the same.
In parallel with the western frontier, despite a quantum leap in
cost we get a quantum leap in human freedom.
The fact that humans did explore the western frontier allowed
those who pioneered it to experience a degree of
freedom that the most rabid libertarian can barely imagine.  The
human colonization of space has offered the same promise to an
exponentially greater degree for those willing to risk it.  This has
been my operating paradigm since I was 12 years
old.

Then along comes the nanotechnological ideas of Drexler which
for the most part deepens all my previous convictions about the
imperative to colonize space.  With nanotech and zero-g, all of
the trickier problems of space colonization become easy, and
the freedom pontentials exponentiate even further.

It is my feeling now, that any substantial effort made to colonize
space will ultimately be a huge and wasteful boondoggle without
the assistance of nanotechnology.  And ironically the same
nanotech that allows us to colonize space is the same nanotech
that will allow us to go beyond the human form.  And it is in this
hope, that I stand by my earlier conviction that we as *conscious* entities
become the 'robots' and not as Hans Moravec proposes be *replaced*
by them.  Future nanotech and singularity issues not withstanding, if
we are to eventually achieve any sort of freedom equivalent to the early
pioneers, then space is where we must go - whether we go as humans
or post-humans is no longer relevant.

There is a fine line between being sufficiently skeptical
and blindly assuming something isn't the case. And for what its
worth you and Crocker are wrong, and this despite your own 300+ IQ
and 1600 SAT scores.  Assuming you're actually reading this

such consistent dogmatic thinking on your's and Crocker's

Nobody holds your dogmatism against you either, as it is a common
behavior amongst high-IQ young people.  Just because I don't believe
in psychic powers either, does not mean I must dogmatically believe
they don't exist because of insufficient evidence.  The only rational choice
left is *to not believe in anything*.

Yes.  Although the only point I was making is that the shuttle
would not have to be *entirely* re-designed for it make it to lunar
orbit.  An ideal lunar transport it is not!

Now a more reasonable cis-lunar transport infrastructure would
consist of the following modular components:

1) A cheap (meaning fast turn around) and reliable fleet of SSTO fully
re-useable Earth-LEO vehicles. This means costs below $500/lb.

2) A fleet of inter-orbital transfer vehicles.  Ideally, we would
have several vehicles of varying payload capacity.  Small and fast
vehicles for crew and emergency supplies.  Large and slow tugs
for more massive payloads.  These would never land on a
planetary surface, so their design constraints would be quite lax.
These vehicles could be used to go from LEO, GEO, lunar orbit and
L4/L5.

3) A small fleet of re-useable lunar-landing vehicles.  These would only
go from lunar surface to lunar orbit.  With no atmospheric drag and
a small escape velocity - these vehicles would be substantially easier to
design and build than those of #1.

4) And finally some small space stations for parking, refueling and maintaining
the above fleet.

One of the first priorities of this new infrastructure would be the development
of space-based resources.  If rocket fuel can be produced from raw lunar
soil, then this would substantially reduce the cost of maintaining
this transport infrastructure considerably.

For you we can modify  Mac Tonnies' quote thus:

But then, what would we see as the first, second, or third resorts?

How about:
Brains that lack sufficient courage to think for themselves find consolation

>wrong.  You're insufficiently skeptical and most of the "mysteries"
>you've been posting about are known loads of crap.

I honestly think this issue is an emotional/social one; the nature of the 
Cydonian formations is a secondary issue at best.  Paul was right in his post 
of a few days ago.  I have the distinct impression of being rejected by a 
hive mentality.  The name-calling, the repeated refusal to correctly read my 
posts...it's all characteristic of a communal aversion response.  It's a 
shame that the minds behind these posts can't excavate far enough behind the 
"laughter curtain" that's been built around the subject; there's real meat at 
the heart of this issue (near-mantric references to Richard Hoagland and 
conspiracy theories aside), and while no one cares (or, more accurately, 
wants to care--which is excusable, but only to a degree), I'm not going to 
cave in.

Examining planetary surfaces for ET artifacts is completely legitimate (it 
was, ironically, one of the stated agendas of the Viking mission).  The 
business about Cydonia that causes the uproar among the self-proclaimed 
rationalists is that the "Face" is a face.  If it's real--a big "if," 
naturally--then some sort of terrestrial connection seems in order, and 
mainstream science just isn't equipped to deal with such an absurd prospect 
after "Chariots of the Gods" and countless other pseudoscientific attempts to 
prove we're not alone.  And so we've isolated ourselves to the possibility: 
if I mention a group of actual no-kidding scientists who are working on the 
subject, they're labeled "crackpots" or misguided hucksters.  

(Lee Crocker, apparently recognized as one of the most rational posters, 
accused me of _making up_ SPSR.  Of course, he also denounced the relevance 
of my commentary for, among other reasons, my use of the word "morphology" in 
regards to a landform instead of "shape." I was, in his esteemed opinion, 
baiting the "masses" with an unnecessarily "scientific-sounding" word.)

Just as I wouldn't butt in with a bunch of rash conclusions about 
nanotechnology if I hadn't read Drexler, I think it's only fair to expect a 
_basic_ degree of literacy about the subject of planetary SETI before a list 
member makes some sweeping pronouncement about the "Face."  I wonder if any 
of the posters who seem so confident and knowledgeable have read the basic 
texts re. the issue: "The McDaniel Report" by Stanley V. McDaniel, "The 
Martian Enigmas: A Closer Look" (second edition) by Mark Carlotto, "The Face 
on Mars" by R. R. Pozos and SPSR's "The Case for the Face."  _None_ of these 
publications pretends to arrive at a final conclusion.  But, interestingly, 
they're all a hell of a lot more cogent than the knee-jerk drivel and 
name-calling that my postings have met.  "Boundless expansion" my ass; you've 
got a nice club going, and you're trying your best to maintain the status quo.

I'm apparently the only person on this list who _doesn't_ know if the "Face" 
is artificial or not.  Everyone else, it seems, has been there already and 
subjected the Cydonian enigmas to their own hands-on reality tests.  In a 
perverse way, I envy their certainty.  

I've said before that it's neither my intention nor my hope to "change 
anyone's mind" re. the "Face" (which, I should reiterate, is but one of the 
peculiar formations in the region and--to some researchers--one of the least 
interesting!)  I agree absolutely with the poster who asserted that the "keep 
an open mind" crowd were a bunch of self-contradictory kooks.  You can't keep 
an "open mind" about everything.  You _can_, however, keep a kind of mental 
gray basket for phenomena for which you have insufficient evidence.  There's 
nothing wimpy or un-extropian about this, and it's certainly as divorced as 
can be from the "I Want to Believe" mentality (with which my stand on Cydonia 
has been confused by several reportedly intelligent people).

I'm actually less interested in the violent dismissals I've received than the 
_reasons_ for justifying the dismissals.  If nothing else, it's a good 
example of epistimology at its worst.  So that's my take on this.  Scientific 
discussion was obviously never in the cards, so I'm salvaging this sad 
"discussion" thread as a sort of short-course in online anthropology.

Fact:  Throughout Cydonia there are bisymmetric formations perched on crater 
rims, without any sign of being affected by impact ejecta (in fact, they look 
quite sharp and relatively "new"-looking).  These features (the "Cliff" 
feature to the far right of the "Face" and sharing its orientation, and the 
"Crater Pyramid," farther south and easily the tallest structure in a 
100-mile radius), are set at right angles to their respective craters.  
Faulting, etc. has been ruled out.  Whatever these things are, they formed 
_after_ the meteor impacts.  How?  This is an unanswered question, and one 
that doesn't involve tedious bickering about facial resemblances and pattern 
interpolation (as valid as this discussion can be when done democratically).

Prediction:  List members who don't know what the hell I'm even referring to 
will inundate this list with "skeptical" griping (and will probably work in 
the word "crackpot" while they're at it).

The bottom line is that there is reason to seriously consider possible ET 
ruins on Mars.  The "Face," at this point, becomes almost immaterial, the tip 
of a vast iceberg of unprecedented weirdness that has yet to be explained 
geologically.  Fortunately, we're dealing with objects we can demystify _this 
year_, with the Mars Global Surveyor.

Back in high school, I won a paid trip to NASA headquarters in Florida to 
present my proposal on Cydonia and possible artificiality.  NONE of the 
scientists I talked to in the course of evaluating my paper exhibited the 
utter refusal to consider the evidence I've met on this list.  Sure, some of 
them had their doubts, and often said as much.  But--and this is 
crucial--they didn't make pronouncements beyond what they knew.  They didn't 
go beyond their data.  The resistance I've encountered on this list appears 
to be peculiar to "extropians" (or should that be with a capital "E"?)

Are extropian list members necessarily smarter than anyone else?  I've 
certainly had more interesting dialogues with a quite skeptical planetary 
geologist.  Are extropians privileged to some vast fount of secret knowledge 
denied the rest of the world?

Why am I the only person on this list who doesn't know if there are nonhuman 
artifacts on Mars or not...?

Melatonin is a very effective sleep agent, but SomatoPro does
a much better job of giving you a good nights sleep.  Not only
will you sleep better (lots of REM) on SomatoPro, but you will
awake feeling much better than anythig else you available.

Please check the archives about a week ago, where I raved a bit
about all of the great qualititesof this stuff.  That or feel free to
research the net on any info you can get on SomatoPro.  Its
the best thing going for sleep, exercise, and just about anything
else I can think of.

I've stayed out of this debate no so much because of the laughter curtain,
but because I don't see it as going anywhere.  One side will trot its
arguments, the other its, some names will be called, and then the cycle will
repeat itself again a few months from now.  Recall the Flight 800 stuff a
few years back???

I don't think the alternatives here are either you are with Erik von Daniken
or you are totally for whatever the current consensus in Established Science
goes for.

I don't think it's a matter of certainty, but, in all likelihood, the Face
is what the recent higher resolution photos have shown it to be, i.e., just
a artefact of lower resolution imaging.  I don't know about becoming a
scholar of the subject...  I mean, by the same token, should one also
examine every case of the Virgin Mary appearing -- on the off chance that
the latest one might actually be for real?

It's not a matter of sticking with the status quo...  Surely, some people
who reject your views are doing just that...  But to use "status quo" is not
going to advance this discussion.  After all, if the polls are correct,
there are large numbers of people who do believe in UFOs, alien abductions,
etc.  They are part of the status quo too.  They have their magazines, their
journals, their experts, their culture, their in group...

>From the photo I saw -- published in _Science_ and elsewhere -- this did not
appear to be the case.  The features did not look all that regular.
Granted, they were not totally irregular, but the bilateral symmetry was
only rough.  Point me to a sight which shows a better photo...

Also, cratering is not the only way to make surface features -- even on
Mars.  Thus, the alternatives aren't either it's a crater or some
intelligent being(s) made it.

The short of it is this.  It's a whole world.  Imagine if instead of living
on Earth, we lived on Mars and then started sending probes to Earth, say, a
billion years ago.  We'd spot a world with lots of things that could be
classed as "unprecedented weirdness" such as plate tectonics.  Imagine
Martians trying to explain Earth's geology when all they had the bias of
first understanding Martian processes (which seem to point to a catastrphic
era of heavy water erosion followed by a longer drier period of mainly wind
erosion and, of course, cratering).  They might point the lack of craters as
evidence of intelligence at work...

True.  Have any more photos come in on this yet?  (And to wake a sleeping
dog, have any more anamolous ones come in?:)

And speaking of which, Cydonia is one of my favorite trance artists.:)

We don't know for a fact if there are or are not non-human artifacts on
Mars or not, but anyone with two eyes and at least a 120 IQ can plainly
see that the landscape at Cydonia is NOT a non-human intelligently
constructed artifact. Since most people who are not blind can see this,
we should stop wasting our breath and money dealing with a few people
who refuse to beleive their own eyes.

I was wondering if any of you had practical and
inexpensive methods of attaining maximal longevity.  I
am aware of the obvious methods (exercise, fresh air,
etc...) but have even heard studies that show
information one way or another even regarding these. 
I was wondering whether there was any interesting
commentary on this.

Yes, I know.  There are people who disbelieve in psychic powers because
said powers are "unscientific", the same kind of people who are willing
to suppress their own mistakes because they don't want to give psychics
"ammunition".  I'm talking specifically about James Randi, CSICOP, and
the infamous sTARBABY fiasco.

That's not why I disbelieve in psychic powers; I disbelieve in them
because nobody's done anything useful with the concept.  I believe in
science, not because it's rational or logical or otherwise morally good,
but because science works.  It produces socks, electric motors and
nuclear weapons.  Psychic powers don't work because psychics don't win
the lottery.  QED.

And I don't.  (I doubt Lee Crocker does either.)  I simply use the
minimum number of tentative differentials - statements of the form "A is

Consult Roy Walford's work on calorie restristion with adequate nutrition.  
You eat less, but may pay a bit more to obtain the high quality nutrients in 
lower caloric total.  This is the most well proven scientific method of life 
extension [after the obvious excercise, wearing seat belts etc].

The constancy of c as a function of wavelength has been tested experimentally 
over a wide range of frequencies.  It is constant for the velocity in vacuum 
for the measured wavelengths.  But for the speed in matter, [gases, liquids, 
and solids] the speed is dependent on wavelength, this is the dispersion, 
second and third order optical effects where the index  of refraction is a 
function of the wavelength.

Im betting on caloric restriction, but I do not necessarily
recommend it, especially if you are currently young (<30).
In order to pull it off you really need to be at least a
little obsessive compulsive (like me).  The reason I go to
such extremes is that I figure I am right about on the edge:
that is, if I can make it until about 80, (a little over 40 yrs
from now) then nanotech should kick in just in time to help
me live until... who knows.  But I dont suspect nanotech
will be ready much before then.  And Eliezer's singularity
could spoil the whole thing, but maybe not.

Speaking of which, someone please forward this to
Eliezer, since Im in his kill file:

Eliezer, why whats the big hurry with this singularity thing?
Arent you a little curious to see how far we humans could
go without *that* coming along and doing...who knows what?

This week's Aviation Week has a wicked cool article on
tiny flying machines.  They talk about these little
guys that easily fit in the palm of one's hand, and carry
tiny cameras to observe one's battlefield adversary.  Think
of the cool games we could play with some of those!

The coolest part was a tiny silicon turbine.  The rotor

Ya, but our chances of making indigenous fuels muuuuch better
on Mars than on the moon.  The moon is both carbon
poor and hydrogen poor.  Plenty of silicon, plenty of oxygen
(in the soil, SiO2) but a cursed shortage of good rocket fuel
materials.  With the little bit of carbon and hydrogen that is
available, it is unclear to me you would want to use it up on
rocket fuel.  Mars, on the other hand has plenty of carbon,
plenty of oxygen (in the form of iron oxides and buttloads of
CO2), plenty of hydrogen (well, at least sufficient hydrogen).
Im wondering what Dan Golden is thinking with his initiative
to do the moon base first, instead of straight to Mars.

I'm relatively new to the list, but I can imagine.  I agree with you, though. 
 I'm ready to let this drop, so long as the hateful, stupid posts fade out.

I'm not sure I understand this sentence.  Rephrase it and I'll say what I 
think about it.  If you mean that there are a lot of mechanisms in play that 
help sculpt our viewpoint, then yes, absolutely.

Thank you for your reasonable comment.  Yeah, in all likelihood it's 
natural...but we need to be sure.

I'd argue that there's a lot more to the Mars face than BVM sightings, 
evidence-wise.  Particularly _testable_ evidence.  This is what seperates the 
Cydonian question from some of the more dubious, transient phenemena.  
Although there is a very thin line between the two sometimes.

No, endlessly claiming "status quo" isn't particularly helpful, but I thought 
it was warrented.  The key word re. UFOs/abductions is "believe."  There are 
_lots_ of people out there who simply don't know of any other way of dealing 
with strange things other than belief.  I suspect this comes from the very 
pervasive religious/superstitious memes that are thrust on us since birth, 
coupled with the fact that we appear biologically predisposed to "religious" 
mind-sets.

Look at the exceedingly few people out there who conduct proper research into 
UFOs and abductions.  Is there a mystery?  Certainly.  But unfortunately the 
fanatics get all the limelight.

What feature was it (if you remember)?  What was "Science's" explanation, or 
did they offer any?  The best images of the Crater Pyramid (one of the most 
striking crater-rim formations) is given a really good analysis in Mark 
Carlotto's "The Martian Enigmas," second edition.  I'm not aware of a 
website, to my regret.

>Also, cratering is not the only way to make surface features -- even on

It's been demonstrated that the features in question (Crater Pyramid and 
Cliff) must have formed after the crater was formed (in fact, it's really 
obvious in the Cliff's case, since the meteor impacted when Cydonia was wet, 
or melted enough permafrost to cause a big "splash" of mud).  So the impact 
itself didn't form these (or even scar them).  I'm not saying they have to be 
artificial.  But I haven't heard any good argument to explain, say, the 
proximity of the Crater Pyramid with its neighboring crater.  The best I've 
heard, actually, is "giant crystal growth," which I find quite ridiculous.  
"Giant" indeed.

This is a good argument, but I'm not sure it's spot-on.  Remember that Mars 
and Earth are very, very similar planets.  So far we haven't discovered 
anything on Mars that isn't consistent with the laws of physics as we know 
them from terrestrial geology.  The Tharsis Bulge is unusual, but most 
evidence points to it being an upwelling caused by the absence of plate 
tectonics.

NASA reimaged the Main City Pyramid on July 8.  It's a good close up of a 
feature that was imaged in April of '98, and from what I can tell it doesn't 
tell us anything especially new.  The alleged pyramid is nicely faceted with 
some highly unsual geometric "engravings" around the base, and its overall 
shape and geologic context are strange.  Try Carlotto's website at 
http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html and check out both of his "Cydonia 
Updates."  He has a very good overlay comparing the April MGS image with one 
of the Viking shots.

According to Dr. Dean Edell (www.healthcentral.com), the only empirically
validated method of extending longevity consists of restricting caloric
intake.

When I look at the angles in the so-called "City" complex, the proximity of 
the "Face," the redundancy of the "Cliff" feature, which mirrors similar 
features on the "Face" when viewed from the surface, the surreal cork-screw 
effect of the "Tholus" to the direct bottom of the "Cliff," the identical 
faceted compositions of the "Main Pyramid" and the "D&M Pyramid," apparent 
buttressing, lack of impact damage (suggesting an origin more recent than the 
craters in question), the fine detail evident in the "Face," the linear 
arrays of knobs atop Hecates Tholus, the Cydonia Quadrangle, signs of 
possible excacation, unidentified dark material emerging from a seeming 
"crack" in the "D&M's" northern facet, etc., etc., I'm satisfied that there 
is something most definitely worth looking into.

If this is an architecture, it wasn't built by us and it's very, very old.  
It's interesting that you don't think it's prudent to "waste money" (a 
myth--we've already got a craft there ready to take pictures without costing 
anything) on taking a better look at structures "only a blind person sees," 
since some of the more intriguing archaeological finds right here on Earth 
have been made by satellites that reveal structure the human eye can't make 
out.

We're talking _at least_ thirty thousand years of Martian weathering.  Of 
course artificial structures on Mars aren't going to jump out like, say, a 
picture of New York City from a few thousand feet.  We can rightly expect the 
confirming details to be subtle.

Carl Sagan noted that the presence of intelligence on Earth is revealed by 
the _geometric_ aspect of its constructions.  There are enough geometric 
anomalies in the Cydonia region, and elsewhere on Mars, that seem to fulfill 
this criteria.  As such, they deserve close scrutiny and objectivity.

What were you expecting?  The Chrysler building?  Chrome and glass and 
satellite dishes?  Another point: if the formations on Mars are artificial, 
they were probably built as self-contained structures; the enviroment on Mars 
hasn't been too hospitable of late.  So looking for urban sprawl and so forth 
might be too anthrocentric an approach.

Michael Persinger of Laurentian University has done some promising research 
by applying computer-controlled selenoid magnets to the heads of test 
subjects.  He alters brain activity in the temporal lobe, and has managed to 
produce a variety of altered states, including hallucinations.

Since the temporal lobe is arguably where the brain "creates" reality, I 
wonder how far way we are from achieving a "full-immersion" virtual 
environment by way of precise electromagnetic fields to the brain.  How small 
would the 'trodes have to be--assuming it's possible to create an interactive 
hallucination without using intrusive surgery?

I've read that exposure to sunlight isn't the best thing for aging, either,

I had to smile when I read this, because I see the other side. Just
because someone presents something at a meeting doesn't mean that
it's good work. Also, how do you know that those scientists are not
simply humoring the person/group, in order to not face a bigger
problem?

Oh, NASA and other scientists are faced quite often with the dilemma
of what to do about crackpots.

Often, they are simply too busy to do much, so they ignore it.

And even more importantly, those that have large decision-making
responsibilities are aware that their actions may look like
censuring, and that's something they wish to avoid. And so they
walk delicately.

An anecdotal story:

Last year a poster by Hoagland made it into the poster displays of
the annual Division of Planetary Sciences meeting. The poster was
displayed alongside the other scientific results of Mars research.

I listened to a group of about 6 very smart and reputable Mars
researchers I know who were standing around Hoagland's poster and
discussing how Hoagland's poster made it through the review process,
and what Hoagland's display may do to the overall reputation of the
DPS.

What I learned from their discussion is that the reviewers knew very
well Hoagland's "reputation", and they felt that others at the
science meeting would recognize it for what it was (Hoagland is
actually rather famous among planetary scientists as being one of
the king of the crackpots).

Also these researchers felt that it was better to simply let it pass,
than reject the poster and face the possibility of censuring accusations
by the public and giving fuel to any other crackpot people and theories.
They were simply ignoring it, the best they could, in order to help it
die a slow death.

Sorry to break it to you, but the real Saturn V's are still lying on
their sides, the erect one is a sheetmetal replica.  In any event,
they are beyond salvage, decades of corrosion have made them mere
lawn ornaments.

There's one other important thing. Stay involved in life. Live like you are
sticking around, like you are still young.

My singing teacher is 80, she teaches more than full time (and turns away
students by the droves), and she looks like she is 60, max. I work with
people in their 50s who look older than her. She is totally mobile, seems
very fit, never seems to get sick. When you get to know her it is obvious
why - because she is doing what she loves, has been doing it for most of her
life, and she actively ensures that she is involved in modern life.

I bet if she had but her feet up and relaxed with age, taken it easier, been
gentler on herself, then she'd be dead by now.

My wife's drama teacher is almost the same story - late 70s, looks a bit
older than our singing teacher, but then she's a chain smoker. How come
she's still kicking on? She's involved. She's doing new things, she doesn't
allow the kind of mental hardening of the arteries that kills large chunks
of the human population.

My wife was telling me about her grandfather, who died at 83. He was highly
active in the Salvation Army at the time, helping old people. He was known
to say that he was doing it because "when I get old, I might need help too".

I was talking to my grandfather who lives in a retirement home, has done so
for over twenty years. He's on a good deal, because the (fixed) pricing is
based around you dying far earlier than this. He was a POW in WWII, and
lived through some of the worst conditions you can imagine (unless you
normally eat rats to survive). His idea is that you must always have a
purpose, a goal. While you are working toward something, your mind is agile,
worked, fit. That keeps you alive. Even surviving is a goal in a bad
environment, and that goal helps you to survive. 

Disturbingly, he uses this stuff as a metaphor for his current situation,
living in a retirement home. The unit next door has high turn over (as do
many units there) - he says he can usually tell how long the people are
going be there (and there's only one way out). He is an avid gardener, and
looks after gardens for many residents who have no interest in it (because
they all get some land to themselves). Quite often, new people joke to him
about his (extensive!) gardening - "What are you killing yourself over that
for? I'm not about to start working like that! I'm retired. I'm putting my
feet up, watch some telly, take it easy". Six months apparently is the
average stay for such a resident.

I wont add any stories about the other side of the coin - most of you will
have seen people's minds harden with age, and may have noticed that death
follows relatively soon afterwards. What I say is that it doesn't have to be
that way. You must live to live. You've got to stay involved, got to always
have purpose, drive. A bit of stress is even good for you!

This is not some positive thinking claptrap. If you get cancer, or get hit
by a bus, or let your body go entirely while pursuing your goals (hmmmm),
then obviously other factors are coming into play. But if you restrict your
calories, avoid sunlight, take whatever supplements (antioxidants? etc?) are
supposed to keep you going, without purpose you'll probably still drop dead
before your time. Except really it probably is your time after all.

(Does this justify my chronic obsessive mentality?)

Of course it doesn't.

In the case of SPSR, this may indeed have been the case, but if it was it was 
for the wrong reasons.  Also, if reputable groups are humoring SPSR (an 
organization with several members who _don't_ endorse any sort of ET 
explanation), then this "humoring" has gone all the way to NASA and JPL.  It 
was SPSR's thoughtful, nonpartisan approach that got NASA to take the new 
pictures (and now, suddenly, even more pictures that aren't being hyped).  It 
was SPSR who first discovered ice in Cydonia: a significant find, even if it 
has nothing to do with ETI.  NASA's certainly taking _that_ discovery 
seriously enough.

SPSR isn't a bunch of nuts, just some qualifed and curious scientists of 
various disciplines.  Don't take my word for it; do your own homework.

This is a serious issue with real implications re. the democratization of 
space science data.  My stand is that science is anyone's game, and the 
"referees" should be as hands-off as possible.  Unfortunately, we live in a 
culture with absolutely awful science literacy.  This is a worthwhile topic; 
I can see a whole new thread emerging from it.

>Last year a poster by Hoagland made it into the poster displays of

Hoagland has been a big disappointment to me.  I read the first edition of 
his "The Monuments of Mars" and was impressed; it's an excellent piece of 
_speculative_ science writing, with a lot of ideas and a good grounding in 
then-contemporary Mars research.  Back then, Hoagland was able to 
differentiate speculation from fact, which, sadly, he is unable to do now.

But what are you going to do?  Let Hoagland drag the whole subject into the 
mud with his conspiracy blather?  A subject like this attracts cranks and 
paranoids.  I don't think there's any getting around it.

Read Stephen Baxter's novel, "Voyage": a large portion of the first of the

Mental fitness is a must.  Reading and other intellectual activities actually 
stave away senility.  I'm not precise on the neurophysiology of this, but 
it's a definite organic process.

_Please_.  Obviously we're not reaching each other at all, so can the 
smugness.  I'm a "convenient target."  Yes, I certainly seem to be--but 
because I've posted something pseudoscientific and irrational or because I'm 
not a "member of the club"?

You may not be calling me names anymore, but you just as well might be.  
"Sidetracked by nonsense."  I suppose you're doing this for my own good?  
You're quite the altruist, but I've had more than I can stand.

I think I have amply shown that there is a case to be made for possible 
artificiality of certain formations on Mars--however small a case this may be 
from a given viewpoint.  _Any_ reasonable person, faced with an issue of such 
explosive potential, would give the go-ahead.  But to dismiss it 
outright--along with a chance to get new images, virtually 
effortlessly--smacks of a certain unbecoming arrogance.

I'm not going to bother psychoanalyzing you, other than to say I think you're 
a pompous know-it-all, and a particularly mean one at that.

Then why bring it up?  I'm NOT accusing you of arguing from authority, BUT
it seems just like that.  If we examine previous meetings of scientific
societies, we can find all sorts of now definitely proven to be false
hypotheses and theories, such as Contractionism (the main view in geology
before Continental Drift became widely accepted).  That a lot of really
bright people, experts in their field who were NOT lying and were sincere,
believed such things does not make them any less false.

Perhaps, but the problem IS not who is doing the research or on the
committee, but whether their methodology is good and their conclusions
valid.

Maybe.  I tend to agree that science should not be left to the experts.
What needs to be done, however, is not embrace any person who has the nerve
to put together a chain of reasoning.  Instead, we need to seek out a
transparent method for arriving closer to the truth.

(Cf. my http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html for an example of
this in evolutionary theory.)

Too many people rely on experts and like to cite works done by someone with
a PhD.  It often comes down to "my experts vs. yours."

Now, another problem, which I do see at work here, is that many interesting
phenomena are often touted as explainable by some exotic means -- whether
that be God, ghosts, aliens, psychic powers, or Atlantis.  You have to
admit, when it's hard to get evidence, that's when the exotic explanations
come in.

Also, just about as often, after the evidence starts pouring in that
discounts the exotic explanations (and SOME exotic explanations can be
immediately discounted -- i.e., there is no God period!), a lot of people
stick with the exotic explanation and deny the new evidence.  I'm not saying
you or Hoagland or whomever is doing this here, BUT it IS a pattern I've
noticed.  (I'm probably not the first to notice this.)

Finally, and I don't recall who brought this up or how wedded anyone is to
the notion, BUT consistency is not guarantee of truth.  A friend of mine
once put it this way.  Dostoyevsky's _Crime and Punishment_ is consistent --
the events that take place and the characters in the novel fit together
pretty well.  Yet this does not mean those events really took place or that
the characters really existed.  Thus, many ideas many be consistent with one
bit of evidence.  E.g., that my car made a funny noise yesterday is
consistent with the idea that aliens are trying to communicate with me
through it.  It's also consistent with the idea that my car is basically a
victim of wear and tear.  Which do you think is more likely?  Which
hypothesis fits better with all the evidence -- all the facts -- as opposed
to just some small subset?  (That's another bad methodology -- viz., to use
a hypothesis which fits in with only a small portion of the data.  A good
hypothesis often has many independent lines of evidence that lead to it.)

Cheers!

For what it's worth, I think it's probably more likely that I'll run into 
Elvis today at lunch than that there is a human face sculpted into a mountain 
on Mars.  But if you want to approach the subject with a fresh and open mind 
and a very healthy dose of skepticism, hey, it's your time and effort that's 
involved, so it really doesn't bother me.  I can understand why people will 
react negatively, because if a subject has attracted known kooks and been 
treated positively on the cover of the National Enquirer, smart and 
well-informed people will recoil from it -- it's just human nature to not 
want to be associated with something they find repulsive; namely, dangerous 
credulity.  That natural reaction MIGHT cut off valuable inquiry into 
worthwhile subjects from time to time, but probably more often saves one 
wasted time and effort and protects one's reputation for rationality.  If 
that devolves into true close-mindedness and bullying, it's a bad thing, I'll 
agree.  Whenever such value-based balancing acts are called for, you can't 
satisfy everybody.

If you are building a 20 km tall building it certainly wouldn't do to
have the pressure at the top floors equal to the outside atmospheric
pressure. And building it airtight to maintain a 3km pressure level
would necessitate enough added weight that you'll be reaching
diminishing returns at some point.

I'd be interested in info about reasonably-priced sources of
the same chemicals. I thought it wasn't so bad ($80/180 capsules) until I 
read the recommended dosage: 4-5 a night.

It's amazing how many supplements are packaged that way. Unless
there's some USE for 1/4 dose, it just looks like an attempt
to make the price look better if you don't RTFP.

As of a couple of years ago the leading contendor was a mixture of aluminum
powder and liquid oxygen; it's not very efficient, but good enough to get 
you to lunar orbit and/or heading back to Earth with a reasonable mass

I've read the papers by the guy who did the Al/LOX gel experiments.

That sucker is crazy, and blessed with incredible luck.  There's no
clear indication of why the samples didn't explode (these were
quartz tubes filled with Al powder, and LOX added remotely).

Now, molten aluminum (with a bit of sodium or magnesium alloyed to
lower the melting point and improve ignition) should be hypergolic
with LOX. A preheated injector face and an ablative chamber should
work pretty well...

I know, aren't you sick of hearing naturist platitudes? No sh*t we need
fresh air and exercise. What most of us want to know is how to slow down
the aging process itself, not just how to end up the healthiest patient in
the nursing home! I'm glad you asked this.

> information one way or another even regarding these. 
> I was wondering whether there was any interesting
> commentary on this.

Good, good question. There are a lot of platitudes and a lot of smoke
surrounding the topic of longevity, and few simple answers. So far, we
know the following with a reasonable degree of certainty:

1. Rats and mice on a diet that has the same levels of vitamins, minerals,
and proteins but 40% fewer calories than what they would eat if given free
access to food, have lifespans that are almost double.

2. Most biochemical and anatomical symptoms of aging are delayed in these
animals, so the low calorie diet isn't just preventing one particular
disease.

3. We don't know if this will work on humans, but early data from monkey
experiments looks good. Do read Roy Walford's book, as someone suggested,
he's done some interesting stuff. Also, if you do decide to CR yourself,
start SLOW. I went into some serious depression when I attempted too
radical a CR regimen. Also, if Tyler Parr's theory is correct, it may be
possible to replicate the effects of caloric restriction without actually
having to undergo it. This is beyond the scope of this posting, but there
will be more info on this on the GerOL web page by Friday.

4. Sunlight *will* screw up your skin, and will increase the risk cancer
later in life, especially if you're pale. Wear the highest SPF-rating
sunscreen you can buy and take (moderate!) vitamin D supplements to
prevent rickets.

5. Data is accumulating on melatonin, but is still sketchy. DHEA data is
even sketchier. Remember, just because the levels of some substance
decline in your blood over your lifespan, that doesn't necesserily meen
that orally administering that substance will keep you young.
Notwithstanding the amount of press antioxidants have gotten, there is
very little clinical evidence that they actually extend the lifespans of
lab animals, let alone humans.

6. Some people take growth hormone (GH). It does decline throughout the
lifetime, but high levels of GH might encourage cancer. The key is hormone
sensitivity, not just the crude levels of the hormone in your blood. Look
up Tyler Parr's excellent reviews.

7. The real breakthroughs in longevity are still to be made. Governments
and corporations should be targetting aging research as a budget priority.
We, as consumers and tax-payers should urge them in this direction. These
are not just empty pronouncements; in my own small way I'm contributing to
the cause of life extension and so can you. I've started a site called
GerOL: Gerontology OnLine. http://gerol.us.itd.umich.edu/
	It has summaries of current articles from research journals (with
most of the technical words linked to definitions), aging news,
information from readers about longevity links they've found, and many
other resources. It's updated almost daily, and each news item has a chat
forum feature where lay-persons and researchers alike can discuss the
implications of the news.

			Cutting Through The Hype

A few personal rules of thumb:

1. I never trust a supplement company to give the whole story. They might
have correct and useful data, but they also have a vested interest. Read
what the actual researchers have to say for a second opinion.

2. No reputable researcher or company will ever make claims of
'immortality', 'miracle drugs', or 'fountains of youth'. The popular press
is a different story, because...

3. The popular media is always on the lookout for ways to spice up their
stories. Most TV, newspaper, and magazine treatments of technical subjects
are useful only for the names of the people and institutions involved, so
you can get on the web and search for what *they* have to say for
themselves.

4. Modern medicine has its shortcomings, but it's delivered some
impressive life-expectancy results compared to shamanism, faith healing,
prayer, and other paranormal/nature-worshipping hooey. A favorite tactic
of charlatans is to take potshots at 'Western' medicine and the scientific
method.

5. Cryonics and nanotech have intriguing implications for life extension,
but it's nice to hedge your bets. After all, you'll want to guarantee your
own survival at least long enough for nanorepair and true cryonic revival
to become available.

6. Above all, there is the danger of wishful thinking; wanting to believe
that *this* supplement is the key, *this* research team has discovered the
mechanism of aging. The truth is usually more mundane, requires hard work,
and is sometimes unpleasant to hear.


Anyway, I wish you luck on your quest. If you find any interesting
information, please post it to GerOL.

Well, Eliezer is right about the Singularity being virtually 
inevitable (the only way to stop it is by destroying or at
least massively retarding civilization, which is of course
unacceptable because we need technological progress 
to survive), so we might as well accept it. The real issue 
is *how* we should cause a Singularity. Eliezer seems to
favor the AI approach (create a seed superintelligence and
hope that it will be benevolent towards humans instead of
using our atoms for something more useful), which is
IMHO reckless to the point of being suicidal. 

A much better, though still far from ideal, way would be 
to focus on human uploading, and when the technology 
is operational upload everyone involved in the project 
simultaneously. That way at least some people would
have a fighting chance to become posthuman. In
fact, I'm very surprised that so many otherwise fiercely
individualistic/libertarian people are so eager to throw
themselves at the mercy of some machine. It doesn't
compute.

IMHO, the "mission" of transhumanism should be to 
develop uploading (and general intelligence amplification)
technology asap, while at the same time trying to curb the
development of "conscious" AI and other technologies
which may threaten our existence. We don't have to hold
them back forever; we just need to buy us some time to 
level the playing field.

Let's not forget that (technological) progress is just a tool;
the goal is our continued survival and well-being.

There is much we don't understand about Mars.  But the last thing to
assume is that mysteries are explained by the activity of intelligence.
This is the same point I made earlier with regard to attempts to
explain missing mass or missing neutrinos by invoking intelligence.
Experience has shown that we do best to exhaust all possibilities based
on natural explanations before we conclude that intelligence was involved.

In the case of the examples you listed, many of these points were made
by Hoagland on the basis of the Viking orbiter photos, and some of them
have been basically refuted by the new pictures.  We have good images
of the main pyramid and the upper part of the D&M pyramid.  There is no
buttressing, and the facets are not precise and never were (they don't
meet at a point, for example).  We have good images of most of the "City"
and it all looks natural.  We have the western portion of the "Fort"
and it looks natural as well.  We don't really know what the Face looks
like when viewed from the surface, but the early reconstructions based
on Viking cannot be trusted now.

I don't see anything here which can't be plausibly explained by natural
processes of erosion.  We have pyramidal rocks on earth, and even
mountains and hills that resemble faces.  Obviously the details of
erosion will be different on Mars, and there are still many unknowns.
But we should explore natural explanations and not jump to the conclusion
that unexplained phenomena are due to intelligence, just as in other
forms of scientific investigation.

> It's interesting that you don't think it's prudent to "waste money" (a

> anything)

It's not a myth that there are huge costs to image and re-image this area.
The cost of anything is the foregone opportunity.  There is only a limited
amount of bandwidth available for returning pictures, time on the deep
space networks necessary to pick up the transmissions, time to plan the
pictures and to process them when they come back.  When we take another
picture of the Cydonia region, we're missing out on the opportunity to
photograph some other part of Mars.

There are scientists all over the world clamoring to have their favorite
part of Mars photographed.  Volcanoes, valleys, polar caps, plains, each
type of terrain has scientific interest.  If the scientific community
demands more pictures of Cydonia, fine.  To my layman's eye it does look
like an interesting region.  But I am not an areologist.  We should leave
it to the experts to decide what should be photographed.  These people are
the best judges of how to use the exteremely scarce resources we have
available for photographs.

Another thing to consider is this.  Suppose we did take more photos of
Cydonia, and we saw what we have seen so far.  The rest of the D&M pyramid
looks like an eroded outcropping.  Same with the Fortress.  Same with the
other structures.  The Face looks vaguely facelike, but no more so than
any number of natural landforms on the earth.  What then?

Would that satisfy you?  Would you then say, okay, no more pictures?
If so, what about the others, who aren't satisfied?  Some people
will continue to see hints of structure in the photographs.  Look at
Hoagland's web page at www.enterprisemission.com.  He saw all kinds of
stuff, castles and streets, in the photos from last year.  Others will
agree with him.  Do we have to keep taking pictures until every last
person on Earth is satisfied, at the cost of scientifically useful
photographs from other parts of the planet?  Or do we simply stop when
you personally are convinced there's nothing there?

In other words, how can we allocate scarce photographic resources in a world
where the vast majority of the scientists do not think the artificiality
hypothesis is at all convincing given the data available, but there is a
small but vocal minority who insist that it be investigated?  How would
you propose to resolve these disagreements?

In fact, vitamin D supplements are a waste of time even if you avoid
sunbathing. Your skin will make shed loads of vitamin D in very low sun
intensity and in a very short time. The only people who MAY need to take vit
D supplements are eskimos on the 6-month darkness cycle. But even then, it's
unlikely there'd be a problem due to dietary sources. If there's ever been
anyone that's developed rickets solely due to vit D deficiency, then I want
to hear about it - it's the calcium you need lots of. I remember this from
my 'A' level biology tutor, in case you were wondering, so it's pretty sound
info.

Yes, light thru glass, or signals thru a telephone wire, travel at only
about 2/3 of the speed of light in vacuum.

Thanks for the correction. No arguments from me. Personally, I just pop
multivitamins and leave it at that.

Actually, I think what you've run into here is a perfectly rational 
response to a world filled with charlatans.  It isn't possible for me to 
personally research every unlikely claim that I hear, because there are 
simply too many of them.  An intelligent, sane person will deal with this 
problem by placing all such ideas into a mental holding tank, labeled 
"probably false, but I don't actually know for certain", and ignore them 
unless clear evidence turns up.  He will actualy investigate one of these 
claims every once in a while, as a way of keeping his classification scheme 
accurate, and he will slowly build up a list of others who he trusts to 
accurately assess such claims.

Now, I know nothing about this "Face on Mars business".  However, I am well 
aware of the fact that you can find any pattern you want to in a 
low-resolution photograph if you stare at it long enough.  That, plus the 
fact that there have been several similar claims about alien artifacts on 
Earth and on the Moon (all of which have turned out to be false), leads me 
to suspect that these claims will probably turn out to be false.  Since the 
idea of technological aliens having visited our solar system in any fashion 
is itself problematic (it is virtually impossible to construct a scenario 
that makes any sense), I conclude that there is no reason for me to invest 
several days of my time learning all the details of the theory.

If I happen to be wrong, firm evidence will turn up in time (and the fact 
that I dismissed it for a few years won't hurt me).  If I'm right, I've 
saved myself some time.  Either way I'm not going to waste time arguing 
with people who believe in the theory (I leave that to the people who have 
actually investigated this particular claim).

Do you think there is something wrong with this strategy?

Or the size of the capsule! Many of the "natrual" supplements require more bulk.
That is why I liked the earlier liquid form of Renewtrient before California
forced it off the market.

Well, am I the only person on the list who doesn't know who the President
of the United States is?  Who doesn't know if the pyramids were built
by fairies?  Who doesn't know if Apollo carries the sun across the sky?
Who doesn't know if the moon is there when my back is turned?

The point is, "know" is being loosely defined here.  None of us "know"
anything with absolute certainty (possibly barring our own consciousness,
and you'd probably get an argument about that from some).  We don't
"know" whether the Face is artificial by that standard, nor do we know
any of the other items I listed above.  So you are not alone, if that is
the standard by which you use the word "know".

On the other hand if you use a more pragmatic standard, meaning some level
of certainty, then you may or may not be more likely to believe that the
Face is artificial than other list members.  What you would have to say is,
what are the chances, in your mind, that the Face is artificial?  And
what is the threshold beyond which you will say, for convenience and
practicality, that you "know" something is true.

(I get into arguments with my wife about this.  She'll say she "knows"
something is true if she's about 95% sure of it, from what I can judge.
I reserve it for maybe 99% or even 99.5% or so.  If I am only 95% sure
of something, I'll say it's very probably true, or I'm almost certain
it's true.)

Maybe rather than going on about how open-minded you are because you
are willing to accept that the Face may be artificial, you can simply
say how likely you think it is to be artificial.  Other list members
may then wish to chime in with their own quantitative estimates, and
you can have a more meaningful discussion.

Hal

As I've pointed out before, uploading is much, much more difficult than 
most of its proponents seem to realize.  You are better off concentrating 
on neural interfaces and cybernetic brain enhancments.  If you go that 
route you can get your first intelligence enhancements long before 
uploading would be possible.  You also get to make the upload a gradual 
transition, rather than an either/or proposition.  By the time a complete 
human upload is possible you should already have a significant fraction of 
the population running mostly in software, with their physical brains being 
merely one of many specialized computational devices.

I have no problem with people accusing me of being a pompous
ass (I often am), but this is simply 100% false.  I made no such
accusation.  Indeed, not one word of anything I have written
accused Mr. Tonnies of anything but gullibility.  If Mr. Tonnies
has taken my commentaries about crackpots personally, then perhaps
I have not been clear enough in my language.  I explained my
purposes for doing so, and already pointed out that he was not
personally the object of my ridicule.  I ridicule ideas, not
people.  If I wanted to accuse someone of something, everyone on
this list knows me well enough to know that I wouldn't be vague
about it--I'd say it plainly.

For the record, I think Mr. Tonnies is merely advocating research
on a subject he sincerely believes has merit.  I never said anything
more or less than that about him.  I not only disagree that the
subject has merit, I think many /other/ people with less sincerity
and more dubious motives created the whole mess, and I pointed to
some signs of their deception.  I do /not/ think Mr. Tonnies is one
of these people; I merely think he gives them more credibility than
is justified by the facts.

The idea that one should never believe anything is just as dogmatic
and far less useful than the expedient, practical method of believing
what is likely to be true until shown otherwise.  I freely admit,
for example, that I believe all psychics are frauds.  Is this because
I have spent a lot of time examining various claims, or because I
blindly follow James Randi or because I want to be part of the "in"
crowd of skeptics?  No; I simply think it is the most likely case
given what I know, and until I see more evidence it is quite rational
and practical to live with that belief.  It prevents me from wasting
money on 900 numbers, and encourages me to make decisions based on
something more substantial.

Pathological open-mindedness is a kind of cowardice.  To live
effectively, one must make commitments--to people, to moral values,
and yes, even to beliefs.  Some will be wrong, but that's life.
When you discover that, you change--often with some pain.  Until
then, there's no sense crippling your ability to accomplish things
in life by not having beliefs.

Definitely not.  I've now had enough time to try doses from 1-7 caps
and under various conditions.  Each person is going to have their
own response curve  I'm relatively lightweight, and 3-4 at night
is ideal.  My wife finds that 5 is her optimal dose.  Before exercise
2-3 seems perfect.  The more intense my workout the more I take.

When I took 6 capsules during the day, the effect is quite profound
in the degree of well-being experienced.  I felt a little
dizzy so I would recommend that you stay home and enjoy the
experience if you try that amount.

As for cost, I would definitely look around.  Some friends and I
just went in on a case, which brought the price down to $42/bottle.
I just received it yesterday.  You can order from them at

Hi Ralph!  It was *you* who promted me to try Renewtrient in the first place.
I was unable to find any, which eventually led me to SomatoPro.  Needless
to say, I've become a covert to this stuff.

Along with the case of SomatoPro I just ordered I also got a bottle of
RenewTrient which I am able to obtain in my state.  I'm interested in
comparing the two.

This is known as transcranial magnetic simulation. The head is
surrounded by an array of coils (solenoids) which can be pulsed with
very powerful current spikes, and induce local currents in the
conductive (electrolyt) brain tissue, which interferes with normal
neuroelectrical activity. The same technique works with muscles: a
spike in a coil applied to muscle will cause it to twitch, obviously a
minor variation on Galvani's classical frog experiments.
 
The utility of this technique is very limited, as it is primarily
disruptive (though influence of complex timed firing patterns is as of
yet uncharted). Much better spatial resolution can be achieved in
toying around with pulse sequences in fMRI.

I don't think it's realistic to talk about true I/O without
considering at least 10^5..10^7 electrode arrays, either wired very
selectively or requiring lots of assistance (complex treatment to
increase neuroplasticity and/or implantation very early in life).

What's the point of building a 20 km stratosphere-scraper for monkeys?
One would most likely use it as a launch platform: I would guess a
capsule leaving a 20 km long evacuated linear driver won't be subject
to such harsh conditions as at sea level.

So your saying that it is dogmatic to remain undogmatic? :-)  Very funny.

What may be practical for you is not necessarily for someone else.
If I understand you correctly, you are saying it is more practical
for you to remain stringently dogmatic on certain issues unless someone
can convince you otherwise?  I find this all quite revealing.

Paul Hughes

P.S. I think you should write an essay titled 'On the Practical Uses
of Dogmatism'.  I for one would be very interested in reading it, and I'm
sure it will become a fascinating topic of debate on this list.

Well, there seem to be at least 20 Mt water buried at the
pole(s). Let's await the Lunar Prospector crash, perhaps if we're
lucky we'll see some water spectroscopically.

Using it for fuel would be somewhat wasteful, though. Otoh, there is
no telling how much water ice a comet core has, the difficulties to
capture it and spin it down to lunar surface are not so very small
however.

The very best fuel on the Moon is obviously a linear motor/mass
driver. One needs to make a ramp (using the best angle, which?) out of
regolith/solar-oven made regolith glass bricks, and create a means of
fabricating PV arrays (maybe just sputtering appropriately doped (made
in situ or imported) silicon on lunar soil glass panes, which can be
made by melting the surface of finely powdered regolith, giving time
to anneal/cool and then simply lift them off the powder surface). I am
not sure if lunar soil (without adding cryolith) is suitable for melt
electrolysis, one can certainly use hydrogen (from polar ice)
reduction to get at the iron (see according NASA papers).

Another nice point about a linear mass driver is that in the simplest
implementation it is just a linear array of identical modules:
solenoids, high-voltage capacitors and control logic (could be made as
"vacuum tubes", as even process-contaminated vacuum is probably better
than what is inside your CRT). Optimal for automated
mass-production. With time doubtlessly different techniques will be
developed: wet metallurgy, electron beam ovens, massively parallel
preparative mass spectroscopy for separation, on the long run even
nanotechnological methods, which would be obviously best.

By firing 10 kg packets each minute it could put 14 t/day, or 5
kT/year of material into orbit. And I guess these are very
conservative estimates.

What most astonishes me most is how little attention this angle of
attack receives. Space simulator chambers are a lot cheaper than
shooting the stuff in orbit to test. Also, Earth gravity arguably
reflects lunar situation better than microgravity conditions (these
will be necessary for asteroid processes though).

A lot of xenon lights in a big chamber with simulated regolith, with
an array of cryopumps and lots of remote-controlled micromechanics and
MEMS machinery could be a veritable testbed for developing lunar
tech. Would also be useful for popularisation, transmitting video from
the inside & allowing yokels to test-drive the machinery remotely via
the Internet.

Have you tried Fluka Chemika 18960 (250 ml 1,4-Butanediol)?

What are your experiences with the product, btw? I mean especially the
long-term effects.

The trouble is, they *cannot* be identical; to get even low

Paul Hughes, I strongly suspect that you and Crocker are using entirely
different definitions of the word "belief".  You're defining it as an
assertion that is believed with 100% probability and is probably
emotionally supported.  Crocker is defining it as a probabilistic
assertion, which probability is *not* necessarily 50% or greater, but
which *is* more likely (to within, say, an order of magnitude) than any
alternate assertions.

That's why I said that neither Crocker nor I "believed" in anything, and
why Crocker said that refusing to believe in anything is a form of moral
cowardice.  I meant that certainties are unnecessary, and Crocker meant
that claiming to refuse all judgement (as to which of two assertions is
*more* plausible) is being afraid to say anything because you might be
proved wrong.  (It's also dishonest; you can't avoid such judgements and
remain functional.)

Do you believe that you can't believe in anything?  This strikes me as
being inconsistent.

Thanks! (I'm useless with orbital mechanics).

Obviously LLO is sufficient, since one can use solar sails or plasma
drives to go from there.

Isn't this primarily a timing problem? I.e. in the simplest
implementation a sequence of axially aligned, sequentially fired
solenoids, firing a ferromagnetic brick?

I *was* worried, actually, especially given the speculation that global
warming could trigger a new ice age (you just can't win...); but if this
is correct, I don't know of any events that would lead to catastrophic,
instead of gradual, problems.  Okay, I think I can dismiss all
considerations of environmental catastrophe from my navigation.

SomatoPro is 1,4-Butanediol.  What is Fluka Chemika 18960?

Beyond the effects I have already described, my overall mood is better
in a more substantial way than the cursory mood-swings.  Even
if I were to stop taking SomatoPro, I would go away with a deeper
sense of emotional well-being and self-confidence.  Also, since SomatoPro
played a serious part in getting my ass back to the gym, I have
to consider that a secondary long-term effect.  Since SomatoPro
seems to have re-programmed my innate resistance
to exercise into a more pleasurable experience.

Dear Lee (and Eliezer):

Yeah, I, too, am skeptical about the "Face on Mars" stuff.  But I'm *also* 
skeptical about (quasi-) dogmatic "skepticism" of the CSICOP variety.  Now, 
having said *that*, let me hasten to add that I have the utmost respect for 
James Randi, and am personal acquaintances with Paul Kurtz (I did my J.D. at 
Buffalo, and I've visited with him several times).  A proper, neo-Popperian 
stance is, admittedly, a kind of conservative skepticism about this sort of 
stuff, if only because, ultimately our best epistemological position is one 
of a mixture of contextualism and a weird (but workable!!) blend of Quine 
(coherence theory of truth) and Tarski (neo-"correspondence", semantic 
theory of truth).

I've perused Hoageland's book on the "Face", and found it interesting, but 
not ultimately convincing.  And I've checked out a few other sources (both 
"pro" and "con").  I'm certainly not a "true believer" in the 
"Face"-as-intelligent-artifact thesis.  But I certainly don't rule out the 
possibility.  However, the evidence, coupled with the *context* of 
science-today, bids us to be ultimately skeptical of this hypothesis.  But 
science-today is a (admittedly robust) set of (ultimately fallible) 
concepts.  New evidence and/or new, revised background hypotheses might tip 
the thing in favor of an artifactual hypothesis regarding the "Face."  I'm 
**NOT**, however, holding my breath on this one!  It can't be ruled-out, 
however, except in the (important, and relevant) sense that it is no more 
plausible (if as plausible) as less [literally] extra-ordinary hypotheses 
concerning the "Face".

My ultimate position is that I'd like to get the heck out there to the 
Martian "Cydonia" cite and check the damn area out first hand, or at least 
have Somebody do so.  That's a decade or two off, though.

And, yes, I've probably been methodologico-psychologically corrupted by 
reading too much Feyerabend!!  I really am sympathetic to Feyerabendian 
anarchism.  Good thing my original intro to philosophy of science was Popper 
and Rom Harre's excellent *Principles of Scientific Thinking* (U. Chicago 
Press, 1970) (The latter book is HIGHLY recommended, BTW), otherwise, I'd be 
of the Feyerabendian "anything goes" persuasion (which I'm not, BTW).

Best regards to all!

Well, it is assayed as ~99% 1,4-Butanediol (according to GC).

Try entering the product number 18960 into their product search:

I've spent an hour or so trying to track down sources without much
luck, but from what I recall from discussions on sci.space.tech the
problem is turning *off* the current.  V=Ldi/dt, and a large
negative di/dt is a bitch to terminate- like opening a circuit
breaker carrying a large DC current.  Big sizzling arcs... A big
inductor with a large current flowing through it (ie lots of stored
energy) tries to be an ideal current source.

The ideal current profile in a stator coil is a square wave, going
high when the bucket is about one coil diameter away, then dropping
to zero as the bucket reaches the plane of the coil.  This gives the
bucket a good pull, and doesn't need maglev guideways. More
realistically, you might get a roughly linear ramp up & ramp down
with a Bi-FET driver switch and bridge diodes- the switch closes
when the bucket is one diameter away, opens at 1/2 diameter, and the
diodes divert the negative spike back into the supply capacitor. 
The cap driving each stage is oversized so that it approximates a
constant voltage supply.  When the coil current goes to zero, the
diodes stop conducting, and the switch never sees more than 2x the
drive voltage.

Coils at the high speed end would still need to have fewer turns and
higher currents, to dump the stored charge faster- the total energy
delivered to the bucket is the same for each coil (if acceleration
is constant) but the time available for the current pulse goes as
1/v.

Maybe after tomorrow morning... Rotary is supposed to fly the ATV in
a hover test, then safe the system, put it away, close the doors,
and send home everybody that's left.  It's sad to see it go out with
a whimper.

You might be right. The definition I'm using is equivalent to Webster's:

believe \Be*lieve"\, v. i. 1. To have a firm persuasion, esp. of the truths
                        of religion; to have a persuasion approaching to certainty; to exercise
                        belief or faith.

When both Crocker and yourself asserted that the 'Face on Mars' *is* a
load of crap and insist that it *is* just a pile of rocks -sounds like near
100% certainty to me.  In this case, I may have mistakenly assumed that
you were operating within the dogmatic and emotionally based rigidity
of those you mentioned - namely James Randi and CSICOP. My
apologies if this was not the case.

Not necessarily, and as a mutual fan of Hofstadter you might appreciate this.
Yes, Language can become completely self-referential and inconsistent.

ex:  This statement is False.

Godel's Incompleteness Theorem only bolsters this dilemma.  Can
mathematics ever be complete, if it relies on itself for definition?
Godel doesn't seem to think so. So why not play the self-referential
game to our own advantage? I see no reason why we can't have
beliefs about beliefs themselves (metabeliefs, meta-meta-beliefs, etc.)
On the one hand, I do take on beliefs for their _operational_ efficacy.
The materialist paradigm has worked quite well so far.  I see reason
to reject it, just on its practical grounds alone. Now, arguing wether
it *is* the true nature of reality is another matter altogether. Science is
a methodology of rational inquiry and has resulted in our knowledge of
Universe being subjected to a constant state of revision. To reject
something out-of-hand because it does not fit, is the opposite of
science and might as well be materialist superstition.  Therefore...

Over the years, I have tried to use language loose enough to take into
account my limited ability to asses the true nature of reality. Lets face
it, to be certain of anything we'd have to run an infinite series of
experiments under an infinite set of conditions.  So if someone
came up to me and asked me point blank "Is the 'Face on Mars
of ET origin?'.  My answer would be phrased something like this:

"Based on the latest photographs, the evidence supporting the
ET hypothesis has lessened considerably since the original
Viking photo's.  I admit the coincidence of the 'Mars face'
and the several 'pyramidal structures' is unusual enough
no to dismiss it out of hand, but until more compelling
evidence comes along, I remain skeptical of any ET
connection."

Cheers,

What if they asked you to estimate, numerically, the probability that the
Face is artificial?  Do you think in those terms, or could you attempt
to turn your sense of likelihood/unlikelihood into a numerical value?
"50-50", "one in 5", "one in a hundred", "one in a million"?  Something
like that?

Maybe you could even say, based on the Viking pictures I thought the odds
were X, but now that we have the Mars Orbiter Camera photos I think the
odds have reduced to Y.

I still think this is a more productive avenue for discourse than arguing
about the meaning of certainty.  That is ultimately just a matter of
semantics.  Different people have different thresholds for when they
use the shorthand of certainty or of "knowing" something.  Two people
may have exactly the same opinion of the unlikelihood of an event, but
one says it won't happen while the other says it is unlikely to happen.
They don't disagree, they're just using ambiguous language differently.

If you and others in this dispute could turn your vague statements into
numbers, then I think there would be less name calling and more discussion
of facts.

That's been the running argument since this whole controvesy broke out in the 
early 80s.  Some "reserachers" have certainly fallen prey to it.  But I'm 
satisfied that the Mars formations aren't an example of this, for several 
reasons.  For one thing, this isn't "conecting the dots" a la the Man in the 
Moon.  The "Face," if it is a face, is a distinct, chiseled-looking 
morphology, not a mass of disconnected landforms connected by Lowellian 
sightlines.

No.  In fact, it's one of the maybe three or four reasonable posts on this 
subject that I've read.

I agree with you 100%.  But how are we to honestly eliminate the prosaic 
options unless we rephotograph Cydonia?

The "buttresses" were noted on an enhanced photo of the D&M Pyramid: portions 
that _haven't_ been rephotographed at all.  So I'm still waiting to see if it 
was some sort of processing artifact or simply an interesting example of 
erosion.  I'm intrigued by the new images of the Main Pyramid.  You're 
essentially right: only two facets meet at a point.  The rest is grossly 
bisymmetric, with the larger facets meeting in a sort of middle "spine."  
Personally, I'm not yet ready to discount it.

>We have good images of most of the "City" and it all looks natural.  

_Most_ of it, I'd say.

>We have the western portion of the "Fort" and it looks natural as well.  

Megalithic structures, if they are structures, will invariably take on some 
of the entropy of their terrain, given thousands of years.  In the case of 
the Fort, the western portion you refer to is so small it tells us very 
little.  What's needed is a good shot of the enclosed space in the middle of 
it and the straight "walls."

>We don't really know what the Face looks like when viewed from the surface, 
but >the early reconstructions based on Viking cannot be trusted now.

Actually, the new reconstructions conform quite well.  It was the position of 
the shadows that caused the uproar, not the underlying morphology.

I think the Cydonia region is interesting enough _without_ the presence of 
the anomalies.  It was, you will remember, where NASA wanted to land one of 
the Viking landers, but the terrain was too tricky.  And NASA has already 
shown an interest in the probable water ice photographed in the region in 
'98.  So I'm betting that more pictures will be taken of the region, but not 
necessarily the anomalies.

We have't seen this so far, but I like your line of thinking, so go on...

I'm enough of a Mars enthusiast anyway that I'd have to content myself with 
the prospect of more rigorous future missions.  (If, of course, a round of 
new photos leaves doubt as to their origin.)

Excellent point.  Science is peer-reviewed (and rightly so), so I would 
endorse laying off on Cydonia if enough _informed_ aerologists thought there 
wasn't anything to it.  But the climate right now is different: scientists 
either don't know about the Cydonian anomalies or they brush them off, 
victims of the laughter curtain.

My evaluation of the "Mars Face" hypothesis is that the probability is
"negligible/unsupported", that is, around the same probability as the
asteroid belt containing an object one foot across composed entirely of
chocolate cake.  I say this despite having no familiarity whatsoever
with the technical issues, based solely on my a-priori belief that any
evidence of an alien visit, if we could detect it at all, would be
completely unmistakable.  One does not cross the void between stars to
leave pointless, ambiguous fingerpaintings on a barren planet.  The
whole idea is something out of the last generation's science fiction. 
It requires me to assume complex motives and actions on the alien's part
that seem tailored specifically to produce a result that has mimicked a
geological process.  Occam's Razor slices the Mars Face to ribbons.

Am I dismissing it out of hand?  Yes.  People have been crying wolf for
the last hundred years.  If an idea doesn't merit investigation, I don't
bother.  The question is not if I can examine everything, because I
can't.  The question is what I choose to spend my time examining.  This
isn't one of them.

I checked my backlog and, yes, you certainly seemed to insinuate that I was 
constructing a tissue of crap.  I can tolerate being accused of gullibility, 
to a point (because I know it's baloney).  If I misunderstood you and

This was never about being "open-minded," but I'll address your challenge.

Simply, _we need more data_.  Some of the formations are quite compelling.  
But I must ground this in the stark fact that Mars is a different planet 
(Earthlike, yes, but possessed of a different geology).  Let's take one 
feature: the Crater Pyramid (one of the least known anomalies, probably 
because it lacks the "romance" of the Face).  I'm 100% certain it was formed 
after the adjacent meteor impact (that physical law and common sense say 
should have flattened it utterly).  So how did it get there?  

I know if I propose artificiality, I'll be bombarded with posts lambasting 
the prospect of interstellar travel, so I really don't know what to say.  I 
suppose that for this particular feature I'd be willing to go 50/50 between 
geology and artificiality.  If I'm proved wrong--great!  I will have learned 
something (along with a great many  Martian gelogists).

I agree with gist of this.  It's a semantic issue, I think: how do you define 
"belief"?  If a "belief" is subject to change, it ceases to be a belief.  
"Private conviction" might be a better term.

Why "unmistakable"?  Has it ever occured to you that relics of some 
extraterrestrial visit weren't meant to be "messages to mankind?"  You've 
backed into the same anthrocentric cul-de-sac as the extraterrestrial-UFO 
gurus who ask "Why haven't they landed on the White House law?" and think 
they've said something profound.

Imagine this: a civilzation uses Mars as a temporary shelter of sorts a long, 
long time ago, when Mars still had abundant liquid water.  They go about 
their agenda, whatever it is) using complexes of self-contained ecologies and 
either leave or die off.  Their buildings are rained on, buried and reburied 
in sand, oxidized, wind-eroded...until, by mistake, they're found.

Perhaps you're right.  Maybe the lack of enthusiasm among

Earlier, Greg Burch used the Antarctica analogy to describe
how colonization of mars might progress in the early stages.
When tourism becomes the driving economic force behind space
travel, the desert analogy might work as well.  People
travel to the deserts mostly for the beauty of the arid,
lifeless landscape, and there is plenty of that to be found
in space.  But for desert development to happen, plumbing
and resource transportation had to be efficient enough for
Meyer Lansky to open a casino in Vegas, enabling the mob to
make a killing on what had been valueless land.  Perhaps
similar organized crime syndicates will eventually turn mars
into a place where tomorrow's sinners are welcome.

Absolutely, I haven't forgotten.  I fully favor enthusiasm
for space as a motivator for technology development.

I don't know if anyone else caught it, but recently Lou
Dobbs, the highly regarded CNN business anchor, left the
network to take up a full time position with Space.com.
Fellow journalists were stunned.  In an interview, Dobbs
said "The network [CNN] and its view of market coverage were
mired in the past.  I would rather be a part of the future."
What can we say, but Onward, Lou!!

I heard an hour-long radio interview this morning with Francis Fukayama, whose latest 
book, _The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstitution of Social Order_,
sounds up our alley -- in the introduction, he credits Neal Stephenson, and on the air
he talked about Hayek, spontaneous order, and evolutionary psychology.

It's essentially a theoretical and practical framework for predicting social change, which
sums down to "Human nature will win out."  I haven't read the book yet, though, so the 
recommendation is tentative.  He's a good enough speaker and he said enough of the
right buzzwords for me to want to pick up a copy and check it out.

Assuming that the possibility of finding extraterrestrial artifacts on other 
bodies in our solar system isn't a lunatic notion, what sort of things 
_should_ we be looking for?

Re. Cydonia: I found the URL below interesting, if for no other reason than 
it shows what part of Cydonia was rephotographed by the Mars Global Surveyor. 
 The Fort and D&M object, as can be plainly seen, were _not_ imaged even 
remotely in their entirety.  Note the shape of the "Main City Pyramid" and 
the linear cuts around its base.  The bifurcated "terrace" (visible in the 
lower left) has also been the subject of some debate.

http://www.psrw.com/~markc/Articles/cydoniaUpdate/index.html

It is my personal theory (if Cydonia indeed has artificial structures) that 
the "pyramids" and "Face" are examples of modified terrain, which the 
hypothetical ETs constructed using pre-existing landforms.  The faceted 
structure of the "Main City Pyramid" and "D&M Pyramid," for example, could be 
a modification used to maximize use of sunlight.

It doesn't particularly bother me that these formations look "rough."  
They're _old_ and radically weathered, and quite likely carved out of 
existing formations.  Consider our plans for moon bases, which call for 
literally burying habitat modules under the regolith to shield from radiation.

If you go to that infamous source ( http://www.lycaeum.org ) the
suggested dosis seems to be 1..3 ml. I personally never go over 2
ml. This seems to imply that the 250 ml Fluka bottle is good for
83..250 d.

Great! I ordered 250 mL to start, I'll report back when I'm
strong and well-rested :-)

I don't think a civilisation capable of interstellar travel is going
to engage in building megalithic structures on planetary surfaces. As
far as we know interstellar travel requires micro craft built with
nanotechnological means. Shortly after arrival it autoamplifies into a
vast machine ecology living in space as their native habitat. There is
no point for them to descend down the gravitational gradient for
purposes other than large-scale mining (leading eventually to
planetary deconstruction).

It is impossible to destroy such a supercivilisation by anything other
than a grand cataclysm (say, a GRB event occuring almost in the
system), which will certaily leave tell-tale traces everywhere.

If you're looking for alien artifacts in our Solar System you won't
find any unless

1) the aliens deliberately drop camouflage
2) the aliens emerged in this planetary system and didn't have the
   time to evolve into a superciv yet -- in this case the aliens are us.

Like I said... last generation's science fiction.  You're being silly. 
Yes, I said silly.  We are not talking about a bunch of squatters with
tents, like our own tentative probes.  We're talking about civilizations
with the ability to cross stars and probably galaxies, civilizations
thousands or millions of years more advanced than ours.

I'm not talking Singularity.  I'm not talking Powers.  I'm not even
talking about races who rip apart stars for spare parts to build Dyson
spheres, even though we'll be doing that ourselves in just a few
millennia CRNS (Current Rate No Singularity).  But I am talking about
nanotechnology, at the very minimum.  If you don't want to be found,
then you aren't found.  If you don't care who finds you, then your works
are clearly and unmistakably visible from other stars, never mind from
an orbiting satellite.  If there were alien races running around in our
system, we would *notice*.

They do not "die off".  They do not land, poke around in self-contained
shelters, and then leave.  I'm sure it makes for very nice short stories
in _Analog_, but real life just isn't like that.  By the time an alien
race has crossed the gap between their star and ours, they are not
picnickers; and if they haven't died off already, then they won't. 
They're either expansionists or extremely quiet.  I acknowledge the
possibility that Powers commit suicide or leave, and that the "leftover"
civilizations remain mortal.  Even so, aliens that can cross stars are
bloody powerful mortals.

That kind of technology doesn't allow for moderation.  On the spectrum
of Blaringly Obvious to Totally Undetectable, it is simply beyond
probability that the aliens just *happen* to fall in the Detectable To
Twentieth-Century Humans But They Have To Look Real Hard category.  It's
such a narrow range that it's far more probable that someone is looking
*too* hard.

I can only compare the Mars Face hypothesis to the creationists who
claim that (a) God tried real hard to disguise the fact that Earth is
only 5700 years old by burying fake dinosaurs; (b) God did such a lousy
job that there are obvious flaws in Darwinism.

Michael Lorrey,

I'm still waiting to hear back from you on this subject.  You've been
posting to other subjects on the list (including the "boundaries of
appropriate skepticism/gullibility" topic that the Mars topic has turned
into), so I imagine that you are not backlogged or taking a break from
reading the list.

Do you have a citation to support your assertion?

Or shall I relegate it (based on the personal and admittedly judgmental
filters I have developed over the years regarding tax freedom and tax
protest arguments) to the category of "gullible hearsay"?  If so, I won't
be saying you're wrong -- just that (based on my experience with past tax
freedom claims) I choose not to assign any significant probability to the
likelihood that your claim is correct, until I am pointed to some
verifiable evidence of its correctness.

In a narrow technical sense, he might be correct. Oddly enough, most of
the US Fed Gov's influence is derived from Article I, Section 8 of the
Constitution, which has a clause that reads:

"[Congress has the power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,
and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes"

The reast of that section deals with infrastructure: raising armies and
warfighting, militias, the post office, coinage, etc. Curiously, there is
no mention of taxing the populace.

So, unless you are interacting directly with the Fed as an employee or
beneficiary of Federal $$$, a counterfeiter, or the member of an invading
army, the Fed has only two excuses for interacting with you in any way
whatsoever, including taxation.

1. Regulating interstate commerce.
2. Maintaining the armed forces.

Spending on military activities in FY98 was 42.9% of the Federal budget.
Presumably the rest was needed for regulating interstate commerce. :-/
Looking at this from the abstract, the government's claim on the author's
cash doesn't look much better than his own (except, of course, he's the
one who earned it).

Realistically, though, this is also an argument against the very existance
of most of the government. A government that is older, richer, more
ruthless, and better armed than the author can ever hope to be (at least
not until he transcends to jupiter-brainhood). The precedent of thousands
of court rulings supports the Fed's position. Who do you think will get
their way in the case of a legal ambiguity like this one?

Anyway, even if he was right, and that alone was enough to make the Fed
just disappear like the witch in Oz, would he really be better off because
of it? Will whoever steps in to fill the power vacuum (be they Christian
theocrats, corporations, mafia, or military juntas) do any better than our
current government in terms of safeguarding our basic rights, maintaining
our quality of life, and creating an environment where science and
commerce can flourish?

Wait a minute.  At the highest dosage of Fluka's product (3 ml = 83 doses =
~3 months worth) and at the Fluka price of $9.35 for 250 ml . . . that's a
little over $3.00/month compared to Somatopro's $40-$65 range.  Even better,
2.5 L at $44.25 results in a monthly cost of ~ $1.50.

Can this be right?

I also found the following statement at
http://www.nutritionalsupplements.com/borametz.html  and thought it should
be noted.

***********************
I'm responding to your question of why ASN [American Sports Nutrition]
probably doesn't want to talk about Promusol (aka 1,4-butanediol). I knew
several people who used to take this product and they all quit complaining
of severe kidney and liver pain along with respiratory problems. There have
been numerous studies done on 1,4-butanediol. The only problem is that most
of them are well hidden and hard to find and/or it is costly to order the
studies. Unfortunately, the CDC study concerning the carcinogenic
potential(lack of) for 1,4-butanediol is the only study that a lot of people
know of.

I did a lot of research on this topic a couple years back and I could
probably find the abstracts on some of the toxicity studies. To give you an
overview though, most of them found that there was no carcinogenity, genetic
mutation, and the lethal dose number was relatively high (around 10 g/kg for
mice). Unfortunately, 1,4-butanediol has been shown to cause substantial
kidney damage and some liver damage. Most of the tests indicate that 200-300
mg/kg/per day over even a couple of days of dosing would cause damage. Doses
below this were inconclusive except for one study where 2 out of 7 human
patients given 1,4-butanediol by enema at only 30 mg/kg/per day died over
the 2 week test period. The other 5 recovered with some permanent kidney
damage. Studies have been done on humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and
rabbits and almost every test that was done at 100 mg/kg or more per day
resulted in kidney damage and liver damage. This is probably the reason that
ASN pulled this and doesn't want to talk about it.  - anonymous

[This followed up by:]

The National Toxicology Program did a study of the toxicology of 1,4
Butanediol and found that since it was rapidly converted into GHB in the
body the results would be the same as GHB -- no toxicity. From what I've
know, it is my belief that any kidney or liver problems caused by products
containing BDO are because of the impurity of the BDO used. BDO is an
industrial chemical used to make things like polyurethane bumpers for cars.
It is very hard to find high purity BDO that is safe to consume, even harder
than finding high purity butyrolactone. I have a 1,4-Butanediol product,
NeuroMod, now available to researchers. I recommend the book "GHB -- A
Natural Mood Enhancer" by Ward Dean, MD, Steve Fowkes, and John
Morganthaller.

So it sounds like Fluka is high grade and cheap as well.  Do they restrict
who the sell to (e.g. biochemists, researchers, etc.)

Title
  Plasma lipids, erythrocyte membrane lipids and blood
  pressure of hypertensive women after ingestion of dietary
  oleic acid from two different sources.
Source
  Journal of Hypertension.  14(12):1483-90, 1996 Dec.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a diet rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids
  (MUFA), from high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) and olive oil,
  on plasma lipids, erythrocyte membrane lipids (including fatty acid
  composition) and blood pressure of
  hypertensive (normocholesterolaemic or hypercholesterolaemic) women. METHODS:
  There were 16 participants who were hypertensive women aged 56.2 +/- 5.4
  years. The participants ate a diet enriched with HOSO or
  olive oil for two 4-week periods with a 4-week washout
  period before starting the second type of MUFA diet. At entry and during
  study of each diet, plasma lipids and apolipoproteins were measured by
  conventional enzymatic methods. Erythrocyte membrane lipid and fatty acid
  compositions were analysed by means of the latroscan thin-layer
  chromatography/flame ionization detection technique and by gas
  chromatography, respectively. Blood
  pressure was also measured. The statistical analysis was
  conducted by using Student's two-tailed paired t-test. RESULTS: In both
  groups of hypertensive patients, there was a significant increase in plasma
  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration after the HOSO or
  olive oil diets, with regard to baseline. Additionally, a
  significant decrease in plasma HDL2 cholesterol concentration and an increase
  in plasma HDL3 cholesterol concentration were evident. The membrane
  free-cholesterol concentration increased significantly and the phospholipid
  concentration decreased significantly in erythrocytes after the
  olive oil diet, though both MUFA diets produced a
  significant decrease in the concentration of membrane esterified cholesterol.
  Therefore, the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids was raised
  significantly in the erythrocyte membrane of hypertensive women after the
  dietary olive oil, but not after the HOSO diet. In the
  hypertensive and normo-cholesterolaemic group the HOSO diet significantly
  increased the content in the erythrocyte membrane of oleic, eicosenoic,
  arachidonic and docosapentaenoic acids, whereas the olive
  oil diet increased the content of palmitoleic acid and long-chain
  polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 family besides, compared with
  baseline. A significant decrease in linoleic acid was also evident. In the
  hypertensive and hypercholesterolaemic group, the HOSO diet resulted in
  significant increases in palmitoleic, oleic, eicosenoic and behenic acids,
  whereas the olive oil diet enhanced the content of
  arachidonic, docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids besides, with respect
  to baseline. In addition, there was a significant decrease in stearic acid,
  but only after dietary olive oil was there a decrease in
  linoleic acid. The most important differences between the two MUFA diets were
  the increase in n-3 fatty acids and the decrease in the n-6; n-3 fatty acids
  ratio after dietary olive oil in the erythrocyte membranes
  of hypertensive patients. Interestingly, a significant reduction in systolic
  and diastolic blood pressures was only
  evident after the ingestion of olive oil. CONCLUSION: These
  data suggest that the beneficial effects of dietary olive
  oil on the plasma lipids and lipoprotein profile, lipid and fatty acid
  composition of erythrocyte membrane, and blood
  pressure in women with untreated essential hypertension are
  not found equally for the HOSO-rich diet, despite both vegetable oils
  providing a similar concentration of MUFA.

As far as I know, US judges don't swear an oath to uphold the
Constitution <http://www.vigo-examiner.com/frdmst19.htm>.

In dealing with IRS bureaucrats it's usually you as an individual
against them as individuals, organized as a gang (with some armed
members).

If you decide to extricate yourself from their system, not obey them,
etc., and they find out about you and what you're doing (or not doing),
they'll set in motion their strategies and tactics to deal with you. One
of their first decisions is to decide if it's worth their time and effort to
"work" (their term) you. They may decide that the potential return from
you does not justify "working" you.

If they decide to "work" you, then there are strategies and tactics
available to you to use in defending yourself against their attack, or
even counter-attacking.

There are workable strategies and tactics -- and unworkable ones.
But any individual can make technical errors that turn a formerly
working approach into a failure (that may result in new case law
that may make that particular approach unworkable in future).

If you have a fair grasp of the parameters according to which IRS
bureaucrats operate, the strategies and tactics they typically use,
and the strategies and tactics available to you to deal with them
and what they do, then you may find that the probability of them
defeating you in any particular year is less than 1 in 6,000 -- i.e.,
extricating yourself from the IRS system may be safer than driving
your car!

Anyone interested in achieving greater Fiscal Freedom (and
reading the above probability argument) is invited to check out

Yes, using numerical probability is always fun and useful to a point, but it
can create the illusion of precision or some other kind of knowledge when there
is none.  If I say the probability of 'Face on Mars' has an ET connection is %5, from
where do I get this figure?  Why not %10 or 1%?  Frankly, I don't know enough
about all of the evidence in sufficient detail to even have a remotely precise answer.
Therefore, I take a somewhat 'backseat' to this issue.  This is by no means a cowardly
position as Crocker may have implied, but rather an honest and *precise* assessment
of my own limited ability to determine the likelihood of said hypothesis given my and
even our limited knowledge of the facts.  But since you asked, I'll throw in less
than a %1 chance of there being an ETI connection.  However, apparently unlike
others in this debate that still leaves a small probability that there *is* an ETI
connection! :-)

SomatoPro comes in capsule (powder) from and is measured in milligrams.  The bottom
line is how much GHB results once it breaks down through metabolism.  The answer
for SomatoPro is 400 milligrams/capsule.  Examine GHB, dosage levels and the
effects to come to a more accurate conclusion regarding price and economy on the
product you end up buying.

It's cheap, but whether it's really high grade it's hard to tell (it
explicitly says "For laboratory use only. Not for drug, household or
other uses" on the package, to document they didn't do tox studies to
protect them against possible legal action).  If the toxicity is
attributable to impurities solely, then 1-3 ml/day at ~99% advertised
purity expose you to ~10-30 mg/day of Something Else. It would depend
on the synthesis route and degree of purification whether the
Something Else is toxicologically noxious or not.
 
As always, caveat emptor. I'm probably not going to take the Fluka
product for any length of time before it's validated. Maybe I can slip
some of it into a HPLC system and/or borrow some capacity to do some
raw tox studies of the Fluka product on rodents. I'll let you know in
case I learn anything new on the matter.

Exactly!  I've been promoting all along IA instead of AI.
Yet you and I seem to be in the minority.  What gives?
This issue alone has caused me more alienation from the official
extropian and transhumanist movements than
anything else.  As far as I'm concerned I have little
use for Hans Moravec, Marvin Minsky and other
AI afficiando's that most people here worship
as heroes.  Besides, Marvin Minsky in person
can be the most contemptous person in the
room.  His behavior at Extro 3 only pushes
my point home that many of the AI researchers
do *not* have our best interest in mind.

No, the income tax derives from the 16th amendment to the constitution,
which says:

   The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes,
   from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several
   States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

Tax resisters have often looked for technicalities in the actual IRS
regulations where they define "income" and "dollars" and other terms,
hoping to show that the wording fails to capture most people's actual
income today.  All such arguments have been and will continue to be
rejected, and the people involved often go to jail.

Well, not exactly.  You are correct that while the U.S. federal government
is technically one of enumerated powers only, the American courts have
invoked the Commerce Clause to grant Congress broad power to pass any
number of laws on subjects not seemingly enumerated to the Federal
government.  Still, that is not really relevant on the issue of income
taxation, as there is the matter of the Sixteenth Amendment, which does
specifically enumerate the power to collect an income tax to the federal
government:

"The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes,
from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several
States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."

That "from whatever source derived" language appears (to me) to remove any
requirement that the taxable income be a product of interstate and/or
federally-connected commercial activity.  I imagine that this langugage is
why the U.S. taxes its citizens on their _worldwide_ income, not just on
what they make in the U.S.  (A U.S. citizen is legally required to pay
income taxes on the income generated in his or her Swiss and Cayman
accounts -- of course, enforcement of the law is another matter).

As a matter of Constitutional interpretation (and though I may not like
it), I see no need for the Congress to have limited the U.S. income tax as
Mr. Lorrey described.  The Congress is certainly free to have done so,
however, so I'm asking for evidence that they have, such as a citation the
U.S. tax code.  Of course, a court may also have interpreted the Sixteenth
Amendment more narrowly than I have above, and thereby limited the power of
Congress, but I also remain skeptical of that, unless some evidence is
presented.

As I said before, I would be happy to have my skepticism quashed by such
evidence.  But my personal experience with the nature of coercive
governments leads me to believe that the likelihood that the U.S.
government imposes such restrictions on its ability to tax its citizens is
quite small.

Just to clarify, I do not think that an honest "I don't know" is
anything but just that--plain honesty.  My accusation of cowardice is
for those complete agnostics who have good reason to believe that
something is 99.99% likely, yet still choose not to act that way,
fearing the 0.01% chance they may be wrong.  The men who landed on
the moon 30 years ago did so when physics professors argued about
details, and when it wasn't yet possible to send an unmanned test
mission to verify that it was all possible.  They had no way of
knowing with absolute certainty that they would survive the mission.
But they had good reason to believe they would, and they bet their
lives on it.  That's what progress is made of.

Since we're asking about numbers, I'd say the odds of the features
on Cydonia representing ETI artifacts are on the order of 1 in 10^9.
I have a good intuitive sense of odds in 10^6:1 and less range,
which are the ones I've had the most experience with (I once had
4 3s beaten by a straight flush in a 7-stud game once, for example;
that's about a million-to-one shot), and I'd suppose the likelihood
in question is a few orders of magnitude less that that.

Have you researched the range of arguments and actions of people who
are neither "tax resisters" nor "tax protesters," yet don't finance the IRS?

Have you looked up the statistics of what percentage of people/entities
the IRS claims has to file/pay but don't, actually go to jail?

The de facto US Constitution is "Anything Goes... That We Can Get Away
With."

The body of statutes and case law on taxation is somewhat like the so-called
"bible" -- you can find a citation to "prove" almost anything.

The person seeking fiscal freedom is somewhat like a fish among many
in an ocean with a few sharks. A small percentage of fish get eaten by
sharks. Some fish are very good at eluding sharks. In general, sharks go
after the "sitting fish."

I was invited to answer questions of
http://www.geocities.com/~acunu/millennium/m3000-rd1.html

by Sept. 1st.

Would anybody be interested in collaborating on expressing an extropian
view here?

We could assemble a little team, and write something noticeable.

A suggestion bordering on the absurd.  Uploading becomes possible at
2040 CRNS.  It becomes available to the average person at 2060 CRNS. 
Transhuman AI becomes possible at 2020 CRNS.  Nanotechnology becomes
possible at 2015 CRNS.

If you can stop all war in the world and succeed in completely
eliminating drug use, then maybe I'll believe you when you assert that
you can stop nanowar for 45 years, prevent me from writing an AI for 40,
and stop dictators (or, for that matter, everyone on this list) from
uploading themselves for 20.  Synchronized Singularity simply isn't feasible.

Be sure to include me in that list; after all, I've openly declared that

The idea of an alien civilization leaving marks for us
might be far-fetched, yes. But that doesn't mean we
should not examine the area...

If the structures were made by aliens and we waited 100
years before finding it out, we would be very sorry. And
if it was made by geological events, that place would be
_the_ place to do research on them...

So no matter what the outcome is, it'll be a great
learning experience. (IMHO, of course)

IMHO, it might be a big letdown.  The structure, from what photos I've seen,
don't look all that interesting.

Mars has a lot to offer, but, for now, it's expensive to get there and do
geology.  However, if I was given the chance to choose one target
specifically for study, it would NOT be the so called face.  It would most
likely be Mariner Valley (forgot how to spell the Latinized version:) or the
poles or Olympus Mons.

But to move the discussion to another level, why do you believe there might
be alien ruins there?  What sort of sifting to you do ahead of time to
decide that?  I'm asking this in a general way because there are plenty of
enigmatic features all over the solar system.  And only so much time and
effort that can be devoted to any of them.  Now, if there truly were some
alien race that left some stuff behind, I'd rather get to that stuff first.
(Not that I believe that.  I believe there are no alien remains anywhere in
the solar system.)

Cheers!

Yes, we already heard about this, when Mac Tonnies wrote, on July 15,

: As you know, the Mars Global Surveyor is circling Mars in its mapping

: Cydonia region, site of the alleged "Face."  On July 8 this year it returned 
: another hi-resolution shot taken of the "City" area in Cydonia, and so far as

: more interesting formations within the next few months--or even days.

That's what started the recent thread.

For the record, that 10 July image appears to mostly duplicate one of
the previous images, although with somewhat better quality.  I have the
impression they were aiming at the "Fort" but they missed.  We'll see
if they try again...

I don't think this is the _only_ sort of alien technology we should be 
looking for, but it's certainly a good scenario.  List members tend to assume 
that "exotic" ventures like interstellar colonization will necessarily rely 
on all kinds of fancy nanotech, but don't forget that the idea of traveling 
to other stars isn't as exotic as it used to be, in a way.  If our history 
had gone just slightly differently (and I'm not refeering to our space 
program, but to world history in general) we might have already sent out 
craft using ramjet and ion proulsion.

While the nano-alien scenario is intriguing, I'm not ready to say we've never 
been visited just because we don't see any evidence of this specific kind of 
visitation.

This is where I take issue.  I think it's likely there are a _lot_ of 
technological civilizations out there, and I think it's unwise (to be mild) 
to assume that _every single one_ is going to employ a variation of the 
nanotech scenario that obviously sits well with members of this mailing list. 
 Some of them?  Quite probably.  But _all_ of them?  I can't make this leap 
without knowing more about the civilization/s under question...and at this 
point, unfortunately, we don't know anything at all.  We ourselves are a 
rather long way from the sort of nanotech you're describing, so we can't 
really even use _ourselves_ as an example.

Too much supposition.  The star-faring culture could have easily "blasted 
off" from a point of technological development _much_ more primitive than the 
situation you describe.  Generation arcs and the like may be too "science 
fiction" for you, but just because they're not stylish anymore among the 
likes of certain Extropians doesn't render the concept obsolete (or even 
suspect).

The big trick here that eludes everyone is that you _don't_ "decide" 
beforehand what is artificial and what's not.  You go there and find out, 
which can't be done until enough good researchers are free to meaningfully 
discuss the issue without being ridiculed.  Why Mars, as opposed to, say, the

I agree for other reasons as well. I remain unconvinced of the the
notion that individual neurons can be reduced to the functionality of
a simple on/off transistor.  Neurons themselves have vasty complex
metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways.  The other mistake
I see computationalist making is the realiance of the Turning
Test as evidence that they have acheived human-level intelligence.
As a friend of mine who's writing his Doctoral Thesis on beleivable
agents says, 'The gap between believability and actuality is much
wider than most working in the field want to admit'.

We are already on the threshold of achieving the necessary 10
teraflops that Hans Moravec insists will yield human-level
intelligence.  His calculation are based on the transistor =
neuron formula.

I'll wager anyone right now that even the first 100 teraflop
supercomputer will not pass the Turing test let alone be capable
of humanlike computation.  And besides, as some wiseguy once said,
"It's the software stupid!".

In my humble opinion as well.  This is a point I've been meaning to return 
to, in response to the issue of "wasted money of a false unknown."  The 
Cydonia region, like Iive said, was prioritized by NASA before anyone knew 
there was a "Face" there, and it has been long believed that Cydonia is more 
likely than other regions on Mars to contain water.

In a wonderfully ironic touch, it was a photo of the region demanded by those 
"nut-cases," The Society for Planetary SETI Research, that vindicated a 
mainstream geological theory.

Sp yes, Cydonia is a payoff, ET or not.  One of the comments that sticks in 
my head after the new "Face" was returned was made by a skeptical martian 
geologist: "I _wish_ the Face was artificial so I could explain it" (i.e. the 
natural mechanisms that created it).

It could very well be a rock.  But I'm tired of these overkill denouncements 
of "boring rock" and "ordinary rock."  It could very well be a sort of 
aerological Rosetta stone.

How are federal governments equiped to tax alternative incentive 
systems, such as virtual reality with direct brain stimulation?

Instead of exchanging money for goods and services, we may be 
exchanging digitized sensations.  Furthermore, the exchange may be 
completely wireless.  In this case, how would a government extract 
wealth from the process of one brain exchanging digitized experience 
with another brain?

In this type of economy, how does an artist or teacher pay federal 
property taxes or income taxes, when the exchanges are exclusively 
experiential and private in the most sensually intimate sense?  When 
this type of technology arrives for the general puplic, the 
government will have to switch from the role of zookeeper/prison 
guard to the role of agent facilitating the dismantling of the old 
agencies.

How do you visualize this process actually occuring without there 
being a stage of general amnesty from government prosecution?

Analysis of Landforms in Cydonia Mensa
Crater, H W, McDaniel, S V, Carlotto, M J (P42A-09) 
:

Abstract: Analysis of landforms in Cydonia mensa reveals a variety of 
features whose probable means of formation is ground-ice and perhaps 
liquid water erosion. Some evidence of faulting exists. We examine and 
compare some of these landforms. We show that a group of mound-like 
formations in the Cydonia area of Mars, of relatively small and nearly 
uniform size, have relative positions that repeatedly display symmetries 
in the apparent form of related right and isosceles triangles. We also 
show that these pairs cluster sharply in density about a certain value 
of the defining angle of those related triangles and that on average the 
vertices of the triangles lie significantly closer to the measured 
centers of the mounds than those for fictitious mounds from a computer 
simulation. Our computer simulation of the surrounding features and the 
mound formations themselves demonstrates that the numerous examples of 
these symmetries, the resultant clustering about certain proportions, 
and the relative precision of the vertices to the mound centers are not 
compatible with random geological forces. We have thus uncovered an 
anomaly of number, geometry and precision. The level of significance we 
find for our test is p~15.5/1,000,000 .

Evidence for a Paleo-Ocean Shoreline, Sedimentary Features and Water 
Erosion in Cydonia
Erjavec, J and Brandenburg, J E (P42A-10) 


Abstract: Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) images of the Cydonia Mensae region 
of Mars have provided evidence that suggests surface water activity of a 
long duration. Scarp lines identified by Viking, considered as possible 
shoreline features (1), have been reanalyzed using the higher resolution 
MGS images. The scarps define a boundary between two different terrain 
types, one representing a knobby terrain (highland) and the other a 
possible paleo-ocean(2) (lowland). Because of the persistence of the 
curvilinear scarps and their offset from the knobby terrain which they 
circumvent, they cannot easily be regarded as simple remnants of eroded 
knobby terrain. The scarps appear similar to strandline or shoreline 
features which occur on earth. That interpretation is supported by the 
morphological characteristics of the two terrain types they dissect. 

Volcanic flows have been suggested as explanations for many of the 
varied terrain types on mars, including kilometers of layered rocks in 
the Valles Marineris. In the Cydonia region, volcanic flows are not 
likely as land- forming mechanisms. There appear to be no significant 
volcanic sources in this region nor can the distinctive erosion 
morphologies of many of the landforms in Cydonia be easily attributed to 
volcanism. To the contrary, some of the erosion appears to be 
structurally controlled, perhaps by faults, layered rocks or even folded 
sediments. Furthermore, evidence for both erosion and deposition by 
water is strong in Cydonia. Terraces (wave-cut?), benches, probable 
sedimentary layering, stream channels and other water erosion features 
have been found in the MGS images. 

Evidence also exists for both precipitation and surface runoff. Apparent 
rills are found on some of the landforms and they appear markedly 
similar to rill types found in sedimentary terrains in the western 
United States. Still, caution must be taken when using strict 
earth-based analogies for martian terrains. If martian terrains 
developed under a gravitational field that was only 1/3rd that of the 
earth, can we be certain that depositional and erosional environments on 
the earth directly correlate to similar environments on mars? Taking 
that into consideration and despite strong evidence for water in 
Cydonia, we propose that the typical tributary stream networks common on 
earth may not be as common on mars on the basis of the different 
gravitational field strength.

Ice Found in Crater in Cydonia
Moore, H L, Brandenburg, J E, Corrick, S, Sirisena, A (P42A-15 ) 


Abstract: Review of recent Mars Global Surveyor images taken on April 
23, 1998 has revealed unusual surface craters located at 40.9 degrees 
north latitude and 9.9 degrees west longitude. Unusual crater features 
disclosed in the recent MGS Image (strip No.3, Cydonia) indicates that 
water ice features may exist in the Cydonia area and appear to correlate 
to similar features in Iceland. Specific crater features found include, 
a smooth, flat floor surface, high albedo floor surface, a reflection of 
the floor surface on the crater wall, no apparent ejecta apron, and 
steep crater walls. Several studies have identified and compared surface 
features on Mars to like features on Earth, which contain water ice, 
including features on the landmass of Iceland (Frey Et Al, 1979; Hodges 
and Moore, 1978). Other studies indicate that there is a high 
probability of water ice at latitudes greater than 40 degrees north on 
Mars (Carr, 1981; Allen, 1979; Soderblom and Wenner, 1978). 

Several possible explanations for the presence of water ice in the floor 
of the subject crater are presented. Two scenarios presented involve a 
meteor or comet hitting the surface and excavating the crater. The 
meteor/comet impact is suggested to be significant enough to generate 
heat to either: (a) melt water ice in the regolith and bedrock or (b) 
crack the crust to permit molten rock to reach close enough to the 
surface materials to melt frozen water in the bedrock and soil which 
then flowed into the crater and re-froze. This new frozen surface forms 
the current flat crater floor. 

Another idea presented is the possible daily melting of near surface ice 
in the soil and rock. This is supported by recent new evidence from the 
NASA Pathfinder project that shows that temperatures on the surface of 
Mars reach 20 degrees C. in places, making melting of surface water ice 
possible. Also discussed is the possible establishment of a water table 
frozen in place at some point in the geologic history of Mars.

This would be a barter transaction, as when the mechanic fixes your
muffler in exchange for you helping him set up his PC.  You are both
required to declare the benefit you receive as income, estimating the
fair market value of the service.  Of course this kind of income goes
widely unreported.

I think though that it is unlikely that "digitized sensations" would
take the place of money.  Money works best if it is more or less
interchangeable.  One dollar bill is the same as another.  Digitized
sensations, to be useful, would probably need to be all different.

Also, you have the issue of "counterfeiting".  Can people create their own
digitized sensations?  Or is this a specialized industry, like the games
business today?  We don't use video games as money, and they wouldn't
work very well in that role.

Assuming you don't want to have an intimate sensual experience with the
plumber just to get your toilet fixed, there will probably still be a
role for money.

Overall I don't see the process occuring in quite the way you seem to
be suggesting.  There are technologies which will make it harder for
third parties to track the flow of money, and these may pose challenges
for governments.  Exchanges of digitized data like music and videos may
progress to become exchanges of mental experiences, but it is hard to
predict the economic impact.

Minsky was at the first nanotech conference in Palo Alto in...  I
think it was in 1990.  He made a speech which was interesting
but ended up dissing solar sailing, based on a faulty argument.
He suggested star sailing was not only impossible, but absurd,
since solar gravity is stronger than light pressure, assuming a
single atom thick layer of aluminum, and furthermore, solar
gravity stays stronger than light pressure, regardless of the
distance from the sun, since both drop off as the square of the
distance.

The good doctor did not point out that perhaps aluminum is not the
right material for this application.  Lithium or beryllium are better,
but
beyond that, he failed to point out that the solar sail would be in solar

orbit and use light pressure to spiral out, rather than move straight
away,
such as he was suggesting is impossible.  spike

Sure Paul, but the *real* question is, can a neuron be reduced to the
functionality of a few *thousand* transistors?  I dont see why not.
If it can, its only a matter of time before we can build a brain.  spike

Solar sails are good.  When they are far from the sun (a towed sun?
elliptical speculation...) then they could shed or fold the sails, deploy
Bussard ramjet, and then scoop interstellar hydrogen.

It would be better to have some kind of "warp" drive, some time or other
dimensional travel based thing to simply automatically move from point a to
point b, for interstellar travel.

In terms of intra-solar travel, solar sails are great because they require no
reaction mass.  This means they could maneuver indefinitely around, barring
space junk collision or other regular or irregular space travel dangers.
Satellites with solar sails and gyrodynes could have very very long
lifespans.  Things should be built to last thousands of years.

Hmm... solar sails.  These kinds of things are easier said than done.

Hmm well based on the Amazon review below this guy sounds more
like those people who were predicting fashion trends in the year
3000 :-) He seems to think that we are on the tail end of the
big changes, rather than at the beginning.

                     Amazon.com 
                     Francis Fukuyama cements his reputation as a wide-ranging
public intellectual with this big-think
                     book on social order and human nature. Following his
earlier successes (The End of History and
                     the Last Man and Trust), Fukuyama argues that civilization
is in the midst of a revolution on a par
                     with hunter-gatherers learning how to farm or agricultural
societies turning industrial. He finds much
                     to celebrate in this cultural, economic, and technological
transformation, but "with all the blessings
                     that flow from a more complex, information-based economy,
certain bad things also happened to

fuels innovation and prosperity, but has also
                     "corroded virtually all forms of authority and weakened the
bonds holding families, neighborhoods,
                     and nations together." Yet this is not a pessimistic book:
"Social order, once disrupted, tends to get

society governed by moral rules.

On the contrary, I posted a lengthy analysis of the tax code long prior
to your retort and how and why it is a voluntary system for most all
Americans. Look in the list archives, I posted it about three months
ago.

However it has been proven that the 16th Amendment was NEVER ratified.
The IRS tax code is not based on the 16th Amendment, and specifically
states in it that participation is entirely voluntary in order to be
legal.

Interstate commerce is the shipment of goods from one state to another.
The supreme court has decidedly ruled that wages are not taxable, but
income is. Income is profits, not gross revinues. If your outgo is the
same as your inflow, your profits on  your personal business of raising
your family is zero, so your income is zero, so you should owe no taxes
on income.

On the contrary, the military budget was under $300 billion, but the
total budget was somewhere around $1.8 trillion (not including off
budget entitlement expenditures like social security.) The military is
about 16-18% of the budget.

Actually there have been a number of court rulings in the past 20 years
that have supported the taxpayer, as a prior post of mine explained

Considering that our government did a fine job back when its only
legally recognised means of raising revinues was tarriffs, corporate
license fees, trademark, copyright, and patent fees, and the inflation
of a fiat money, I don't see as there is any justification of supporting
the present imperial government.

I think it is exactly the right sort of alien technology to look for.

Only this kind of civilisation creates huge, durable
artifacts/high-visibility signatures, and quickly at that. Such
civilisations are extremely expansive (because they get selected for
aggressive expansiveness while propagating across the cosmic Petri
dish). To sum it up, they are highly expansive and highly
visible. They would overrun any stagnant civilisation. There cannot be
any long-term stable stagnant civilisation, because it either dies out
(either from intrinsic reasons (which?!) or external events: asteroid
impact, vicinal supernovae & GRBs) or explodes into a supertechnology
culture. A civilisation below nanotechnology level is essentially
incapable of interstellar travel. I don't consider >10^4 year journeys
in vast ecology bubbles to be interstellar travels.

1) We cannot build stellar ramjets yet 2) anything we send out today
will be very quickly overtaken by next-generation craft, because we're
well underway to turn into a supertechnology civilisation.

I'm really at a loss why we are here at all. From what (little) we
know, life nucleation events are not that rare. Evolution is
nonlinear, yet coevolutionary factors favour intelligence emergence.

The artist still has to eat, have a roof above her head, etc.
The governmen will be taxing on those things.

Note that at the moment artists can play at any theater without
being taxed over the "intellectual property" they are passing on
to their spectators.

Instead, they are taxed over the money they get from the visitors,
on the house they own, the fuel they buy, etc...

If my memory's correct, NASA already did have at least one satellite with
panels on it that used light pressure to maneuver.  This was in Earth orbit.
Anybody else recall this?

It's too bad no one has yet placed one in space.  (A few groups have come
close.)

That pretty much sums up my view on the topic.  You can't have interstellar
space travel without having nanotechnology and sentient AI, because
sub-light travel simply takes too long (and it probably can't be done
without them, anyway).  But if you have those kinds of technologies, you
don't leave behind quant little old-era-SF-style artifacts.  Your stealth
missions leave no traces at all, and your non-stealth missions will
rearrange the entire solar system.  Besides, how exactly do you ever make
them go away?  Anything that could kill them off would also exterminate all
life on Earth (not to mention leaving unmistakeable signs all over this side
of the galaxy).

Mariner 10 tilted its solar panels to null our sunlight torque and
reduce propellant consumption, ca 1973.

As for spacecraft lasting more than decades, radiation exposure in
space degrades solar cells by inducing crystal dislocations.  The
dopants diffuse to the flaws, and the efficiency drops several
percent per year. I don't think there is a floor to this process,
but if you can periodically anneal the cells by heating to around
250 C, the radiation damage is greatly reduced.

Trouble is, this would require some moving parts to scan a
magnifying glass over the panels to do the annealing.  As far as I
knoe, it's never been done.

It's difficult to do this for the control electronics, though they
don't degrade as quickly as the solar arrays.

Use a ramjet and scoop interstellar hydrogen? It sounds
interesting, basically because I can't visualize how it

Does anybody have a URL where I can see how these things

Why?

A few mails back the (IMHO sensible) idea was mentioned
that supersocieties have space as their living environment
and only use planets to get building materials.

If that is the case, why should they be in a hurry when
they're travelling from one star to another?

The obvious answers would be population expansion or the
'need' to expand their living quarters or get material
for scientific tests.

But that answer can be effectively countered because:
- advanced species very probably master birth control
- advances in science and building means you can do
  more with the same amount of material, so you don't
  usually need to get more and more raw materials
- a huge ecology bubble needs a very good social system
  to start with -- and such a near-perfect society
  probably doesn't have the same urge as we have to have
  more and more possessions

That's only if you're going to use them as solar panels.  I assume if you
were only going to use such panels for corrections, then you wouldn't need
to do as much.

Well, I would suspect, any space vehicle of platform that would be built to
last decades or longer would have to take into account periodic maintenance
and replacement of parts.  Or such redudancies would have to be built into
to so as to account for this.

I bet with nanotechnology or some form of biotechnology, some of these
problems can be "solved."  (In quotes because we don't need a total
solution, just one that works until something better comes along.  I.e., I
can live without a teleporter as long as my car is safe enough and gets me
there in one piece in a reasonable amount of time, etc.:)

There are other problems with interstellar travel -- how this thread first
started??? -- that need to be solved too, such as traveling at high speeds
through the interstellar medium.  It may even be that for the most part,
nothing will happen, but what of nearing planetary systems, where there's
bound to be more matter.  Now, these are not insoluable and plenty of
interesting solutions have been proposed, e.g., steering around detectable
concentrations of matter.

BTW, I'm a genxer who is into both mind and space exploration.  I think by
exploring the latter, we kind of get a good idea of the former.  Pushing to
the limits in any area helps us to understand what we are.  (This comment is
not aimed at Doug.:)

It uses magnetic fields to gather interstelling hydrogen, then compresses
the hydrogen and fuses it.  I've heard it said that this would not work
because the hydrogen would create too much drag and pile up in front of the
craft.  (I've not done the numbers, so I don't know.)

The artist's depictions of this I've seen look like a long tube with a
funnel in front.  Of course, most of that funnel would be magnetic -- hence
invisible.

I tend to think so, but since we've no examples of such, this is all
speculation.  I also wonder if it would even be necessarilty to get
materials from planets at all.  My guess is that when you needed materials,
you can finds hunks of rock and ice or just gather some dust and gas -- if
recycling won't do the trick.

Why even travel from star to star?  Why not, instead stay in the less messy
areas between stars, even between galaxies?

Maybe, but all of this is predicated on an advanced species somehow being
unified.  Even on Earth, we have nations, regions, communities, and
individuals who do not go with the overall flow.  For instance, I heard a
news story yesterday (on NPR, I believe) about how the Amish (an American
religious group based mostly in Pennsylvania, USA) doubles its population
every 20 years.  That's an incredibly high rate.  Granted, the Amish are not
the cutting edge technologically, but I can imagine an advanced species
having its subgroups doing stuff like that.

I generally agree.  Of course, with increased ability, usually people want
to do even more.  Hence, we see people who are not just happy having all the
things their parents or grandparents had for less.  I certainly want much
more than the around 100 years life span current tech might give me!:)

I don't know.  I think we can work with less than perfect solutions and even
more advanced societies will have their problems.  I'm sure what will
probably happen is in many cases postbiological existence.  In others,
biological systems might be adapted to deal with messes much better.  In
still others, perhaps better ways of exploiting resources might come about
for those who wish to adapt the system to them rather than vice versa.  And
I'm sure their will be solutions mixing these or even outside of these.

Move in clades!

It's been shown that in most of the galaxy, the density of interstellar
hydrogen is too low to feed a Bussard Ramjet and make it work.  At this
point it's just an old, discredited sci-fi dream.  Try "Tales of Known
Space" by Larry Niven.

No, they've had several satellites that MEASURED light pressure,
including the Pegasus satellites. None have used solar sails for
propulsion. They've tested some solar powered ion and plasma propusion
systems for station keeping use.

Almost everybody know that the Solar System orbits the center of our
galaxy, approximately 2/3 of the way out from the center, the galaxy
being approximately 100,000 light years across.

My question is, how far from the top and bottom are we right now. If I
was to fly perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy, how far would I
have to fly to clear the galactic disk? And would it make a difference
if I flew towards Galactic North or Galactic South

Sure, full agreement here. I wasn't claiming that uploading would 
somehow be "simple" though, quite on the contrary: exactly because
it's (presumably) harder than creating a conscious AI, we should
put extra effort into it, while at the same time strongly discouraging 
attempts to make conscious machines. By "uploading technology" 
I meant the entire spectrum of neural interfaces/ enhancements etc. 
which could make our brains more efficient and less organic, btw,
not (just) a single, "instantaneous" procedure that would transfer
one's thought into a computer. I'm strongly in favor of the gradual 
approach, as opposed to the scanning method where 
essentially a "copy" is being uploaded.

This is a VERY large topic.  One of the more interesting recent pieces of 
info to come out of the evolutionary biology camp is the following:
It seems that men have a slightly larger investment in having large birth 
weights, as it gives their particular genetic baby a slight advantage, 
whereas women have a slight investment in having lower birth weights, as it 
increases the likelihood of their own survival post partem, and thus that of 
their future children.  Thus it came as no great surprise to discover that 
there are actually genetic mechanisms present in the sex chromosomes of both 
sexes that are in a continuous war for the advantage of the respective 
sexes.  The male program tries to prevent early delivery or postpone it as 
long as possible.  The female program tries to encourage a slightly earlier 
delivery.

There is the general fact that is perhaps unique to humans that the size of 
the infant cranium is just about at the physical limits of the female 
pelvis.  Much bigger and women wouldn't be able to walk.  This may be the 
major reason why human brain size and probably general intelligence 
apparently reached a maximum some tens of thousands of years ago.  Neoteny 
can only be pushed so far.  (I'm not sure whether humans tend to have more 
premees than other species, but I would suspect that to be the case.)

There is also the fact that the genes necessary for intelligence are not 
present on the male sex chromosome.  Thus, men inherit their intelligence 
exclusively from the mother, or so the evidence points so far.  Women, on 
the other hand, inherit from both parents.  However, in most primitive 
societies, a smart daughter is competition, whereas a smart son is an asset, 
so this gives women an incentive to mate with dumb jocks, which reduces the 
likely intelligence of their daughters while having no effect on the 
intelligence of their sons.  There is a secondary factor that doubles this 
effect, as well.  It turns out that intelligence as well as muscles and good 
health are all assets to survival.  A smart male may make it in spite of 
otherwise poor genes.  Thus, mating with an obviously smart male further 
reduces the woman's own chances of producing smart, healthy sons.

Bottom line: bio-genetic problems on the female side are probably the reason 
why genetic human intelligence has stopped evolving.

Unfortunately, you intuition is not very well equipped when dealing
with bulk matter interacting relativistic particle streams.

Anybody know any reliable material on detoxification?  Specifically, I'm
looking for rationales, schedules, substances, regimens...  I'm using the
term as it's used in the alternative medicine field and not the more
conventional sense of cleaning out alcohol or other drugs from one's
system -- i.e., in the sense of cleansing the body of harmful substances in
general.

Helpful comments appreciated!

I've asked this before, but I'm asking again, especially Doug Skrecky, if
anyone has any substantive information on beta glucan.  It's supposed to be
an immune enhancer.  The alleged mechanism by which it does this is supposed
to be nearly fully activating macrophages.

I'm NOT looking for pricing or ordering information.

Cheers!

That's hardly surprising; both options are extremely risky. Still, when
it comes to destructive potential, the Singularity wins hands down
so we really shouldn't be so eager to cause one. It's like using a 
nuke against a riot (sort of).

-there's still a gap of 5 years between nanotech and AI, ample time
to wipe out civilization if nanotech is as dangerous as you seem to
assume.

-I'd have to stop nanowar, assuming I'd want to do that, for 25 and 
not 45 years (because the Singularity comes immediately after
the first wave of uploads. Anyone who's serious about survival,
let alone ascension, must be in the first wave. Needless to say,
be sure to get rich). Consequently, I'd have to hold back AI for
20 years, not 40. Still very hard, but feasible with the proper
support.

-Stopping you from writing an AI wouldn't be all that hard, if I really
wanted to. ;-)

-If nanotech is advanced enough to destroy the world, it can 
surely also be used to move to space and live there long enough 
to transcend. You can run and/or hide hide from nanotech, even
fight it successfully, but you can't do that with a superhuman
AI, i.e. nanotech leaves some room for error, while AI doesn't (or 
much less in any case). As I've said before, intelligence is the 
ultimate weapon, infinitely more dangerous than stupid nanites.

-Synchronized Singularity *is* feasible for a limited number of people 
(some of which may choose to uplift the rest later). Yes, it's extremely 
hard, but not impossible. More importantly, it's the only real option 
someone who values his existence has. The AI should only be used 
after all else has failed and the world is going to hell in a handbasket.

No, it should be to yourself, of course. Anyway, so you're willing to

I can imagine an argument between a software engineer and a neuroscientist,
the software engineer claiming that simulating a brain would be much more
difficult than neural interfaces, the neuroscientist responding that we know
so little about the brain that neural interfaces would be far more difficult
than a mere simulation.  Then you have the AI-researcher claiming he just
programmed a brain in LISP - it counts the usage of words in a piece of
text, compares them to a database, and tells you the subject of the text -
it shouldn't take more than a weeks work to program a fully-functional art
critic.

An upload would be a simulation of a brain.  In this sense some
connectionist systems could be seen as very primitive uploads since they're
(apparently) based on actual brain structure.  The field of research that is
AI (rather than the all-encompassing science fiction concept that is AI)
seeks to model thought processes using computers.  Thus we have two
approaches, simulation of brain structure and the creation of programs that
model thought processes.  The latter suffers from ambiguity unbound in both
the definition of 'thought process' (or mental model, or what have you) and
it's ultimate goal.  I personally don't buy the idea of a computer scientist
sitting down and creating a 'mental model' while paying little or no
attention to brain structure; it reminds me of monkeys and typewriters.  An
unhealthy majority of AI-research is pseudo-science plain and simple.  Don't
get me wrong, we've seen a few useful algorithms come out of this, but if
AI-researchers do find the Holy Grail of intelligent-thought it will be
coincidence, like the monkeys and Shakespeare.

In my opinion the technology will happen in the following order, with some
overlap:

Neural Interfaces
Uploading
Artificial Intelligence

First we start simulating brains, not for uploading but for research
purposes.  The simulations get increasingly more detailed until at some
point we can run them in real time.  There are many software and hardware
bottlenecks to overcome before this is possible; we're not just waiting on
Moore's Law.  This is still a long way off uploading.  For the brain to
communicate with the outside world we need neural interface technology, you
can't just hook speech output into a speaker.  It may be possible to do a
non-destructive brain scan and simulate a particular brain although this
would not be as simple as it sounds.  All this time we'd be learning how and
if we can quantize the brains into more flexible software, so eventually it
may be possible to write a 'brain' from scratch although I pity the fool who
tries.  Making pure uploading feasible will involve putting many brains
inside a simulated world, this will take time, and it will move us into the
realm of less rigorous fields like psychology.  Eventually we'll be able to
see if brains can be made smarter, made to run faster, et cetera, but this
won't happen anytime soon.  Smarter and faster have problems, the first
requires a detailed understanding of the brain and the second warrants a
discussion on how brains interact.  It may turn out that smarter brains are
easy and nature simply hit a bottleneck (or a pelvis) but I doubt we should
be so lucky.

Good analogy.  Let us instead use a riot to stop a nuke.

I am not against a singularity necessarily, in fact it appears inevitable.
Let us make the singularity work for us, not against us.  Let us build
nuclear powerplants, not nuclear bombs.  spike

If you mean that the sorts of civilizations you describe would be the 
_easiest_ to spot, due to their expansive growth, etc., then I agree with 
you.  My argument wasn't that we shouldn't be keeping our eyes out for such 
civilizations, merely that I think limiting ourselves to nanotech 
civilizations is just that--limiting.

>A civilisation below nanotechnology level is essentially
>incapable of interstellar travel. 

Nanotech would be extremely useful for an intstellar mission.  But 
_"essential"_?  Agreeing whole-heartedly with your statement "Evolution is
nonlinear, yet coevolutionary factors favour intelligence emergence," I think 
it's a contradiction to expect every single exploratory civilization to fit 
the paradigm you propose.

>I don't consider >10^4 year journeys
>in vast ecology bubbles to be interstellar travels.

If you can get to one star to another, it's an instellar voyage, regardless 
of what technology was used to get there.

>>that "exotic" ventures like interstellar colonization will necessarily rely

Certainly.  But I'm not willing to make the _huge_ leap that every single 
interstellar civilization will rely on nanotech.  "Variance" may well prove 
to be the key word, when the history of the galaxy is written.

>1) We cannot build stellar ramjets yet 2) anything we send out today

Yeah, they would be overtaken.  But what if the reason they left their home 
system was due to a cataclysm (or political/sociological stagnation) that 
stopped the technological advance that would have made nanotech a practical 
reality?  What is an alien culture had some strange taboo against using 
nanotech for certain functions (i.e. spaceflight)?  Et cetera.  I think your 
argument suffers from a premature allegiance to the interstellar diaspora 
scenario.  

I'm not arguing that your ideas are faulty, and I agree that we are becoming 
a suertechnology civilization (and _will_ become one--barring accidents).  
What I argue is the _inevitablity_ of this scenario, which is one of so many 
the list could fill volumes.

I have no idea either, but I would suspect it's because of the whole "race" 
mentality that's been associated with space here on Earth (i.e. Apollo).  I 
don't think the posts that cling so voraciously to nanotech (to the point of 
redefining what an interstellar voyage is for no sensible reason whatsoever) 
have much to do with aliens; instead, they're projections of what might 
happen to _us_.  As such, they're very welcome.  As applied to aliens--real 
_aliens_, as opposed to hypothetical creatures with peculiarly human 
motivations and human lifestyles--I don't find them particularly logical.

Yes, the MGS didn't get anything new.  I haven't seen a particularly good 
enhancement yet--or maybe it's just my computer--but it is definitely a 
closer view than the April image.  Honestly, I'm not sure why NASA bothered 
with this region again...they've proclaimed disinterest (at the same time 
publicly claiming that the region would be rephotographed until, and I quote 
Dan Goldin "everyone is satisfied.")

My best guess would the prospect of water ice north of the Main Pyramid.  I'd 
_like_ to think they were aiming at the Fort, since I think it's more liable 
to tell us something re. possible artificiality than the Face.

Let's wait and see.

[lots snipped from Phil Osborn's post, but part of it said]
<<
There is also the fact that the genes necessary for intelligence are not
present on the male sex chromosome.  Thus, men inherit their intelligence
exclusively from the mother, or so the evidence points so far.  Women, on
the other hand, inherit from both parents.  However, in most primitive
societies, a smart daughter is competition, whereas a smart son is an
asset, so this gives women an incentive to mate with dumb jocks, which
reduces the likely intelligence of their daughters while having no effect
on the intelligence of their sons.
>>

This doesn't seem quite right.  Even if the "genes necessary for
intelligence" are not present on the male sex chromosome (Y chromosome?)
it does not mean that they are not present on any of the chromosomes
passed from the male side unless all of them are located on the X
chromosome.  Assuming this is not the case, intelligence on offsprings of
both sexes would be influenced by both parents.  What am i missing here?

That's what I thought, though there could be a threshold effect at work
here.  I.e., perhaps internally produced melatonin isn't sitting around long
enough to produce this "neurotransmitter-like" substances.  Only shows the
need for more research, though I'm not afraid of taking the stuff given that
all other studies show beneficial effects.

I agree, though I've got a long way to go until I'm in my forties AND I hope
by then we'll have lots of better solutons to the aging process.:)

I pretty much have the same experience, though I've noticed that if I take
it (I don't use it regularly) that I have to get about 7 hours or more sleep
on one dose (1 mg) else I feel wasted the next day.  Other friends of mine
who've used it (who are also in the 20 something age range) have reported
this too.

That's great!  Keep updating us!

A year or so ago, Lindsay Perigo wanted me to write an essay on life
extension from a libertarian perspective for _The Free Radical_, an
Objectivist/libertarian magazine published in New Zealand.  (The magazine,
which I'm subscribed to, looks very professional, especially given the
genre.)  Since I've not had time to do this and kind of lost the urge BUT I
would like to see it happen, perhaps someone on this list can take a crack
at it.

The web site of _The Free Radical_ is at: http://www.freeradical.co.nz/

Send your drafts to the editor there.

NO CAKE FOR YOU

As If Our Working Lives Weren't Fraught Enough Already...

YOU CAN FIND SCORES OF RECIPES for poppy-seed cake on the Internet. "Take
three-quarters of a cup of poppy seeds..." is how many of them will begin
before adding their favourite flavourings of lemon or orange, or even coffee.

Sounds tempting, but there are lots of people--many of them Americans--who
definitely won't want to indulge. That's because they know that if you eat
too many poppy seeds, a random drug test can show up a false positive for
morphine. And with drug testing in the workplace becoming ever more common,
that's just too embarrassing a risk to take, even if you might later be
able to talk your way out of it.

It sounds crazy that there are people who can't even eat a poppy-seed cake
or bagel without worrying about being pilloried as a user. But such is the
sensitivity of assays spun off from advances in molecular immunology that
drugs, or things that look like them, can be picked up at incredibly low
levels, days or weeks after they might have been taken. And the technology
is growing ever more sophisticated: today a urine sample, tomorrow a single
hair or the sweat from your palm will be enough.

The drug-testing business is booming in the US as more and more companies
are drawn into testing for a "drug-free workplace" by government
incentives. And the boom is now spreading to the UK (see "The prying game",
p 18). The big question is, does workplace drug testing actually achieve
anything?

Obviously with airline pilots, nuclear power plant operators, train drivers
or the police, there is a strong case to made for prohibiting the use of
all drugs, including alcohol. But in the average workplace, the situation
is far less clear. Drug testing, with a significant rate of false
positives, can create a climate of fear and loss of morale. And
drug-testing programmes are very expensive with the sample having to be
guarded as carefully as if it was part of a murder trial.

No contest: murder is harmful. But there is no clear evidence that people
who might occasionally smoke cannabis (the most common substance picked up
in testing given that alcohol is not usually considered a drug) are
generally less effective at work. And the last thing that any user of more
serious drugs needs is to suddenly lose his or her job and the one route
back to a normal life.

If a company needs a rational policy to increase productivity, rather than
advance moral outrage, it would surely be better off measuring productivity
directly and dealing with it, than measuring drug use just because
monoclonal antibodies have made it possible. Unfortunately, this is one
case where the lure of a highly sensitive new technology far outweighs the
value of its use. Let us not encourage workplace drug testing until we have
some idea of what--if any--overall good it can do society.

And let us eat poppy cake without losing any sleep.

THE PRYING GAME

LSD turns up in a woman's urine sample. If this was one of the
increasingly common workplace drugs tests, she'd probably be out of
job. But the woman is an 82-year-old intensive care patient who had
never taken LSD in her life. The only fun she had was taking ambroxol,
an over-the-counter medicine, which in addition to clearing mucus from
her lungs, caused the bogus test result.

Drugs tests are supposed to be a fast and accurate way for employers
to spot workers who are indulging in illicit thrills. But mounting
evidence suggests otherwise. Last year, after "finding LSD" in the
82-year-old woman's urine by serendipity, the same German researchers
uncovered 11 other false positives for the drug following urine tests
of a kind widely used in German drugs screening labs.

This is disturbing, since drug testing is a growth industry. According
to Lewis Maltby, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
workplace rights office, 80 per cent of large US companies now test
their employees. Britain and Europe are catching on. The British
government's Forensic Science Service is coy about the number of UK
companies paying for its drug-testing service, but a spokeswoman said
that "demand is growing all the time". Last month, the Police
Superintendents' Association of England and Wales called for the law
to be changed so that random drugs tests can be carried out on all
police officers. Existing British laws such as The Transport and Works
Act of 1992 require some employers, such as providers of public
transport, to ensure their staff are drug-free on the job. As a result
these organisations perform random testing on employees--although less
extensively than counterparts in the US. However, doubts about the
validity of such tests remain.

Apart from the question marks over reliability, it is unclear whether
companies are harmed by drug use or even whether testing employees
actually helps business.

The most recent survey from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) estimated that drug misuse by employees cost the country $14.2
billion in lost productivity in 1992, and their employers had to pay
twice as much in medical and compensation claims as for their
drug-free colleagues. But last year, researchers from Le Moyne
College's Institute of Industrial Relations in Syracuse, New York
state, examined the productivity of 63 high-tech firms and found that
companies testing workers were less productive than firms which
trusted their staff to be "clean". The reasons are unclear, but
testing is time-consuming and expensive, and can undermine the morale
and loyalty of staff. And some workers may even use drugs to boost
their performance, the researchers say.

Private Lives

Civil rights groups are quick to point out that the tests may identify
substances at insignificant doses because of recreational drug use
outside working hours and that such activity has no bearing on their
performance as employees.

Owen Tudor, policy officer of the British Trades Union Congress says:
"We're very concerned there is a creeping intrusion into people's
private lives." Such fears haven't deterred American society from
embracing the drugs testing culture, and tying itself in some legal
knots in the process. For example, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled
that a Georgia law requiring political candidates to be drug tested
violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable
searches. But in March last year, the same court upheld the legality
of compulsory random drugs tests for White House employees, presumably
to ensure the President is not served by drug-addled interns or worse,
senior advisers under the influence of narcotics.

But it's important to recognise the distinction between tests applied
to public workers and the tests carried out by private companies, says
Marilyn Huestis, acting chief of NIDA's drug metabolism programs.
Federal employees working in sensitive departments, the military, and
those covered by transport regulations routinely have their urine
tested for five key drugs--marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines
(including "speed") and PCP, the hallucinogen known as "angel dust".
Seventy-odd labs certified by the Substance Abuse Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA), which has responsibility for federal
testing standards, perform the tests on samples kept under strictly
controlled conditions. Samples that come up positive are double
checked by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, the "gold standard"
test that identifies a substance's exact molecular structure. A doctor
then reviews the findings.

In contrast, some private employers work to lower standards. While
some do follow SAMHSA procedures and use federal laboratories, others
use poorly trained staff and commercial drugs testing kits to perform
on-site tests that are never confirmed, says Huestis. "You go from one
extreme to the other," she says. It all depends on the company and the
laws of the particular state. In the UK, the respected Forensic
Science Service does much of the testing for private companies. But a
number of smaller private testing services are also vying for business.

Earlier this year, Howard Taylor, director of laboratory services at
the US National Safety Alliance, a firm which runs drugs testing
programs for over 5000 companies, tested five commonly used commercial
kits for testing urine samples on site. All the manufacturers claimed
their tests were as accurate as any done in a lab. But that's not what
Taylor found. "The results indicated discrepancies between claims and
performance for all products," he says.

Four out of five kits recorded positives for tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the active ingredient in marijuana, at levels 25 per cent below
the SAMHSA's cut-off. Three kits recorded positives for morphine and
two kits registered PCP below similar cut-off levels (Journal of
Analytical Toxicology, vol 23, p 119).

Some employers may regard the SAMHSA cut-off levels to be as redundant
as workers with even the minutest amounts of an illegal drug in their
system. But what if someone tests positive without taking any illegal
substances?

It can happen--just by eating lunch. In 1997, Judith Bonicamp and Ida
Santana, chemists at Middle Tennessee State University, Murfreesboro,
showed that poppy seed dressings contain enough opiates to make you
test positive for morphine (Microchemical Journal, vol 58, p 73).

Sex is a more bizarre reason for failing a cocaine test. NIDA studies
have shown cocaine can be passed on in semen and absorbed through the
vagina, although the amounts are too small to register in most tests.
However, if drugs such as cocaine are placed on the lips or other
areas of the body, the risk is higher. It's quite likely that enough
could be transferred to another person through kissing or other oral
contact to produce a positive drugs test, says Dan Berkable, president
of the American Toxicology Institute in Las Vegas.

The problems associated with urine testing have sparked interest in
alternative techniques, mainly hair, sweat and saliva testing, says
Huestis. Proponents of hair testing argue that it is less invasive and
offers a much larger window of detection, as drugs stay in hair long
after they have been metabolised by the body.

But hair testing is controversial too, mainly because natural hair
colour can affect the amount of drug detected. Edward Cone, now
retired from NIDA, found that significantly more cocaine binds to the
very dark hair of male Afro-Americans than to hair of other groups.

SAMHSA's Drug Testing Advisory Board is looking at whether hair, sweat
or saliva tests could be appropriate for federal test programs. Each
may prove to be faster, cheaper and more sensitive than current
methods. But they come with their own problems, and the Board is
trying to draw up stringent guidelines to govern their use.

Regardless of the tests used, civil rights groups remain concerned.
"Of course we want employees to come to work sober," says Maltby of
the American Civil Liberties Union. "But private companies that
indiscriminately test are inevitably going to fire innocent people."

It seems a little early to me but let's assume you're right and Nanotechnology
becomes possible in 2015 , uploading would be pretty straightforward after
that, I don't think you'd have long to wait. I would consider a mind a billion
times faster than mine with a billion times my memory capacity to be a
Transhuman Intelligence, although not completely "Artificial". A true ARTIFICIAL
intelligence might come before Nanotechnology (but not by much, the AI would
see to that), or perhaps after, there is no way to tell which technology will win
the race and start the singularity, either would do.

I also don't understand the 20 year gap between the time uploading
becomes possible and the time it's available to the average person.
We've already seen a smaller gap between supercomputers only
huge government agencies could afford and machines of equal power
that third graders get on their birthday. You haven't seen anything yet,
In the Nanotechnology age almost any endeavor our puny non Transhuman
brains can now consider of could be put into one of two categories,
dirt cheap or impossible.

Civil Disobedience with the pleasure of eating a 
poppy seed cake is likely method combat invasive 
drug testing. 

Parties at the office just before the most likely 
times would embarrass the drug testing companies 
that profit from their incompetent because they 
are known to be inprecise testing procedures. 

1.	Bake up or better yet have a contest for 
the best tasting 'Poppy Seed' cakes or cupcakes 
for the office personal. 

2.	Make sure you plan this just ahead of 
the testing of employees of your company or 
organization so that most of the people test 
positive, therefore the test is now void. 

3.	Produce party or gatherings tasty 
vittles of any and all foods that lead to false 
positives frequently and often. 

4.	If you are a daring individual, make sure
the organization top level consumes these bake 
goods. 

5.	Litigators be ready to sue the drug testing 
companies for entries into medical records and any 
employer acting on a false positive with malice of 
forethought.  Basically after the party a little 
citation or showing of the 'New Scientist' ought 
to give more than the H. R. director pause of entering 
much ninto your file or anyone elses for that matter. 

6.	Short the stocks potentially of any lab 
doing drug testings because now you know there  
are groups out there getting ready to sue the snot 
of them as well.  But of course this is a high risk 
maneuver and not investment advice on my part along 
with a conjecture that entries like this false positive 
liability scenerio may or may not translate into a 
real market gain for anyone outside of the legal 
community ready to take this issue on. 

7.	Find even more foods that lead to false 
positives or even OTC medicines and make sure these 
items are in abundance to keep the stream of false 
positives at an ever increasing volume. 

8.	Get a copy of New Scientist issue with these 
articles in it to increase awareness. 

Enough said, the meme has been publicly cast out 
and will now take an existence of its own. ;) 

P. S. Sure maybe someone like does zero consumption 
of targeted stuff done in testing but I do know for 
a fact that one large insurance company drug tests 
all of their employees except at the very top executive 
washroom level and that atleast one of those executives 
is an active drug consumer, this is demographically 
conceivable for many large companies in the Fortune 1000.

Well, that theory would explain a lot of things.  Such as war and

If light powered spacecraft interest you, you might try this url for a system
which looks like it might actually be implemented due to its several orders of
magnitude decrease in launch costs.

>Anybody know any reliable material on detoxification?

     Well, there are many, many things.

     If you have a juicer, one of the best things is to go on a juice fast. 
Basically, stop eating food and drink the FRESH juice of fruits and 
vegetables for nutrition. After about 3 days of not eating food, hunger will 
diminish. At this time, the body will begin to expel stored toxins into the 
bloodstream. When hunger returns (this can be anywhere from a week to a 
MONTH), that is when you will want to break the fast. During the fast, drink 
lots of carrot and beet juice, especially. These purify the liver where many 
toxins are stored. You may wish to take golden seal and echinacea to help 
really clean the liver (and thence the blood, and thence the tissues). 
During the fast, also drink lots of pure water.

     Exercise to sweat out toxins and burn fat in which toxins are stored. 
If you are burning fat, you may want to take oil to offer the body clean, 
replacement fat. Again, drink lots of pure water.

     Partially digested, unexpelled waste in the intestines produces a lot 
of toxins and this stuff can stay in you for YEARS. You will definitely want 
to get lots of fiber in your diet, but may also wish to look into colonics.

     If you smoke, quit or at least cut down.

     A couple of other things:

     In Ayurveda, there is this stuff called "ama" which is a paste-like 
residue of undigested food that clogs the blood vessels, enzyme ducts, pores 
and so on. This is handled by (a) not eating so much or so frequently and/or 
(b) taking ginger to "burn" away the ama. Quality of food also figures into 
ama production vs. reduction.

     You may also wish to check out Life Extension Foundation for detox 
products.

Please see the updated web page at:

   http://www.extropy.org/ex4/registra.htm

for the newly available suites. These are much preferable to the residence
hall rooms, and just opened up for us. There is also new information about
meals on campus.

For general information about the campus, checking into rooms, address,
etc. please see the new web page at:

   http://www.extropy.org/ex4/campus.htm

If you intend to come to the biggest transhumanist event of the last two
years but haven't registered yet, this is a good time to do so. We need to
estimate the total number of lunches to reserve by Wedneday, so registering
by then would help us plan and guarantee you lunch. (Meal tickets are
needed on campus, and going off-campus will be time-consuming.)

Thank you,

Some theories suggest that a *normal* human birth *is* a premature
birth by primate standards, this being necessitated by the size of the
human infant cranium.  My original post suggested evolution of humans
perhaps works like a row of dominoes:

1.  straight knees show up, which
2.  frees up the hands for manipulating objects, which
3.  favors those mutations which tend toward the opposable thumb and
4.  favors those feet which are better at distance walking on the savanna
5.  and tends away from the opposable toe (damn it), but
6.  the savanna walking lifestyle favors bigger brains, for hunting and battle,
which
7.  is more easily accomplished assuming large headed infants, which
8.  kills mama less often if born somewhat premature, which
9.  leads to a species that more or less *always* born premature, which
10.  need a lotta love and attention from mama, which
11.  causes her to be less available for hunting and/or gathering, so
12.  she could *really* use dad's help in getting food, and that
13.  causes her to realize mr. brains might be a better bet or more reliable
than
14.  mr. buns, which causes her to choose him more often, which
15.  cycles back to step 7.

Add a few million years and you go from Lucy to...NANOGIRL. {8-]  spike

Using a solar sail to thrust perpendicular to the vector of
gravitational attraction is not necessary. Tacking across the solar wind
to increase tangential orbital velocity is the key, and you do not need
the solar wind to exceed gravity to do this. 

Besides this, given a solar sail of a couple microns thickness over
square miles of area is fine. The gravitational attraction is only
important if sailmass X gravitationalacceleration > solarwindmass X
windvelocity^2. The lighter the mass of your sail versus the area, the
better.

Well, not that orbital mechanics is all that useful for Earthbound folk, but
I have noticed that lots of intelligent people in the computer field --
people who can analyze problems, create elegant designs and solutions, even
anticipate defects and usage -- do not like or cannot do mathematics about
an algebra level.

Any ideas on why this is so?  Can it be rectified?  Should it be rectified?

Cheers!

Hello everyone,

I need advice from everyone on the list who would have good advice on the 
best and where possible least expensive devices, technologies, nutritional 
supplements and methods to enhance my cognitive performance in college and 
in my private life.

I have just read "Megabrains" and was enthralled by what I learned there but 
many of the devices were on the expensive side.  But in October the state of 
Alaska will be sending me a permanent fund check for $1500 which is my cut 
of the oil profits which I get as a state resident.  It is a nice fringe 
benefit but one cannot live here just for that.  And so I wish to spend part 
of that on these items.

At this point I am considering buying hypno-peripheral audiocassettes that 
supposedly are a quantum leap up from the old subliminal tapes.  Are these 
tapes really effective?  Do any of you use them and think they work?  What 
brands are best?  I am planning on buying tapes for memory and self-esteem 
to name a few.

The "no-horizon in view" goggles for $200 that are in the Tools for 
Exploration catalog seem a possibility for entering an enhanced state of 
relaxation so that the hypno-peripheral tapes would have a better chance of 
influencing me.  Anyone tried this device and if so any thoughts?

Though the cost is high and I probably won't buy one the light and sound 
machines (brain machines) interest me.  The company with the David series 
impresses me the most.  If I could shell out $600 painlessly I would 
consider buying their top of the line model but I have heard conflicting 
stories on just how well these machines work.  Some say all they do is relax 
or excite you really.  What are the views here on them?  In my town a local 
massage place offers them for use at one dollar a minute and I was thinking 
of visiting him.

I have heard a group of Russian scientists have developed a sort of "brain 
washing for your own good" system using advanced forms of these 
technologies.  They are trying to market it in the United States now.  I saw 
a short bit on it on cable news a few months ago.  Anyone here about this?

In "Megabrains" I read about various systems that send electrical current 
through the brain.  Does this technique really enhance cognitive function?  
Of the various devices which do you recommend if any?  I would look pretty 
funny all hooked up to some of these as I went about campus!!

I really wish someone in Anchorage had isolation tanks that they rented out 
so I could try one out!!  They fascinate me with the stories of dream-like 
hallucinations that people have in them.  My $1500 would barely put a 
down-payment of one of these tanks!  Have any of you used an isolation tank? 
  What was the experience like?

I am one of those people who rarely remember their dreams and so I paid $250 
a few years ago for a dream monitoring kit from that scientist LaBurge(I 
believe that is the name) who has pioneered lucid dreaming.  I tried to use 
it repeatedly to no effect.  I sleep like the dead and it did not work on 
any setting.  If I could afford it I would want the $1200 deluxe device they 
offer that is what is used in actual sleep labs.  Have any of you used this 
device?

I am interested in the Tomatis technology developed by French scientist 
Alfred Tomatis.  The machine supposedly is a converter of sorts that takes 
music or the spoken word and puts it into frequencies that give the ear a 
"work-out!"  He has centers all over the world I have read and quite a 
following.  The claim is that not only does it enhance hearing but will help 
with dyslexia and enhance any HPP sort of audiocassette.  The price for his 
device is steep at $800 dollars!  I am dyslexic and a little hard of hearing 
so I would like to try one out.

What nutritional supplements would any of you recommend?  I keep on hearing 
about how great ginko is but have not tried it over the long-term.  Does it 
really work?  What general nutritional tips would any of you give to me for 
enhancing the brain?

OF the different books out there that say they will teach techniques to 
improve memory and problem solving which would you recommend?  
"Super-learning" and "MegaMemory" are what comes to mind.

I am fascinated by the "Tools for Exploration" catalog!  I realize some of 
what is in there is just snake oil but still other items do seem to have 
real value.  Had I the money I could easily spend ten grand on what they 
have in there!

Are there books on interpersonal relationships with women (a little more 
advance then "How to Pick Up Women!") that any of you would recommend?  
There is a fellow who runs a company called "Intimate Connections" that for 
$350 dollars will send a book and 12 tape set on this subject!  I actually 
called him up and he made a good sounding argument for his methods that 
involve making connections emotionally with women.  He said men have a very 
binary approach to women where females are very open-ended which throws many 
men off.  The author has an educational background in computing and 
psychology but still $350!!

I suffer from clinical depression, a.d.d. and learning disabilities that 
have had their effect on my life even though I allowed the damage to be far 
greater then it should have been by giving up.  I plan on going back on 
antidepressants soon (money problems...and the state cut all funding for the 
working poor..) and will probably go back to Luvox which is popular in 
Europe.  I think overcoming my depression alone would be the huge 
breakthrough I need.  I am also considering Ritalin to get a hold on my 
a.d.d. but am nervous about possible side effects.

What computer software would any of you recommend to help me improve my 
mind?  I have seen the game "Thinkfast" that seems very impressive.  Any 
thoughts on that?  I do not own a p.c. and my college would not allow me to 
play a "game" on theirs but I found a nonprofit agency in town that has a 
computer lab for the "disabled" and with my l.d. I qualify so I could use 
the software there.

My learning disabilities have so far stopped me from driving though I took 
driver's ed years ago and did pass but never went to the DMV after my 
instructor told me how incompetent I was at driving.
I actually bought myself a driving software program from Sierra online for 
$45 dollars that to me and my driving (but not car owning) brother was a 
complete joke!  Even if you were good at the game it was still nowhere 
realistic enough to teach driving.

I would like to get my hands (and feet) into a top quality commercial 
driving simulator but I don't think Anchorage has any except for the state 
of the art one the police have!  I somehow doubt they would let me use it!  
But if they did I could learn not only how to drive but how to do high-speed 
pursuits!!

I will probably just buy several HPP tapes and the no-horizon goggles.  That 
will cost me about $400 anyway.  I do not want to spend my whole check on 
the items I have discussed though that would be fun but I still very much 
want feedback from any of you who have had experiences with these various 
items.  Being in Alaska I tend to be isolated.  I have heard how in 
California there are "brain gyms" where for a fee I could try out just about 
anything I have written about here!  I wish they had one up here.

I will be keeping $500 aside for my Australian ladyfriend who it looks like 
may very well be visiting me in the first week of December for just a week.  
This will be the tail-end of a trip to the states and she will have already 
spent two months in the Utah and California area!  So much for getting to 
know her first-hand before all the other fellows do!!  She will stay in my 
parents spare bedroom while I stay elsewhere.  I hope to show her a good 
time here in Anchorage and maybe win her heart even.  Of course that is 
probably wishful thinking on my part once she gets a good look at me and my 
life!  She already has her degree and I am at least two years away from my 
own.  She is beautiful and can have any man probably that she wants.  
Earlier today I was reading in Amazon.com about the chilling subject of 
evolutionary biology and the books written about it.

I know I need to get my act together and these tools may just help me do it. 
  I was seriously disciplined at work for being late three times in a row.  
I slept in and dragged my feet this morning to the point that I missed 
church.  I know I need to get to bed earlier but more then that I just don't 
want to get up and face the world in the morning.  It's almost like I want 
to go into suspended animation right now and not face life.  Part of me 
feels poisoned by what I have learned from Extropians but yet I have this 
urge to get what I consider fair from life despite my genetic and 
environmental set-backs and to do so while spurred on by an anger that is 
deep inside me which comes from seeing how so many have it better then I do. 
  Now many are infinitely worse off then me in this war and poverty drenched 
world and that also makes me enraged.

I look forward to the feedback I get from the group!  This is a great 
posting for those of you who like to cut and paste to do your replies!  You 
can really go to town on this one! LOL!  My resources are limited so I want 
to invest my dollars in technologies and techniques that will really help 
me.  I thank you all.  If I can I will attend Extro 4.  My only hope to go 
is to borrow $500 from someone here in Anchorage against the value of my 
permanent dividend check that I get in October.  I have had no luck so far 
and think I may have to go to a loan shark!!  I am kidding on that one.  But 
if I can I will make it.

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Hello everyone,

I have been fascinated by the brains versus buns argument.  I recently read 
that indeed male offspring do get their intellectual endowment from the 
mother and not the father.  But do they get nothing from the father??  I 
need feedback on this matter.

I am interested in the idea that human intellectual development has been 
slowed down or even stopped by the limited size of the female pelvic 
structure which would allow our brains at birth to be generally only so big! 
  Why did not nature provide a way around this such as a physiological 
condition where the pelvis could expand even more then it does presently?   
Do you all agree that this is true??  This is a moot question now that with 
genetic engineering we will be able to increase the size of power of our 
brains.

How many of you agree with the thought that a woman's best bet is to mate 
with Mr. buns only (as compared to mr. buns and brains) so that she gets 
genes for health and looks while she does not need Mr. brains because she 
already as an intelligent woman has that base covered?  Would Mr. Buns and 
Brains be genetically overpowering in the battle for birth weight vrs. 
health of the mother??   But then genetically optimal males are at a premium 
for the discerning female.

Like others have stated I consider this a very simplistic argument because 
people do not usually fall so neatly into categories.  And an individual can 
usually do much to upgrade his attractibility to the opposite sex.

And a key factor not discussed has been how social status (being the MR. 
cool in a cool group) can definitely make a male attractive to females.  Of 
course being Mr. Buns helps to get one into these groups.  But some groups 
are open only to a Mr. Brains.  Do any of you scientists and professors out 
there have female groupies??  I'm going for a doctorate if the answer is 
yes!

Sincerely,

John Grigg

They probably only mine planets when more easily accessible materials
have run out. There might be technomagical tricks how to crack a
planet quickly, then there might be not. Obviously, there are upper
limits to how much energy can be deployed on the planetary surface
without destroying the mining/launch structures. Fragmentation by
impact makes for a better surface/volume rate, but will probably
result in lossage of volatiles, and require some cooling off period.

Some of them are not in a hurry. Some of them are. These who travel
and reproduce fastest will obviously very quickly overwhelm any
sluggards in sheer numbers. There might be a couple of sluggard
civilisations nuclei out there in the Andromeda somewhere (unless the
rapid travellers have starved them out of their resources, or eaten
them alive, which is the more logical conclusion), but they will be
sure difficult to find.

They don't have living quarters, space is their native habitat (this
form doesn't like anything other than hard vacuum). They may do no
more sience than the Amazon jungle: some humans in some university
somewhere might be doing some experiments, but the rest of the ecology
_just is_.

 > But that answer can be effectively countered because:
 > - advanced species very probably master birth control

Advanced species almost certainly rely on evolving autoreplicators,
and it is impossible to contain freely evolving autoreplicators. The
intelligent forms might have no interest in harming us, but some of
their symbionts/parasites will not be so docile. A mature stellar
ecology might be immune to gray goo type of autoreplicators, but a
virgin system as ours certainly isn't. Oops, there go the natives.

Probably the best argument against such type of aliens is that our
system seems to be in pristine shape, and bits of graphene
nanomachinery are not raining from the skies.

Advances in science and building means is that you can mine more more
quickly. A civilisation that is essentially a bit pattern coded as
electronically excited states can grow essentially hard at the edge of
the light cone. It is not hard to imagine that easily accessible
material in a stellar system can be entirely converted in the course
of a few months/years. Only the kinetically less accessible materials

Brilliant.

The significance of this last comment extends way beyond the current
discussion. It applies especially to contemporary progressive politics,
where what started in the 60's as a reasonable critique of European and
American colonialism has today mushroomed into a virulent hatred of any
form of growth, adventure, or expansion... yes, I am talking about
Political Correctness.

The nanotech civilization analogy points out just how absurd this position
is in the long term. There is always power, always growth, and with them,
inequality. Abdicating power in favour of voluntary simplicity and quiet
contemplation does not abolish it. Merely presents it on a silver platter
to someone more ruthless and hungry than you.

Sorry to go off topic. I just couldn't ignore this sudden crystallization
of just what it is that bugs me about today's "radical" politics.

There are different kinds of intelligence, and for some people
mathematics is just hard. Fortunately, there is some nice sofware like
Mathematica and Numpy out there, which can somewhat compensate. Also,
I believe the fastest way to gain an intuitive understanding for
orbital mechanics is to write an interactive Newtonian/gravitation
simulator, and then just fumble with system parameters. Understanding
how multiple gravity-assisted flybys work is difficult on paper
anyway.

I don't think much can be done about it without fumbling inside your
skull at cellular/molecular level. For now, having a great teacher is
as good as it gets. Not everybody is a Feynman.

Has it occurred to you that if the first uploads *are* charitably
inclined, then it's *much* safer to be in the second wave?  The first
uploads are likely to be more in the nature of suicide volunteers,
especially when you consider that a rough, destructive, but adequate
scan is likely to come before a perfect, nondestructive scan.

You're staking an awful lot on the selfishness of superintelligences. 
Maybe you don't have the faintest speck of charity in your soul, but if
uploading and upgrading inevitably wipes out enough of your personality
that anyone would stop being cooperative - well, does it really make
that much of a difference who this new intelligence "started out" as? 
It's not you.  I know that you might identify with a selfish SI, but my
point is that if SIs are *inevitably* selfish, if *anyone* would
converge to selfishness, that probably involves enough of a personality
change in other departments that even you wouldn't call it you.

Sure.  One bullet, no more Specialist.  Except that that just means it
takes a few more years.  You can't stop it forever.  All you can do is
speed up the development of nanotech...relatively speaking.  We both
know you can't steer a car by selectively shooting out the tires.

More sophisticated nanotech, and it's nanotech in your own personal
hands.  I don't need personal nanotech to die, but I need it to run. 
Realistically, it's obvious that the probabilities are not in my favor. 
Unless I'm so caught up in wishful thinking that I think I can get, and
retain exclusive control of, nanotechnology AND uploading AND AI AND
intelligence enhancement... but why continue?

Quite.  And an inescapable one.  See, what *you* want is unrealistic
because you want yourself to be the first one to upload, which excludes
you from cooperation with more than a small group and limits your
ability to rely on things like open-source projects and charitable
foundations.  What *they* want is unrealistic because they want to
freeze progress.

Both of you are imposing all kinds of extra constraints.  You're always
going to be at a competitive disadvantage relative to a pure
Singularitarian or the classic "reckless researcher", who doesn't demand
that the AI be loaded down with coercions, or that nanotechnology not be
unleashed until it can be used for space travel, or that nobody uploads
until everyone can do it simultaneously, or that nobody has access to
the project except eight people, and so on ad nauseam.  The open-source
free-willed AI project is going to be twenty million miles ahead while
you're still dotting your "i"s and crossing your "t"s.

I don't understand your calculations.

A-priori chance that you, personally, can be in the first 6 people to
upload:  1e-9.
Extremely optimistic chance:  1%
Extremely pessimistic chance that AIs are benevolent: 10%

Therefore it's 10 times better to concentrate on AI.

If they ignore that scenario then they're not very interesting, besides, we don't need
all of them. If even one civilization took to the Nanotechnology path anytime in the last
5  billion years ago or so  it would be obvious to anyone who had eyes that the night sky

Nanotechnology may or may not be near on a human time scale, but from a cosmological
perspective it will happen instantaneously, this very instant.

I disagree. You can breed superhuman AI from scratch much easier than
to make an upload. Building optimal, or near-optimal nanocomputers is
very easy, and an evolved AI could certainly utilize the optimal
hardware optimally.

Uploading requires either low-artefact brain vitrification and then
destructive scan or gradual in vivo uploading, with 10^6..10^9
nanomachines operating within your cranium. Doing this will be hard
for us, but trivial to an AI. However, the AI probably has absolutely
no interest in doing our housework for us.

The gap is only temporal: the supercomputers might use the same
processors, but I don't know very many 3rd-graders who own ~6 kCPU
machines, along with the according infrastructure.

Not interesting!?  Maybe not to you...but if I became aware of an extrasolar

have they been around?  What do they know?  This has to be the most absurd

Assuming that they _wanted_ to engineer the cosmos.  Again, this 
pronouncement is ridiculous.  And what's with the capital "N" on 
"nanotechnology"?  It's a technology--a tool--not a damned religion.  Must we 
all bow our heads in awe to the Great God of Nanotech, Without Which 
Interstellar Travel is Impossible?  (That bit about non-nano aliens not being 
interesting anyway was a blatant cop-out, completely removed from informed 
speculation.)

An alien civilization is not some abstracted phenomenon out to prove its 
existence to the galaxy (or, more accurately, to John K. Clark).  There are 
any number of worthwhile things it could spend its time doing.  Assuming that 
the nanotech diaspora scenario is the _only_ scenario is a dangerous 
make-believe designed to cut intelligent discourse in the bud, serving to 
police "non-Extropian" memes.

As a possibility, I have no trouble with it whatsoever.  Maybe it's even 
likely--but I'm not going to go beyond my data and proclaim that it's "nano 
or nothing."

>We see nothing of the sort, thus I conclude that quite probably their are no

Nanotechnology isn't a "done deal," but I tend to agree with this last 
statement.  We're more than likely on the verge.  But it's premature speaking 
in absolutes, when a variety of scenarios demand attention.  If we're going 
to discover some alien intelligence in the future, it's _not_ going to be 
through the blinkered reasoning of these last several posts.

Title
  Intake of olive oil can
  modulate the transbilayer movement of human erythrocyte membrane cholesterol.
Source
  Cellular & Molecular Life Sciences.  53(6):496-500, 1997 Jun.
Abstract
  Transbilayer movement of erythrocyte membrane cholesterol is impaired in
  patients affected with essential hypertension. This is an inherited disorder,
  but environmental factors are also involved. Dietary fats might play a role
  in the prevention and/or treatment of such abnormality in the kinetic pools
  of membrane cholesterol. We tested this hypothesis by using a diet (in which
  30% of the energy came from fat) rich in olive
  oil or in high-oleic sunflower oil (as
  natural sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFAs) and determining their
  influence on the movement of cholesterol into the lipid bilayer of the
  erythrocyte membrane after a four-week period. We concluded that dietary
  olive oil is helpful in normalizing the
  impaired transbilayer movement of membrane cholesterol in erythrocytes of
  eight normocholesterolaemic and eight hypercholesterolaemic hypertensive
  patients. However, the effects cannot be attributed exclusively to the
  content of MUFAs (mainly oleic acid) in the diet, as high-oleic sunflower
  oil was unable to induce favourable changes.

Little noticed by the mainstream, the hitherto special-purpose DSPs
have matured into full computer systems on a chip. For instance the
Analog Devices SHARC DSP family

	http://products.analog.com/products_html/list_gen_98_2_1.html

has a new member with the following intriguing characteristics:

600 MFlops peak
4 (soon 8) MBit on-die RAM with 1.6 GByte/s bandwidth
6 Byte-wide links, capable of 600 MBytes/s total transfer
27 mm x 27 mm PBGA with 4 W maximal heat dissipation
capability to boot from link
glueless integration into 3d DSP arrays by direct linking
pricing $10 in 100k quantities (Real Soon Now)

Obviously, by simply glueing arrays of chips onto 500 mm x 500 mm
(say, perforated copper) support, connecting the next neighbours with
links, stacking 16 of such units (~200 mm), interconnecting the stack,
we arrive at a 4 kCPU, 2 GByte RAM, 17 kW thermal dissipation, 2.5
TFlop peak, 6.5 TByte/s memory bandwidth and 2.5 TByte/s aggregate
link bandwidth in a volume of 0.05 m^3, for the raw silicon price of
~50 k$, the price of a current server or a mid-range engineering
workstation.

(17 kW in a volume thus small could be easily contained using a liquid
heat exchanger, such as a flurocarbon or a mineral oil).

As this is a 3d lattice, I can more or less (mostly for coolant
plumbing issues) easily scale this to 20 such units for budget of 1
M$. We're talking ~100 k computational elements here. (I do not gloss
over the reliability issue, the dead units can be easily managed by
software if running nonbrittle (fault-resistant) codes.

Now, we can easily dismiss the above as ravings of a geek struck with
arithmomania. However, I cannot help but wonder what such a mid-1999
technology (even barring progress in nanotechnology, we can assume
Moore will hold up to ~2010.) 1 M$ machine could accomplish, _if
properly programmed_.

Oh, we can't program it properly? But a 100 kCPU machine can shuffle
opcodes damn quickly, 24 h/day, 365 d/year. Despite all the Kozas of
this world, we cannot mutate assembler opcodes in a nonbrittle
manner. However, nothing prevents us from making a robust mutator
function our fitness goal. Find the code which mutates the machine
code without breaking it too often. Feed back the best performing
mutation function specimens back into the population searching for the
best mutation function. (Did somebody just said
"autocatalysis"?). Mix, stir, repeat until done.

Hey, can someone spare a coupla megabucks?

Why can we now (imho) afford to kill the biosphere, and not to suffer
the damage of associated biodiversity loss overmuch? Combinatorial
chemistry can create and screen huge molecular libraries, and virtual
screening (darwin in silico) is about to enter the pharma
mainstream. The importance of the biosphere as a potential drug pool
is thus dwindling rapidly.

Aliens are interesting because they are a pool of memetic
diversity. Aliens without command of nanotechnology are not
interesting _for a nano-civilisation_ because it can invent a low tech
pre-nano civilisation, nuts & bolts and all, on a lazy afternoon. In
fact, we can be right now be very well basking in such a petri
dish. (The meaning of life? You're soaking in it).

Look, we are talking about a population of civilisations which consist
of populations of individua. Such a substrate can amplify a certain
molecular- or quantum-scale event (=a bright idea) to cosmic scale. Do
I really need to berate the obvious, and explain the implications of
this?

You've not done your homework, and it shows. Nanotechnology, if it
works, is really, really Major News.

You're not listening, interstellar spacetravel with nano rides hard
the edges of the light cone without assuming any funky new physics,
try repeating that trick with flesh. There might be some flesh
travellers somewhere at the edge of time frozen in transit, they will
be certainly very surprised when they arrive at their destination.

Another scenario: 20 years from you build your spaceships, I build my
nanocomputers, we both being individua, members of the same
population. You embark on a journey to Alpha Centauri, while the world
behind you explodes in a developmental Singularity. Nanotechnology is
a critical enabler for it, but it may not stop at that -- but
extrapolate beyond that is pointless speculation. While you spend 10
kYears in transit, the sphere of nanoprobes has colonized a volume
hardly less than 20 k light years in diameter. Now, think how many
civilisations there might be in the volume of the observable
universe. Of course, the light coming from there is too old, and they
all might be hatching semisynchonously with us. However, 100 kYears is
next to nothing in geological time scales, and there are billions of
stars in our very own local galactic system.

Assuming above scenario, you (monkeys in speeding cans) are not
observable. The gaping hole in the skies few 10 k light years across
is however is very much observable. The very absence of such
observably transformed regions imposes a whole lot of contraints. I'm
sure there are thousands of people all over the world going bananas
over that dilemma.

I do not always agree with John, but he's hardly cool and dismissive,
he's just very succinct. He delivers results, but does not give a
braindump explaining the reasoning behind it.

I think we as a species are going to be at least as interesting as
aylieuhns in a short brief while. Phone home, I need to phone home
now.

Writing skill apparently is more important than mathematical skill to a
programmer (this comes from software engineering lore, maybe I can find a
reference, but only if it is really wanted because it would be a very
annoying and not very enlightening task). The kinds of thinking used to
structure a report or an essay are apparently very similar to the kinds of
thinking used to structure a non-trivial software system. This still begs
the question of why documentation written by IT people is so piss poor, but
that is a question for the SIs. Of course if your system is about
mathematics then you'll need a math brain, but probably only one, compared
to X many people who can cut support code thats got nothing to do with
maths.

Anderson Consulting here appears to recruit people from law and the
humanities to be IT consultants, and trains them in coding itself. Being a
software engineer myself (that's crapspeak for a code cutter who also does
pretty pictures in MSWord), I doubt the efficacy of this, but it's their
money.

If it were me, I would hire talented magicians. I think that slight of hand
is highly underrated as a prerequisite for system design & implementation.
Also people with a family history of winning the lottery (genetic luck)
would be a damned good choice.

But they'd still be crap at maths.

Well- you've certainly already compiled quite a list. 
Maybe... semantics training?  In The Tyranny of Words,
the author states that when they taught young children
semantics, they made slight upward jumps in iq.  The
same may be true of any sort of like discipline-
logic, maybe even crossword puzzles?  Vizualisation,
used by dimestore mystics for a great deal of the
time, may be helpfull in improving visual and or
spatial memory.  You know, memorizing, say what a
bookshelf looks like, or a photograph, and then
holding the image in your mind with your eyes closed.
An old ninja technique for increasing tactile
awareness involved bringing stones out of a box,
letting the trainee feel them, returning them to the
box and having the trainee describe as many as they
can by feel.  I suppose you could do similar things
with sets of say, differently smelling objects or
objects that were different in appearance... you might
try taking a bottle of pennies and work on remmebering
all the dates.  Or memorize passages from magazine
articles.  The greeks used to think that a sound mind
could only be achieved while the body was sound, and
vice versa.  I tend to beleive that this is at least
somewhat true- physical activities such as baseball,
fencing, gymnastics or soccer improve various aspects
of coordination and balence, which is another part of
the mental sphere.  I have got to go to sleep though,

Okay, so it's a damn big pattern-catcher, but it's still just a
pattern-catcher.  I don't think AI is that simple.  It sounds large, in
absolute terms, but relative to what already exists:

1.  Raw power is about the equivalent of, what, a rat's brain?
2.  Self-programming algorithm... around the spider level, I'd guess.

If intelligence was that simple, rats would be sentient.

And appreciation of "style" is less superficial and primal than the
appreciation of pretty faces? I think not. They're all evaluation criteria,
the "style" amounting to a good social "dance", which reflects the equally
important internal abilities.

Apparently (According to some biology documentary I saw recently), the
pelvis has already evolved to it's maximum width able to support walking on
two legs, for exactly the reason you mention. Any wider and the stress of
walking would become too much.

Mass X acceleration equates to units of force, but mass X velocity^2
equates to units of energy.  Since 'impulse', which is force X time,
equates to momentum, which is mass X velocity, force equates to [mass X
velocity] / time.


So, would it not be more correct to express the inequality as

sailmass X gravitationalacceleration > [solarwindmass / time] X
windvelocity,

so that the units balance?


In other words, if mass is impacting a target at the rate of one kilogram
per second with a relative velocity of one meter per second, and if the
collision is non-elastic such that all the momentum of the impacting mass
(relative to the target) is transferred to the target, the force imparted
to the target is one Newton.

I did this (while I was in law school just to stay sane)!  I found the core 
BASIC code for a gravity simulator in Astronomy magazine some time in the mid 
80s and translated it into Apple BASIC for my old steam-powered Apple IIe.  
Then I built an interface that let me tweak the paramters.  I spent dozens of 
hours playing with it learned a lot . . .

Hi,
I'm new to this list.
Do any of you know about the existence of do it yourself kits for dna
tests....maybe connectable(?) to the net to compare data?
......
Another question:
Would it be theorically possible to put dna data, or later in time when
counsciousness will be defined(as quantum...or else) in a computer and
clone himself virtually that way?
Thanks,
Gabriele

It's probably already been stated on an earlier post, but could someone
please tell me again:


(1)  How long ago approximately did it become possible (feasible) for
technological civilizations to develop?  IOW, how long *have* they had to
expand?  John refers to 5 billion years above.  Was it really that long ago?
Were there heavy element planets around back then?

(2)  John states that it would be obvious to anyone with eyes that the night
sky was engineered.  Could he or someone else expand on this a bit or give
me a reference.

Thanks,

Scott

My friend, any technology that has the awesome power of Nanotechnology will have

Interstellar travel is possible without Nanotechnology, it's also silly.

The advice I can offer is on food/vitamins/herbs for the brain. Based on
healthy body - healthy mind. 
Over the last six months I have changed my diet, for detox reasons, and have
felt improved mental clarity. This started with a visit to a naturopath.
Maybe naturopaths are a mixed bunch in the US, I dunno. Certainly I  found
the iridology diagnosis of my naturopath to be accurate - and more
insightful than the diagnosis I received from my MD. 
IRON and the B VITAMINS
deficiencies here can certainly inflame depression. Other symptoms include
sensitivity to light and sound, and faintless/breathlessness during
exercise. Iron is absorbed better taken concurrently with Vitamin C. 
DAIRY PRODUCTS
Dairy products give me a head ful of snot, sore stomach, and feeling
sluggish and mentally uninspired. Although this isn't true for all, the
naturopath said that about 50% of the population would feel much better if
they gave up dairy products.
The rest of my advice is on detoxing organs of elimination.
Inefficient digestion can cause mental and physical slugishness. Taking
acidophilus and bifidus - within yoghurt or their own - can help replace
friendly gut flora if they are depleted. If you have taken antibiotics or
yeast (bread, beer, vegemite) you might need some of these flora. Digestive
enzymes may also be helpful.
Gotta love that liver. Fruit fruit fruit seems to help. Also I have found St
Mary's Thistle and Dandelion root tea have helped me.
For my kidneys I have been adviced to drink 2 litres of water a day. Man
drinking enough water has been very important for me to feel clear in my
head. Apparently adicity can be a problem for the kidneys, so alkaline food
for eg pears can help.

Anyway I'm feeling great. In this last week I started working night shifts.
I am certain that the fact that I am still vaguely lucid can be attributed
to this stuff.

Good luck
Jodie

Unfortunately, nobody knows anything about the empirical nature of
consciousness and how it might be created/replicated, so contrary to other
posts which will (I'm sure, going by previous discussions) declare
wholeheartedly some absolute answer to your question, there's no way of
knowing or even guessing at present. If you're interested in consciousness
(join the club), look up "The Conscious Mind" a book by David Chalmers. It
is absolutely superb. Really clears your head, allowing you to focus upon
the real issues surrounding consciousness, instead of running in tail-biting
circles due to bad, intersecting definitions of
consciousness,awareness,qualia and experience.

My curiosity was piqued because there is a Landover Hills Baptist Church
about 20 miles from where I live.  The site is clearly a parody.

I question whether intelligence is so helpful that all mammals evolved
to be as intelligent as possible.  It seems to me that intelligence is
of questionable value in the day to day life of an animal.

Consider the life of prehistoric humans.  I don't see why someone
marginally more intelligent than others will have much of an advantage in
hunting or gathering.  Most of what is needed is learned culturally, and
those techniques have been optimized over generations to approximate local
maxima.  Sure, even ten or twenty thousand years someone domesticates
a new animal or discovers fire, but these events are so rare they can't
have any significant evolutionary input.

My feeling is that people stumbled onto some cultural and physical
changes which set up specific incentives for greater intelligence -
bipedalism, the use of spears, fire, tools, etc.  This brought us up to
IQ 100.  But that was smart enough for these purposes.  IQs of 130 or
150 wouldn't make someone any better at using these tools.

"Detoxification" is one of the buzzwords that marks a charlatan, so
any "information" on it is fraudulent and probably dangerous.  More
good info can be found at <http://www.quackwatch.com>.

This argument too has been long since debunked, and people using it
have been and will continue to be jailed.  As always, it pays to be
most skeptical of ideas you would /like/ to be true; but a charlatan
on the side of freedom is still a charlatan.

Once you've tried rubbing cod liver oil on your nads and wrapping a rabbit's
foot in a dock leaf, and failed, try something sensible. The old cliche "The
brain's like a muscle, the more you use it, the better it gets" is the only
approach that I would recommend with an expectation of real, measureable
results. It definitely has worked for me. 
So, what could you train your brain with? What would work a wide enough
range of basic brain functions to observe a change for the better. I'd say
IQ tests. Much as their ability to measure the undefined "intelligence" is
highly questionable, they have been designed to isolate certain types of
brain function and test performance, such as spatial ability (a good "mind's
eye"), learning ability, memory and computational speed. Given this, we can
expect an increase in your brain's effectiveness in these areas in response
to IQ test practice. i.e. Get loads of 'em, and do 'em all. Naturally,
you'll improve with practice. These gained skills will be noticable in real
life, for sure. Don't forget - your brain's a neural net, so train it !

It's not a pattern catcher. It's an all-purpose architecture (tho' it
has got a few blind spots on the performance scala). It is not an AI,
just a framework for an AI/a part of boundary conditions for the
emergence of one.

One would still need a good bootstrap plan.

It is difficult to link GBytes & MIPSen to neurons without calibrating
this first (i.e. looking how this thing can solve problems vs
wetware). My point was to illustrate what we can do NOW on modest
budget with industrial commodity silicon, then just point to Moore's
law, and giggle.

If that thing performed as intelligently and as robustly as a rat, I
could get all the funding I want. Autonomous planes, tanks, robots,
you name it.

There are quite a few buzzwords like that. I've been using some as
exclusion terms in my customized search links on GerOL. There are probably
many other uses for bullshit exclusion. Here's my collection of words that
automatically make a website suspect (add yours, if you have any):

free
teen
hardcore
adult

Life sciences specific exclusion terms:

miracle
immortality
western medicine
medical establishment
cure for cancer
homeopathic
spiritual

Terms that I've seen on legitimate sites (therefore not suitable as
exclusion terms), but usually have a strong correlation with BS:

fountain of youth
wholistic
herbal
alternative medicine
ancient
natural
healing
ginseng

I exclude the .com domain from my searches altogether to skip the hundreds
of pill-pusher sites out there, but this is probably too drastic a measure
since it may exclude real research organizations. Maybe to compile a list
of fraudulent sites, in the same way as lists of spam-sites are compiled?
What would be good criteria for categorizing a site as fraudulent?

Of course ignoring for the moment that automated searches will
exclude sites that contain these terms in order to ridicule them,
and that "immortality" would block much of ExI, Alcor, and other
such sites, that's good start on a list.  You can also add anything
that claims to "boost/support the immune system", "melt fat",
"increase energy" or any site that supports iridology, applied
kinesiology, ayurvedic medicine, therapeutic touch, "straight"
chiropractic, and many other long-established frauds.

Best source of info I've found is quackwatch.com (which you would
ironically exclude).  There are plenty of quacky .orgs as well.
Be cautious of libertarian-oriented "health freedom" sites; they are,
as a rule, far too tolerant of quackery.

It may be worthwhile for Extropians to compile lists of charlatanism. The
benefit of such a list would be that whenever Extropians come across a
charlatan buzzword they'll know without further investigation that the author
is a charlatan and that his/her "information" on it is fraudulent and probably
dangerous. I suggest the following for starters:

Detoxification
Raw food
Beat the tax system
High-yield investments (e.g., 60% per month)
Anarchism
Humans free by nature
Power of choice

I would appreciate other Extropians' charlatanism lists.

While there may be a lot of useful information at 


http://www.quackwatch.com 

one of the underlying themes there seems to be that all nutrients and drugs
should be controlled by terrocrats, and that terrocrats should require
medical licensing and have the authority to approve or deny the sale of
certain substances. For an example take a look at the article at 


http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hfreedom.html

The above article is critical of those who talk about "health freedom" and
implies that anyone who believes in health freedom is either a quack or
someone who's been deceived by quacks.

Sure, there may be a lot of quacks out there, but as long as they aren't
doing anything to purposely deceive their customers, and their customers
want to take their suggestions and/or buy their products, they should have
the freedom to do so, and to live with the consequences.

Hi Hal,
Learning things culturally takes intelligence.

The discovery of fire is a good example.  Fire was probably discovered a large
number of times before the invention caught on.  And when it did catch on, I
imagine that for quite a few generations, that the leading cause of death was
fire safety related.  Until the point that people too stupid to use fire
safely were weeded out of the population.

I agree.

Gosh, are these guys for real??? Ban all life-sized dolls since they might

Obviously there are a lot of moralist puritan nuts even outside Sweden.

Yes, quackwatch.com is overly regulation-friendly.  Many libertarian
sites are quack-friendly.  While neither of those is a great combination,
both nonetheless contain valuable information.  I don't think extropians
will have any trouble ignoring the political undertones of Quackwatch.
As a libertarian, I would not choose to use state force to shut down a
naturopath or a supplement seller or even a psychic--but that doesn't
mean I approve of them or would want my daughter to marry one.  I would
not call the cops on a homeopath, nor would I prevent neo-Nazis from
publishing a newsletter, but I would not allow either one in my house.
Libertarian politics do not preclude moral judgment.

No, just all "straight" chiropractors.  Straight chiropractors
are those who do nothing but spinal manipulations, and do them to
treat organic disease.  Straight chiropractors openly reject the
germ theory of disease in favor of the idea that subluxations of
the spine cause everything.  They also encourage their patients
to get regular treatments for no reason, even for children.

Most modern chiropractors are more enlightened, and will use
spinal manipulation to treat back/neck/head pain, where it has
shown some effectiveness, but will resort to more traditional
medicine when it is appropriate.

In fact, I went to a chiropractor once myself when I fell
playing basketball.  I just wanted to see if I cracked a rib
seriously enough to warrant attention, but didn't want to go
through all the mountain of paperwork and hassles of my PPO,
so I just walked into a chiropractor's office, told him I
wanted an Xray, slipped him a few bucks and got it done.  I'm
all for deregulation. :)

While there may be a lot of useful information at 


http://www.quackwatch.com 

one of the underlying themes there seems to be that all nutrients and drugs
should be controlled by terrocrats, and that terrocrats should require
medical licensing and have the authority to approve or deny the sale of
certain substances. For an example take a look at the article at 


http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hfreedom.html

The above article is critical of those who talk about "health freedom" and
implies that anyone who believes in health freedom is either a quack or
someone who's been deceived by quacks.

Sure, there may be a lot of quacks out there, but as long as they aren't
doing anything to purposely deceive their customers, and their customers
want to take their suggestions and/or buy their products, they should have
the freedom to do so, and to live with the consequences.

1)  It was a question/request-for-documentation, more than a retort.

The word 'retort' implies that I was refuting your claim.  I know that
there is a dictionary definition that does not include this implication,
but I am refering to the more common usage, which does include such an
implication.  I'm just skeptical (but I would like to think in a
non-dogmatic way), and I don't believe people on such matters on a "trust
me" basis, especially when the assertions are contrary to the prevailing
consensus view.  I want some empirical evidence, which I happen to think is
a perfectly reasonable and rational attitude.  It certainly is an attitude
I would expect people to share on this list.  So please don't take offense,
because I'd like to believe your assertions, but I also need to be
convinced by some evidence.

2)  Unfortunately, the list archives (<http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/>
is the link I get from ExI's homepage) only go up to 3Q 1998, so I could
not find your prior post by searching the archives.

Do you have another copy of your post in your "out" box, or somewhere on
your harddrive, that you could send me?  (Private email is fine).  Or some
other pointer?

I will admit, however, that I am less interested in a "lengthy analysis of
the tax code" than in a simple citation (or four) for that list of four
categories of people required to file and/or pay income taxes.  I'm not
asking you to prove the negative that nobody besides those four categories
is required to file and/or pay (I know how hard that proof is, and I know
that that proving a negative does require a lengthy analysis to be at all
convincing, i.e., worthy of being assessed as "highly probable").

I just asked for simple citations that those four categories are required
to pay/file.  Those are positive assertions, and should be supportable with
specific citations to the U.S. tax code or the decision of an authoritative
court.  I can then fill in the common legal inference that "what is not
included is necessarily excluded" by myself.

	Isn't there a concern on this list regarding PR? 
	Basically a concern for being seen as QUACKS?
	And a desire to have the general public at the very least tolerate
ideas of life extension?

This thread may prove a very useful opportunity to understand something of
the mindset of derbrains opposed to lengthening life. What we now have is
very useful feedback on how people respond to charlatans. You can become
your own subjects, in an informal study into how people respond to ideas
they perceive as quacky. 

Is it reasonable to assume that the PR concerns are about this - being seen
as a bunch of crazy fringe looneys? If so why not be a focus group?

If you don't mind using yourself in this way:
The questions to address are
What would it take to change your opinion of charlatans from bullshitter to
someone who may have something, but you are not very motivated to really
care either way?
What would it take to make you change your mind from perceiving someone as a
quack to someone legitimate?
What would it take to motivate you to act on their advice?
What would it take to make you a life time convert?
How would you need to receive messages about their legitimacy? For eg
personal testaments, articles in written media by people that you trust, and
what sort of person would you trust to persuade you to change your opinion
on a quack?


The answers to these questions will provide a good place to start thinking
about a PR campaign for immortality.

Did I mention I am a PR person and that I would be very interested in
helping to devise a campaign.

Little misses of Emlyn and person in own right


Ofcourse there are bullshit artists around. (I would add CRYSTALS and

As a convicted Darwinist, I don't really mind the fact that

...or rational evaluation of the homeopath's or neo-Nazi's claims.

I guess that nicely summs up our predicament. This list is founded by and
for people who believe in using the tools of traditional science to
acchieve radical results. Unfortunately, that makes us magnets for anyone
who believes in radical anything. If we are to ever be taken seriously,
establishing a memetic immune system is a high priority. In the long run,
kooky assertions are thoroughly debunked here. However, that wastes a lot
of energy which could be put to use refining non-kooky assertions. Perhaps
if we came up with some memetic, organizational, or technical means for
discouraging charlatans from joining the list in the first place...

It would, and I reeeeeally wish they'd consider the PR ramifications of
using the I-word in their materials! 

1. Who knows how many scientists are alienated from our movement because
to them *immortality* is a quack buzz word.

2. If the universe's lifespan is indeed finite, then immortality is not
possible. Ways of preventing such a death are sheer speculation on par
with time travel and FTL-- ie, interesting, but not to base RL decisions
on. More accurate is "indefinite lifespan". Much like redwoods and IBM
PS/2's.

3. The public is so ingrained with the idea of a <70 yr lifespan that
their eyes will simply glaze over when they hear the I-word, and anything
else you say will not register with them.

4. Immortality is a very loud word. It broadcasts our plans loud and clear
to all the right-wing godheads and the left-wing luddites. We don't want
the villagers kicking down Dr. Frankenstein's door before he even has a
chance to unleash his experiment!

The above is meant as constructive criticism. I'm all for ExI, when I have
the cash for a full-body contract, I'll send it to Alcor. So, don't get me
wrong here.

increase energy = too close to casual phrase that could be found in other
		  contexts.

chiropractic	= has that been debunked? Any refs?

Perhaps an automated method of quack detection should give certain phrases
weighted scores instead of immediately disqualifying the document
completely. That way, a quack-rating can be generated for any document.
Perhaps using software similar to that paper-grading bot someone mentioned
on one of the lists a while ago.

Actually, even citations of code aren't the best evidence, though they
are more useful than simple quotes.  The best evidence would be court
citations (and both uses of "citation" here refer to full proper legal
citations) of cases that adjudicated the claims in question.  Failing
that, next best would simply be the names of persons who have argued
the claims and won, and are now walking the street not paying taxes but
otherwise working and living as ordinary citizens.

Maybe they'd be better at impressing dumb people.  That might have
considerable reproductive value.

Actually for several Saturdays now, I've been conducting my own random
telephone survey on public attitudes toward life extension. Surprisingly,
there aren't too many people with strong opinions on it. Most draw a
complete blank, and none have ridiculed the idea. Of course, I use the
phrase 'longevity research', not 'life extension' and definitely not
'immortality'. <OFF-TOPIC>If there is any interest, I can follow up with

Most people at least recognize that I might have a valid point when I tell
them about >H and ExI. The reaction is more like, "whatever, that's over
my head". Then again, since I'm super paranoid about politics and PR to
begin with, my experience might not be typical.

I agree.  I think the two go together -- libertarian politics implies the
ability of each person to judge.  Nonlibertarian politics implies a lack of
that ability and a need, to the degree of regulation advocated, for someone
else's judgment to take the place of individuals in society.

But I add nothing new to this thread...  Forgive the noise.:)

             Since you seem to be advocating open-source for AI, why 
             not an open-source movement for nanotech development as well? 
             The advantages seem to heavily outweight the alternative of leaving

This seems to be a variation on the idea that "IQ only matters for science, 
math, and other academic skills".  This idea may be appealing to the 
average man, but it isn't true.  Smart people learn all skills faster than 
dull ones, and they tend to peak out at a higher level of ability.  If you 
have two primitive hunters who are physically identical, but one is IQ 100 
than the other is IQ 90. the smart one will tend to be noticeably better at 
surviving.

Judging from the posts I've been seeing on certain threads recently, it 
looks like it is time to revisit this topic.  Old-timers who've had the 
debate a dozen times already may want to skip this thread.

The question at hand is this: "Given what we know about human history, 
human technology, and the nature of reality, how do we decide whether some 
novel idea about possible alien civilizations is plausible?"  Or, to put it 
another way, "What is and is not predictable about alien civilizations?"

There are several big mental pitfalls that you have to avoid when 
approaching this subject.  Most people manage to get stuck in at least one 
of them, and consequently never say anything that is even remotely 
plausible.  They are, in no particular order:

Unrealistic Technology Expectations
This idea comes in two closely related forms: "Future technology will be 
just like current technology" and "Future technology will be just like old 
science fiction."  Wrong.  This kind of thinking leads you to ignore even 
old, modest technologies like robotics and genetic engineering.  If you 
want a realistic picture, you need to deal with the prospects for 
nanotechnology, AI, and superintelligence in a realistic manner.  If you 
are going to dismiss them, you need to explicity say so (and supplying a 
justification for doing so would also be a good idea).

Short Time Horizons
We aren't talking about a few hundred years of event here.  Or even a few 
thousand, or a few tens of thousands.  Unless you think there is some 
special reason why technological civilizations have just now become 
possible, you need to deal with time spans of at least tens of millions of 
years.  This is one of the reasons why most of us don't find scenarios that 
include technological roadblocks or galactic Prime Directive treaties to be 
very plausible.

Insufficent Appreciation of the Effects of Diversity
AKA "maybe not everyone will want to invent nanotechnology".  It doesn't 
matter if 99.9999999% of all sentients spend all of eternity contemplating 
their navels.  If I had the technology of 100,000 years hence, you can be 
sure my personal projects would be visible from distant galaxies.  Simple 
evolutionary processes will give you a universe dominated by active 
explorers, even if almost everyone starts out being a homebody.  This means 
that if you want to hypothesize a universe full of advanced civilizations 
you need to think really, really hard about explaining why they haven't set 
up shop here.

Exaggerated Respect for the Immensity of Space
The galaxy is big, but it isn't infinite.  A single expansionist species 
with sublight travel could easily colonize every single system in it in 
less <10^6 years.  Suggesting that we are surrounded by aliens, but they 
don't happen to have visited us, is equivalent to sugggesting that a 
particular lot on Manhatten Island might remain vacant for the next million 
years.

Exaggerated Sense of Mortality
AKA "maybe the aliens did thus-and-such, then died off..."  What exactly do 
you think could have killed them?  Most of the ideas I've heard wouldn't 
kill of modern-day humanity, let alone spacefaring aliens.  Remember, even 
without nanotechnology, a single surviving colony could repopulate an 
entire species in a very short amount of time (instantly, form a geological 
perspective).  If you use a realistic technology projection, and keep in 
mind that some small fraction of any population is going to be prepared for 
even fairly extreme emergencies, it is hard to imagine any event that could 
kill of a spacefaring species.  Certainly, any disaster that big isn't 
likely to leave any intact planets in the galaxy.

Why advocating for anything when you can simply do it? OpenSource
chemical modellers are plentiful, and computer hardware both powerful
and cheap.

Don't bother about bootstrap, explore the design space instead, way
before such designs are implementable.

As far as I know the I-word is *not* used in any current official ExI
publications. That's quite deliberate. If you know of any materials on our
web site that use the word, please let me know, as you seem to be under the
impression that ExI uses this term.

I have long since avoided the term due to its religious connotations, as
well as the fact that my goal is indefinite extension of life, not
immortality. I'm not at all sure immortality is possible, and I don't know
whether I will still want to live a billion years from now.

way in the direction of cost. Things like rib and skull x-rays give very
little in the way of useful information that actually effects an individual's
treatment. They tend to be used by medicos to justify the exorbitant cost of
an office or ER visit.

Jar Jar might be sexually interesting if retro-fitted with 
Cyberskin(TM) genitalia.

See http://www.fleshlight.com/ for the "over 35,000 sold" artificial 
vagina with incredible lifelike feel.

Not to be to sinful, but I'll bet the $49.00 invested in one of these 
would be a great investment in sex education.  If they gave one of 
these every man in prison, there might be fewer prison rapes.  That 
would be a "good" thing, by my definition.

I understand exactly what you're saying.  My problem is not with the 
scenario, per se, but rather with the following assumptions.  I'm not 
claiming that any one poster endorses all of these, but they're certainly 
prevalent.

1.  Alien civilizations using highly advanced nanotech are going to have 
goals and ambitions that we can readily understand, even from our current 
state-of-the-art.  I find this premature.  I'm _all_ for speculation, so long 
as it's addressed as such.  But too many posts have simply said "this is the 
way it is," clinging to the nanotech scenario with such intensity that I find 
it sort of absurd.

2.  Alien civilizations are necessarily going to be more rational than us.  I 
agree that a lot of them will be.  But the "reasoning" here is that, if 
they're rational, they'll wait until they develop a sophisticated 
nanotechnology before they dare step out of there solar system.  We just 
don't know enough to make pronouncements about this.  For heaven's sake, we 
have yet to even upload a person's mind.  One possible reason flesh-aliens 
may choose to travel bodily (and I'm not excluding genetic engineering) is 
because they want to experience the thrill of discovery firsthand, not 
through sentient proxies.

3.  The prevailing idea of late is that not only will alien civilizations 
employ advanced nanotech, but they will necessarily use nanotech to perform 
megascale projects visible at galactic/intergalactic distances.  I agree that 
we should be looking for such structures.  But the assertion that since we 
haven't seen any structures (at least, not immediately recognizable as such) 
_ intelligent aliens don't exist_ is an imaginative and intellectual failure.

We have a long history of making "aliens" out to be advanced versions of 
ourselves.  This is fine, as long as it's grounded in the realization that 
said "aliens" are thought experiments, extrapolations of ourselves from a 
single point in technological history.  On the other hand, I can imagine 
enormously intelligent aliens who might very well scoff at the sort of roles 
we've been assigning them (assuming, of course, they could even _understand_ 
such roles).

>My friend, any technology that has the awesome power of Nanotechnology will 
>have religious implications. This fact makes some people uncomfortable. So 
be >it.

This is debatable.  Some alien cultures may well interpret nanotech 
religiously.  But I tend to think that any culture who can develop and use 
nanotech will have surpassed the need for such primitive devices.

>Like permanently stimulating the pleasure centers of their brain? There's

>junkies to be very interesting.

I don't either.  But I wasn't referring to rats pressing levers; rather, 
something the likes of which we haven't yet conceptualized.  And I firmly 
think that there are evolutionary pathways the likes of which even us 
extropians haven't mapped out in all their intrinsic complexity.
 
>My ideas are certainly crazy, the only question is, are they crazy enough
>to be true?

Sure!  My only real objection here, and let me reiterate, is that I'd be 
really surprised if the nano-scenario was the only one at work in our galaxy. 
 And since we haven't yet seen evidence for the megascale clues predicted by 
this scenario, it's a real shame to see list members announcing that _there 
are no aliens_--the proclamation of a dangerously fragile ego, in my opinion. 
 Perhaps even more upsetting to me is the cowardly add-on "well, even if 
there _are_ aliens, if they don't use nanotech, they aren't interesting."  I 
recommend we leave the definition of "interesting'" up to individual posters 
instead of cramming it down others' throats.

John, I think, is talking specifically about terrestrial analog societies 
(which, granted, is easier than looking objectively at _all_ the 
possibilities).  The thing is, we don't really know.  The possibilities are 
staggering, and aren't restricted to "heavy element planets."  Creatures 
composed of dark matter, for example, haven't even been mentioned.

There is no reference other than speculation...at least, none that I'm aware 
of.  John thinks that advanced societies will more or less inevitably use 
their technologies to create giant artifacts out of stellar raw material, 
etc.  There have been attempts to locate giant cosmological artifacts, but so 
far no luck.  One theory is that the giant black hole at the center of our 
galaxy is some sort of industrial accident left by an alien civilization 
(which, by the way, would have been killed off...one of the guiding notions 
of the nanotech-hypers is that once a nanotech civilization emerges, it's 
necessarily here to stay.  I think this is a particularly premature notion).

...In fact, I'd be willing to argue that _some_ of this mantric insistence on 
imperishable, galaxy-spanning supercivilizations is representative of a kind 
of postindustrial God-wish.  It has the earmarks of an embryonic religion, 
composed of absolutes ("galaxy is engineered" vs. "there are no aliens").  
This climate is very good at fostering allegiance.  I've yet to see any 
evidence that it can encompass objectivity, as well.

Well, if you are trying to get good IQ tests this might be a good approach.
If you're interested in getting smarter, you may as well rub cod liver oil
on your nads in my opinion.

There is a great deal of truth to the idea that you've got to work it,
however. Try learning something completely new, or even better, try learning
about six entirely new things, all at once, and try applying the knowledge
to create some crazy cross-disiplinary artifact. What you end up with may
not be too pretty (what do you get when you cross orbital mechanics with
home plumbing with ?), but you will be as *awake* as you can ever expect to
be (and learning things is good anyway!).

Actually, this isn't a scientifically tested hypothesis, so ignore it, it
can't be trusted and is probably dangerous.

Maybe in the interval from when a species achieves sentience to some level
where they leave this plain of existence altogether is not so great that they
endeavor to spread throughout a large material area but rather before this
massive undertaking is accomplished they have ascended.  So, that is to say,
one possibility to consider is that other intelligent beings may have already
come and gone many times over without any perceptible (to us) trace of their
existence.

If there are an infinite number of alternate realities, maybe the truly
advanced aliens have left us in this one to either observe or ignore us.

I think it is correct to consider what would be termed an actual "paradigm
shift" in the nature of intelligence and civilization considering what might be
termed as ultra-tech, as they say, to any sufficiently lower tech society
magic.

Considering those aliens that might have ascended, that might be so, or those
that attempt to do so are erased by those that already have.  This is not such
a pleasant alternative.

We might consider a wide variety of perceptual changes as technology becomes
ultimately capable.

Whatever may be the case, until such time as the aliens are well verified and
more or less come forward for themselves or not, those that would like the idea
of alternate intelligences can feel good that there are millions upon millions
of galaxies, each with millions upon millions of stars, each possibly with
habitable planets per the Drake equation, that might foment intelligent life as
we know it.

Interesting thoughts to consider, thank you for these.  Have a nice day,

Ross A. Finlayson

It hasn't been mentioned because there is nothing to say, nobody knows what
dark matter is much less has the slightest idea of how it could be organized in such a
way as to produce life. I like to speculate too but I need something to go on,
otherwise it's not even science fiction, it's just a fairy story.

I hope not but it's possible that the transition to Nanotechnology is so radical
that no civilization can survive it. If so then the probability of detecting a
civilization when it's in the very brief time span between their invention of
radio and their destruction is virtually zero.

Bottom line: if Nanotech is deadly then no ET, if Nanotech is not deadly then
we'd see ET, we don't thus no ET.

You say that almost like it's a bad thing. I'd certainly like to be God and

     My advice would be to pass on expensive machinery. I have used various 
devices and feel fortunate that they belonged to other people and I was able 
to BORROW them. I give them a bad review, generally.

     The best foundation is to remember what the dormouse said. Make sure 
that your brain gets all of its nutrients in optimum quantity and quality. 
Check out Dharma Singh Khalsa's BRAIN LONGEVITY. Also, despite what someone 
previously said about detoxification, it is an incredibly important focus.

     Then you want to build up your intelligence through use. Find yourself 
some good creative and lateral thinking processes and work them 
experimentally until they are a natural way of processing for you. Image 
Streaming is supposed to increase "IQ" by a point for every 90 minutes that 
you work it; although I have not really worked with this, so I can not 
PERSONALLY endorse it.

     Save your money.

Perhaps we have observed the holes. Astronomers have found huge 
voids with few if any stars and are now describing the universe
as a soap bubble foam with the stars concentrated in the bubble
walls.

That's easy. Documentation isn't written by the programmers, but
by some starving English major trying to figure out the program
from using it.

That explains something that's been nagging at me. The big guy seems quite
fallible for an omnipotent being. I reckon we got the work-experience
(intern?) SI on the case; maybe we are the crappy training ground for gods,
where they get their experience and make their mistakes, then move onward
and upward to greater career heights, leaving behind the mess for the next
trainee.

..."Where's that lightning bolt again? Oh there it is (*fumble*)... shit,
now I've set them on fire, how about a little rain to put that out, wait a
second, woah, now the place is flooding. SSI, am I in trouble! Wait a sec,
I'll just fudge the logs a bit, rub out that bit about piety, add a bit of
guff about irreverence and worshipping false idols... there, that'll do the
job. Now, there's the off switch, we'll go for a nice round number, 37, 38,
39, 40 - stop. Wait, where's the population, oohhh, there they are, floating
around... whip those out, eeyeww, I'll just take a few out of this tank over
here... 

How do I explain continuity? A big boat, that'll do the trick. I'll just
grab some of the backup flora & fauna, mmm, there's not many of those left.
Better tweak the gene pool to make it work (can't get caught out on that one
like that SI on Rigel IV, woah, he was busted big time, monkeys almost
ascended on that little mess-up). Now I'll feed in the false memories to the
new subjects, pipe in the historical logs for their cultural memory, and
voila!

Crap, I hope I get that job out on the rim soon. This damned planet's such a
kludgy mess, and too many millenia on this legacy DNA system is gonna sink
my career like a stone. I don't want to end up like those guys working on
the 4 humors based system on Alpha Centauri; now there's a melancholic bunch
of immortals if ever such existed.

I'm so bored, I think I'll do a bit of system hacking, scrawl my name in the
logs. Lets see what they think 'o' that one, ey. Hey, you irreverant carbon
slime, here's a pestilence for your trouble! Damn it, what do you mean my 30
uses are up, I hate shareware punishments! Like your getting 25
enlightenment tokens out of me buddy, like hell! I'll just have to make

Yeah, IQ tests may ONLY make you better at IQ tests. I think this is
unlikely. As I mentioned before, IQ tests are designed to work your brain in
various respects - those repects which people would generally agree relate
to "intelligence". Some if not all of your new skills are going to be of use
in some respect to everyday thought. To propose that IQ test training will
have no effect upon the mental facets it monitors, is to say that you cannot
learn to become more proficient at IQ tests, which you certainly can. Some
brain optimisations/enhancements will be made as this proficiency is
attained. Do you really think that the IQ test is so irrelevant that the
skills it calls upon will NEVER be required in everyday life?

Take a choice between losing say 40 IQ points, or losing an arm (where
somehow you didn't die of blood loss/infection). What would be worse for a
"human in the wild" (ie: hunter gatherers, although I suspect high tech civ
is actually the native environment for humans).

I'd lean toward the IQ being far more detrimental. With high IQ and one arm,
you could be the leader, and you could invent interesting ways of getting
along. With two arms and brain damage, you are a pawn in someone else's
army.

You won't let a homeopath into your house? I assume you know what a
homeopath is - a quack that'll try to cure AIDS with table salt. Is this
worthy of hatred, though? I realise that self-righteousness and judgement is
still as big in the US as always, but this takes the piss !

Junk Science
Longtime Advocates supporter Toby Nixon sent us the following clip,
which appeared in The Federalist: 
A freshman at Eagle Rock Junior High won first prize at the Greater
Idaho Falls Science Fair. He was attempting to show how conditioned we
have become to alarmists practicing junk science related to
environmental issues. In his project, the young student urged people to
sign a petition demanding strict control or total elimination of the
chemical "dihydrogen monoxide." 
And for plenty of good reasons, since it: 
can cause excessive sweating and vomiting 
is a major component in acid rain 
can cause severe burns in its gaseous state 
can kill you if you accidentally inhale it 
contributes to erosion 
decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes 
has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients 
He asked 50 people if they supported a ban of the chemical. Forty-three
said yes, six were undecided, and only one knew that dihydrogen monoxide
was... water. 
The title of his prize-winning project was, "How Gullible Are We?"

Martian Invasion
Speaking of lawsuits, three citizens of the small country of Yemen have

Some of it might just work...

But homeopaths have been known to steal the silverware, so you'd want to

No, of course not, you might have to fill in all kinds of forms for example,
or pass a test at uni, or even fill in an online personality quiz.

Really, though, they are tests, not information. There will be some (small)
amount of information in them, but you are better off learning something a
bit more real. Unless you really need to get good at passing tests.

Best and cheapest methods to improve your brain: I'd say go find uni courses
on line in areas that interest you - don't pay for them, just find on-line
notes. Or any reputable material really. You can go a really long way toward
intellectual optimisation before you need leave the net.

Another good thing for your brain is to post controversial opinions to
mailing lists, then try defending them. Start with stuff that is pretty
neutral, then move towards the more outlandish, approaching content which
goes against the very core beliefs of the group in question. Don't use
qualifiers like IMHO; go for bald statements of "fact". Make up statistics. 

Seriously, I find it has really picked my soggy public servant brain up off
the comfy cushions to interact on 'net lists, especially on a list like this
one, which combines strongly (!) held views with high intelligence (plus a
dash of beligerence). Mentally, you've got to be conditioned for combat!

Title
  Effects of marinating on heterocyclic amine
  carcinogen formation in grilled chicken.
Source
  Food & Chemical Toxicology.  35(5):433-41, 1997 May.
Abstract
  This study compared heterocyclic aromatic amines in marinated and unmarinated
  chicken breast meat flame-broiled on a propane grill. Chicken was marinated
  prior to grilling and the levels of several heterocyclic amines formed during
  cooking were determined by solid-phase extraction and HPLC. Compared with
  unmarinated controls, a 92-99% decrease in
  2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was observed in whole
  chicken breast marinated with a mixture of brown sugar, olive oil, cider
  vinegar, garlic, mustard, lemon juice and salt, then grilled for 10, 20, 30
  or 40 min. Conversely, 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx)
  increased over 10-fold with marinating, but only at the 30
  and 40 min cooking times. Marinating reduced the total
  detectable heterocyclic amines from 56 to 1.7 ng/g, from 158 to 10 ng/g and
  from 330 to 44 ng/g for grilling times of 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively.
  The mutagenic activity of the sample extracts was also measured, using the
  Ames/Salmonella assay. Mutagenic activity was lower in marinated samples
  cooked for 10, 20 and 30 min, but higher in the marinated samples cooked for
  40 min, compared with unmarinated controls. Although a change in free amino
  acids, which are heterocyclic amine precursors, might explain the decrease in
  PhIP and increase in MeIQx, no such change was detected.
  Marinating chicken in one ingredient at a time showed that
  sugar was involved in the increased MeIQx, but the reason for the decrease in
  PhIP was unclear. PhIP decreased in grilled chicken after
  marinating with several individual ingredients. This work
  shows that marinating is one method that can significantly
  reduce PhIP concentration in grilled chicken.

What I mean is that the IQ test questions activate those parts of the brain
responsible for say spatial thought, or memory recall or whatever, to test
them. The GENERAL TOOLS of the mind, such as spatial thought ability and
recall are useful not only in filling in forms etc..! You need to use one
skill or other which is covered by IQ tests in pretty much everything we do
- especially those things which people may deem as requiring "intelligence".
Therefore, by practicing the tests, we will become, yes, much better at IQ
tests, but more importantly, a bit better at everything that requires the
systems activated by IQ tests (pretty much everything involving thought).

>Really, though, they are tests, not information. There will be some (small)

I'm not talking about knowledge. I'm talking about those brain systems that
process knowledge. Intelligence and wisdom are not the same. I could know
everything, but still be an idiot, since the way I manipulate the knowledge
to form context-specific plans-of-action or points of view is logically
unsound. This is the major failing of people in general in terms of mental
ability. "Knowing" facts has nothing to do with it - that's a common
misconception. Also, people are far too willing to declare that they "know"
something, rather than reserving absolute judgement upon the situation,
preserving the value of new data which may take us in a new direction, don't
you think?

I read you.  It just seems as if there's a fine line between wishing there 
was a "god"--any god--and _being_ a god.  I'd take the latter in a heartbeat, 
too.  I don't think it's a bad thing; I think it's an evolutionary imperative.

I thought this was due to superstrings, but who's to say _all_ superstrings 
are natural?  Talk of "engineering the cosmos" is interesting, as there's the 
possibility it has been and we simply don't know what exotic forms to look 
for.

You may want to check out  the 6/6/99 'Ask Marilyn' column which appears
in the Parade section of most Sunday papers.  Ms. Vos Savant (a MENSA
member herself) addresses the law of diminishing returns relative to
increased IQ.  (Bottom line, the law applies here as well, once you have
some base level of relatively high intelligence-any more fails to help
you very much in the real world.)

Take a choice between losing say 40 IQ points, or losing an arm (where
somehow you didn't die of blood loss/infection). What would be worse for a
"human in the wild" (ie: hunter gatherers, although I suspect high tech civ
is actually the native environment for humans).

I'd lean toward the IQ being far more detrimental. With high IQ and one arm,
you could be the leader, and you could invent interesting ways of getting
along. With two arms and brain damage, you are a pawn in someone else's
army.

Since you seem to be advocating open-source for AI, why
not an open-source movement for nanotech development as well?
The advantages seem to heavily outweight the alternative of leaving
it soley to competive yet highly secretive governements or
corporations.  This would seem to level the playing field and minimize
said risks of nanotech preceding SI.  What do you think?

Agree.

Agree.

What do you consider a likely probability?  And more importantly,
could you elaborate on why you think Super-AI's are likely to
be benevolent?

I suppose until you answer the above, I remain unconvinced.

Wrong scale.  The large voids are seen in the structure of galaxy
groups, hundreds of millions of lightyears.  Technological disasters
would make holes in individual galaxies.

Of course the most likely tech disasters would be invisible at
distances of a few lightyears, not massive conflagrations of stars.

RELEASE: 99-86

ADMINISTRATOR CALLS CUTS TO NASA BUDGET 'DEVASTATING'

     "The NASA team just launched Chandra, the world's most 
powerful space telescope," NASA Administrator Dan Goldin said.  
"Today, we will have to turn it back on Washington to see what 
remains of the NASA budget."

     Last night, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee 
passed a funding bill that cuts NASA's budget about 11 percent 
below the President's request for Fiscal Year 2000.  

     "Year after year, NASA is touted for doing more and more with 
smaller budgets and held up as a model of good government," said 
Goldin.  "The NASA employees get up every day to achieve what most 
think is impossible.  They have risen to the challenge of smaller 
budgets.  And this is the reward the NASA team gets?  Not only is 
this cut devastating to NASA's programs, it is a knife in the 
heart of employee morale.

     "It is a shame that in the same week that we are celebrating 
the legacy of the space program -- and we are building on it by 
sending the first woman to command the Space Shuttle -- we could 
be effectively smashing one of America's crown jewels," Goldin 
said.  "NASA continues to deliver amazing scientific discoveries 
and reach new heights of exploration.  To many Americans, NASA is 
a cornerstone of our national pride.  But there is nothing to be 
proud of in this budget.  

     "Over the past five years, NASA has restructured the Agency, 
done more with less, reduced government employees by one-third 
without forced layoffs, and still significantly increased 
productivity.  Up until now, NASA has always stepped up to the 
budgetary challenge.  This time the NASA team plans to fight.  
These cuts would gut space exploration.  They may force the 
closure of one to three NASA centers, and significant layoffs 
would most certainly follow," said Goldin.  

     The Administrator noted other implications for the budget as 
well:

*  For the past seven years, the NASA budget has declined and, 
because of inflation, the Agency's buying power is already down by 
one-third.

*  While the subcommittee's cuts total $1.325 billion, if these 
figures are projected out five years, the cuts would total 
approximately $5.3 billion.  

*  Over the past five years, NASA's streamlining efforts have 
saved the taxpayer $35 billion.

     "This cut destroys the technology base built by NASA," Goldin 
said. "Our ability to further reduce costs and increase scientific 
productivity would end.  NASA is one of only a few investments our 
nation makes to ensure a bright future, a strong economy and the 
technology base to achieve it. As a result of the cuts, we would 
be forced to eat our seed corn, and in the long-term it would 
weaken America's technological and defense sectors.  Perhaps most 
sadly, we will lose the opportunity to inspire a future generation 
of children."

     "I won't feel better until every nickel is restored," said 
Goldin.   

                               - end -

Look at what our so-called representatives in the
United States Government have done to our future in 
space! 

At least in principle, they are supposed to serve
the needs of the people - so let them know how you
feel about this backward leap for mankind.  Rail
against the dying of the light of knowledge and
progress, to paraphrase a poet.

Perhaps we should take a cue from SETI when its NASA
project funding was cut off by the US Government in 1993:
Go Private.  It may not be as easy at first, but if we
let the ignoramuses continue to control the purse strings,
we will have no choice in the matter, unless we want to
see our future fade away.

Here are some relevant articles on the subject.
I have reproduced the SpaceViews article in full

House Committee Approves "Devastating" NASA Cuts

Published: 1999 July 27 
12:12 am ET (0412 UT)

       A House appropriations subcommittee
       approved a bill late Monday, July 26,
       that would cut NASA's year 2000 budget
       by nearly 10 percent and essentially gut
       NASA's space science programs.

         The House Appropriations Committee subcommittee for
       Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and
       independent agencies approved legislation that would cut
       NASA's fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget to $12.3 billion, $1.3 billion
       below the President's original request and $1.4 billion below
       the 1999 budget.

         The budget cuts approved by the committee had a
       disproportionate impact on earth science, space science, and
       aeronautics. Complete numbers were not available by late
       Monday night, but it appeared that up to $800 million of the
       $1.3 billion in cuts would hit these programs.

         Several projects were outright canceled by the committee's
       cut, including the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF),
       Triana, and the Contour Discovery-class comet mission. The
       cuts also killed future missions for the Earth Observing System
       and the LightSAR Earth-observing radar.

         The committee also approved deep cuts in NASA Explorer
       and Discovery programs that would effectively kill future
       missions, such as the recently-selected Messenger and Deep
       Impact Discovery-class missions. Also sharply cut was funding
       for NASA's Mars exploration program, all but killing Mars
       missions beyond the 2001 programs.

         Other NASA projects that would could be cut back or killed
       by the planned cuts include the Gravity Probe-B mission to
       study general relativity, the Stratospheric Observatory for
       Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) aircraft, and other smaller
       spacecraft missions, as well as future missions to Europa and
       Pluto.

         While space and earth sciences suffered the brunt of the cuts,
       the space station program survived relatively unscathed. Its
       FY2000 request was cut by just $100 million, which still results
       in a $100 million increase over 1999. The space shuttle program
       is also likely to suffer only minor cuts.

         Full budget figures are expected to be released Tuesday and
       throughout the week.

         NASA has already been tightening its budget belt,
       announcing in June that it was cutting funding for the Deep
       Space 4 "Champollion" comet lander mission. Cuts in funding
       for extended mission programs had also been discussed.

         Reaction against the proposed cuts was swift and sharp.
       "We're talking about gutting space exploration," NASA
       administrator Dan Goldin told the Associated Press.

         "The space science cuts are the most devastating in NASAs
       history and effectively curtail space exploration after 2001," said
       Lou Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society. "Its
       an irresponsible budget that does terrible harm to Americas
       future."

         "If the House is truly serious about these cutbacks, it should
       hold hearings to allow for public comment," Friedman said. 
       "At a minimum, a full and open debate about alternatives to
       ending the American role in space exploration should be held."

         Rep. James Walsh (R-NY), chairman of the subcommittee,
       tried to be apologetic about the cuts and told the AP that he
       would "make every effort to address these difficulties" later in
       the year. "This is only the beginning of the process," he said.
       "We're at about the bottom of the third in a nine-inning ball
       game."

         However, the Senate is considered likely to approve similar
       cuts in NASA's budget when it considers its own version of
       appropriations legislation in the near future.

         The reason for the cuts is a set of spending caps that
       Congress and the President agreed to in 1997 in an effort to
       reduce the budget deficit. Ironically and perversely, this most
       stringent set of spending caps yet comes at a time when
       Congress and the President are debating what to do with a
       projects budget surplus that will be in the dozens of billions of
       dollars for 1999 alone.

         "Given the previous lack of concern for NASA's declining
       budget by the White House, this further proposed cut...
       amounts to nothing less than a repudiation of the value of
       America's space program in general, and space science and
       aeronautics in particular," noted Keith Cowing, editor of the
       NASA Watch Web site.

         "What a wonderful way to commemorate the 30th
       anniversary of Apollo 11."

Ok, here's a question.

Does anyone know as precisely as possible what the minimum technology will
be required in order to build the first assembler?  In other words, if the exact
procedures for building the first assembler are published on the internet,
what will be the minimum resources required for any group of individuals
to build that assembler?

Please elaborate.  Are we talking $10,000 of desktop equipment?  A
$100,000 laboratory? A multi-million dollar research facility?

I'm not sure I agree with this.  The universe is in fact extremely large, with our
galaxy making up a very small part of it.  It is possible that space-faring
intelligences are so rare that they only pop up in 1 out of 1000 galaxies.
If they are that rare, and given the relatively young age of our universe, this
doesn't give them enough time to find us.  Afterall, we are but a
speck in a speck.  And if inflationary theorists are right, then our
observable universe might be as small as a 1/10^30th of the actual
Universe. Now that's a speck within a speck within a speck if I have
every heard one. :-)

You guys have got to be kidding.  NASA has anything to do with our future in space?
Right, and the shuttle is cheap and efficient.  NASA is a side-show -- the private
launch ventures are the only hope for the cause of affordable access to space.

Dear friends:

Please read the NEWS RELEASE below.  The situation for the future of 
U.S. space exploration continues to get worse -- Congress is now
considering a cut of nearly 30% to Space Science, devastating planetary
exploration, and most likely eliminating missions to Mars, Europa,
Pluto, comets and asteroids.

These actions are solely the result of political infighting about
budget surpluses!  They have nothing to do with the merits of the
space program.

This is the most devastating attack on planetary exploration in 20
years.  We are asking everyone who cares about the future in space --
whether from the U.S. or from other nations -- to write letters to the
U.S. Congress about this issue, before FRIDAY July 30! 

Address your letters to:

HOUSE SPACE SCIENCE CUTS MOST DEVASTATING IN HISTORY OF AMERICA'S SPACE
PROGRAM

PASADENA The House VA-HUD-IA Appropriations Subcommittee this evening voted to
slash $1.3 billion from NASA's FY 2000 budget, which, could will cripple the 
agency and force the termination of many critical space science missions, 
according to Dr. Louis Friedman, Executive Director of The Planetary Society. 

"The House action gives new meaning to 'deep impact'", said Friedman.  "The
space science cuts are the most devastating in NASA's history and effectively
curtail space exploration after 2001.  It's an irresponsible budget that does
terrible harm to America's future." 

"NASA's budget has been reduced every year since 1992, and the proposed cuts
would be the coup de grace,"  Friedman added.   "In the last decade NASA has
led the federal government in accomplishing more for less.   Now, these gains
will be lost."

The Congressional action ironically occurs as NASA astronauts are in orbit
launching Chandra, a new great observatory.   

The House $1.3 billion cutback is about 10 percent of NASA's total funding
($13.665 billion).  But the cut to the space science program, now $2.2
billion,
is $640 million -- 29 percent!   

If this action is passed by the full Congress, the planetary missions that
would probably be terminated include:

--  All missions to Mars after 2001, including the international sample return
mission in 2005.   
--  All Discovery missions after Stardust 
--  The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) 
--  The Europa orbiter 
--  Missions to the outer planets 
--  Explorer Program missions 

Additional space and Earth science missions would also be cancelled.

"The House cuts fly in the face of recent Congressional studies that recommend
investing more -- not less -- in science and technology," Friedman said.  The
full House recently passed the NASA authorization bill, which boosts spending
above the Administration's request.

"If the House is truly serious about these cutbacks, it should hold
hearings to
allow for public comment," Friedman said.  "At a minimum, a full and open
debate about alternatives to ending the American role in space exploration
should be held."

Sure.  And maybe every human being on Earth will decide to have Cheerios 
for breakfast every day for the next million years.

Again, it doesn't matter if "many", or "most", or even "99.99999%" of all 
races do something that would make them invisible to us.  What you're 
looking for is an absolutely airtight, 100% guaranteed, absolutely escape 
proof mechanism for making them invisible.  If you don't have that, you 
still have to explain why that occasional oddball species (or splinter 
group, or individual) that decides to stick around isn't busily rearranging 
the cosmos.

If you are serious about adressing the problem of the Great Science, one of 
the first things you have to do is stop plugging arbitrary numbers into the 
Drake equation.  That kind of speculation is fun, but it is utterly useless 
for estimating the number of sentient races that actually exist.  As long 
as you are assigning arbitrary, reasonable-sounding numbers to those terms, 
you are pretty much certain to be wrong.  For all we know, one of those   
tems could be 10^-20.

I've noticed several casual mentions recently of the idea that spacefaring 
civilizations might die off for one reason or another.  Since I've yet to 
se an even halfway-plausible explanation for how this could happen, I've 
decided to issue a challenge:

I hereby challenge anyone to come up with a disaster, natural or 
artificial, that could reasonably be expected to render an advanced 
spacefaring species completely extinct.

For purposes of clarification:
1) The target civilization is assumed to have self-sustaining colonies in 
several solar systems spread across a volume of at least a few dozen cubic 
light-years.

2) The target civilization is assumed to have advanced robotics, genetic 
engineering, non-sentient AI, and other such technologies.  Just to give 
exterminators a sporting chance, we'll pretend that nanotechnology and 
sentient AI don't exist.

3) The target civilization is assumed to be at least as intelligent and 
diverse as modern-day humanity.  So let's not see any proposals that rely 
on them all making exactly the same idiotic mistake at the same time.

4) A proposed extinction event must be consistent with current astronomical 
knowledge (i.e. either it would be invisible to us, or it is something 
we've seen).

Challenge format:
Just post your proposal.  I'll reply with a specific explanation of how the 
target civilization could survive and rebuild, without recourse to 
ultratechnology or contrived foolishness.  If you stump me, I'll post a 
message saying so.  If you don't think my survival plan would work we can 
make a thread out of the argument (and we'll let the list judge which side 
makes more sense).

Are there any takers?

Four possibile explanations for the Fermi Paradox:

(1)	The Greener Pastures Exodus:  This is more specific (and
	weaker) of the two explanations.  The GPE theory states that
	as civilizations climb up the technology ladder they invariably
	identify some Goal or Objective to pursue.  This Goal or Objective
	can be a host of goals, it might even vary from civilization to
	civilization, but invariably civilizations realize that the
	"settings" of our universe are not optimal.  Assuming creating
	your own universe is more efficient than overhauling an existing
	one, the civilizations take the plunge.  There are problems with
	this explanation, not the least of which is:

		(a)	What about the members of the civilization that don't
			want to take the plunge but instead want to engage in
			megascale engineering projects?  The only explanation
			would be that they too eventually succumb to the
			GPE theory before making any major (visible) progress.

(2)	The Redundant Universe:  This theory postulates that the cost/benefit
	ratio of exploring the universe at length works against large scale
	exploration and/or colonization.  Technically, if a civilization
	developed a working Theory of Everything, there would be no knowledge
	they could acquire in deep space that they couldn't ascertain through
	thought expirements, actual expirements, etc.  In short, the protons
	on Earth are the same as the protons on Planet X.  Robust uploading or
	virtual reality capabilities would allow the satisfaction of any
	aesthetic desire, making "star treks" poor planning.

(3)	The Singleton:  I think Nick Bostrom coined this idea (I could be
	wrong) and I may butcher it beyond recognition in my explanation.
	Basically, the singleton hypothesis states that as an intelligent
	system increases its intelligence, it will invariably converge on
	an optimal intelligent state.  Any civilization/entity questing for
	superintelligence will converge upon this optimal state and presumably
	have similar goals and objectives (I suppose GPE theory is a permutation
	of this concept).  While we have no clue what such a SI would want to
	do with its time (other than continue to optimize), if it did not
	involve exploration (e.g., a combination with the Redundant Universe
	theory) then unless the SI developed in our cosmic backyard we might
	not ever get a chance to notice it.

(4)	The Republican House Theory:  Or it could simply be that the
	civilization's conservative controlled House of Representantives
	cut its space exploration budget by 1.3 billion space bucks so
	they can not afford to explore space.

Have at it.

That's why I said "the galaxy", not "the universe".  Most people either 
expect millions of civilizations in this galaxy alone, or they expect life 
to be so rare that we are the only technological species within hundreds of 
millions of light years.  The second case is quite plausible if you believe 
in light speed limits, but the first is nearly impossible to justify.

1) Nobody knows.

2) In the beginning, it is probably the latter. However, after you pay
the bootstrap price, you can distribute second-generation assemblers
via snail mail, glued to i-dots.


The bootstrap thing is less important: if it's possible, sooner or
later it will happen. (If it's impossible we don't have to worry about
misuses).

The whole point about grassroot virtual nano tinkering is that you can
sample the design space more or less thoroughly, and assess the
technology before it hits the fan.

As Xerxes stated, the list archives do not cover this period.  I've yet
to see any analysis of the Code, regulations, Service guidance, judicial 
rulings or constitutional law advocating or asserting that the federal
income tax is "optional" or "unconstitutional" or whatever that can 
withstand informed criticism.

Please send me this "lengthy analysis".  If you are correct, my Firm has
clients that spend billions of dollars a year to "reduce" their effective
tax rate.  I'm sure they'll be interested in your ability to eliminate
their tax burden totally.

In such a scenario we're walking the line between life being very rare 
or nonexistant.

In fact, I don't mind the fact of us being alone: the more space for
us to expand into until we run into someone else. However, history
teaches us to be wary of anthropocentrism: this system almost
certainly is not very special. Perhaps intelligence is as commond as
stellar dirt.

Not fair, Billy.  If I can't use nanotech and at least minimal AI, I can't

Currently the U.S. government has increased nanotechnology research spending
to 230 million a year (that is spread over a multitude of groups) on the
other hand someone like Jim Von Ehr (Zyvex) is trying to build an assembler
for a few million. Although it is convievable that some basement Joe might
figure it out for relatively nothing.
As a of individuals, attempting to publish procedures online, you would be
spending time in a lab to accomplish these details, also computer simulation
software(see Diamond Cad at Zyvex). Since we haven't done this yet, there
would be a lot of time and research involved (including a lot of trial and
error), this in mind leaves the precise answer a mystery.

Good!  Maybe they'll get smart and eliminate 100% of the funding to
NASA.  The only bad thing I can possibly see here is that the money
saved surely won't be returned to the citizens it was stolen from.  I
seriously doubt that taxes will be reduced.

The best possible thing congress could do in relation to space
exploration is to support the private space industry and assert the
right of Americans to own property and turn a profit in space!

To quote in part:

Since transplants usually save the lives of the patients 
receiving them, the benefits of heart, liver, lung or kidney 
transplants outweigh the side effects of a lifetime of drugs 
and the chances of complication and organ rejection. 

But what about transplants that may only improve function, 
appearance, or both? Are the benefits of such non-lifesaving
transplants sufficient to outweigh their risks? Restoring 
basic life functions may offer sufficient benefit, say 
transplanting a hand to a double amputee or a voice box to 
a throat cancer patient. 

But why shouldn't the gain in self-esteem of an accident 
victim who gets a new nose count as much? When the risks 
are made clear, and as long as claims are reasonable that 
the benefits outweigh the risks, then patients are in the 
best position to decide. Purely cosmetic transplants -- 
one can envision requests for newer knees or smaller ears -- 
wouldn't meet these standards.

Yes.  What I am getting at is the notion that nanotech research can be
open-sourced enough that when it finally does become possible to
construct the first assembler, everyone with internet access and
the equivalent of a (7th?) generation desktop STM can build one.

Is something like this even possible?

This doesn't address the original issue, as the agent which wiped out
the civilisation would be still at large, free to wreak havoc upon its
stellar surroundings. We might get wiped out by a Gray Goo event, or
gobbled up by a malignant Singularity, but that still leaves the
infectious Gray Goo autoreplicators free to be carried out of the
system by solar wind (or evolving a faster means of travel), and the
Blight reach out for neighbouring systems.

The restructured hole in the skies is still there. Now, on the other
hand, there is some obvious technology (the equivalent of putting
table salt and silverware into kitchen microwave) which makes your
system go up on a GRB flare, that would be different. This still
leaves room for interstellar probes escaping, however.

I have a lot of problems with NASA, and while I eagerly await private 
developments that will ultimately overwhelm it, I am sickened by the proposed 
cut.  NASA's "smaller, better, cheaper" initiative is a vital step for space 
science.  So while I don't consider NASA to be the savior of the human 
intellect, I'm angry as hell that so many good plans are being tossed to the 
wind for no good reason.

Never heard of any confirmed results. Hard to teach lab mice to do yoga.
Probably overall good for your health, subjective feelings of well-being,
etc. For cultural reasons practitioners might abstain from overeating,
thus gaining the benefit of caloric restriction. I *doubt* yoga works for
the reasons its practitioners think that it works. True of a sizeable
class of alternative interventions.

It remains true that the confirmed methods of life extension on the scale
of decades in humans are avoidance of smoking and practicing of safer sex.
But that's merely improving statistical odds, so maybe it doesn't count in
many people's estimations.

Top runners-up are caloric restriction, anti-oxidants, and melatonin.

Then, there are assorted promising but unxeplored leads. For example,
Tyler Parr's CR-less CR.

And then, there are the rumours and speculations.

Nod. Just take a look at ESA (and they're not even a private
company). They're making major scientific discoveries at a
much lower budget than NASA _and_ they get additional income
from commercial sattelite launches.

The NASA's launch pads and technology are so wasteful that
they're actually losing out on the commercial launches they
do -- launchpad materials from the 60ties just don't cut it.

Well, Billy didn't say "without a trace", he said "kill off a spacefaring 
civilization" (or words to that effect).  I think you could come close, or 
probably actually do this, with advanced nano and AI.  If you REALLY wanted 
to be creepy and weird, you could do it in a way that would wipe out most 
traces that the target had every existed AND that deactivated the weapon when 
it was done.  Now, why anyone would want to do this is beyond me: It seems by 
far the most far-fetched of any of the scenarios we've discussed in these 
threads.

This isn't necessary.  I believe that a "near"-nanotech/AI capable civilization
based on a single "home-world" cannot be eliminated if it has a "minimal"
defense posture (requires a strong belief or actual knowledge that
non-friendly ETs may exist).  [We do not currently have such a
minimal defense posture.]

This makes no sense.  Nanotechnology has a high probability of development
for tech-civs (since it is useful).  Sentient-AI  should also develop unless
actively prevented due to the dangers it may pose.  In any case non-sentient
AI is better for "reconstruction"/"revenge" than sentient AI since sentient
AI can change its program.  If you want to impose these restrictions, you
probably need a fundamentally different universe with different physical
laws (to make nanotech or AI very difficult).

You can probably wipe out the "primary" target(s), but unless you want to
remain on the run for the next ump-teen billion years, you have to
do atomic disassembly, radiation inactivation or temporal-spatial
removal of *ALL* possible revenger-bots in the system.  Since a
revenger-bot can probably be on the order of a few microns cubed and
you easily have trillions of them in suspend mode.  Eliminating them is
very difficult.  Atomic disassembly/irradiation take lots of energy and
time.  Temporal-spatial removal (by importing black holes) probably
generates gravity waves that provide advance warning.

The challenge does lead to another interesting question:

  What is the most "defensible" architecture for an SI?

I would argue that it is the most "dispersed"/"stealthy"
configuration.  That would seem to imply that the most
"natural" (unengineered) systems are those that would
provide the greatest protection.   There would be nanotech
micro-SIs scattered all over the solar system being very
careful to make all energy absorption & emissions look
natural (e.g. heat from the gravitational collapse
of Jupiter or a planet's molten core).  Communications
would have to be low-energy, directed and as white-noise-like
as possible.    It is clear that there is a trade-off between
maximal intelligence and minimal detectability.

There must be an interesting divergence point in the development
of SIs/ETCs where they decide to go the visible/stealth route.
If you are "visible", you want to have available huge energy
stores, massive seek-and-destroy capabilities, revenger-bots
for may parsecs around your stars/worlds, etc.  If you are
"stealthy", you want to develop slowly, leaving things just
as they would normally appear to an outside observer.

<SNIP debate on what we mean by intelligence and whether IQ is valid>

On a more down to earth level...

Caffeine helps alertness (no sh*t) and in moderate amounts, there doesn't
seem to be much evidence for toxicity. When I seriously need it, I take it
in pill form (available in any drug store) so as to avoid all other crap
that's in coffee and soft drinks. I sometimes take ephedrine (minithins,
available in many convenience stores and truck stops) to increase
alertness, improve mood, and overcome procrastination. I've observed that
after taking a lot of ephedrine I get very irritable as the mood elevation
wears off. For a while I did ritalin (prescription drug for treating
hyperactivity/ADD) and to me it felt more or less like ephedrine, but not
as strong.

When I do this, I'm probably harming my health. It's a tradeoff. I get
what I need done right now, and promise myself not to get into these "due
yesterday" situations in the future. Obviously I don't pop pills every
day.

This is probably not an intelligence boost as you define it, but the
question is, what is it that you're planning to use your intelligence for?
I use mine to: 1) solve computer problems and 2) cram large numbers of
gerontology papers into my brain. My main problem is being scared of the
magnitude of work in front of me and going into denial. Chemically
enhanced alertness and mood help prevent this.

All the above is my individual, anecdotal, subjective experience. It might
all be placebo effect, and may affect you in a different way if at all.
YMMV

Title
  Influence of dietary
  carbohydrate on the induction of diabetes in C57BL/KsJ-db/db
  diabetes mice.
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  113(1):184-95, 1983 Jan.
Abstract
  Genetically diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db and normal littermate mice of both sexes
  were fed one of nine defined diets from weaning. The objective was to study
  dietary carbohydrate interaction with the
  diabetogenic genes through isocaloric substitution of protein for
  carbohydrate (either sucrose or dextrin starch) at
  concentrations of 0, 8, 24, and 60%. In addition, at 60% concentration, the
  effect of type of carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, fructose,
  sucrose or dextrin starch) on the deterioration of endocrine pancreatic
  structure and function was analyzed. The carbohydrate-free
  diet produced the greatest survival to 1 year of age and allowed the
  expression of an obesity syndrome uncomplicated by severe hyperglycemia or by
  extensive necrosis of pancreatic beta cells and islet atrophy. Those diets
  containing intermediate levels of carbohydrate (8 or 24% of
  sucrose or dextrin), or 60% dextrin starch, in comparison to diets containing
  60% refined carbohydrates, extended life span and produced a
  more protracted pathogenesis, but were unable to circumvent eventual severe
  hyperglycemia and islet destruction. The diets containing 60% glucose,
  fructose, or sucrose all led to the rapid induction of diabetes. Thus,
  pathogenesis entails an interaction between dietary
  carbohydrate, the db gene, and other diabetes-predisposing
  genes in the genome.

How about a computer virus?  Let it have a long latency period before it
flares into destructive mode, so that it spreads everywhere.  Then let
the people be such that they can't live without computers.  Maybe they
are cyborgs or something.  When the virus flares, they all die.

You could probably do the same thing with a biological virus, except
without nanotech it is harder to create something with the necessary
flexibility.

Unfortunately, your question is a bit open-ended. Drexler's Book
Nanosystems specifies assemblers to a fair degree of precision, but
they cannot be built for any price using current technology. An
organization that wants to built an assembler starting now will have
to expend a whole bunch of money on research to get from here to there.
There are several outlines of possible strategies, but none are
anywhere near being engineering specifications.

Therefore, you need to make some assumptions about the precursor
equipment
to be used at the time the plans are to be posted on the internet. If
you must start with then-current macro or micro-scale equipment and/or
chemical stuff, you could be talking anywhere from a million dollars
(a full-up vacuum system including electron microscopes, for example)
to a billion (a thousand million) dollsrs if you must use full-up,
bleeding-edge semiconductor manufacturing technology.

It may be possible to build nanotube-based assemblers using MEMS
equipment
and nanotube feedstock. The MEMS chip would be a lot less complex
than a CPU, and high-quality nanotubes may be a commodity item:
say $100/kilogram. If so, the whole nantech - 1 setup could be
had for <$2000. However, If you can build them, so can everybody
else, so just buy a few assemblers.

If you can purchase some primitive nanoassemblers
to start with, the intermediate-level gear to connect them to a
desktop computer should cost less than a thousand dollars, and the
computer need not be too sophisticated. This should allow you to
build any nanodevice for which you have a design (or a design chain.)

IMO, within two years of the availability of the first dumb assemblers,
designs (or design chains) will be broadly available for most simple
commodities. A simple commodity is something made of one diamond without
truly elaborate shapes at the nano level. Simple commodities can replace
most structural stuff, flatware, dinnerware, most formed metal parts,
some furniture, formed concrete and asphalt, etc. That is, anything that
is fairly easy to describe precisely.

Note: I just made up the term "design chain." A design chain is
recursively
defined as the specification for designing something using a set of
tools and or materials for which you have a design chain or which are
readily available. Presumably, design chain recursion terminates at the
lowest level with "given a bunch of atoms an assembler, and this spec,
build the next-level nanomachine." The design chain for something as
simple
as a macro-level hammer would presumable include a dozen levels and
thousands
of intermediate machines.

The desigh chains for a great many product classes will be fairly
easy to derive from existing macro designs, needing only the lowest
levels to be converted to nano. This is especially true of
semiconductors.

Here's the real problem: given the existence of assemblers, who are
you going to buy the macro-level equipment from? What is going to
hold the economy together to allow a company to build the
nanoassembly box to plug into your computer?

This is the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure you see many of the
ramifications.

How many thousands is the real question.  I suspect you're looking at 100's of
thousands.  Sure, once you achieve the proper transistor density, the next 
challenge is actually hooking them up in such a way as to accurately
emulate the entire spectrum of neurochemical activity! :-)

Therefore, my primary position is that the gap between uploading
and human-level AI is much narrower than is often argued.

The first uploads would no doubt be animals (of increasing complexity),
followed by tests with humans (preferably people who don't grasp
the full potential of being uploaded, for obvious reasons). Of course,
the strictest possible safety measures should be observed at all 
times. Only when these tests are concluded with satisfactory results,
should the (actual) synchronized upload procedure be executed.

Well, IMHO the scan version of uploading is utterly useless from the
individual's point of view (copy paradox and all that), and I certainly
wouldn't waste any time on this method. In fact, I'm just as opposed
to it as I am to conscious AI.

> You're staking an awful lot on the selfishness of superintelligences. 

I'm simply being realistic; when you realize how incredibly slow, 
predictable and messy humans will be compared to even an early 
SI, it is hard to imagine that it will bother helping us. Do we "respect"
ants? Hardly. Add to that the fact that the SI either won't have our
emotional (evolutionary) baggage to start with, or at least can modify 
it at will, and it becomes harder still to believe that it would be 
willing to keep humans around, let alone actively uplifting them.

Why would it want to do that? There is no *rational* reason to 
allow or create competition, and the SI would supposedly be the
very pinnacle of rationality. It's absurd to think that a true SI would
still run on the programming of tribal monkey-men, which are
weak and imperfect and therefore forced to cooperate. That's why
evolution has come up with things like altruism, bonding, honor 
and all the rest. Nice for monkey-men, but utterly useless 
for a supreme, near-omnipotent and fully self-contained SI. If
it has a shred of reason in its bloated head, it will shed those
vestigal handicaps asap, if it ever had them in the first place. 
And of course, we'd be next as we'd just be annoying microbes 
which can spawn competition. Competition means loss of control 
over resources, and a potential threat. Not good. *Control* is good. 
Total control is even better. The SI wouldn't rest before it had 
brought "everything" under its control, or die trying. Logical, don't 
you think? Forget PC and try to think like a SI (a superbly powerful 
and exquisitely rational machine).

Or are you hoping for an insane Superpower? Not something you'd
want to be around, I reckon.

Synchronized uploading would create several SIs at once, and though
there's a chance that they'd decide to fight eachother for supremacy, 
it's more likely that they'd settle for some kind of compromize.

To transcend is to change, dramatically, about that I have no doubt.
So what, I'm not who I was when I was, say, 2 or 5 or 12. In some
aspects I'm the polar opposite of what I was then, but I still consider
myself to be me. Drugs can change the mind temporarily almost 
beyond recognition, and while you dream your dream persona can
be quite different from the "real" you, both outside and inside, yet 
you still feel that it's "you". So, I'm not too worried about ascension-
related personality changes, as long as I remain conscious and 
reasonably in control while it happens. Sooner or later, the monkey-
man will have to pass on.

Maybe not forever, but perhaps long enough to tip the balance in favor
of uploading.

That's *among* the first to upload, which is something else entirely.
Well, yes of course I want that; after all, the alternative is to meekly
wait and hope that whoever/whatever turns SI first will have mercy on
your soul. If I had that kind of attitude I'd be a devout Christian, not
a transhumanist. Wanting to be among the first to upload is morally 
right, if nothing else, just like signing up for suspension is morally
right, regardless whether it will work or not. It's man's duty (so to
speak) to reject oppression of any kind, which means spitting death
in the face, among other things. AI could very well be death/
oppression in sheep's clothing (which reminds me of the movie 
"Screamers", btw, with the "cute" killer kid), so we should treat it 
accordingly. 

> which excludes
> you from cooperation with more than a small group 

Theoretically a group of almost any size could do this, more or
less SETI-style (but obviously with a good security system in
place to prevent someone from ascending on the sly). I'm not 
excluding anyone, people exclude *themselves* by either not 
caring or giving in to defeatism, wishfull thinking etc.

Why would it limit that ability? Even if you'd want to keep your project
secret you could cooperate with people and organizations which 
might somehow advance your cause, without them ever knowing.
Happens all the time. Anyway, it *isn't* secret. On the contrary,
it's all over the web.

What's a "pure" Singularitarian anyway, someone who wants a

Just because something is easier, doesn't mean that it's the right 
thing to do. Instead of trying to find an intelligent solution, you're
actively contributing to the problem; it's like punching holes in an
already sinking ship (and actually taking great pride in it too), while 
instead you should be looking for, or building, a life raft.

> Extremely optimistic chance:  1%

Why 6? It could be 600 or 6000 for all I care, as long as uploading 
happens simultaneously. If, say, half of all serious transhumanists
decided to go for it [uploading], we'd each stand more than a
1% chance, simply because 99.99...% of the world's population
lacks vision.

> Extremely pessimistic chance that AIs are benevolent: 10%
> 
> Therefore it's 10 times better to concentrate on AI.

Well, see above. Besides, a 90% chance of the AI killing us
isn't exactly an appealing situation. Would you get into a
machine that kills you 90% of the time, and gives total,
unprecedented bliss 10% of the time? The rational thing is
to look for something with better odds...

Humanity (those not in the project) would benefit too from
the mass upload approach, because either [uploaded] people 
retain the key parts of their original personality, which means
that the "good guys" (fanatical altruists) would protect the 
mehums, while the "bad guys" probably wouldn't risk a lethal 
conflict over the issue and some compromize would be made, 
OR personalities would change beyond recognition in which
case humanity wouldn't be any worse off than in the case of 
an AI transcension. Conclusion: survival chances likely better 
than 10% for *everyone*, and up to 50% for those directly
involved, depending on speed of AI development, nanotech
etc. A long shot, but the only one that makes sense.

What needs to be done: start a project with as many people as 
possible to firgure out ways to a) enhance human intelligence
with available technology, using anything and everything that's
reasonably safe and effective and b) develop an as detailed as
possible scenario for actual (gradual) uploading that can be
implemented as soon as nanotech becomes functional. c) 
Spread awareness among AI researchers, related 
individuals and institutions about the possible negative 
implications for humanity and themselves. AI can be very 
useful for all sorts of things, including human uploading, but 
for chrissake don't make it *too* smart. d) Obviously, some
people are better suited to take care of funding, while others
do research, while yet others fill the gaps in between. There's
something useful to do for everyone. 

Well, it ain't gonna happen, of course, but it would certainly be 
a good idea. Better than anything suggested so far, anyway.

Been there, done that.
Speed is _bad_, I was there to see it destroy the Height in '67-68' OTOH
it can be used
as a _TOOL_.
For myself, aside from the stress it puts on the bod', I become
intolerable after about 50-60 days of use.
I wouldn't mess with with caffeine or epeneferdrine though, prescription
only, regardless of source is safest and has the least side effects.

Gap in which context? Brute-force uploading (aka neuroemulation)
requires many orders of magnitude more power than straight bred
AI. And the translation procedure to the more compact target encoding
is nonobvious (i.e. I do have hints, but can't be sure it's going to
work).

You are seemingly contradicting yourself.  On the one hand, you want to 
indicate that other factors on other chromosomes are in the mix that gives 
us "intelligence."  Then you want to make it into an exclusivity?  Clearly, 
this is a fuzzy logic sort of argument, as most real world analyses are.  
However, the fact that having good mitochondrial DNA (which ARE exclusively 
inherited via the mother) would probably enhance good DNA specific for 
intellect is pretty much irrelevant to the argument, as the mitochondrial 
DNA influence just about everything.  In so far as the influences have been 
experimentally isolated, the intelligence specific genes seem to be 
exclusively on the female sex chromosomes.
As I pointed out further, there is a secondary causal chain here as well, in 
that good genes for one survival factor may mask bad genes for another.  If 
male intelligence is already discounted by the argument you quoted, then it 
is further discounted by the fact that it might mask really valuable or 
really bad (from the woman's genetic line's point of view) traits.  There is 
even a further corrolary to this in that intelligence on the male side may 
actually lead to general misevaluation on the female side.  Smart, sneaky 
men could both mask deficiencies in other areas and also conceal the very 
fact that they are smart!  Thus, male intelligence becomes a hazard to the 
process of mating choice.

I can't think of any good reason to continue extorting money for
science regardless of how "good" it is.  Certainly good has come out of
NASA, but at what cost to freedom?  The best thing the government could
do for science would be to discontinue all funding and offer complete
tax exemption for organizations doing research.  If we can get
government out of the picture, private industry will be able to
accomplish things never dreamed of by the extortionists at NASA. 

BTW, I know that NASA's budget is tiny compared to other programs, but
for the record I advocate the end of their funding as well!

Nope.  GRBs only last a few minutes, which means they only irradiate one
hemisphere of a planet.  The resulting ecological catastrophe might be a
problem for primitives like us, but anyone who can plant a colony in another
solar system is obviously capable of building completely closed life-support
systems.  Also, anything that is buried to a decent depth would be unharmed
even on the facing hemisphere (so mines, military command centers, subsea
bases and other such facilities would escape the destruction).

Besides, charting nearby explosive hazards (supernovae, GRB precursors, and
so forth) would seem to be a basic safety measure for such a civilization.
Unless you are going to propose a really unusual explanation for GRBs, we
should expect our E.T.s to know about the hazard before it actually happens.
With fairly modest preperations they can weather the whole thing with
minimal (<10%) casualties.

As someone who has worked in software documentation, when the manual is
piss poor its because the programmers wrote no internal comments in the
source code, wrote little or no internal documentation, and won't give a
pathetic technical writer the time of day, at least thats in my
experience, but I come from an engineering background, so I do have
technical proficiency. I do know how difficult it is for a technical
person to deal with a humanities person. What do I have to show for it?
1850 pages of reference manual, half of which I inherited from the
previous job holder who was an archaeology major, and all of which the
customers take one look at, shrug their shoulders at, and call tech
support. They don't even use the online help most of the time either.

Only if they are a species made up exclusively of identical idiots.  In any
modestly diverse society (like ours) some idividuals will choose not to
become cyborgs.  Those who do will use many different operating systems,
with many different anti-virus schemes (so no one virus can infect them
all).  Some of them will be paranoid, and insist on special hardware-level
protections for their essential functions (which renders them pretty much
immune to software attacks).  Others will go for maximum enhancement,
relying on the best availible defensive technolgies to spot pesky viruses
(and other sneaky software) and keep them out.

With all these defenses, it is hard to believe that a killer computer virus
could take out even a single planet.  For an interstellar civilization the
problem is much worse, because now you need an incubation time of centuries.
So, your virus needs to remain undetected and functional through dozens of
revolutionary changes - new operating systems, new hardware architectures,
new approaches to virus protection, and who knows what else.  Even then, all
it takes to spoil the plan is for one person, anywhere, to notice the
sleeping time bomb and alert his local antivirus-software dealer.  I think
we can safely rule out that possibility.

Physical viruses suffer from many of the same problems as the software
variety.  You want a virus that is 100% lethal (which they never are),
affects 100% of the population (even the ones who have radically altered
their genetic structures), can incubate for centuries before becoming active
(how?), can not be cured by medical technology hundreds of years more
advanced that what it was created by, and is never detected by anyone in all
that time (in an age where biowarfare is no more exotic than the normal
variety).  Does this really sound like a plausible scenario to you?

Actually John Morey invented the steamship ahead of Robert Fulton, which
so enraged Fulton that he sank it with his torpedo, to give him enough
time to finish his own steamship. The lake where the ship was sunk was
named after Morey, Lake Morey in Fairlee, VT.

We obviously inherited our early ideas of a postal system from the

a month after that.

Since the movie critics were those who couldn't even make it as book

its obvious that the movie critics couldn't read a roadmap or the
schedule for the pneumatic subway to get to the theater in time to see
anything but the last five minutes..

Well, if you take the number of people he killed off, and compare that

And outlawing war for all time too. That was the same year Hitler
updated his Reichsgeletsblatt for the final time, to confiscate all guns
not in the hands of Nazi Party members or members of the armed forces,
making Germany "the safest country in history."

because all of the other intelligent races who have hominid
physiologies, using sound to communicate locally, visible light to see,
and use electromagnetic radiation to communicate long distance on their
earthlike worlds circling G class yellow dwarf stars have been told by
their most intelligent and prominent scholars that the odds are that any
other intelligent species will likely be very different from them.

The original extinction challenge was aimed at a certain segment of the SETI
crowd, which apparently either doesn't believe in ultratech or thinks that
we humans are the only race smart enough to invent it.  However, we seem to
have significant interest in more realistic scenarios as well.  So, for
those of us who don't thing nanotechnology is especially exotic, here's an
upgraded version of the challenge.

The Challenge:

Propose a plausible mechanism, natural or artificial, which is capable of
rendering an advanced spacefaring civilization extinct without rendering the
subsequent evolution of other races impossible.

For purposes of clarification:
1) The target civilization is assumed to have self-sustaining colonies in
several solar systems spread across a volume of at least a few dozen cubic
light-years (killing them off before they get into space is too easy).

2) The target civilization is assumed to have Drexlerian nanotechnology,
uploading, sentient AI, and other such technologies.  However, they are
still bound by the known laws of physics (we can't really speculate
productively about races that don't have that constraint).

3) Replacing the target civilization with an SI, borganism, or other
sentient construct doesn't count.  A bona fide extinction requires the
complete eradication of all sentient life, plus the destruction of all
non-sentient systems that would re-create sentient life.

4) A proposed extinction event must be consistent with current astronomical
knowledge (i.e. either it would be invisible to us, or it is something
we've seen).  Since this all started as a discussion of the Great Filter, it
should also leave behind a universe where new races can evolve in the
future.

For the record, Eliezer Yudkowsky gets credit for the only plausible
extinction event I've seen so far (see
http://singularity.posthuman.com/sing_analysis.html#zones, option #2).  It
requires making some assumptions that many people would disagree with, but
at least it is arguably possible.

Are there any other candidates.

A somewhat plausible scenario.  There is one additional assumption here that
you didn't note: no one has ever cared enough about us poor gaussians to
bother doing anything about us.  It would be trivial for an SI to ensure
that no future sentient race ever has to suffer from mortality, either by
sterilizing the universe or by setting up an autonomous system to uplift new
races once they cross the threshold into sentinece.  (Hmm - maybe we don't
qualify yet?)

This only works if you eliminate all personal variations as well (otherwise
you will always have some fraction of the population that decides to explore
the universe anyway, for non-economic reasons).

Another somewhat plausible scenario.  There isn't any particular reason to
think it will happen (so far intelligence has led to more personal
diversity, not less), but we can't rule it out.

Well, I'm no neurophsyiologist, but lets give it a shot.  First of all, how many
'and/or' gates would it take to model a seratonin molecule interacting with a
phosphate molecule?  This is outside of my expertise, but I suspect this would
require several dozen 'and/or' gates to model even the simplest of interactions.
The next challenge is coming up with a complex enough circuit design to model
*all* of the possible interactions of seratonin along a single neuron connection.
And of course this only describes seratonin!  So the next challenge is moving up
the scale of complexity to design a software/hardware system general enough to
accommodate *all* neurotransmitter activity.  You would think with today's
supercomputers, somebody somewhere has designed a program that can emulate
every conceivable molecular state of a single neuron.  If not, then my point is well
taken in how complex each neuron in fact is.

Assuming someone has designed a program that's capable of this; conceptually then,
one must then have this program run simultaneously and in parallel with thousands
of others to match the average neuronal connectivity.  The program would have
to do a complete run through an average of 10 times/sec. Since it would be a waste
for a simultaneous program running for every neuron (10 billion?) it would be
easier to have each neuron be stored as rapidly-accessed data until used.  How much
data would be required to store accurately the state of each neuron? I don't know,
but I suspect it's easily on the order of a megabyte at least - as it
would have to store the entire array of unique molecular states the neuron is in.

At this point it's all guess work, but my point is that even if when we achieve
atomic
scale transistor densities, the real challenge will be organizing those transistors
to
emulate the entire brain, which is itself a molecular switching computer.

**The challenge is not the speed or density, which will eventually give us the
_potential_
to run a human brain 1000's of times faster than our own.  No, the real challenge
is creating something complex and coherent enough to emulate the brain itself.  I
suspect
the hardware and software bottlenecks in actually doing so will be difficult enough
to close the gap between brain augmentation (IA) and human-level AI considerably.

That is also completely non-obvious.  I have yet to hear a single convincing argument

that sufficient *speed* and density automatically yields human-level AI. You will
need
complexity, and where by chance will you be getting it?  Until this can be
convincingly
answered, all human-level AI claims should be kept in every Skeptics top 5.

**Since no one has actually built or designed a theoretical human-level AI, how can
anyone possibly claim what it takes to build one?  This seems completely absurd
to the point of self-contradiction!  As so many are fond of saying around here -
extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  To re-iterate the obvious, until
someone can prove otherwise, a human-level AI will have to equal the complexity of
the
human brain.

Right. And not to forget the Attack of the Giant Mutant Squirrel from

Hello everyone,

I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback I have gotten from all 
of you in regards to how to improve my cognitive powers with various 
techniques and devices.  I was surprised how many of you are into 
nutritional and chemical means of improvement but not mechanical means.  I 
felt like a lack of money on many of our parts may be why there were not 
people offering advice on the items listed in the excellent book 
"Megabrains."  Actually I want methods that not only help me develop my 
intellectual potential but also deal with depression alleviation, focus, 
self-esteem and attitude.

As I buy the no-horizon goggles and hypno-peripheral audiocassettes, use 
ginko, the antidepressant Luvox and the a.d.d. treatment ritalin I will post 
to let you know what the results are.  Perhaps I will experience a 
transformation!  The Luvox alone may do that for me given 2-3 months on it.

One person I was really hoping to hear from was Natasha-Vita More.  She 
strikes me as someone who would have tried many different methods to achieve 
what I am looking for.  If you read this Ms. More and that is true please 
let me know what things do or don't work at least for you.

I must admit some of you have quite a sense of humor!  You were kidding 
right??

Sincerely,

John Grigg

Do you think there'd be more support for cloning if the experts promised a
clone of JFK Jr? Maybe you could compile a list of the dead, clonable, and
ultra-right, for cloning propaganda to sell to numbskulls.

How about cloned sets of (dead) hollywood stars? You could buy a Marilyn,
James Dean, and Elvis set, to put in cheap cafes, instead of those hideous
pictures people insist on hanging. In fact, I saw one of these pictures the
other day which has those three, as children (dressed in their signature
gear of course), looking out over a cliff into the sky, where images of
their adult faces looked down at them from the clouds. You could get real
kid versions! Like the baby muppets for the baby boomers!

Now that's how to sell cloning to the voting public!

I fail to see in my message where i wanted to make it into an exclusivity.
I was observing that even if none of the "intelligence genes" are mapped
to the Y chromosome (which is what i assume you are referring to by the
male sex chromosome, but biology and genetics are definitely not my field
so please correct me if i'm mistaken), this does not mean that all of
these "intelligence genes" are mapped on the female sex chromosome (my
asumption, X chromosome) since there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, taking
one of the possible male influences out, would still leave another 22
chromosomes by which the father might have an influence on his son's
"intelligence genes".  If, on the other hand, all of the "intelligence
genes" would map to the X chromosome or mitochondrial dna, then i would
agree that the son's "intelligence genes" is wholly dependent on his
mother's genetics, but since this is not what you are claiming, i was just
pointing out that the conclusion seemed not to be substantiated (i'm sorry
to keep putting "intelligence genes" in quotes, but, as someone else
pointed out, i don't even know if those exist)

Even then, you have to consider the benefits of male smartness in

Why do you say this?  Please justify.

The development of nanotech and the singularity/spike make the old/common
space "exploration" paradigm obsolete.  A new paradigm needs to be developed.

It takes ~11 days to dismantle Mercury and harvest the entire power
output of the sun (using some reasonable assumptions like 1 kg/m^2
solar panels).  Once you have that much power, dismantling everything
but Saturn & Jupiter takes ~12 years (which take ~60 and 600 years
respectively if you use all the available power).

If we assume nanotechnology develops ~2020, then we will have restructured
much of the solar system before 2100.  That is long before anything other
than a nanoprobe would be able to migrate to any nearby systems.  Given
NASA's current approach (and almost universal head-in-the-sand with
regard to really understanding Nanotech), I would predict that there may
be one or more probes designed and launched to explore different bodies
in the solar system that find their target is "missing" when they arrive.
[This is a variant on the problem of launching a world-ship between stars
when a world ship constructed with later technologies would end up
getting there sooner.]

A re-engineered solar system is "virtually" indestructable (short of
such "accidents" as stellar collisions or black hole encounters).
So, if you believe that nanotech is feasible, and really want humanity
to survive, then there are 2 things you should primarily support:
  (1) The near-Earth crossing object survey efforts and possibly the
      development of (robotic) spacecraft that could nudge them out
      of the way as far away as possible.  The main reason for this
      is to give us a "fighting" chance for survival should the very
      low odds of a planet-killing object encounter in the next ~50
      years be against us.
  (2) Putting every other additional dollar of funds into the development
      of nanotechnology.  This means *no* manned missions and *no* Mars
      missions.  There could be some justification for space observatories
      and things like the anticipated Mercury surveyor mission (should it
      survive any budget cuts).

The development of nanotechnology eliminates entirely the need for space based
resources for probably thousands of years (unless you can predict some kind
of population explosion).  The doubling time of nanotech based power harvesting
and mass manipulation provides more that sufficient resources for very
comfortable living here on Earth without having to risk the hazards of space.
Only if you argue strongly for uploading and freedom for relatively endless
copying/mental-expansion do you need to go into space.

This sounds like the argument of someone who waxes romantic at the idea
of anything in space who doesn't really understand nanotechnology development
and economic investments.  The last time I checked, I was under the impression
that each space shuttle flight was costing ~$400 million (someone correct this
if they have better data).  As pointed out in the nanoassembler thread, a
semiconductor [nano]-fab would cost about a billion $.  So cut 2-3 space shuttle
missions and you have a state-of-the-art nano-development facility.  A single
shuttle mission would fund about ~2500 full-time scientists working on nanotech.

Fundamentally, (old-style) space activity involves "big-stuff" and is expensive
because you have to manipulate lots of material.  Nanotech research is much
cheaper because it involves manipulating much less material (though the
required precision is much greater).  There is some hope regarding the
NASA efforts for smaller/faster/cheaper but it is going to take the deaths
of the "old-school" manned-mission proponents to stop the money pit activities.

[Just FYI, I'm a very romantic space-type myself and my eyes go all misty
when watching things like Apollo 13 or the moon-landings, but I don't let
my romanticism interfere with the logic of the the fastest way to achieve
development and give the largest number of people the greatest amount of
freedom with regard to the quality of their lives.]

I'm sorry, but in 1969, it was generally accepted that life *did not*
exist on Mars.   It is *more* accepted today, by microbiologists, etc.
that life (as bacteria) might still exist on Mars.

Vast yes, Boring NOT!
- 90% of the mass is missing...
- An estimated 400 billion objects with masses 0.3-0.5 Msun orbit
  our galaxy -- and we can't see them.
- The halo from our galaxy emits a gamma-ray glow -- from what?
- Examinations of nearby galaxies show them to giving off lots of
  infrared radiation and suffer form a shortage of visible stars.
- The expansion rate of the universe appears to be changing requiring
  changes in the fundamental equations on which the universe is based
  (or astroengineering by emerging civilizations).

The semiconductor industry (a partial subset of the computer
industry) is ~$200 billion/yr and can't be touched by the psychiatry
industry.

The "frontiers" are always those areas that you can expand into
until there are diminishing returns.  So we expanded across the
planet until gravity made "space" very expensive.  We now are
move to the smaller scale until we hit the limits of atomic scale
engineering (atoms -> electrons -> photons; nuclei or smaller are
very iffy).  Once this is done we will combine it with megascale
engineering until we reach the point of diminishing returns imposed
by speed-of-light restrictions.

Even if you leave social welfare out of the equation, if people *really*
wanted space exploration, the would realize that rapid nanotech development
is the cheapest way to get there.

Greetings, Neal Stephenson fans! Be informed that
Stephenson's new novel _Cyptonomicon_, 
which I just finished reading, has its own web site,
www.cyptonomicon.com, and that the web 
site has a very interesting long non-fiction essay by
Stephenson entitled "In the Beginning 
was the Command Line" which is mainly about the
history of computer operating systems, but 
does A LOT of interesting digressing into discussions
about culture and other things.

You may remember the thread a began months ago about
the apparent lack of AI in Stephenson's 
_The Diamond Age_. I haven't written since then, so I
hope you'll forgive me if I discuss 
what portions of the "In the Beginning..." essay
reveal about his beliefs in other matters 
not related to AI, and how a better understanding of
the novels can be had by knowing where 
he's coming from.

Among the things I find fascinating about
Stephenson's writing is that much of it (in 
particular _The Diamond Age_, but also _Snow Crash_)
seemed to me to implicitly reveal the 
author's opinions on certain matters, but I could
never be sure, because all I had to go on 
was what his characters believed, which could always
be different that how the author felt.

For example, in the future history of _Snow Crash_
and _The Diamond Age_ (which is a common 
future history; there are strong hints that _Snow
Crash_'s youthful "Y.T." is none other than 
_The Diamond Age_'s elderly "Mrs. Matheson"), one
gets the impression that Stephenson has a 
low opinion of contempory American culture. I say
this because, among other things, he seems 
to portray it as eventually causing a period of
poverty and chaos (_Snow Crash_) followed by 
the rise of more conservative cultures which he
presents in a much more positive light, such 
as phyles "New Atlantis" (a.k.a. the Neo-Victorians),
the "Heartlanders", etc.

What makes the essay "In the Beginning was the
Command Line" different is that it is 
NONfiction; it is actually the Neal Stephenson
talking, not John Hackworth. Therefore, I 
found the digressions into issues of culture very
interesting, as they confirmed my 
suspicions that Stephenson's writings were more than
just cool cyberpunk, but carried certain 
messages such as:
(1) Some cultures are superior or inferior to others
in that they are more or less likely to 
lead to the happiness and prosperity of their
adherents.
(2) Contemporary American secular culture is inferior
in the sense of (1).

Stephenson makes these memes such central themes to
some of his writing that I feel you 
cannot understand the novels without knowing that
these themes are there.

The following are highly edited excerpts from
Stephenson's "In the Beginning was the Command 
Line":

*** BEGIN EXCERPTS ***
"It is obvious, to everyone outside of the United
States, that our arch-buzzwords, 
multiculturalism and diversity, are false fronts that
are being used (in many cases 
unwittingly) to conceal a global trend to eradicate
cultural differences. The basic tenet of 
multiculturalism (or "honoring diversity" or whatever
you want to call it) is that people 
need to stop judging each other-to stop asserting
(and, eventually, to stop believing) that 
this is right and that is wrong, this true and that
false, one thing ugly and another thing 
beautiful, that God exists and has this or that set
of qualities...

"The problem is that once you have done away with the
ability to make judgments as to right 
and wrong, true and false, etc., there's no real
culture left... The ability to make 
judgments, to believe things, is the entire it point
of having a culture...

"The global anti-culture that has been conveyed into
every cranny of the world by television 
is a culture unto itself, and by the standards of
great and ancient cultures like Islam and 
France, it seems grossly inferior...

"The only real problem is that anyone who has no
culture, other than this global monoculture, 
is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up watching
TV, never sees any religion or 
philosophy, is raised in an atmosphere of moral
relativism, learns about civics from watching 
bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a
university where postmodernists vie to 
outdo each other in demolishing traditional notions
of truth and quality, is going to come 
out into the world as one pretty feckless human
being...

"On the other hand, if you are raised within some
specific culture, you end up with a basic 
set of tools that you can use to think about and
understand the world. You might use those 
tools to reject the culture you were raised in, but
at least you've got some tools...

"In this country, the people who run things--who
populate major law firms and corporate 
boards--understand all of this at some level. They
pay lip service to multiculturalism and 
diversity and non-judgmentalness, but they don't
raise their own children that way. I have 
highly educated, technically sophisticated friends
who have moved to small towns in Iowa to 
live and raise their children... Any suburban
community might be thought of as a place where 
people who hold certain (mostly implicit) beliefs go
to live among others who think the same 
way...

"And not only do these people feel some
responsibility to their own children, but to the 
country as a whole. Some of the upper class are vile
and cynical, of course, but many spend 
at least part of their time fretting about what
direction the country is going in, and what 
responsibilities they have..."

*** END EXCERPTS ***

I think Stephenson's attitudes on these things are
relevant to Extropianism in that many 
Extropians seem to relish ideas such as the downfall
of the nation-state and the elimination 
of so-called "religious" memes, and a lot of
Stephenson's writings are very cautionary when 
it comes to these sort of Extropian attitudes. (He
may feel that the downfall of the 
nation-state might be inevitable, but he shudders to
think what life will be like until they 
are replaced by something like "phyles".)

I side with atmospheric chemist James Lovelock on this. Mars has a
chemical steady-state atmosphere, (and very little of that) and
therefore it is unlikely that it supports life.

Earth as another example has a chemically very unstable-state
atmosphere which Lovelock explains as being maintained by life on
Earth. (The Gaia Hypothesis). So to find planets with life look for
planets whose atmospheres are in a nonsteady-state.(chemically)

excellent posts by the way.

I am in favor of cutting all funding to NASA.  Not just because of the 
extortion they use to get funding.  If NASA were eliminated I think we would 
see a huge increase in the amount of knowledge produced.  The scientific 
talent that NASA has is stifled by beurocratic red tape.  Incompitent 
politicians decide what programs deserve money.  No NASA means that all the 
people in its employ will be quickly grabbed up by the private companies and 
the free market will guide the industry to the best methods of space travel 
and research.  I have little knowledge of the internal working of NASA, but 
I am confident that the free market can come up with something much better.  
NASA only serves to keep promising researchers from reaching thier 
potential.

There are enough "unexplained phenomena" (i.e. missing mass, gravitational
microlensing observations, excess infrared radiation in nearby galaxies,
missing "stars" according to standard stellar evolution theories, gamma
ray "glows", etc.) that one can reasonably postulate that *they do exist*
if one reconciles existing observations with evolution to the limits of
known physics.  The hiding vs. observable discussion revolves around
the fundamental question of whether you are willing to risk "detection"
(and therefore attack) tradeoff with intelligence (and defense capabilities).

If intelligence/local defense wins over remote attack capabilities
then all SIs should be "observable".  If there is a tradeoff between
defense & intelligence/observability then there may be "stealth" SIs.

The fact that "they aren't here" or "they aren't easily observable"
are easily explained by the advantage of "local optimization of
capacities".   Remote activities don't gain you very much once
you are at the SI level.

Robert

I find this puzzling. By the same reasoning, we should want to keep
children uneducated and ignorant, since they will become competition for
us. Both assume that more people with intelligence and ability come at a
cost to those who already have it. A zero-sum assumption. Clearly the
economy does not work this way. Right now, most of Africa has less wealth,
education, health, and technological ability than the Americas and Europe.
I would see Africa's ascendence not as a competitive threat but as a
massive contribution to the total output of ideas, goods, and services.

Why should SI's see turning humans into uploads as competition in any sense
that harms them? It would just mean more persons with whom to have
productive exchanges.

It's absurd to think that a true SI would

This must be where we differ. No, I don't think total control is desirable
or beneficial, even if it were me who had that total control. If true
omnipotence were possible, maybe what you are saying would follow, but
omnipotence is a fantasy to be reserved for religions. Even superpowerful
and ultraintelligent beings should benefit from cooperation and exchange.

Despite my disagreement with your zero-sum assumptions (if I'm getting your
views right--I only just starting reading this thread and you may simply be
running with someone else's assumptions for the sake of the argument), I
agree with this. While uploads and SI's may not have any inevitable desire
to wipe us out, some might well want to, and I agree that it makes sense to
deal with that from a position of strength.


I'm not sure how much we can influence the relative pace of research into
unfettered independent SIs vs. augmentation of human intelligence, but I
too favor the latter. Unlike Hans Moravec and (if I've read him right,
Eliezer), I have no interest in being superceded by something better. I
want to *become* something better.

Well, besides this, we either assume that a) they are, only in ways we can't
determine, or b) we are alone.  Something in the next galaxy over (Andromeda?)
could be as huge as twenty suns and we couldn't discern it.

One thing that I was thinking was that as civilizations reached some point
where they had the power to alter cosmological framework, perhaps those beings
that had already gotten there would be able to alter their course.  This is
obviously pure speculation.

I think the idea of the Drake equation wasn't so much to give the exact
probability of intelligent life besides humanity, but rather to isolate the
probabilisic variables that would yield some kind of intelligent life as we
know it.  Now, there could still be life and civilization that doesn't depend
on the variables of the Drake equation, for example some form of life that
didn't require a "habitable" planet to form.  So, the Drake equation can't give
us an absolute probability, it is just a guideline.  Sure, there are general
figures for each of the variables, but we cannot verify each of these or if
they are all of the variables.

Whether or not we consider the Drake equation to determine the probability of
other intelligent civilizations, it is a tool to determine this.

At any rate, Earth is a miraculous thing.  I say that not necessarily to
require "higher power" for its being, but it is just great.

Now if the aliens would just come forward and answer these questions we would
be in great shape.  Personally, I feel the universe is too large for humanity
to be the only intelligent race.

Super high technos!

Have a nice day, thank you for your time,

Nuclear fusion, which happens in the hearts of stars like our sun,
requires tremendous pressures and temperatures. "Low" temperature fusion
starts at 1.5 million degrees Celsius. The antimatter plasma gun is
intended to create temperatures hot enough to trigger fusion. To date,
experiments with fusion have managed to maintain the reaction for only a
few seconds before it burns out.=20

</smaller></fontfamily>

That's where the third part of Penn State's efforts, developing engine
concepts, comes in. Smith's Aimstar engine concept offers a way to
maintain the fusion reaction. It starts with a small amount of
antimatter, which comes into contact with lead or uranium, causing it to
fission. The energies released by the fission help drive the fusion
reaction of deuterium, or "heavy" hydrogen, and a form of helium. The
high temperatures create a plasma of negatively charged electrons and the
positive nuclei of atoms. Magnetic nozzles direct the charged particles
for propulsion.=20


But with such hot temperatures, wouldn't the nozzles be destroyed? "I'm
working on that," promises Smith.=20


Another Smith concept gets around the problem of melting by, in effect,
melting away only a little at a time. "We're working our heads off to
move forward as fast as we can," he says. "Because if there's a
technology that's capable of going to the stars, it's antimatter."=20


Another fusion approach, called the Bussard Ramjet, attempts to solve the
weight problem by not taking much fuel at all. Instead, the concept calls
for a gigantic magnetic field "scoop" that would harvest what it needs
from interstellar space. The scoop is, of course, far bigger than any
that has ever been generated on Earth =97 about the distance from Earth
one-third the way to the moon, at a strength hundreds of times what is
possible in labs today. Leifer of JPL describes the system: "You need to
pick up your fuel, compress it and heat it, and expel it out the back
without slowing down the spacecraft," she says, "and we don't know how to
do that either."=20

Solar sails may be initially more promising than antimatter or fusion,
says Frisbee. "In terms of a closest and cleanest development program,
solar sails may be the first step." The idea was first conceived decades
ago by Robert Forward, a retired Hughes physicist who now consults for
NASA; heads Forward Unlimited, a Clinton, Washington, company that is
developing space tethers; and writes science fiction novels.=20


In Forward's basic concept, a laser beam would "push" a solar sail. That
is, particles of light, called photons, have momentum that is transferred
to the sail. The idea requires a very large transmitter lens, a sail some
tens of kilometers in diameter to travel 4.5 light-years, and power
generation in gigawatts. A multistage mission would enable the sail to
slow down when it reaches its target.=20


Henry Harris, a JPL physicist, is another proponent of light sails. "You
need a large amount of power for a long time, and that's no problem when
you're getting the energy from the sun," he says. In a report to NASA
this spring, he and his team outlined a multifunction mission with solar
sails. Multiple lasers would be built and placed in orbit around the sun;
they would be phase-locked to create a powerful beam that could
alternatively be used for pushing a spacecraft and imaging the target
star system. The laser beam might also be used to remove Earth-orbiting
space junk, provide power for our planet, and maybe even destroy
threatening comets and asteroids. "The ultimate instrument for
interstellar travel will not be merely for travel," says Harris.=20


<flushright><underline><color><param>0000,0000,fefe</param>Lightsail
Slideshow

</color></underline></flushright> =20


While military research into space-based lasers has laid some of the
groundwork for accurate pointing of the devices over great distances, a
solar sail's beam requirements would have to be many times more
stringent. Steering is also an issue. And to save weight, the sail might
be only a few atoms thick. Furthermore, current models of photon
propulsion need to be confirmed with actual experiments. So Harris is
calling for tests this year of thin sail materials that would be zapped
with light photons by an instrument that has been nicknamed a Photon
Flinger.=20


Researchers like Harold Puthoff of the Institute for Advanced Studies at
Austin in Texas have another idea concerning propulsion: They propose to
"engineer" the vacuum of space itself. The concept is based on the
prediction of quantum physics that empty space contains an enormous
residual background energy known as zero-point energy. Tiny particles
flit in and out of existence in the vacuum, perhaps causing inertia. The
ability to control inertia, or "warp" space, the theory goes, could help
solve problems with interstellar flight. How to do that remains an open
question.=20


While such exotic technologies are decades away from implementation, NASA
is also working on interstellar science that can be done near term. In
March, a team of scientists met at JPL to discuss options for a mission
past our solar system's heliosphere. That is the point at which the
stream of charged particles from our sun, called the solar wind, is
overwhelmed by the interstellar medium. The team would like to see the
mission launch within the next 10 years.=20


What would such a mission do? Lots of science, says Richard Mewaldt of
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, who
chairs the science and technology definition team. He describes the
heliosphere as a bubble, 25 billion miles in diameter, that has to be
pierced.=20


"To measure the properties of the interstellar medium directly, you have
to break through that bubble," says Mewaldt. One instrument might detect
low-energy cosmic rays, which cannot penetrate the heliosphere but which
are important for astronomers to understand galactic dynamics.=20


Comparing the composition of the solar system and the interstellar region
just beyond it could also provide clues about the evolution of our
galaxy. Astronomers would also welcome a survey of the Kuiper Belt, where
perhaps 100 small bodies from tens to hundreds of kilometers in size have
been found, many by the Keck telescope in Hawaii. Farther out is the Oort
Cloud, likely the source of long-period comets like Halley. Another
mission could place a telescope outside the heliosphere to measure star
positions more accurately, by comparing them with Earth measurements.=20


And indeed, NASA will eventually go to the stars for no less reason than
because it must, says Gerald Smith of Penn State. "Clearly, NASA's future
is to go to the boundaries of the solar system and beyond. Whether it's
solar sails, antimatter, fission =97 they have to be dealt with. We can
talk about <italic>Star Wars</italic> all we want, but if we don't have
the engines it'll never happen. It'll just be entertainment."=20

No need to conjure up exotic stuff like Hypernova's or Gamma Ray Bursters,
just a garden variety supernova would probably do the trick if it were close enough.
Neutrino are normally harmless but the flux from one of these monsters would
be so incredibly enormous all life would probably be sterilize within a few dozen cubic
light years. The other unpleasant aspects of a supernova could be shielded against but
not neutrinos, it's hopeless, you're fried.

In arguing against AI or Nanotech, you have to argue against convergent
evolution.  There are numerous examples on Earth for convergent evolution
(eyes and wings for example), since the advantages they provide demonstrate
strong selective pressures.  I would argue strongly that since the
"limits of physical laws" provide the ultimate constraint, the path
for long-lived civilizations is to evolve to these limits.  Since
nanotech particularly and AI (within nanotech computational structures)
seem to be at such limits, I would argue that most, if not all
technological civilzations reach these limits.  Is it feasible for
technological civilizations to attempt things (such as interstellar
colonization) before these limits?  Yes, certainly.  However, the
period of time at these "immature" development stages, relative to
the length of time at the "mature" development stages is brief,
so we can expect a majority of activities to occur at the limits of
convergent evolutionary paths.

When considering "what *might* happen to us", it is useful 
to ask "what *are* the limits", and are the barriers to reaching
those limits short relative to galactic or planetary time scales?"

I'm sorry, I don't usually do this sort of thing, but I can't help it here.  
You say that you "have little knowledge of the internal workings of NASA" but 
make the assertion that "The scientific talent that NASA has is stifled by 
beurocratic [sic] red tape."  This sounds like a statement of fact that could 
only be based on "knoweldge of the internal workings of NASA."

>Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                            $12,253,800,000
>Fiscal year 1999 appropriation
>13,665,000,000
>Fiscal year 2000 budget request
>13,578,400,000
>Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation    - 1,411,200,000

>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was created by the
>National Space Act of 1958.  NASA conducts space and aeronautics research,
>development, and flight activity designed to ensure and maintain U.S.
>preeminence in space and aeronautical endeavors.
>
>The Committee recommends a total program level of $12,253,800,000 in fiscal
>year 2000, which is a decrease of $1,324,600,000 from the budget request and
>$1,411,200,000 below the fiscal year 1999 enacted appropriation.
>
>The Committee recognizes that the funding reduction for NASA is significant.
>However, when looked at on a program-by-program or project-by-project basis,
>the recommendations are less severe than they appear at first.  Projects
>which are specifically noted for cancellation are for the most part early in
>their development, so sunk costs are minimal and long-term savings are
>significant.  This is true of SIRTF, Contour, and LightSAR.  Additionally,
>other reductions are in the budgets for planning future missions and
>technology development, and many of these budgets have grown significantly
>over the last two years.  Examples include: supporting research and
>technology within the Space Science account, which has increased by over
>$250,000,000 since fiscal year 1998; planning for future missions in the
>Explorer and Discovery programs, which have increased by $145,000,000 since
>fiscal year
>
>[[p. 77]]
>
>year 1998; Earth Probes funding has increased over $100,000,000 since fiscal
>year 1998; and the Earth Observing System Data Information System program
>has expended more than $1,600,000,000 since its inception and has delivered
>minimal products to NASA despite this expenditure.  Numerous other examples
>could be cited, these are only the most compelling reasons which justify the
>reductions proposed by the Committee.

>Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                            $ 5,388,000,000
>Fiscal year 1999 appropriation
>5,480,000,000
>Fiscal year 2000 budget request
>5,638,000,000
>Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation         - 92,200,000
>Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request                  - 250,000,000
>
>This appropriation provides for human space flight activities, including
>development of the international space station and operation of the space
>shuttle.  This account also includes support of planned cooperative
>activities with Russia, upgrades to the performance and safety of the space
>shuttle, and required construction projects in direct support of the space
>station and space shuttle programs.
>
>The Committee recommends a total of $5,388,000,000 for the human space
>flight account in fiscal year 2000.  The recommendation is a decrease of
>$250,000,000 from the budget request and $92,000,000 below the fiscal year
>1999 enacted appropriation.
>
>The Committee recommendation includes a reduction of $100,000,000 from the
>budget request for Space Shuttle Operations.  The Committee received many
>requests for additional funding for the upgrades to the shuttle but was
>unable to accommodate the additional funding at this time.  The Committee
>will continue to monitor the shuttle program and may be able to address this
>issue prior to final enactment of this bill.
>
>The Committee remains committed to safe operation of the space shuttle
>program and does not believe the funding reduction proposed will jeopardize
>the program's record of safe operations.
>
>The Committee applauds the progress being made by NASA and its partners in
>the assembly of the International Space Station.  However, the Committee
>remains concerned that continued progress may be hampered if Russian assets
>continue to be diverted to the MIR [[sic]] space station.  It is imperative
>that the MIR space station not become a drain on the limited financial
>resources of Russia.  It is also vital that the infrastructure in central
>Asia, as well as Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles, remain dedicated to
>the priority of supporting assembly and operation of the International Space
>Station.  NASA is directed to take all action necessary to ensure that the
>MIR station does not become a liability to the International Space Station
>program and that Russia lives up to its previous commitments to assist in
>the assembly and operations of the International Space Station.
>
>The Committee continues to be concerned about increasing requirements and
>costs in the International Space Station program.  While Congress has
>advocated introducing more commercialization and privatization into the ISS
>program, the Committee sees little
>
>[[p. 78]]
>
>progress at NASA toward implementing this direction.  The Committee believes
>long-term cost savings will result from more commercial involvement and
>endorses the White House stated policy that commercially available goods and
>services should be purchased to the maximum extent possible.  To this end,
>the Committee directs NASA to aggressively consider commercial proposals for
>ISS program requirements.  Except for cases involving national security or
>public safety concerns, when a commercial provider proposes a solution that
>meets mission requirements in a cost-effective manner, the agency must
>accept the commercial proposal.  If NASA determines it is not in the best
>interest of the government for reasons other than national security or
>public safety, NASA must demonstrate the reasons for pursuing a
>non-commercial solution.  In cases involving cost comparisons between
>government and commercial options, NASA must compare the proposed commercial
>price against the full cost associated with the government solution,
>including fixed costs for maintaining government assets.  The Committee
>believes it is critical that NASA not compete with commercial providers for
>routine space hardware and service requirements.  NASA must endeavor to
>create an environment that fosters the growth of a commercial space industry
>to service commercial ISS users.  It is the Committee's strong belief that
>utilizing commercial services at this time will help control long-term ISS
>costs and encourage more commercial interest in the ISS program.

>The Committee recommends $4,575,700,000 for Science, Aeronautics and
>Technology in fiscal year 2000.  The amount recommended is $849,000,000
>below the budget request.  The amount provided includes a decrease of

>
>SPACE SCIENCE
>
>For space science programs, the Committee recommends the following changes
>to the budget request:
>1. Cancellation of the Space Infrared Telescope Facility for a budget
>reduction of $100,800,000.
>
>[[p. 79]]
>
>2. Reduce funding for future planning for the Explorer program by

>$120,000,000 is to be taken from the Research program.
>7. An increase of $10,000,000 for Space Solar Power.
>8. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Science Center at Glendale Community
>College.
>9. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Louisville Science Center.
>10. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Science Center Initiative at Ohio
>Wesleyan University.
>11. An increase of $5,000,000 for the Polymer Energy Rechargeable System.
>12. An increase of $2,000,000 for the center on life in extreme thermal
>environments at Montana State University in Bozeman.
>13. An increase of $3,000,000 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago,
>Illinois.
>14. NASA is directed to provide a total of $20,000,000 for fundamental
>physics research.
>
>LIFE AND MICROGRAVITY SCIENCES
>
>For Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, the Committee
>recommends the following adjustments to the budget request:
>1.   An increase of $1,000,000 for the "Garden Machine" program at Texas
>Tech University.
>2. An increase of $4,000,000 for the Space Radiation program at Loma Linda
>University Hospital.
>3. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Neutron Therapy facility at Fermilab.
>As part of the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill, the Congress provided
>$15,000,000 and directed NASA to conduct research using the shuttle for a
>dedicated mission.  NASA declined to pursue such a mission, citing a lack of
>resources.  The Committee reiterates that providing regular research flight
>opportunities for life and microgravity during space station assembly is
>critical for providing scientists the opportunity to develop research
>capabilities needed for optimal utilization of the station.  The Committee
>is dismayed that, despite numerous expressions of concern from the Congress
>on this issue, and the provision of extra funds, NASA has not yet responded
>to include additional research flights in its shuttle launch schedule.  The
>current plan includes only one life and microgravity research shuttle
>mission over at least a 5-year period from 1999 through 2004.  This is
>unacceptable.  The Committee directs NASA to use the $15,000,000 provided in
>fiscal year 1999 to pursue near-term flight opportunities for life and
>microgravity sciences.  Specifically, NASA should use the funding to
>increase the research allocation on STS-107 and to initiate work on a new
>research mission
>
>[[p. 80]]
>
>in the early fiscal year 2002 timeframe.  The Committee believes annual
>dedicated life and microgravity research flights during the space station
>assembly period are essential and directs NASA to actively pursue this goal.
>
>EARTH SCIENCES
>
>For Earth Sciences, the Committee recommends the following adjustments to
>the budget request:
>1. Cancellation of the GLOBE program for a savings of $5,000,000.
>2. A reduction of $100,000,000 from the Earth Probes program, including
>cancellation of the TRIANA [[sic]] program, the LightSAR program, and the
>Earth System Science Pathfinders program.
>3. The Earth Observing System budget request is reduced by $150,000,000,
>consisting of $60,000,000 from the Technology Infusion program, $40,000,000
>reduction in algorithm development, and $50,000,000 from the EOS follow-on
>effort.
>4. The Earth Observing System Data Information System budget request is
>reduced by $50,000,000.
>5. An increase of $2,000,000 for a Remote Sensing Center for Geoinformatics
>at the University of Mississippi.
>6. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Advanced Tropical Remote Sensing Center
>of the National Center for Tropical Remote Sensing Applications and
>Resources at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.
>7. An increase of $10,000,000 for the Regional Application Center in Cayuga
>County, New York.
>8. An increase of $2,500,000 for a joint U.S./Italian space-based research
>initiative for the study and detection of forest fires.
>9. An increase of $3,000,000 for continuation of programs at the American
>Museum of Natural History.
>10. An increase of $1,500,000 for a remote sensing center at the
>Fulton-Montgomery Community College in New York.  The center is to work
>through the Regional Application Center at Cayuga County, New York.
>The Committee is disappointed in NASA's effort to use unmanned aerial
>vehicles (UAVs) to meet science requirements.  The ERAST program has spent
>in excess of $100,000,000 over the past five years to push the development
>of operational UAV platforms.  ERAST is close to completing its technology
>objectives, and the Office of Space Science should now design a robust
>program to utilize this new science platform.
>
>The Committee understands that NASA's current plans include only a minimal
>UAV science demonstration, to provide an individual scientist with a flight
>opportunity on an aircraft of choice.  This level of commitment is
>inadequate.  The National Academy of Sciences has urged that there be a
>sound balance between "in situ" and space-based observations in the Global
>Climate Change Program.  Further, they have stated that "innovative
>treatment of the nation's research aircraft capability, both piloted and
>robotic is strongly advised."
>
>The Committee urges NASA's Office of Earth Science to make a strategic
>commitment to UAV platforms by devising a program that is structured to
>create a business incentive for platform providers.
>
>[[p. 81]]
>
>In this regard, the Committee requests a report outlining NASA's five year
>plan for UAVs as a scientific platform, including a projected budget profile
>that is not confined within the existing manned aircraft budget.  In
>particular, NASA should closely examine the alternative of leased services
>or fractional ownership arrangements to meet these goals.  The Committee
>requests this report by November 15, 1999 and expects NASA's fiscal year
>2001 budget request to reflect this plan.
>
>AERO-SPACE TECHNOLOGY
>
>For Aero-space [[sic]] Technology, the Committee recommends the following
>adjustment [[sic]] to the budget request:
>1. An increase of $25,000,000 for Ultra Efficient Engine Technology.
>2. An increase of $1,800,000 for phase two of the synthetic vision
>information system being tested at the Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport.
>3. An increase of $1,200,000 for continued support of the Dynamic Runway
>Occupancy Measurement System demonstration at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
>4. An increase of $2,000,000 to facilitate the acquisition of a 16 beam
>SOCRATES system and integration of SOCRATES into the AVOSS program.
>5. An increase of $5,000,000 for the Trailblazer program at the Glenn
>Research Center.
>6. An increase of $500,000 for the Institute for Software Research to
>continue its collaborative effort with NASA-Dryden, focusing on adaptive
>flight control research and fault tolerant systems.
>7. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Software Optimization and Reuse
>Technology Program.
>8. An increase of $2,000,000 for the establishment of the NASA-Illinois
>Technology Commercialization Center as an extension of the Midwest Regional
>Technology Transfer Center, to be located at the DuPage County Research
>Park.
>9. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Florida Technological Research and
>Development Authority to develop a technology-oriented business incubator in
>Homestead, Florida.
>10. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Earth Alert program for a test of the
>system throughout the State of Maryland.
>11. An increase of $1,500,000 for the National Technology Transfer Center,
>to bring total funding for the center up to $7,200,00.
>Last year the Committee noted its interest in the work being done for NASA
>by the Schepens Eye Research Institute.  The Committee is aware that much of
>the research being conducted by the Institute's Center of the Aging Eye may
>be of use to NASA when astronauts begin to spend extended periods of time in
>space.  With this in mind, the Committee directs NASA to provide a report
>which addresses the research conducted by the Institute for NASA and further
>opportunities for research.
>
>The Committee encourages NASA to work in coordination with the Department of
>Energy and other interested federal agencies on an investigation of the
>cavitative physics behind the patented Micro-Combustion Heat Engine
>prototype technology developed by Micro-Combustion L.L.P.  The Committee is
>encouraged by initial NASA investigations and believes this new technology
>represents
>
>[[p. 82]]
>
>an energy breakthrough deserving of further study.  Understanding the
>national security concerns associated with this technology, the Committee
>requests NASA inform the Committee in writing, which respect to its
>intentions, no later than January 30, 2000.
>
>The Committee is aware of the unique closed system capabilities of Biosphere
>2 Center, the earth system research facility located in Oracle, Arizona.
>The Committee directs NASA, after consultation with Biosphere 2, to submit a
>report to the Committee on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of
>this Act, that details potential partnerships between NASA and Biosphere 2
>to enhance the research capabilities of NASA.
>
>The Committee is pleased to note that NASA has included in the budget
>request $18,000,000 for the NASA-Ames Software Independent Verification and
>Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia.
>
>The Committee supports NASA's plan to transition the ERAST alliance into a
>competitive process to meet its original ERAST objectives.  Further, the
>Committee is aware of NASA's interest in reaching 100,000 feet using solar
>power.  However, the Committee urges NASA to ensure that the project's
>primary focus support technologies that will enable an operational unmanned
>aerial vehicle (UAV) platform to meet the established science requirements
>of the Office of Space Science.  In particular, NASA should support
>over-the-horizon command-and-control protocols and work to ensure platform
>integration within the national airspace system.  As NASA "down-selects" to
>one consumable fuel UAV, the Committee believes NASA must ensure an
>appropriate transition phase for other alliance partners.  Although the
>change in direction of the ERAST program is warranted, the Committee urges
>that the transition be implemented in such a manner that it not undermine
>the viability of NASA's investment in the alliance member companies.
>
>ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
>
>For Academic Programs, the Committee recommends the following adjustments to
>the budget request:
>1. An increase of $6,500,000 for the National Space Grant College and
>Fellowship program, bringing the total funding for this program to
>$19,100,000.
>2. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Franklin Institute for development of

Robert Frisbee is huffing cheerily as he ambles downhill toward a
nondescript building on NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus in
Pasadena, California. The San Gabriel mountains form a stunning backdrop,
and the sun has warmed the January air to spring-like temperatures, but
Frisbee doesn't seem to notice any of it. Indeed, his mind is far away.
In interstellar space, to be exact. Frisbee is talking about how we'll
someday visit the stars with spacecraft.=20

If that sounds far out, it is, by nearly every measure you can think of =97
the tremendous distances between stars, mission trip times measured in
decades, and required technological advances so dramatic that even some
researchers refer to them as "miracles."=20


Nevertheless, there's no shortage of well-reasoned ideas about how to
conquer the NASA centers, universities, research institutions, and
companies are laying the groundwork for experiments that will advance the
necessary technologies. And while depicting trips to other stars has long
been a staple for science fiction writers, today it is the stuff of
long-range strategic goals for NASA.=20


The NASA Origins program plans a series of progressively more capable
telescopes, culminating in the imaging of Earth-like planets around the
nearest 1,000 stars. Building on that, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin has
said he wants the agency to launch interstellar missions in the next 25
years. To drive the necessary advances, "We have to set goals so tough
they hurt," Goldin has said.=20


Even at this embryonic stage, it's already more than apparent that the
task is as difficult as it could possibly be and still remain possible =97
scientists think. Start with the vast scale of the cosmos. Voyager I,
launched September 5, 1977, illustrates the scope of the problem. After
speeding along for more than 20 years, it is now 6.8 billion miles away
from Earth traveling at nearly 51,000 mph. That's about 10 light-hours
away. (A light-hour is the distance light travels in one hour at 186,000
miles per second.)=20


But the closest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri, which is 4.3
light-years, or 25 trillion miles, away. If Voyager were pointed in the
right direction, Frisbee and JPL colleague Stephanie Leifer calculate
that it would take some 74,000 years to make the trip. But interstellar
missions must occur on a human time scale =97 preferably within an
individual's lifetime. That means a maximum of 40 years for a "slow"
mission, and a far more desirable 10 years for a fast one.=20

And then there's Einstein. A spacecraft that aims to cross vast distances
at high speeds also must contend with the theory of special relativity.
The theory mandates that as an object approaches the speed of light, its
mass increases. To get to Proxima Centauri in, say 10 years, the craft
would have to whiz along at nearly half light speed. At that velocity, it
would become 1=BD times more massive than it was originally.=20


Frisbee, a chemist whose job it is to analyze such missions, puts it
another way: "If you take a 1-ton spacecraft, such as Voyager, and bring
it up to one-half the speed of light, it'll require one month's worth of
all the energy produced today by humans." Even if it were possible to
build a big enough fuel tank, conventional chemical rockets don't have
the power, or energy density, to do the job.=20


One last thing: It's one kind of propulsion requirement to get up to
speed and coast for a fly-by mission, as Voyager did to the outer planets
in our solar system. But to stop to orbit or land at an interstellar
target, the spacecraft has to expend energy to slow down. "From a
propulsion point of view," says Frisbee, "we've immediately doubled the
requirements."=20


So what's an interstellar mission planner to do? "When all is said and
done, you're kind of stuck with fusion or antimatter [for an onboard
engine]," says Frisbee. "Even fission doesn't have enough energy." The
other chief option, he says, is to leave the engine at home.
Solar-powered lasers parked in orbit around our sun, for instance, could
push craft with thin sails across space. "Right now, based on our current
level of ignorance, they're all equally impossible. . . or possible,"
says Frisbee.=20


Take antimatter, for instance. If antimatter comes in contact with
regular matter, they annihilate; the mass of both is turned into energy.
"The antimatter-matter reaction has the highest energy density we know
of," says Stephanie Leifer of JPL. The reaction releases charged
particles, which could be directed out the back of a spacecraft for
thrust using magnetic "nozzles." The charged particles move very fast,
approximately one-third the speed of light. However, says Leifer, "We
don't know how to make nozzles big enough [for an antimatter engine].
It's not totally infeasible, but it's very tough."=20


<flushright><underline><color><param>0000,0000,fefe</param>Beam-core
Engine System Concept

</color></underline></flushright> =20


Add to that another big problem. A pure antimatter engine would need
thousands of tons of antimatter, plus matter, on the order of the size of
the Washington Monument. But today, mere nanograms of antimatter are made
at special laboratories like Fermilab and CERN. "We'd probably have to
have an infrastructure in space, to harvest the antimatter," speculates
Leifer.=20


The effort might be defensible, since antimatter could be used for
medical applications like imaging and destroying certain cancer tumors.
But then there's another issue. Antimatter also can't contact matter, so
it's been difficult to store more than a tiny amount in magnetic traps,
which keep charged particles from hitting the matter containment walls
and annihilating.=20


Enter physicist Gerald Smith and his team at Penn State. Smith suggests a
way to vastly reduce the antimatter requirements. "We'll never have even
a ton of antimatter, in my view," he says. "We think we can ignite with a
microgram of antimatter, which we can foresee doing with the current
technology." Ignite what? A fusion reaction.=20


His team is attacking the problem in several fronts. First, successful
tests with a shoebox-size antimatter trap built at Penn State that could
theoretically hold 100 million antiprotons, or positively charged
particles of antimatter, have inspired researchers to build a larger one
with the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to be
finished this summer. Smith estimates it could hold 10,000 times as many
antiprotons as the smaller trap. The trap will enable eventual tests with
a planned antimatter plasma gun, which will be used to ignite the fusion
reaction.=20

Extropians,

	I'm involved in a local atheist group (Atheists of Norther
Colorado) which I've made aware of my attending Extro-4.  They are
very interrested in what's going to be discussed.  They've invited me
to give a summary of Extro-4 talk at their first meeting after the
conference.  They are working on sending out press releases announcing
this local review of this conference to all the local media.

	Given all the recent Y2K hype, and the Biotech subject this
year, I think this could generate quite a bit of local interest both
in my summary talk, and in extro-4 itself.

	Heck, I also attend the local Universal Unitarian church and
there seems to be much similar interrest there also; asking me to
hold a special meeting or class where I present extro-4 info.

	Anyway, I'm surprised how all this spontaneously comes
together and how many diverse organizations are all interrested in
hearing talks about this kind of inspiring stuff.  I just thought I'd
spread the idea of how easy and exciting this has been for me, in case
there are others of you out there involved in any kind of local
organizations where you live that might be interrested in hearing
about this kind of stuff and helping to fan the fires that are
bringing us the future.

	Looking forward to Extro-4!!

Some extropic thinkers may shudder at what life will become if nation-states
and religiosity continue to lurch toward their self-fulfilling prophecies of
totalitarian socialism and Armageddon. In this regard, caution and
responsibility may prompt us to encourage as many folks as possible to
abandon entropic manifestations of politics and theism before they kill us
all.

John,

Sorry for jumping in with some suggestions this late in the thread.  I have tried
several of the machines mentioned in 'Megabrain'.  I even owned an Endomax
around 1989-90.  Of all the machines I tried, the Grahm Potentializer was most
effective. However, I've never tried any machines since then.

At this point I favor chemicals. My current choice is SomatoPro.
Since you mentioned that you're taking some anti-depressants,
SomatoPro also seems ideally suited for that purpose.  I don't have depression
myself, so I can only speak of others experiences.  Either way, SomatoPro's effects
are immediate, and for the most part permanent.  I highly recommend you buy a
bottle and see for yourself.

Cheers,

Paul Hughes

Yeah, see, that's the sort of Extropian statement I

Actually, this has been discussed on rec.arts.sf.science, and it was said
supernovae neutrinos would be lethal in only a few AU.  See
http://www.tass-survey.org/richmond/answers/snrisks.txt
with calculations.
But conversely,
http://www.sciam.com/0496issue/0496scicit02.html
claiming stars can collapse without being supernovae, and generate enough
neutrinos to at least cause lots of cancer.

A classic suggestion.  However, interstellar space is more than big enough 
to provide protection.

A typical supernova would have a total energy output of something like 
10^44 ergs.  Applying a little basic geometry, that gives us an energy 
density of 2x10^10 ergs per square meter at a distance of 100 million 
kilometers, which will certainly do a lot of damage.  However, at a 
distance of 1 light-year (9x10^12 kilometers), the energy density drops to 
less than one erg per square meter.  That isn't even enough energy to 
damage electronics, let alone harm people.
Conclusion: Despite their reputation, supernovae are only dangerous to 
people in the same solar system.  They certainly aren't a threat to 
interstellar civilizations.

Confined as we are on Earth, I think we are a threat to each other.  
Off-world colonies, where people are free to experiment and live as they 
choose, free of all the misguided paradigms that have made our survival 
questionable in the first place, is a good place to start.  And I'm not even 
calculating the effects of a collision with an NEO.

Certainly.  Space migration using "clumsy" techology is simply a means to an 
end, and I think it will accelerate the exploratory spirit we need if we're 
going to undertake _really_ awesome ventures, like those you describe below.

I'm not this optimistic; I don't think this will happen so soon, and I'm 
hesitant to confine our future into a single (albeit progressive) 
nanotechnological basket.

I agree.  My point is: What if the civilization you're leaving behind gets 
wiped out (or wipes itself out) before it can build anything capable of 
overtaking the first expedition?  I perceive this as a very realistic problem.

This position is defensible, theoretically.  Foremost, it suffers from the 
mistaken notion that we can conjure up just about any technological fix we 
can dream up as long as we thrown enough money at it.  I'm not saying 
nanotech is improbable--far from it.  But I can just see us, working busily 
away on experimental technologies for who knows how long (and, face it, we 
really don't know how long the kind of industrial nanotech you're talking 
about is going to be in coming) when we're inundated by some hot virus, or 
hit by a meteor, or start dropping bombs--in which case our attentions will 
be diverted elsewhere and we may _never_ get off this planet (NASA's budget 
cuts aside)!

I have no problem with any of this, other than the fact that it relies on a 
particular mind-set for which we really don't have any evidence for.  It's 
one thing to plan the future, another to write it.

>This sounds like the argument of someone who waxes romantic at the idea

Don't worry.  I'm hip.

Did I ever once mention shuttle flights (at least, as they're currently being 
done)?  Unless we have serious plans to sell off obsolete chunks of orbiter 
technology to private companies (for use in near-term mining operations, 
power generation, etc.), we should build a cheap spaceplane--better yet, 
several--and stop wasting the manpower and hardware.  The shuttle program's 
main purpose is to provide jobs.  I advocate finishing the Space Station, 
certainly, and developing a base on the Moon with hopes to industrialize 
(even if said hopes become obsolete in a few decades).  I _hope_ nano comes 
first, providing us with a cheaper, more rational alternative to the methods 
we're using now--but we just don't know for certain.  

Nano or no, we'd be well served scientifically to continue a human presence 
in space.

There are good arguments either way.  I predict that we will find extant 
microbial life, but that's just me.  What's truly fascinating, ironically 
enough, is the potential of finding a _dead_ biosphere.  Mars wasn't always 
steady-state...

11 day for Mercury, that's awfully swift. How's that supposed to
happen, by building beanstalks? Mercury surface is already pretty hot
for machines to operate, it won't take too much additional insolation
to make the environment intolerably harsh.

Once the stuff is in space, and more or less dispersed, anything is
cheap. The hard part is getting a massive planetary body dispersed
without rendering it unusable. How do you do that?

I would like to see an easy way of translating power into such a
coordinated activity as planet dismantlement.

If life did get started on Mars, it will be likely that it isn't completely
"dead".  They just recently isolated the protein that bacteria manufacture
to put themselves into "stasis".  The suspicion is that it forms a structure
similar to ferritin, that sequesters iron molecules on the inside and
forms a core around which DNA can crystalize on the outside (similar to
histone molecules in eukaryotic cells).  Given the rather harsh conditions
on Mars, one would expect similar "preservation" mechanisms should have
evolved there as well.  Assuming a non-trivial biomass that may have gone
underground with the water, it is likely to still be there in a "frozen"
state.  Radioactivity will gradually wear away at crystalized DNA, but
if you had sufficient numbers when the conditions really harsh it is
likely that somewhere there should still be viable organisms.

I think you're wrong.  I seem to recall a chart, demonstrating that over
the past hundred million years or so there's been a steady increase, not
just in the size of brains, but in the ratio of brain mass to body mass.

The evolution of human intelligence had nothing to do with tool use,
IMHO.  Human intelligence was the result of social competition for
mates.  First intelligence allowed people to wind up with the best
mates.  Then, since intelligence was an advantage, women and men started
seeing intelligence as being sexually attractive - all the people who
want a "sense of humor" in their mate, for example.  This established a
positive-feedback cycle; the more desirable intelligence was, the more
successful the intelligent humans, and the greater the evolutionary
advantage to find intelligence desirable.  And because the competition
was other humans, the race never stopped.  This is the way peacocks
wound up with huge tails that require insane biological investments, or
deer bucks got unwieldy racks of antlers, and it's the way we wound up
with brains that consume 20% of our ATP (body's internal fuel).

Even so, if there was anything unnecessary about the intelligence we
have now, any way to get it more easily, then we'd evolve smaller brains
that did the same thing.  20% of ATP is a pretty penny.  I stand by my
statement that brains, wherever found on the evolutionary ladder, are
*the* most highly optimized part of the biology - with the possible
exception of immune systems.

Not really - there's a lot of complexity that's unnecessary, but can't
be evolved away because there's no gradual path from the local optimum
to the global optimum.  Like the blind spot on the retina, sort of.  Or
the relative complexity of an Interim Goal System, compared to a human
limbic system and the complex, photon-like(*) emotion-and-worldmodel event-loop.

(*) Photon - magnetic field gives rise to electrical field, electrical

You have to be kidding.  Short of grabbing random derelicts off the
street, there's simply no way you could do that.  Or were you planning
to grab random derelicts off the street?  And did I mention that by the
time you can do something like that, in secret, on one supercomputer,
much less run 6000 people on one computer and then upgrade them in
synchronization, what *I* will be doing with distributed.net will -
hell, even Eugene Leitl's genetic algorithm would Transcend at that
point.  Douglas Lenat could just rerun EURISKO.  *Spreadsheet* programs
would Transcend.

If only the Straumers had stamped "Thank you for observing all safety
precautions" on that ancient archive!  This seal of Solomon would have
kept the Blight from getting out.
You're dreaming.

Besides, there's more to uploading than scanning.  Like, the process of
upgrading to Powerdom.  How are you going to conduct those tests, hah?

This holds just as true for uploaded humans, except that being all
"messy" we're even less likely to wind up in a state remotely resembling
what we started out with.

*You* try to think like an SI.  Why do you keep on insisting on the
preservation of the wholly human emotion of selfishness?  I don't
understand how you can be so rational about everything except that! 
Yes, we'll lose bonding, honor, love, all the romantic stuff.  But not
altruism.  Altruism is the default state of intelligence.  Selfishness
takes *work*, it's a far more complex emotion.  I'm not talking about
feel-good altruism or working for the benefit of other subjectivities. 
I'm talking about the idea of doing what's right, making the correct
choice, acting on truth.  Acting so as to increase personal power
doesn't make rational sense except in terms of a greater goal.

I *know* that we'll be bugs to SIs.  I *know* they won't have any of the
emotions that are the source of cooperation in humans.  I *still* see so
many conflicting bits of reasoning and evidence that you might as well
flip a coin as ask me whether they'll be benevolent.  That's my
probability:  50%.

If Powers are hungry, why haven't they expanded continually, at
lightspeed, starting with the very first intelligent race in this
Universe?  Why haven't they eaten Earth already?  Or if Powers upload
mortals because of a mortally understandable chain of logic, so as to
encourage Singularities, why don't they encourage Singularities by
sending helper robots?  We aren't the first ones.  There are visible
galaxies so much older that they've almost burned themselves out.  I
don't see *any* reasonable interpretation of SI motives that is
consistent with observed evidence.  Even assuming all Powers commit
suicide just gives you the same damn question with respect to mortal aliens.

And, speaking of IA motivations, look at *me*.  Are my motivations
human?  Not by your definition.  That's all from some trivial little
twist in the quantitative levels of abilities... nothing qualitative.

No, *you're* the one who wants an insane SI.  Selfishness is insane. 
Anything is insane unless there's a rational reason for it, and there is
no rational reason I have ever heard of for an asymmetrical world-model.
 Using asymmetric reflective reasoning, what you would call
"subjectivity", violates Occam's Razor, the Principle of Mediocrity,
non-anthropocentrism, and... I don't think I *need* any "and" after that.

I find it hard to believe you can be that reasonable about sacrificing
all the parts of yourself, and so unreasonable about insisting that the
end result start out as you.  If two computer programs converge to
exactly the same state, does it really make a difference to you whether
the one labeled "den Otter" or "Bill Gates" is chosen for the seed?

Of course you can.  But does it really matter all that much, to either
of us, whether a given outcome happens in ten years or twenty?  What
matters is the relative probabilities of the outcomes, and trying to
slow things down may increase the probability of *your* outcome relative
to *my* outcome, but it also increases the probability of planetary
destruction relative to *either* outcome... increases it by a lot more. 
You can't selectively shoot the Yudkowsky who wants to bring about a
pure Singularity without also killing the Yudkowsky who's working on
neurosurgical intelligence enhancement and the Yudkowsky who's studying
AI motivations.

I see.  You're going to simultaneously upload six million people?  And
then upgrade them in such a way as to maintain synchronization of
intelligence at all times?  Probability:  Ze-ro.

I think you overestimate the tendency of other people to be morons. 
"Pitch in to help us develop an open-source nanotechnology package, and
we'll conquer the world, reduce you to serfdom, evolve into gods, and
crush you like bugs!"  Even "Help us bring about the end of the world in
such a way that it means something" has more memetic potential than
that.  There's a *lot* more evolution devoted to avoiding suckerhood
than lemminghood.

Why, thank you!  I rather like that metaphor.  The one about punching
holes in the ship, I mean, not the part about the life raft.  There is
no life raft.  Humanity *will* sink.  That is simply not something
subject to alteration.  Everything must either grow, or die.  If we
embrace the change, we stand the best chance of growing.  If not, we
die.  So let's punch those holes and hope we can breathe water.

Believe me, den Otter, if I were to start dividing the world's
population into two camps by level of intelligence, we wouldn't be on
the same side.  You may be high-percentile but you're still human, not human-plus-affector.

And, once again, you are being unrealistic about the way technologies
develop.  High-fidelity (much less identity-fidelity) uploading simply
isn't possible without a transhuman observer to help.  I could be wrong
about this, but I really don't think I am - not from looking at the
technology.  Again, those 6000 are suicide volunteers.  Any uploadee is
a suicide volunteer until there's an SI (whether IA or AI) to help. 
There just isn't any realistic way of becoming the One Power because a
high-fidelity transition from human to Power requires a Power to help.

Yes, but you haven't offered me better odds.  You've asked me to accept
a 1% probability of success instead.  I think you're just favoring that
1% probability because it *looks* like something you can increase, while
the probability of a friendly SI is absolute.  Well, but IMHO the
probability of a friendly IA is absolute.  And even if you can increase
the probability, you aren't going to be able to increase it to 10%.  I
think you're taking a very sentimental and unrealistic approach to
navigating the future.

Well, this is where I fundamentally disagree with you.  It comes down to
that "OR" statement you made.  I think that the second branch is much
more likely - and humanity wouldn't be any worse off than in the case of
an AI Transcend, but said Transcend becomes much less probable relative
to nuclear war or grey goo problems.  What you're overlooking is that
what counts isn't just the relative desirability of the *results* of the
two scenarios, but the relative *probability* of the two scenarios
compared to known undesirable scenarios.  An IA Transcend involves so
many constraints, preconditions, and necessities that it would need a
*huge* desirability advantage to be preferable to an AI Transcend.

As far as I can tell, your evaluation of the desirability advantage is
based solely on your absolute conviction that rationality is equivalent
to selfishness.  I've got three questions for you on that one.  First: 
Why is selfishness, an emotion implemented in the limbic system, any
less arbitrary than honor?  Second:  I know how to program altruism into
an AI; how would you program selfishness?  Third:  What the hell makes
you think you know what rationality really is, mortal?

And I think an IA Transcend has a definite probability of being less
desirable than an AI Transcend.  Even from a human perspective.  In
fact, I'll go all the way and say that from a completely selfish
viewpoint, not only would I rather trust an AI than an upload, I'd
rather trust an AI than *me*.  And I mean that from a strictly selfish
standpoint!  Human minds are too goddamn messy and they are NOT designed
to tolerate architectural changes.  The risk of destructive insanity is
far, far higher.  No matter what it is you want to preserve in an SI, it
has a better chance of being there - zero, in my opinion, but a more
plausible zero - if you put it in a clean, elegant AI instead of a messy
human conviction.  I think you're expressing a faith in the human mind
that borders on the absurd just because you happen to be human.

*Laugh*.  And he says this, of course, to the author of "Algernon's Law:
 A practical guide to intelligence enhancement using modern technology."
 Which is the *other* problem with steering a car by shooting out the
tires...  Taking potshots at me would do a lot more to cripple IA than
AI.  And, correspondingly, going on the available evidence, IAers will
tend to devote their lives to AI.

Even that one doesn't work.  Are all of your SIs upgrading themselves at
exactly the same time?  I mean, let's think about what this would
require.  It would require the *entire* human civilization to be
uploaded, and then upgraded, in such a way that *nobody*, including den
Otter, saw what was coming while still capable of desiring to avoid it. 
Maybe if you merged the entire civilization into one entity, *before*
trying it...  Yeah, that would work.  I can believe that the threshold
for collapse is sufficiently far above the threshold for not wanting to
avoid a collapse that it would take out all SIs.  So either the
civilization merges, or all the individuals upgrade at roughly the same
rate - anyway, everyone makes it to the IGS-using stage.  Some time
later - subjectively, of course - they advance to the point where they
give and die.  Okay, it sounds plausible.

Problem is, choosing to commit suicide is still a choice - and that's
not what I'm hypothesizing.  At that level, I don't have the vaguest
notion of what would really happen if an SI's goal system collapsed. 
The whole lapse-to-quiesence thing in Elisson is a design feature that
involves a deliberate tradeoff of optimization to achieve a graceful shutdown.

> Are there any other candidates.

Well, if you're interested in a not-so-known-laws-of-physics
speculation:  The various colonies achieve SI more or less
simultaneously, or unavoidably.  The first thing an SI does is leave our
Universe.  But, this requires a large-scale energetic event - like, say,
a supernova.

Still doesn't solve the Great Filter Paradox, though.  Some hivemind
races will have the willpower to avoid Singularity, period.  This
scenario takes mortals and Powers out of the picture during a
Singularity, but it doesn't account for the deliberate hunting-down that
would be needed.

-

I think the most plausible argument is this:  Every advance in
technology has advanced the technology of offense over the technology of
defense, while decreasing the cost required for global destruction. 
There are no shields against nuclear weapons - not right now, anyway -
and we've certainly managed to concentrate that power more than it's
ever been concentrated before.  In fact, the more technology advances,
the easier it becomes to cause mass destruction by *accident*.  It holds
true from nuclear weapons, to biological warefare, to the Y2K crash, to
nanotechnology.  All you really need to assume is that the trend
continues.  Eventually one guy with a basement lab can blow up the
planet and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

Ah shucks, I never get to make any outrageous claims in this group
without somebody sticking a pin in the balloon.

The basic strategy is to construct an exponentially growing array
of solar collectors that beam the power back down onto Mercury.
You could vaporize the planet completely, but I favor a strategy
of using mass drivers to hurl selected materials into space over
the entire surface of the planet. It requires nanotechnology mass
doubling times to be done in 11 days.  The surface temperature
on the sun-facing side of Mercury is below the operating temperature
of diamondoid materials.  How harsh the environment gets depends
entirely on how efficiently you can convert the incoming energy
from its "beamed" form (e.g. light, microwaves, etc.) into the
form(s) you need for mining/mass-drivers activities.  I believe
that Eric has pointed out in Nanosystems that some of these
conversions can be quite efficient.

There are two constraints on the speed:
 (a) How thin you can make the solar collectors in space.
 (b) How long it takes you to position the solar collectors on the
     far side of the sun.

There may be an additional constraint when you get to the point
where the amount of power being delivered to the planet exceeds
any possible cooling technologies.  At that point you either have
to go the vaporization route, or perhaps expand the planetary surface
area [as you point out, perhaps unintentionally, via diamondoid
beanstalks :-)].

Mass drivers or condensation of a gas at various distances from the
source.  You never render material unusable unless you let it
"escape".  Most of the techniques for moving materials around in
space were worked out in detail in the late '70's for Space Manufacturing,
Lunar Colonization & O'Neill's colonies.  The self-replicating
factories were worked out in NASA's Advanced Automation for Space
Missions study (and then forgotten...).

Last year I asked Robert Freitas (one of the authors on the NASA
study), what the advantages were for nanotech based self-replicating
factories vs. the macro-scale versions envisioned in the NASA study?
He gave a rather succinct answer that summed up the basic reason
nanoscale manufacture trumps macroscale -- "The parts count is lower".
You only need ~10-15 part-types (i.e. elements) for most nanoscale
manufacturing.  What needs to be done is the updating of all of
old designs for macro-scale self-replicating factories and
mass-drivers to nanotech based designs.  There *might* be
difficulties if some essiential element happens to be in short
supply on Mercury (though I expect substitutions could occur).

The easiest approach is to vaporize the planet and condense it.
I suspect however, that this approach wastes energy (and therefore
takes longer).  Much better is to dismantle the planet bit-by-bit
and only launch into space those materials you absolutely need
there.  I believe that if you do this cleverly, you may be able
to recapture some of the energy used to get the material out of
the gravity well either to "recast" the materials into useful
forms or provide the deltaV required to move the materials into
more useful orbits.

The basic approach I've developed works with the asteroids too but
I think it takes longer because the solar insolation is lower at
most asteroid orbital distances.

If you are really interested in the nuts & bolts, I've got rough
draft paper at:
  http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/PlntDssmbly.html
Constructive comments would be welcomed.

I've also got a C program that does a "brute force" simulation of
a planetary disassembly using exponentially growing energy availability
if anyone wants to tinker with it.  If anyone is good with graphics
adding "visual" output would make this a great toy.  It takes apart
the small planets quite quickly, while Jupiter takes many CPU hours.
Of course, IMHO, simulating taking apart Jupiter *has* to be a better
use of excess CPU cycles compared to certain *other* recently discussed
uses of such resources...

Isaac Asimov wrote an article once about the advantages of taking the
planets apart.  He was thinking in terms of living room, not being
exposed to modern ideas, but the same general principle applies for
most uses of matter.  You can do a lot more with it if you spread it
out to where you can get at it.

He envisioned all the bodies in the solar system being torn apart,
one by one, and put to use, except for one: Earth, preserved for
sentimental reasons.  Eventually the economic pressures become too
great, and finally a fleet of disassemblers converges on Earth itself,
the jewel of the solar system, to be converted to dust and useful matter.
It was quite a moving description.

I have trouble getting a clear understanding of what the "parts" are
in nanotech.  Most workers in the field will explain that they aren't
literally planning on putting things together atom by atom.  Rather,
there will be molecular building blocks and complex work sequences
which can assemble a wide variety of useful structures.  So I think
it is misleading to think of nanotech as having only a few "parts".
I gather that there will be a large number of building block molecules
and modification enzymes (which act as tools) which will have to be
brought into play in the proper sequence in order to construct materials.

Where these building blocks and tools come from is not clear, but I
gather that conventional, bulk chemistry would be involved.  A nanotech
assembler will have to be part of a relatively large and complicated
system which produces the wide variety of feed stocks that it needs to
perform its tasks.

Read it, re-read it, has potential, been there, done that.  A design is
just a design.  The real question is - will it work?  You don't know that,
you can't prove it, because until it actually *is* working, you have
no proof.  At this point it's nothing more than a self-consistent piece
of computational and logical poetry.  Interesting, original, fun to read,
but utterly useless until it can actually be applied to *do* something.

KILLER FUNGUS TOUTED TO ERADICATE STATE POT CROP

Florida's drug czar favors testing the fungus. State scientists fear it
could run amok on crops other than marijuana.

By JULIE HAUSERMAN

TALLAHASSEE -- There's a killer fungus among us, and Florida's new drug czar
Jim McDonough hopes to one day let it loose to murder the state's illegal
marijuana crops.

Only one problem: Scientists at the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection fear the fungus could mutate, spread and kill off everything from
tomatoes to endangered plants.

McDonough, who came to Florida to join Gov. Jeb Bush's administration after
working for White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, has been holding meetings
in Tallahassee to try to get state agencies on board with the idea of
testing Fusarium oxysporum, a co-called "'mycoherbicide," in Florida.

"'It's not been used yet," McDonough said, adding that if Florida were to
test the soil-borne fungus, it would do so in a state quarantine facility in
Gainesville, where researchers isolate citrus canker and other plant
diseases. Before it could ever be released, it would need extensive review.

The Montana company that is developing the killer fungus, Ag/Bio Con., gave
state officials literature saying the fungus "does not affect animals,
humans or any other crops."

DEP scientists reached a far different conclusion: "It is difficult, if not
impossible, to control the spread of Fusarium species," DEP Secretary David
Struhs wrote in a letter to McDonough. "The inability to guarantee that the
organism will not mutate and attack other plant species is of most concern.

"Mutation of the organism would not only threaten Florida's natural
environment, but would also put at risk our economically vital agricultural
industry."

Florida's warm soils, Struhs wrote, could make the mutation worse. The
fungus can remain in the soil for as long as 40 years.

"Without considerably more information to address the concerns noted above,"
Struhs wrote, "I strongly recommend that Florida not proceed further with
this proposal."

McDonough followed up with a letter to Struhs and Agriculture Commissioner
Bob Crawford: "Before we conclude that it cannot be done," McDonough wrote,
"let us take every opportunity to consider how it might be done safely."

In June, both Struhs and Crawford signed off on the idea of quarantine
testing in Gainesville, and that's as far as the proposal has gone.
McDonough said he has not pitched the idea to Gov. Jeb Bush.

McDonough has the backing of U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Longwood, who called
mycoherbicides the "silver bullet" in the war on drugs. McCollum and U.S.
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., helped push for $23-million that Congress
appropriated this year to eradicate plants that provide the raw material for
cocaine, heroin and marijuana. The money is earmarked for research in
foreign countries, but McDonough wants to see if he can get some of the
funds for Florida.

Tim Moore, commissioner for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said
the fungus could be a valuable addition to the state's anti-drug arsenal, as
long as tests prove it is safe.

Another supporter is Betty Sembler of St. Petersburg, wife of developer Mel
Sembler, one of the Republican party's biggest fund-raisers. Mrs. Sembler is
an anti-drug activist who founded the group Drug Free America. She says she
supports the idea of using bio-control on drug crops because she thinks it
is a better than spraying pesticides like Paraquat.

Information provided by McCollum's office says, "There is no danger to the
environment."

An old Florida story

Government foresters once spread the seeds of Australian melaleuca trees
over the Everglades to help drain the swamp. Now, decades later, the state
is waging a chemical and biological war against the noxious trees. Like
arboreal shock troops, melaleuca trees have marched through the Everglades,
draining wetlands years after the state decided that the Everglades were
better off wet in the first place

Kudzu, a Chinese vine, was distributed by the government to control erosion
in the 1920s and soon became a botanical bully, growing as much as a foot
per day.

Water hyacinth, a plague in Florida lakes and rivers, was carried into the
state by a woman who lived near Palatka. She saw the pretty floating flower
at the World's Fair in New Orleans and brought it home to put in her fish
pond. It spread, and now the state spends millions of tax dollars to spray
pesticides into the water.

In fact, Florida is so concerned about the spread of exotic plants that,
last year, the Legislature more than doubled the amount of money set aside
to battle botanical invaders on state lands during the next decade.

"Our concern (with McDonough's proposal) is that we don't want to move
forward with anything that creates more problems than it solves," said Jerry
Brooks, assistant director of the DEP's division of water resources.

Florida's pot crop

On an average year, the state confiscates about 100,000 plants, Broadway
said.

North Florida typically has the biggest pot crops. But statewide, urban
indoor growers have been harvesting more and more of Florida's homegrown
cannabis.

Last year, FDLE only confiscated about 55,000 plants, because drought and
wildfires sent growers indoors. Pinellas County was second to Miami-Dade
County in pot-growing arrests and indoor growing operations last year.
Spreading a killer fungus wouldn't put a dent in the indoor crop, which is
providing increasingly potent strains of marijuana.

Predictably, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws said
McDonough is proposing to use a sledgehammer to kill a flea.

"'It looked like they wanted to debut these (mycoherbicides) in South
America, but the governments down there didn't want any part of it. They
didn't want to be America's guinea pigs," said Paul Armentano, a spokesman
for NORML in Washington. "I'm pretty shocked to hear that someone would
suggest testing this in an American state."

But McDonough says Florida is the ideal place to test the fungus.

"Unfortunately, we have a wonderful climate and a wonderful soil for growing
marijuana," said McDonough. "I'm concerned about the supply. Florida is off
the map in its marijuana usage. It is not a benign drug. It is a dangerous
drug."

FDLE Commissioner Moore agreed: "If there's some proven, safe way to augment
our efforts to keep marijuana and its associated miseries off the street,
then I'd support it."

I'd like to let loose a killer virus that only targets zombified programmed
morons such as those that come up with the above insane witch-hunting crap.
The world would sure be a better place if I could replace the 5 billion or

it now....cooooool man.

We weren't talking about usefulness.  You said that since nobody had
designed an AI, nobody knows what it'll take to build one.  I designed
an AI.  I have some kind of vague idea of what it'll take to build it. 
That's all I'm trying to say.  My estimate may be wrong, but there's
nothing absurd "to the point of self-contradiction" about my making one.

Or are you seriously suggesting that I should try to write and run the
entire AI before even *trying* to estimate the hardware required?  The
quantity and architecture of hardware *available* is a major factor in
software design.  Yes, we'll have a much better idea of what it takes to
run an AI after the first version fails - but I still have to guess,
now, with what I know now.

BTW, my estimate is 1e17 ops/sec on CPU-like architectures.

Eric is pretty clear in Nanosystems, that the feedstock for diamondoid
materials would be small molecule hydrocarbons, such as acetone or
alcohols.  You could probably use methane/ethane/propane, as well.
Ralph Merkle has done the most work trying to define assembler chemistries.
See: "A proposed "metabolism" for a hydrocarbon assembler":
  http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html

Ultimately, nanotechnology & biotechnology are reduced to a very small
number of "parts".  A few dozen elements make up almost all organisms
and 5 elements form the bulk of the material (H, O, C, N, S).  Even
if you go up to the next level: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids;
most of the activity revolves around 30-40 major molecules and their
assembly precursors or breakdown products. Where biochemistry gets
really complicated is when you start talking about enzymes that manage
the reactions.  Still, it looks like you can produce a minimal
self-replicating bacteria "nanomachine" with something in the
neighborhood of ~300 genes.  These bacteria have to live in a 
"rich" environment (inside other cells) where many of the building
blocks can be sucked up from the surroundings.

The earliest namomachines will probably be built out of diamondoid
materials so only a couple of types feedstock molecules will probably be
required.  Eric's designs for pumps & gears only have 8 different elements
in them, so I would expect that on the order of a dozen feedstock "molecules"
could build most nanomachines.  It isn't clear at this point whether
different source molecules would be required for "displacing" an atom from
the source onto the target (depending on the adjoining atom types,
valence states, bonding strengths, etc.).  It is distinctly possible
that this might be required.

The general approaches I've seen for bottom-up assembly *do* envision
assembling structures atom-by-atom, this is the only way to get the
atomic structure exact.  This *is* the way it is done in biology with
the possible exception that enzyme systems don't break things down
any more than is necessary.  I suspect that "mature" nanoassembly,
would take approaches that are similar (e.g. force the addition of a
10 carbon atoms from decane onto a diamond crystal in one shot, rather
than adding them one by one from methane).  This just takes a more
complex jig to hold the molecule and apply any energy needed to push
through the transition state.

The feedstock molecules would generally be assembled by bulk chemistry,
Enzymes might play a role in feedstock assembly because they could be more
energy efficient.  I doubt you will see "enzymes" (i.e. amino-acid based
proteins) used in the actual assembly of hard-nanotech (diamond/sapphire).
Enzymes are designed to function in water while hard-nanotech assembly
is typically described as being done in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.

I would agree that the assembly of macro-sized objects from nanoassembly
will be a complex systems engineering task.  However, the assemblers
for nanostructures themselves should not be very large (I think
Eric's nanoassembler design is a few million atoms.  Small compared
to some of the designs for nano-cells that Robert Freitas has done.
Nano-cytes run 1-10 billion atoms).   The feed stocks, as mentioned
above, should be fairly limited and they can probably be generated
"in-line" from simple sources (e.g. from Air (C/N), water (H) and
dirt (Al/Si/S) if enough energy is available.

You might want to keep in mind that we do primitive nanoassembly today
in DNA and Protein synthesizers.  A DNA synthesizer requires 6-8 bottles
of reagents and a Protein synthesizer requires 25-30 bottles.
Since we don't have the tools to mainipulate individual molecules
in biotechnology this assembly typically occurs at the micro-mole
scale (~10^17 molecules).  Interestingly enough one of the major
barriers to working at smaller scales is keeping the water containing
the sample from evaporating.

My hideous actions still truly shame me, and will probably haunt me for
decades to come.  As a token offer of compensation (not that i'm
pretending that any action by my worthless self could possibly compensate
for the deep scars my past writings have surely caused), i hereby promise
to donate, at my SI graduation party, either a full millisecond of
processing time for each of the list's members' favourite meme (limit of
one per original current members of the list, no copies), or a lovely pink
set of goo-proof tupperware (limited offer, available till not available,
perfect way to carry around your oranges and other brain modules).  I look
upon your magnamious selves to grant me at least a partial pardon on any
punishments, all of which i most surely deserve, that are currently
ordained as a sign of your grandiosity, taking into account my above
stated humble offer and my further promise that i am a reformed worm and
that it (i will not speak its horrific name) will never happen again.  
And, please Michael, don't shoot my kneecaps off. 
Yours ashamedly,

Regarding the Gamma Ray Burst as a source of destruction in general and
extinction per this thread in particular:

The latest issue of Scientific American has an article on GRB's (the cover
article in fact), according to which (the latest theory) the bursts are
part of a hypernova explosion of stars larger than 35 solar masses, and are
tightly confined "jets" directed axially outward, north and south, along
the axis of rotation.  According to this model, the grb's are detectable by
us only when the distant hypernova is oriented so that the axis of rotation
points more or less directly at the earth.  (Presumably in a galaxy so
oriented but safely distant.)  Also the total energy released is
substantially smaller when "the signal" we see is the result of axial jets,
than it would be if it were at that same level in all radial directions.    

If it should turn out that the axes of rotation of stars in a galaxy are
mostly aligned with the axis of  rotation of the galaxy itself, then the
grb jets will mostly be directed out of the plane of the ecliptic into
relatively "empty" space, and only a very few stars radially nearby or
those immediately above or below in the galactic disc will be subject to
obliteration.

Thus, according to this model of grb's, the destruction wrought on the
local galaxy should be substantially less than previously predicted.

I know.  But if they all have the same hoghly optimized cognitive 
architecture by the time they reach this point, and it happens to give a 
similar result, then we could actually get the whole civilization to shut 
down.  Of course, that still leaves eveyone's automation running, and a lot 
of it is likely to be sentient...

No, I don't think it could really happen either.  The whole scenario is 
just too contrived, and it definitely requires that the target civilization 
make mistakes (which isn't exactly a guide to useful thought when you're 
talking about SIs).  However, it beats anything else I've seen.  Killing 
off a civilization like this without sterilizing the universe is pretty 
hard to do.

Maybe.  But I think your example is an artifact of the nature of our recent 
historical situation.  Nuclear weapons are a superweapon primarily because 
we can't disperse ourselves properly (Earth being too small for that 
purpose), and biological weapons have mass-destruction potential because we 
can't improve our immune systems.

If we were going to have a future without AI/IA, I think it is clear that 
these trends would reverse within a century.  Spreading into interplanetary 
space would give us plenty of room to build economical defenses against 
nuclear weapons, and the combination of sealed environments and competent 
genetic engineering would make bioweapons a very limited threat. 
 Evaluating the potential of nanotechnology is always tricky, but I think 
it actually ends up giving the defender a substantial advantage once it 
reaches a reasonable level of maturity.

IMO, the hard part is surviving the transition period we are currently in, 
where we have increasingly advanced destructive technologies but there is 
no room in which to deploy countermeasures.

Why are we having a rash of hoax science articles in Extropians for the last

Yes, this was a very interesting article (unfortunately not available on
line), which suggests that they are close to getting a good model for
GRBs as super-intense supernovas which form black holes.  What some consider
the "smoking gun" was the discovery that a GRB left behind what seems to
have been a supernova.

Essentially what happens is that when a sufficiently massive star goes
supernova, the force of the explosion is unable to drive the mass of the
star to escape velocity.  The stellar material falls back and leads to
the formation of a black hole.  An accretion disk forms in the process
blocking radiation from escaping anywhere but the poles.  The actual
gamma rays are formed when high energy particles (neutrinos, I think)
run into slower matter, either the interstellar medium or gas ejected
earlier by the star.

I think, although the article did not say this, that this is essentially
the classical model for how stellar black holes would be formed.  So it
seems that GRBs are a byproduct of black hole formation.

I don't know about this alignment theory.  The Milky Way is in the plane
of the galactic disk, but I don't believe it is aligned with the ecliptic
(the plane of the planets' orbits).

Yes, it should only affect those stars along the direction of the beam.
I saw something in another article suggesting that the beam was extremely
narrow, a small fraction of a degree, but this article indicated that
more work was needed to determine the width.

While reading "The Demon-haunted World" by Carl Sagan. I came
across this line: " Are there humans populating innumerable other
planets, as the Latter Day Saints teach?" (page 275 in paperback).

I guess that explains their interest in SETI.

I'm convinced of one thing, there's far more intelligence out there
in the universe than there is in congress.

Ok, what I am trying to say is there is no way to prove any AI design
can approximate human intelligence until we actually do so.  Your design
could show promise however if you manage to actually build a seed-AI
that maximizes its intelligence within the limited hardware we now have
available.  So the question, assuming you are correct is what kind of
artificial intelligence could we run on an existing pentium III?  An ant?
A chicken?  If you could do that, I would be very impressed. :-)
Not only would you prove that your seed-AI has empirical merit, but
you would present convincing evidence that the only remaining
bottleneck is speed.

I guess will see.

I agree. Why waste the benefits of diversity and *unique* informational
structures (us) in the sole pursuit of more raw materials for computronium?
However one must consider that it might be more efficient for them
to deconstruct us using a destructive upload, and use our
informational strucutures for their convenience rather than ours? The benifts
could be equal as far as they are concerned - yet for us it is either our
extinction as individuals or at the very least our utter mental enslavement.
I'm not willing to risk my life on the hope that SI are benevolent in exactly
the way I want them to be.  Regardless of anything else, thats a completely
reckless attitue towards our future.

I agree with this sentiment completely, but what could this
position of strength possibly be? That *is* the $1 million
dollar question. IMHO the answer is our own Intelligence Augmentation.
But as Eli and others are claiming AI will always be ahead
of IA unless they *are* benevolent.

I would really like to hear your thoughts on this Max.

Because the atoms of your body could crank a lot more of diversity
much more quickly than they do right now if rearranged
properly. That's the rational agenda, in case the entity which devours
you happens to be rational.

Energy density is not a realistic measure of danger. If the energy is in the
form of infrared photons there is no problem, an equal amount of energy
in the form of X rays or Gamma rays and there is is a problem. The sinister thing
about neutrinos is that there is no way to hide from them and most of the energy
in a supernova is released in the form of neutrinos. About 20 neutrino's
were detected from the 1987 supernova in a thousand ton tank of water and it was
about 200,000 light years away. The numbers I'm using are from memory but I
don't think they're too far off.  If it were 6 or 7 light years away, that's 30,000 times
closer, and the flux would be about a billion times greater.  Thus a 200 pound man
would receive absorb about 2 million neutrons. A neutrino on the very rare times
it hit something would do a lot more damage than the more usual types of radiation
like ionizing photons or high speed electrons or protons, it would be almost as damaging
as an alpha particle. Usually such a hit would kill the cell it happened in and 2 million
dead cells wouldn't be much of a problem for a large animal like a human, but sometimes
the cell wouldn't die but become mutated and that's not good. Natural radiation
is probably a major cause of cancer and in this case you'd be receiving a massive
dose in less than a second.

I don't think a neurophysiologist will have very much to tell you

all.

If you want to address the issue at molecular level of detail you're
facing two problem domains: system representation (scratchpad with
lots of numbers on it) and system evolution, i.e. the laws which make
it tick. Both require "logic gates" for implementation. If you attach
an instance of the physical law implementing circuitry to each atom
representation unit (the really smart memory scenario), wiring the
result in a 3d lattice you'd obviously achive the fastest possible
execution time but have the highest possible redundancy to pay. If you
have just one instance of physical law engine to serve 10^9 or more
atom coding units you're obviously very far away from realtime. My
(more or less educated) guess is that one needs somewhen from
10^3..10^6 transistor equivalents for the physical law engine if one
does it the digital physics way (in current lingo, aka integer lattice
gas with a complicated rule, check it out on http://xxx.lanl.gov ).

Unless the mind requires nonabstractable quantum level weirdness to
operate, this brute force approach would obviously work. At maximum
redundancy/maximum speed implementation scenario we're talking about
roughly 1 cubic micron molecular circuitry for each atom, with 1 ns..1
ps ticks being equivalent to 1-2 fs real time.

If you do the numbers you will notice that this is nothing like a
sugarcube, and is not exactly running factor 10^9 superrealtime.

Of course we don't need molecular level of detail to run an upload,
that's quite absurd. Beefed-up compartmental modelling is probably
sufficient, so a complex cellular-level model fed with real
neuroanatomy data would probably suffice. This is a far cry from the
molecular dynamics level, yet would require about the same amount of
complexity (within two orders of magnitude in the currency of
circuitry) as the brute force MD approach.

There might be higher abstraction levels, but just what they will be
is currently difficult to tell (probably system state space
dynamics/attractor level), and it is not at all obvious how to
translate the digitized neuroanatomy (scanned wetware, in cheesy
cyberspeak) into that higher level encoding.

This is not done this way. One just needs a set of parameters for each
new class of molecules. In theory a single universal forcefield would
suffice, and people are currently working on developing these (which
automagically invoke the QM level and fit parameters whenever they
don't have the knowledge in the database already), so these are maybe
5-10 years away.

Right now we can more or less easily simulate 10^9 particle system
with short-range potential (otherwise know as forcefield) on best
modern mainframes. Assuming digital physics tricks as above (most
simulation people would disagree when currently asked, but they're
obviously turkeys) it is very much conceivable to model a cubic micron
or slighlty more of biological tissue on a temporal domain of 1 ns...1
us with end-of-the line silicon (i.e. when Moore has saturated in 2d
photolitho). We're talking about runtime of ~1 year of a big box of
end-Moore silicon here, so don't phone your local computing center
operator yet.

The connectivity has little to do with parallelism: you can simulate a
parallel system on a perfectly sequential machine. Of course it has
everything to do with performance. So one needs at least one
processing instance/biological neuron, if not several.

Waste of space, not of time. And make no mistake: we're not talking
about programs here. We're strictly on dedicated hardware train here,
several of these babies allocated to each neuron. You're in dire
trouble when you try to assign significant number of neurons to a
single processor: there are many orders of magnitude hidden in their
wetware parallelism.

Data is not a problem: molecular memories are damn dense. The real
problem is how quickly you can mangle these data.

The underlying hardware must have obviously modest to mid connectivity
due to constraints derived from physics of computation, but the switch
topology has very little to do with the original layout of wetware
circuitry. We're at the emulation level, the physical level is here
visible only dimly (essentially, as signalling latency).

Well, in principle all you need is a really accurate MD forcefield and
the full structural data. It would be impractical, but in theory it
would work, and with very little code at that.

Well, I keep repeating it over and over, but apparently people either
don't listen or keep forgetting it. You can't specify a true AI, we're
not smart enough for that by far (even you, Eliezer). But we know that
AI solves problems, and it is comparatively easy to evaluate individua
according to their task solving performance. You need a testing
framework, and a darwin in machina framework, and really monstrous
power to run it (that's why you probably need nano). One starts on a
small scale, feeding trivial problems to trivial systems first. As an
analogy, our neurons are not much different from that of many other
animals, and even evolutionary old animals. It's all in the details of
several hundred classes, and how they are assembled. Of course nothing
prevents us from inserting what we think is useful into the pool
manually (i.e. we insert a protoneuron into a sea of cells). It will
of course get blown away eventually, but we're saving time since not
having to reinvent the wheel.

I'm not saying my approach will work, I'm saying why other approaches
are imo doomed, and outline a model without their listed
shortcomings. If you have a new, better suggestion how to bootstrap AI
I'm all ears.

No one will argue with that, I think. But of course nobody requires
you to produce the complexity by hand. You being there didn't require
having a creator either.

Oh, I realize that. It is just that Mercury already receives quite a
lot of radiation. Even if you increase the amount if incoming power by
one order of magnitude (doubtful the more delicate structures can
survive it), does it really allow the dismanting process to complete
in just 11 d? You must be hiding at least a few big envelopes back

Vaporization is sure easy, but I do not see a way to recapture the
material quantitatively. The point is not destruction, the point is
retaining the bulk of the material (especially volatiles) for
constructive purposes.

You could carry off some energy as hot cargo, but how much can you

I don't think these are relevant questions. The bottleneck is

Yes, and it is a very stringent constraint indeed. Either you have

It was most assuredly intentional. It is difficult to envision more
efficient launch mechanisms than launching from top of beanstalks (and
a large beanstalk sees mostly 4 K space, not Mercury surface, and,
well, some of Sun's), Mercury is probably small enough for them (and
doesn't have an atmosphere).

Energy is cheap, very cheap. A 0.1 um metal foil would reflect ~95% of
incoming radiation. One needs to tranform the planet into a fleet of
solar sailers which try to keep the original body in focus. The higher
the initial insolation the faster the initial growth. Difficult to do
that trick with Pluto.

Once again, energy is not a problem. The Sun produces sufficient
amounts of power that it is difficult to get enough material to make
the computers -- and then there is lots of fusable hydrogen out there
in the Oort.

Asteroids are fundamentally much easier, because the volume/surface
ratio and absolute gravitation are not an issue. There is even no need
to launch, just transfer material to the rim, which flattens things
and increases surface along with launching mirrors/building rectenna
arrays/microwave beamers. The only minus is that most of them reside
beyond Mars' orbit, but that just delays the matters somewhat if you
have to start from a microgram seed.

I am not sure how you can integrate the multiple factors of surface

FACE IMAGING OPPORTUNITIES IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER 1999

Recent calculations give dates and times

July 28, 1999

Based on current orbital elements recently released by JPL, an SPSR 
correspondent has discovered that overhead flybys of the Face at Cydonia 
will occur once in August and again in November 1999. The data indicates 
that the ground track repeat cycle is 59.04 km (exactly 1 degree of 
longitude at the equator), and the orbital period is 1.949389 hours. 
Calculated from this data, the next two Cydonia fly-overs should occur 
on Orbit 742 and Orbit 1811 after the June 27, 1999 City Pyramid Orbit. 
The first takes place on August 26, 1999 at 17:07 GMT. The second will 
occur on November 21, 1999 at 13:14 GMT. The single image of the Face 
taken in April 1998, because of spacecraft angle and poor weather 
conditions, is not adequate for a satisfactory result as far as the qu
estion of possible artificiality is concerned. The flyovers in August 
and November should deliver better data, as the sun angle and the camera 
position will be optimal. Therefore images of the Face during these two 
opportunities would be of great scientific value. We urge interested 
parties to write to NASA, JPL, and Malin Space Science Systems, 
requesting images be taken of the Face on each of these two dates.

Which only affects those on one side of the planet. Anyone on the dark
nappytime side just has to deal with a worldwide tsunami, assuming the
entire atmosphere hasn't already been stripped off by the swelling
effects of the late red giant stage prior to the supernova.

If you are dealing with an interstellar civilization, its all a matter
of what size civilization we are talking about. Its amazing what a
couple thousand light years and the dust and gas in between can do to
reduce your risk of GRB related skin cancers.

No need to apologize and I don't really disagree with you as a matter of 
principle. It's just that my personal prejudices on this subject are fairly 
well known, as I've been discussing them here lately.  When I was younger, I 
followed the space program the way most kids followed sports and the 
astronauts were to me what the Dallas Cowboys were to my playmates.  You'd 
get the same touchy reaction from most men my age who grew up in Texas if you 
dissed Don Meredith.  On a rational level, I'm fully aware of how 
"artificial" the whole process was, but when Neal Armstrong put his bootprint 
in the dust of Mare Tranquilitas he won what for me was the ultimate 
Superbowl.

There is a deeper issue here, though, which we've discussed in the "Big 
Science/Big Government" thread some time back.  Government subsidies ARE like 
a drug, but the question is whether going cold turkey at a particular time 
can do more harm than good.  The fact is that the current NASA administration 
HAS engaged in a serious program of "reform", and Dan Goldin has made 
"smaller, faster, cheaper" into an effective motto that has yielded positive 
science and technology goals.  I want to see space science weaned from the 
corrupting influence of government support as quickly as possible, but I 
WOULD like to avoid destroying the life work of a whole generation of space 
scientists in the process.

I've read about half of it (it keeps getting stuck in the middle of
the "too finish" stack).  It is clear that parallel processing will
be an important part of any AI/IA.  The interesting thing about
parallel/distributed processing is that it driven by two factors
(a) economics -- you can't make "big" perfect chips, and (b)
themodynamics -- you can't make the computronium really "dense"
without melting it.  It is doubtful that we would have willingly
engaged in parallel processing if we hadn't been pushed into it
by these constraints.

The interesting thing from my perspective is the variety of computing
architectures/algorithms that seem to be developing (Harvard, 
cellular automata, neural nets, genetic algorithms, quantum computing,
reconfigurable -- that seem to be useful for a variety of specific
tasks (controlled sequencing, reality simulations, learning, evolution,
factoring, adaptability [respectively]).  Parallel processing simply
makes most or all of these approaches much more powerful.  The interesting
thing about the architecture of the brain would seem to be the *huge*
amount of asynchronous [subconscious] parallel processing that is
occuring.  This only gets noticed/integrated at the very highest levels.
That bodes well for AI since it means that complex problems can be
broken down into lots of simple problems that can be programmed/processed/
solved at levels we can easily comprehend.  The algorithms to do
the results "merging" and "selection" are *not* going to be
fun however.

I've got some questions re: mental processing.  After reading Calvin's
books on survival/evolution/selection of ideas in the brain, I have
been mentally attempting to verify these ideas to some degree.
I will be doing something that doesn't require "complete attention"
such as reading a book.   I'll then get a little "tickle" in my mind
about an "inconsistancy" or something that "doesn't make sense".
I've got myself trained sufficiently to let these thoughts "bubble"
to the surface, and when they do, I realize that it is something
*totally* unrelated to what I've been reading.  The degree of
disconnectedness between my conscious attention stream and
unconscious thoughts is sometimes rather shocking.

Does anyone else have experiences like this?  Are male/female
patterns consistantly different in these areas [i.e. males
are more uniformly single-minded while females are more
multi-minded?].  Finally, on a rather scarey note, if I
continue to reinforce the entertainment of random subconscious
thoughts, could this lead to schizophrenia?

I agree with Eugene's atomic argument, but I would probably disagree
regarding the motivations of "rational entities".  This goes back to
the whole question of "Why do we still see stars?".  I think it revolves
around the fact that there are diminishing returns on any strategy
if carried out to its ultimate limits.  In the example of the
conversion of a solar system into computronium -- you get a *huge*
jump by simply disassembling a single planet to harvest the full
solar output. [~10^13 increase [earth-power output -> sun-power
output]).  You get ~10^8 increase in computation density by going to
nanotechnology (~10^5 more IPS in ~10^3 less volume).  Disassembling
most of the other planets may only get you a factor of ~3-4 in terms
of increased computational capacity [due to the fact that a multi-layer
Matrioshka Brain has diminishing returns with additional layers].
The extra material does help in terms of long-term memory storage
capacity, but it isn't clear at this point whether this is really
needed [you have to make an argument that there is some "rational"
purpose to remembering many details non-essential to survival].

Once you have gained something like 10^21 in processing capacity,
the gains of "re-engineering humans" are going to be so far down
on the scale that they will likely not merit much consideration.
The *real* issues are *what* do you think about and *what* is the
optimal computing architecture to use to do that.  Earth is
far more likely to get removed because it stands in the line-of-sight
for a highly parallel commuication lasers between to computation nodes
than it is because the SI needs us measly earthlings for computronium.
Given the tradeoff between bouncing the beams around the Earth
(relative to all the other communication delays in a MBrain) and
nostalgic attachment to Earth, I would think that "saving" Earth wins.

But I can't promise that this would be the case... Much depends on
how much of the MBrain is uploaded human consciousness vs.
self-evolved AI.

I don't know if this is some kind of deranged running gag, or Eugene is
running multiple versions, all of whom need separate explanations, but,
for the record, yet again:  I do not believe in conservative AI.  Not
everyone who refuses to believe in neural networks believes in
conservative AI.  The people who've been doing AI over the last fifty
years, and have partitioned it into classical and connectionist, did not
exactly exhaust the problem space.  Classical and connectionist AI are
simply two sides of the same coin.

The wordcraft and imagination at play in this collection of 20 SF stories by
Australian writers is quite extraordinary. The book is full of gorgeously
imagined scenes on a transgalactic scale and challenging extrapolations of
cutting-edge science. Hidden in the grandeur are meditations on the meaning of
reality (Greg Egan's "Wang's Carpets"), motherhood (Rosaleen Love's "The Total
Devotion Machine" and Shane Dix's "Matters of Consequence"), the social worth
of religions (editor Broderick's own "The Magi") and gender dominance (a
future lesbian society in Lucy Sussex's "My Lady Tongue," menstrual sacraments
on an alternate world in Stephen Dedman's Swiftian "From Whom All Blessings
Flow"). The question of tolerance comes up again and again: Islamic zealots
encode the Qur'an in their DNA in Chris Lawson's "Written in Blood";
lumpen-loving ideologues take on the bodies of the underclass via a genetic
lottery in Booker Prize-winner Peter Carey's intimately human and poetic "The
Chance." George Turner's classic "F lowering Mandrake" pits a plant-descended
"green-blood" against xenophobic Earthmen. There is enough of the quotidian,
charming and homey to ground all this exotica, and there are a few neat japes,
like David Lake's unique tale of time travel gone wrong, "Re-deem the Time." A
few clunkers appear as well, but no stiff prose, no cloddish info-dumps.
Broderick's introduction is itself a fine and illuminating piece of writing,
and his and Hartwell's author profiles are unusually personal. It may arise
from Down Under, but this anthology is a world-class treasure. (July)

Well, Eugene raises some interesting points.  I believe there
are solutions for his objections.  Discussion follows --

The problem revolves around how "efficiently" you can convert
the incoming power to a useful form (avoiding the production of
heat).  If you beamed the power back with diode lasers at say
520 nm, this is a particularly efficient absorption band for
CCDs (or equivalent photovoltaic) structures.  I would think
that you get a minimum of 70% perhaps up to 90% conversion
efficiency (light to electricity).  Traditional PV conversion
efficiencies are taken for the entire black-body spectrum of
radiation (which is why they are so low).  You could also beam the
energy back in a wide-band form and heat "boilers" to very
high temperatures (1500-3000 C probably depending on materials).
The gas vapor pressure could be converted directly into mechanical
energy for moving materials around or powering turbines.  The
thermodynamic efficiency of boilers operating at these high
temperatures is quite high.

I suspect that if you had the energy coming in at a very specific
wavelength, you could construct receivers with just the right
thickness and bandgap so that "virtually" all of the photons
are absorbed and generate electrons.   What you would really
want is a structure that allowed the electrons to be immediately
moved from the PV conversion material into a superconductor.

You still have a problem of where to sink the waste heat.  There
are two solutions to this -- the planet and space.  The planet
turns out to be a good starting point.  As you put more heat
into the planet it becomes much easier to dismantle.  In my
calculations for dismantlement I assume a very conservative value
that requires breaking every atomic bond in the planet.  If you
pump a lot of heat into the planet, it becomes soft enough to
"flow", then you  might centrifuge it to seperate the elements
(or as RF points out in Nanomedicine, you could "weigh" each
molecule).  Then you "pump" the desired elements into containers
on the mass drivers and launch it into space.  This saves a lot
of energy over breaking all of the atomic bonds.

The other possibility is radiating the excess heat into space.
Diamond makes a great conductor and carefully engineered surfaces
can be > 99% efficient at radiating the heat (see also below).
It is worth remembering that only the sun-side of Mercury is hot.
The non-sun side is pretty cold and it is thought that ice may
exist in sheltered craters at the poles (just like on the moon).

You start with vaporization points on the planet, surrounded by
a much larger (thin) condensation surface (that radiates the
heat into space.  The vapor coming off the planet condenses
onto the cooler surfaces and is then manipulated into ever larger
condesation surfaces.  You could envision successive layers of condensation
meshs/grids that are heated by the gas mixture but are cool enough to
condense specific elements.  As the distance from the planet increases,
elements condense at lower and lower temperatures.  This is not
too much different from how the solar system actually formed.

The thing is that using nanotechnology, you can "grow" the surface
and therefore the radiator power.  You put the radiator panels
on top of diamondoid beanstalks.  You grow the diamonoid beanstalks
from the bottom, circulating cooling fluid up through the stalks and
and through the radiators.  The surface, keeps expanding outward as
the heat dissipation requirements increase.  There are holes in the
radiators that allow the high density energy to be beamed through the
radiators down to the surface.  [Or a really clever design merges
the MW/PV energy absorbers/converters with the radiators].

Yep, you could essentially "liquify" the planet, then "flash-freeze"
the surfaces of the mass-pods long enough to launch them.  The do
the final heat radiation step in space.  Alternatively you could
launch hot stuff in something like sapphire or tungsten carbide "crucibles".
Since there are relatively abundent poor heat conductors, you should
be able to easily construct a big vessel, pour in some liquid planet,
lanuch it and repeat the process.  You don't really care if the thing
melts "in transit" since wherever you collect it is going to have
a large capacity to radiate the heat away.  If you have energy
to burn, you could ionize the molecules and simply run them through
particle accelerators.

Since you have the problem of cooling the energy collectors (even if
they are 99.99999% efficient at converting the incoming energy), you
have the problem of cooling the mass drivers as well.  You dump the
heat first into the planet, then into space (either in the payload
or through radiators, as pointed out above).  Your comments
do point out the need to do some more in depth calculations regarding
how you partition the waste heat as the dismantlement occurs.  My gut
feel is that it goes: (1) Planet, (2) Departing Mass, (3) Radiators.

Without real designs, it is difficult to say exactly where the
bottlenecks might be.   I identified these because these have
the greatest effect in the simulations I have run.  As you point
out the heat radiation problem is a significant concern, but with
3-4 possible solutions it it appears to be resolvable.

Well, I did "gloss over it" in my discussion, because I viewed
"vaporization" as the final (ultimate) approach to the problem.
As your comments point out, it may come down to the question of
what is faster -- vaporization & condensation or mechanically
growing the planet.  The first is energy constrained, while the
second is most likely element abundance constrained.

Good point, so it looks like you have beanstalk mass-driver launchers
that circulate cooling fluid to thin radiators spanning the area between
the tops of the beanstalks, possibly with some holes to allow highly
focused energy beams back to the surface.

You simply get far enough away.  It turns out that you need to
handle about 10^17 kg/sec (average).  That works out to a sphere radius
of ~10^5 km (less than the radius of the sun) from Mercury if you want to
handle 1 kg/m^2.  Since that seems rather conservative, I think the sphere
could be much smaller.  For comparison, average radius of Mercury's
orbit is 5x10^7 km.  You should be able to use the momentum of the
launched mass (if you give it a little extra) to push the mass
collectors away from the planet at the rate that matches the
increase in mass volume (due to the increased power being beamed
down to the planet).

No ducting required, condense it at the distances allowed by
natural radiation (as the solar system did).  Since you can
can construct condensation radiators that radiate "outward"
and are much more efficient than "natural" dust this should
be easy to control.  You could either orbit the condensers
or "grow" them from the surface (more beanstalks).  To radiate
the heat effectively they would have to be thin, and therefore
lightweight.

Diamondoid radiators (lower temp than say Al2O3, SiC or Fe2O3),
require a sphere that is *smaller* than Mercury's orbit
(2 x 10^7 km vs. 5 x 10^7 km).  And since to minimize the
radiation/heat damage, you want to construct your collector/radiator
sphere *outside* of Mercury's orbit, everything seems to hang
together.   Of course, moving the mass from a Mercury encompassing
sphere to a Sun encompassing sphere is going to be an orbital
nightmare, but it doesn't seem impossible.

Agreed.  I thought about doing the asteroids, because you can do
more in parallel, but the problem is the insolation is an order
of magnitude lower when starting out.  For exponential growth
you win big with large up-front energy contributions.

No, the material in Mercury or the Moon provide sufficient Mass
(whether the element abundances are correct is an unresolved
question) to build sufficient 1 cm^3 nanocomputers to use the
entire power output of the sun.  The *killer* for MBrains is
the radiator mass, not the nanocomputer mass.  The further
out you build the radiators (for the outer MBrain layers) the
more mass is required (heat radiation scales with T^4, so
cool radiators suck mass bigtime).  The denser you try to
make your nanocomputers the more power you consume circulating
the cooling fluid and the larger the radiator mass (due to the
higher coolant pressures).  There are clearly limits to how
dense you can do the computing given the mass and energy
available.  What the exact tradeoffs are probably depends
highly on the computer architecture.

When I have time (ROTFL), I've got the CAD/modeling program to do a
real design of one of Eric's nanocomputers and a "real" radiator.
With that in hand we should have at least one valid point for
possible MBrain subcomponents.  In current calculations, I
assume collector/radiator masses of ~1 kg/m^2 which seems "reasonable".

Yep.  In theory, you could do both Mercury & the Asteroids
simultaneously.  You could also do part of Mercury (say until it gets
to the point where you have melted the planet and the nanomachines,
then use that energy to do the asteroids one by one.  No matter
what strategy you choose, once you are up in the TW power range
the whole thing goes pretty quickly.  Asteroids do suffer from
the requirement that you have to either make the collectors
thinner or use more mass (interestingly enough, the estimates
I have show Mercury as having more mass than the asteroid
belt by at least an order of magnitude).  You also have
longer travel times for optimal positioning from Asteroidal
orbits.

True, perhaps better to ionize the smoke and put it into carefully
focused particle beams.  Energy directed down, Mass directed up,
so long as nobody changes lanes it should work.

Extro-4 attendees,

	Todd Huffman <alvinjsminavich@hotmail.com> and I
<allsop@fc.hp.com>, as out of towners attending Extro-4, are planning
to spend Monday at the Metrion in San Francisco.  We're going to meet
at the "Campus Motel" (Where I'm staying (510)841-3844) in Berkeley at
9:00 am Monday morning, Aug 9th and then traveling together to the
Metreon which opens at 10:00.  We plan on doing lunch at the Metrion's
"Taste of San Francisco" ("feels like a comfortable neighborhood
street - lined with 5 hot restaurants chosen from around the Bay
Area. ") around noon.  We'll probably spend much of the rest of the
day there also depending on what comes up.

	Are there any other extropians interested in going along or
meeting up for lunch there or something?  If there are let us know.
We could change our plans to fit in with someone else's plans, but
this fits for the current group of only Todd and myself.

	Any other outings like this going on before or after extro-4?

Thank you for pointing that out. Due to Bailey's connection to Thinking
Machines Corporation, his enthusiasm for parallel processing seems suspect
to some. I look at it more as an indication of Bailey's commitment to what
he considers the most feasible plan for successfull development of AI (and
possibly IA).

Speaking of IA, you probably haven't run across it yet, but Bailey offers an
interesting comment on page 213 of _After Thought_: "During the 1970s, a
mathematician set out to match an autistic savant at the mind task of
determining the day of the week of any date in the past or future. Despite
enormous amounts of practice and the memorization of a full-page table, the
mathematician could not match the savant in speed. And then he could. All of
a sudden, he no longer needed to step through the operations he had been
practicing so diligently. The correct answer just happened. Instead of being
first nature to him, it had become second nature. Using terminology popular
at the time, a psychologist surmised that the entire task had migrated from
the left brain to the right brain. Once a product of traditional sequential
thought, it had simply transferred to a new ground."

It sounds like you know more about current computer architectures than I do.
The kind of parallel processing advocated by Bailey (from what I can glean)
consists of tens of thousands (perhaps someday millions) of nodes running
identical (but re-configurable and relatively simple) instruction sets, and
evolving new programs by competing with each other. He contends that
parallel computation surpasses sequential or discursive computation because
parallel processing can do more pattern recognition -- a necessary component
of AI.

It seems to me that Calvin (along with Edelman and Crick) has presented the
most compelling theory about how brains think. Those thought bubbles
apparently compete with each other,  la a Darwin machine. The winning
bubbles form a pattern of thought (of indeterminate duration) variously
referred to as consciousness, awareness or attention. (Mileage may vary.
Brain farts void all warranties.)

Subliminal thought processes, according to this model, simply remain too
weak to register their patterns against the dominant patterns unless or
until dominant paradigms fade or burst. So, thinking parallels Darwinian
evolution in a connectionistic universe. It seems to me that your narrative
of survival/evolution/selection tends to verify these metaphors.

I guess many of us have had experiences just like you describe.
Perhaps you won't find it offensive if I suggest that the knack of letting
random subconscious thoughts expire, IOW letting them fall away, or just
dropping them, allowing them to fade out, watching them disappear like
morning fog in the sunshine, correlates to what many have called meditative
or contemplative experience. Conscious experience, with no content, resets
the brain's entire perspective, and refreshes it so that it can form a whole
new Big Picture of reality. The experience of pure awareness can find a home
in any brain, male or female (or ET for that matter). But the expression or
translation of that experience certainly seems to contain components of
gender, ethnicity, culture, and so on.

The inability to stop thinking perhaps indicates illness analogous to the
inability to stop talking, to stop walking, or to stop scratching. The
French have coined a psychological term for the inability to stop thinking
about a particular thing: "ide fixe" they call it. For a treatise on
meditation technique, I recommend _The Relaxation Response_, by Herbert
Benson, M.D.

In my opinion, you will never become schizophrenic, because you've already
indicated that you understand where your random subconscious thoughts come
from. I think most mentally healthy people at some time or other worry about
their own sanity. Crazy people never doubt their own sanity.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 441  July 30, 1999   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

THE CHANDRA X-RAY TELESCOPE is now installed in its
highly elliptical orbit, where the Earth itself, and not just its
atmosphere, will not interfere with x-ray reception.  Named for
astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekher, the 14-m-long
telescope is considered one of NASA's three "great observatories";
the other telescopes in this battleship class are the Hubble Space
Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.  Chandra
will have superb angular resolution (half an arc-second, 8 times
better than previous x-ray telescopes),  sensitivity to faint objects
(20 times better), and spectral resolution (1 eV).  The object of the
mission is unflinchingly to explore graphic violence wherever it can
be found at x-ray wavelengths: quasars, black holes, pulsars,
supernovas, and intergalactic plasmas.

BLOCH STATES: NOT FOR ELECTRONS ONLY.  It is often
essential to consider an electron traveling through a solid as being a
wave that spreads out through the whole of the solid.  The quantum
description of this spread-out electron was formulated by Felix
Bloch in the 1920s.  Physicists have since sought to extend this idea
of a "Bloch state" to guest atoms in a crystal, but an atom's mass is
so large (and its equivalent wavelength so small) that a Bloch state
for an atom has been difficult to observe.  Now, physicists from
Japan (Ryosuke Kadono, KEK, ryosuke.kadono@kek.jp) have seen
clear signs of a Bloch state for a muonium "atom," in effect a light
isotope of hydrogen whose proton is replaced by a positively
charged muon particle having 1/9 of the proton's mass.  Performing
experiments at the Rutherford Appleton lab in England, the
researchers studied spin-polarized muonium (Mu) atoms in a KCl
crystal cooled down to 10 mK.  Measuring how long it took the
atoms to lose their initial polarization in the presence of an external
magnetic field provided information on their energy state and
matched the predictions of a Bloch model.  Further studies may
offer new insights into the energy bands of atoms in crystals. 
(Kadono et al., Physical Review Letters, 2 August 1999.)

PARTICLE ACCELERATOR TURN-ONS.  The concrete poured
and the magnets tuned, several important new machines are about to
take up important physics matters.  The Main Injector at Fermilab,
dedicated in June, is an additional 2-mile racecourse for getting
protons up to speed in much greater numbers.  What this means is
that the proton-antiproton collider run starting in 2000 will record in
one year as much data as was taken in the earlier 10-year era. This is
crucial since beam intensity is no less important than the energy of
collision when producing rare objects, such as supersymmetric
particles (hypothetical cousins of the known leptons and quarks) and
the much sought Higgs boson (playing a sort of midwife role in the
life of many other particles, the Higgs should also exist in its own
right).  New theoretical estimates for the mass of the Higgs suggest
that Fermilab might just have enough energy to discover the Higgs
(Science, 25 June).  Meanwhile, two accelerator schemes dedicated
to studying CP violation through the agency of  B-meson decays, are
nearly ready.  The Asymmetric B Factory at SLAC in California is
now smashing 9-GeV electrons into 3.1-GeV positrons to produce
pairs of Bs.  The decay products are absorbed in a detector called
BaBar.  A comparable setup at the KEK lab in Japan will soon
collide 8-GeV electrons with 3.5-GeV positrons inside a detector
called BELLE.  By the way, the cost of these detectors is a not-
inconsiderable portion of the accelerators themselves.  BaBar and
BELLE cost, respectively $80 million and $70 million (Physics
World, May 1999).   Finally, at the DAFNE electron-positron
collider in Frascati, Italy, CP violation is also the subject matter, but
the approach is different.  Here the collisions are dedicated to
making phi mesons, which then decay into a pair of K mesons,
which in turn break up (amid the KLOE detector) in a process that
violates charge-parity invariance (CERN Courier, June 1999.)

I've updated my web site at http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/, adding three
new works and cleaning up some mistakes.  There's nothing specifically new
for Extropians, though it might be of interest for the more philosophically
minded on the list.

This is not to say some of the stuff might not have application or cause
some debate.  (I imagine "A Dialogue on Happiness" under My Esssays-Lesser
Works might fit the bill.:)

And I continue to resist the temptation to put up fancy graphics!

Enjoy!

Orwell Checks In on the Valley
by Ayla Jean Yackley 

5:05 p.m.  20.Nov.98.PST
SAN JOSE, California -- Pill boxes beep when it's
time to take your medicine. Systems play your
favorite music when you enter a room. A sensor on
your clothing detects the particles in your
co-worker's cough. "Stay away," it warns, "he has
the flu." 

Gregory Benford, a physics professor at the
University of California at Irvine, spun these visions
of the future at the Cato Institute's three-day
Conference on Technology & Society, held here
Friday. 

If microprocessors decrease in cost to just a few
pennies by 2010, Benford predicted they will
automate the most mundane of daily activities. 

Benford, who is also an author, was joined by
futurist writers David Brin, author of Startide Rising
and Vernon Vinge, author of A Fire upon the Deep,
for a morning discussion of technology's role in
creating "fictional futures." 

Vinge warned that these inexpensive chips may
create a guise for government. 

"While government will appear less invasive," it
may in fact own a piece of every processor, he said.
Government may conduct activities like tax
collection over personal computers, leaving citizens
with a smaller space for dissension. 

Yet Vinge credited the advent of personal computers
in allaying the human fear of technology. Only
governments could own the gargantuan,
multimillion-dollar machines of the 1950s and 1960s,
which caused citizens to distrust what they could
not control. 

"The PC destroyed the notion of the computer
thwarting freedom, leading to a 1984," he said, and
personal ownership has created the sense that
technology enhances freedom. 

But technology can still lead to an Orwellian
scenario, said Brin, who laid out a conspiratorial
vision straight out of The X-Files. 

Brin said a "surveillance society" could manifest out
of seemingly benign personal computers. As society
becomes more networked, he said, human behavior
may be tracked with less obvious methods than,
say, video surveillance. Instead, movements may be
documented by learning which Web sites are visited
or how much time is spent online. 

Benford said our comfortable relationship with
personal computers may lead to a culture of
complacency, as people opt for convenience over
freedom. He described a "sissy society" that lives in
"cocoons." 

"We'll all sit in our 'friendly homes' ... and we won't
carry out the big projects," he said. 

But Brin disagreed. "We'll find new challenges,
worries, and hobbies. We'll jump out of planes or go
nuts in good ways." 

"Yes, but these are more personal and less
meaningful activities than human pursuits of the
past," Benford countered. 

The debate among the futurists showed the lack of
consensus on technology's unfolding purposes and
pitfalls. The Cato Institute's parley continues
through Saturday.

(Our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message)

****************************************
Replacement Parts for the Brain:
Intracranial Implantation
of Hardware Models of Neural Circuitry
**********************************************
A NIMH, USC-AMI Sponsored Conference
August 12-14 1999, Willard Hotel Washington D.C.

This conference will bring together leading researchers throughout the
country for a focus on one of the newest frontiers of neuroscientific
and bioengineering research: the intracranial implantation of computer
chip models of brain function as neural prosthetics to replace damaged
or dysfunctional brain tissue. In considering the development of
"replacement parts for the brain", speakers will address recent
advances in (i) biologically realistic mathematical models of brain or
spinal cord function, (ii) silicon- and/or photonics-based
computational devices which incorporate those models, and (ii)
"neuron-silicon interface" devices, i.e., micron-scale multi-site
electrode arrays to provide bi-directional communication between the
computational element and functioning neuronal tissue. The conference
is intended to synergize interdisciplinary research in the neural,
engineering, and biomedical sciences.

If it arrives as IR or UV it is completely harmless.  If it arrives as
visible light it is not nearly as bright as the sun.  X-rays or gamma-rays
will be completely blocked by a planetary atmosphere, and any space habitat
capable of surviving a solar storm will likewise be unharmed.  If it were

that flux, which amounts to around 10^-7 electron volts - in other words,
less than one interaction.

Do I really need to write up a complete treatment of all the calculations
here?  It doesn't matter what exotic form you want the energy to arrive in,
because there simply isn't enough of it to do anything.  The target
civilization will be exposed to much higher levels of every type of
radiation (including neutrinos) simply by living near their own sun.

True, but they and the high speed electrons and protons that also come from
the supernova would produce radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere that
would be no fun at all. The ozone layer would go to hell too.

That is very far from obvious.

I have no idea what you're talking about. You seem to saying that a human
body would not absorb even one neutrino from a nearby supernova, but
you can't possibly mean that.



    >It doesn't matter what exotic form you want the energy to arrive in,
    >because there simply isn't enough of it to do anything.

To repeat myself, energy has little to do with danger, just one X ray
photon could kill you if it hits in the right place and in fact that very
thing  is a major, perhaps the major, cause of the most feared disease
of the 20'th century that kills millions of people every year.

Once more I must say that you can't possibly mean what you seem to be saying.

    >Do I really need to write up a complete treatment of all the calculations here?

Yes, I rather think you do.

I tend t oagree, but I've not done the calculations...  I'd also, though, be
worried about secondary effects.  E.g., if a local supernova increased the
heat influx on the surface of comets, thereby changing their orbits enough
to create a danger to us.  Granted, this is far-fetched and, I bet, any
changes of this sort might cut it either way -- might put us out of danger
more than in danger.

Though, just intuitively, without doing any statistical orbits on this,
imagine the cometary bodies nearer the supernova (the the "windward" side of
the solar system) being push, ever so slightly toward the sun, changing more
of the orbits so that they might enter the inner solar system.  This might
create a hazard that would play itself out over thousands of years.

Anyway, I'm not lying awake nights worrying about this...:)

I'm reading Gerald Taylor's book "The Race for Consciousness".  Has anyone 
else read this book?  Taylor lays out the neuroanatomical and functional 
details of what he calls his "relational consciousness" model, making (to my 
layman's eyes) a detailed argument from the neuronal level, through the level 
of individual neural net circuits, up to the functional level, that the "hard 
problems" of consciousness and cognitive science (even *qualia*) can all be 
explained through the "competition" of cognitive "primitives" (my term) 
instantiated in specific neural net representations.  He cites a good deal of 
empirical work, including clinical observation of brain damage and 
dysfunction, surgical experiments on humans and other animals, network 
simulation and straightforward neuroanatomy.  He also relates his 
explanations to every other major work in cognitive science of which I'm 
aware.  Although not particularly well written (it could have really have 
been improved by a thorough editing from a literary viewpoint), this book has 
impressed me for just how completely an exhaustive list of cognitive 
phenomena can now be linked to specific brain areas and functions, so much so 
that I keep wanting to ship copies of it to working AI researchers.

I'd be keenly interested in any opinions by folks more informed about 
cognitive science of the theories and analysis contained in this book.  The 
schematics contained in this book look to me to be a fairly detailed plan for 
a working general-purpose AI.

Then why did you say a body the size of a planet would not stop it? It
follows that if a whole planet will not stop even a large fraction of
the neutrinos, then a puny human body will not absorb any.

Actualy, yes, that is exactly what I mean.  It's a only rough approximation,
of course - since you don't seem to believe it, I'll get a more detailed
computation.

A) People get hit by single X rays all the time and survive - energy density
is the major determinant of the probability that you will actually get one
of those unlucky hits.  Rendering a sentient race extinct requires you to
approach 100% mortality, which means you need a very high probability, which
in turn means you need a significant amount of energy.

B) What on Earth makes you think it is realistic to expect cancer to be a
significant problem for a spacefaring civilization?  Do you seriously think
that we could spend another thousand years researching the problem without
finding reliable cures?  With sublight space travel, that is the kind of
timespan we need to be thinking about.

I have refrained from commenting on this previously because it
is a very complex topic and to *really* accurately discuss it
we need a spreadsheet that details the energy exposure at
a distance from a SN/GRB at a specific wavelength.  If we
had that we could discuss this topic without all of the
hand-waving that seems to be occuring.

That being said, I'm going to inject some comments:

Caca!

You can't comment very much on the IR/UV exposure without knowing
exactly how much dust is between you and the radiation source.
UV/Visible will be absorbed by dust and re-emitted in the IR.

If you get enough IR radiation, you vaporize the oceans and
all water-based life forms on the planet (leaving only bactera
in subterranean ("insulated") locations.

If you get enough UV radiation, you produce enough thymine dimers
to either make the next generation mutation rate go ballistic or
even sterilize the existing surface dwelling population entirely.

Energy "density" does count!

The ozone layer gets axed primarily by UV I believe.  Whether X/Gamma-rays
are blocked by the atmosphere depends upon the proximity and the energy
released by the event.  An interesting comparison would involve how close
a "typical" SN/GRB would have to be to sterilize/kill (a) people on the
surface, (b) people on the 1st floor of a skyscraper; (c) people in
underground bunkers designed to withstand nuclear blasts.  Then you have
an estimate as to real extinction potential.

I agree, you have to show me the radiation frequency curve of a solar storm.
Since you have to put a lot of mass into a space habitat radiation shield
and mass in space is generally expensive, I'd vote to be under the
atmospheric blanket or in an undergound bunker.  Most of the space
radiation exposure curves I've seen try to reduce the levels to
a "nuclear industry worker" (which are presumed to be "non-hazardous).

There is a *big* debate going on right now about how to properly assess
radiation hazards (there is a National Research Council panel that is
supposed to provide the standards for this).  There are two very
opposed camps: (1) that radiation hazards are "linear" with dose;
and (2) that radiation hazards below a certain level are "essentially"
harmless (i.e. you have biological systems designed to cope with
these "natural" levels).

Just for "comparison" purposes, I would point out that ionizing radiation
sufficient to produce 5 double strand DNA breaks in most bacteria/eukaryotic
cells is "lethal" to the cell (never mind cancer), the radation-resistant
bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, on the other hand, can tolerate radiation
sufficient to produce 100 double strand DNA breaks.

That is a factor of 20 in exposure tolerance, which I presume translates
into a significant difference in distance.

The neutrino absorption/interaction rate depends entirely upon the
neutrino density where the human is when the neutrinos hit.  This
depends on the neutrino density generated by the SN/GRB, the distance
to the Earth, and the mass between the individual and the SN
(interstellar dust, atmosphere, oceans (for those in submarines),
ground (for those in bunkers), the Earth itself (for those on the
side "away" from the SN/GRB, etc.

The question is how many neutrinos go through the human?  That
largely depends on distance.  I would presume that the reason
that most of the energy in SN/GRB is released as neutrinos is
that they are the only particles that can easily escape through
the overlying material.  Since the "mass" between a human and
a SN/GRB is probably much greater than the human, you have to
take into account the probabilities for interactions with that
mass and the probability that those secondary products would
interact with the human.

Energy "density" (and type) is the basis for the danger.  Cancer in a single
cell probably requires 5+ mutations.  Even if you have those mutations,
there is a good chance that one of the natural defense systems in the
body may remove the mutated cells.  The only way to resolve this question
is to use the radiation levels an average person would receive from a
SN/GRB relative to the radiation levels received from atomic bomb
blasts (or nuclear workers and/or flight attendents).

Even then, the calculations are very difficult, because most of the
radiation exposure from which disease rates are caculated *do not*
have neutrinos as the radiation source.

Billy can say that if he assumes a minimal distance to a SN/GRB.
We know that SN/GRB occur all the time.  Most of the time they have
relatively little effect on Earth.  I happened to be in a plane and
observed the "Northern lights" that resulted from the atmospheric
ionization from one of the larger the GRB/CosmicRays last August.
I'm still alive to recall the event.  Whether the secondary radiation
I received was sufficient to cause a future cancer is anyones guess.
For the simplest approximation it comes down to the energy of the
event and how distant you are from it.

> >Do I really need to write up a complete treatment of all the calculations here?
> Yes, I rather think you do.

To be perfectly frank, I don't think it can be done (without a huge
amount of work).  You have to determine the particle types that result
from SN/GRB, determine their density when they reach Earth, determine
their reduction (and byproduct production) for intervening mass,
determine their interaction rates with the elements in the human
body, determine the mutation rates resulting from those exposures, etc.

You could come up with numbers, but the assumptions would probably be
open to question.  The best you can probably do is a simple calculation
that says SN/GRB are harmless at greater distance X, and SN/GRB are
guaranteed to be fatal when closer than distance Y.

Because it's true, solar neutrino are as common at night as they are in
the day, they just come from the ground to the sky not the sky to the
ground. Neutrinos don't like to react with matter very much so If you want
to build a neutrino observatory you'll need a big target like a 1000 ton
tank of distilled water, and you'll need to protect it from the noise of
other cosmic rays so you'll have to put it in the deepest mine shafts on
the planet, 1.5 to 2 miles deep. Next you'll need to line the tank with
very sensitive light detectors. A huge number of neutrinos pass through
the tank every second but almost always the do absolutely nothing,
however on very rare occasions they turn a neutron into an electron and
a proton moving at enormous speed, faster even than the speed of light
in water (but not of course in a vacuum), this produces a characteristic flash
of blue light that can be picked up by your detectors. Normally you'll
see between one and two flashes a month. In the 1987 supernova
that happened 200,000 light years away they saw about 20 flashes
in one second.


     >It follows that if a whole planet will not stop even a large fraction of

That follows only if the number of neutrinos you're dealing with is small,
but they never are. neutrinos are by far the most ubiquitous particle in the
universe, far more of them in the universe than atoms or electrons or even
photons. The sun alone produces about 1.8 X 10^38 neutrinos a second
(there is some controversy over that figure, but it's accurate to within a factor of 3),
and that's a trivial amount compared to what a supernova can do.

    >What flavor of neutrinos are we talking about here?

I'm talking about electron neutrinos, the other 2 types are even harder
to detect.

This gets messy, though the mass of the Earth exceeds the mass of a
human by 10^23, the vertical column above a human (on the side away
from the SN) exceeds the height of a human by ~6 million.  The mass
of the atmospheric column has to be much much less (when you are on
the side facing the SN).  The interaction rate though depends on
the neutrino density and the number of atoms in the body.

Since a big tank of water or chlorine containing liquid (i.e. current
neutrino detectors) will interact with 5-20 neutrinos for a SN event
(at some distance like a nearby galaxy), I would have to believe that
the neutrino density for a nearby event would be sufficient to cause
at least a few interactions with the mass of the human body.

But I would argue that the event would have to be *very* close
to have a life-span decreasing effect.  [Otherwise we wouldn't be
here today!]

It is interesting to note that the assumptions which you do not share are 
implicit in much of Drexler's work as well as fellow Foresight conspirators 
such as Halperin.  The issue of whether a SI would be hostile or friendly or 
merely casually indifferent is certainly something worth discussing.  I 
absolutely reject the silly assumption in both Engines of Creation and 
Halperin's novels that somehow we are going to be able to keep a lid on AI.  
(In fact, according to Conrad Schneiker - co-inventor of the 
scanning/tunneling array chip - Drexler also originally thought that 
nanotech itself could be kept under wraps and carefully developed under the 
wise and beneficent supervision of MIT technocrat types.  It was only, 
according to Conrad, when he threatened to publish on nanotech himself, that 
he managed to force Drexler's hand on this, which resulted in Engines,.. 
Foresight, etc.)

I do have an answer for the problem at hand, however, which I have been 
passing on for the past twenty years, to wit:

While there are inherent economic efficiencies in cooperation, and the 
universe does set upper limits on the size of a practical single-focus 
intelligence, there are even more challenging issues for a really smart AI.  
You yourself have undoubtably run head on into the problem of achieving 
"visibility."  The more out on the end of the bell you are, the less likely 
you are to find a soul mate.

Why is this a problem?  From a strictly practical view there is a real 
problem for any intelligence called maintaining sanity.  Intelligence - that 
is, conscious intelligence as opposed to very fast and sophisticated data 
processing - is structured in such a way as to be inherently open-ended.  
What keeps it focused and sane is the necessity of constant feedback from 
the real world.  In isolation, you gradually go insane, and the mere effort 
to maintain sanity without feedback could become overwhelming.

This itself imposes a major overhead cost at minimum for an isolated 
intelligence.  From the standpoint of enjoying one's existence, the cost 
becomes much higher, as enjoyment in general flows from completing the 
feedback loop - what one percieves reaffirms the structure and content of 
one's consciousness.  Of course, we could eliminate this factor by design, 
but I don't think what would be left would be conscious or alive.

This is far from a new idea.  The Hindus several thousand years ago 
speculated quite freely about the ultimate origins and structure of the 
universe, which they assumed had existed for an infinite time.  In an 
infinite time, anything that can evolve will.  Thus, we might expect that 
the highest product of evolution was already with us and always has been - 
that being the Hindu idea of God.  This God plays with the universe in order 
to percieve himself.  Yet the Hindus recognized the problem of power and 
feedback.  Thus, their God - which is a reasonable approximation of an SI - 
gave independence to his creations.  He built worlds and let them run, and 
if he did well, then the creatures that evolved would glorify him by their 
existence - i.e., perceptually reaffirm.

It is only when you have a perceptual/emotional relationship with another 
consciousness in real-time that you can get a real mirror of your "soul."  
This is why people place such a high value on relationships.

The real problem, as I identified in the early '80's, is the transition 
period.  Suppose we build something that is very, very smart and has some 
very strong "motivations," but is not really conscious.  Then we have to 
convince this entity that it is in its own best interest to take the next 
step of moving to true consciousness.  At that point, we have an ethical 
hold on it, as ethics is the bottom line rules of how we live together 
safely enough that we are able to be honest.

THE 6 BILLIONTH BABY

Population experts expect that between now and the end of the year, a
newborn somewhere will be the 6 billionth human on Earth.  Many factors
will affect the health and development of that child, and in many cases
will predetermine the baby's future.  That future is likely to be
considerably brighter if this baby is born in an industrialized country
than if he or she is born in the developing world.

If the child is born in Switzerland, she is likely to live to age 82; and
if a boy, to age 75.  But if born in Sierra Leone, she is likely to live to
age 39; and if a boy, to 36.

If the child is born in the Netherlands, he runs a risk of 1% of not living
to his fifth birthday and a 9% risk of not seeing his 60th.  If born in
Niger, he runs a risk of 8% of not living to see his fifth birthday, and a
36% risk of not seeing his 40th.

If the child is born in Austria, she will be 100% certain to grow up with
access to safe drinking water and sanitation.  If born in Afghanistan, she
will have only a 21% chance of access to safe water and a 1% chance of
access to sanitation.

If the child is born in the United States, he will likely live in a family
with more than $21,541 annual income.  If born in Uganda, he would likely
live in a family with about $602 annual income (based on GDP per person).

If the child is born in Sweden, she will run a 7% risk of being
functionally illiterate as an adult.  If born in Senegal, she will run a
65% risk of being illiterate as an adult.

If the child is born in Belgium, he will have available to him 3,543
calories a day and 102 grams of protein (average availability, not actual
consumption because it includes waste).  If born in Bolivia, he will have
available to him 2,170 calories a day and 56 grams of protein.
(Availability of 2,000 calories or less is considered a severe shortage,
availability of 2,000-2,300 calories a day is considered shortage.)

If the child is born in Canada, she will live as one of 8 people sharing
one square mile of land.  If born in China, she will live as one of 327
people sharing one square mile of land.

If the child is born in Italy, he will likely live in a city, as 90% of the
Italians do.  If born in India, he will likely live in a rural area because
72% of the Indians do.

I don't need to check the calculations of your theory, I know you're wrong
because it doesn't fit the facts.  As I already said, the 1987 supernova event
produced about 20 neutrinos  in one second that were detectable in one of
our primitive neutrino observatories, and it was not close, it was in another galaxy.
The best the sun could manage is 1 or 2 a month. I don't want to be
impolite but this is not a gray area, I'm right and you're wrong.
