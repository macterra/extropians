Beautiful.

My variation (for delivery to conventional/fundie religious types):

Presently, I am an agnostic. Independent of that fact, I strive to be a
holy man. It may take me more than a normal human lifespan just to hear
God's call. In the meantime, I believe that I can be a part of God's plan
even if I'm not saved. And if I get cryonically suspended and God wants me,
I am sure my body being held at LN2 temperature won't stop Him from taking
me whenever He wants.
Why can't that be true of many people? Perhaps God wants cryonics to become
popular so that more people can ultimately be saved, even if it takes more
than  the usual lifespan.

If their eyes haven't glazed over, I move on to:

Didn't Methuselah live 900 years? Etc.

Usually some part or all of that blows their circuits.

I would disagree. Gently, of course. :)

Nope, that's problem-solving. Engineering. Technology. Medicine. Etc. 

Good stuff, great stuff, and it needs science as an input or it's just
doing it the way your grandparents did it.

>as well as create or
>discover answers to all the "how's" and "why's" society encounters during
>its progression.  

That's closer to being what science is about. But there is no such thing as
"applied science". :) Or rather, if you apply science or math to a
practical problem, then you are doing "techne", *not* "scientia".

>The objective of art is somewhat more individual

E. Shaun, methinks you are playing into the had of those who declare art
only to be that stuff on the wall with a frame around it. :\ :) I think art
is any directed human activity which achieves a quality richer than the sum
of its parts: joy outweighing (circuit-2 and below) pleasure. That does
tend to seem subjective, yet there is a lot of overlap across cultures, in
my slight experience. Some art crosses cultures easier than others; I have
more to say about this but the margins of this email are to small to
contain it. :)

I think that art doesn't have to be just about ideas. I think a good
session of go is art. I think a good session of bodysurfing could be
considered solitary performance/lively art. I think singing in the shower
is art. I think a hilarious session of clowning around with my 10-year-old
niece is art. Where are the ideas? Are they all sleeping furiously in the
bin labeled "Colorless Green"? :)

Peace,

MMB

I think this, along with the need for new frontiers, will be the primary 
motivation for human space colonization in the next few decades. Robotic
facilities can only do so much, certainly not conduct high tech lab
research. A mass of under 100 US tons launched from Earth seems to be 
enough to establish a self-replicating colony using current tech, 
including provisions for biological life. A private venture, using one
of 
the new breeed of commercial launchers, might be able to put this
together 
for a few G$. The people that move to this place (Moon, Mars, Asteroid) 
can still access current science on Earth via radio, while living in a
very 
defensible high ground.

Some additional advantages of the Mars trip (see Mars post no. 1) would 
probably be that it would create all kinds of useful technological spinoffs
(perfected suspended animation, which would make the trip dramatically 
easier and cheaper, might get some more attention and funding, for
example) *and* it would almost certainly give an impulse to governmental
space programs (a matter of ego, paranoia and greed), which would in
turn produce even more useful spinoffs. Once on Mars, the motivation 
to develop new technologies would be much higher, because you need
high tech to survive & prosper, while on earth the situation is somewhat
less urgent. Also, there wouldn't (initially) be much else to do then to
develop new ways to make life more comfortable. Since you have your
"spies" (mechanical/human) on earth you don't have to miss out on new
developments, on the contrary, new technologies can be implemented
much more rapidly because the laws on Mars are presumably liberal, 
and there's more than enough room to test potentially dangerous new
stuff etc.

The only real problem is, IMO, money. However, there are lots of groups
that want to colonize space, for whatever reason. Also, there are some
private companies that (aim to) produce relatively cheap commercial
spacecraft. Some kind of alliance would seem like the logical thing to
do. Like I said before, any philosophical or other differences can be 
always settled once everybody is offplanet, and in any case there's
space enough for everybody in space. There are a lot more people
interested in space colonization, than in, say, cryonics, and some of
these people may be very rich (they might duly see a lot of potential
$$$$$$ in this undertaking). After all, this isn't just fun, but also
the opportunity to stake your claims almost at will in the new frontier.
Funding the private colonization of Mars (and other parts of the 
Solar System) should thus be feasible.

(and yes, you could even do it without the rich benefactors if you set
up some lucrative gambling 'n' stuff in some appropriate location
(like the Bahama's), or create some hugely successful electronics
company, market a totally cool new smart drug etc...but let's assume
no-one will do this).

[Oops, I'm rambling again...pardon the high SF-factor, but after all this
*is* a list where even crazier topics (like putting your mind into a machine,
and robots the size of a virus -- yeah right ;-) are discussed, so some
space travel will hardly make it weirder...]

[ Please direct replies to extropians-moderated@mit.edu. ]

	I may as well announce it now.  3 weeks ago, I stepped down
from the Extropians club that I cofounded with Jason Davis to finally,
at last give science my all.

	Why don't I just forward the two emails I sent to the
extropians@mit.edu list?  They say everything I want to say, and more.

	And with that, this club, the still-derecognized MIT
Extropians, passes to whatever form it chooses to evolve itself into.
I'll still forward useful information.  But whoever wishes to lead --
our lists, next year's pamphlet, our group, its guiding philosophy --
the door is completely wide open for you to do so.

	And so, I wish you all the best -- that you may achieve what
you set out to attain.

*--Forwarded message follows-----------------------------------------*

	There's a reason for our 2-list breakup.  It was a necessary
bifurcation.  I mean this literally, as in a second-order phase
transition with two distinct phases.  If time provided, I could make
the difference evident, sharp, but I've been too busy to even post my
"stepping down" email.

	As for -discussion, I happen to think the topics are
legitimate topics.  -- but still...well...sigh...off the mark in many
different ways.

	Keep your eyes out for what happens in "large" intellectual
discussions.  Right after our first Extropian gathering, I told Jason
that it's a deep fact that large forums left to themselves inevitably
default to talking about:

	-politics
	-economics
	-religion

	And lo and behold, left to itself, that is exactly what goes
through -discussion these days.  These are *fine* topics, but I think
there are ultimately more rewarding topics.  But maybe I'm putting the
cart before the horse.  After all, I spent my years on politics,
economics, religion, was a Counterpoint Editor-in-Chief, cofounder of
SAFE (MIT's free speech group), the libertarians email list, and
Extropians.  So who am I to talk?

	These issues are the "contentious" issues involving large,
often powerfully organized power structures, paradigms, morality.  I
was always known for asking people 3 questions, always:

	1) are you religious?  if not, what's your epistemology?
	2) do you believe in immortality for humanity?  are you personally
		interested in it?  why or why not?
	3) what are your political views?

	I file away all these answers.  Ally or non-ally, that's one
of my first classifications.  Folks, like it or not, life is
contentious and will remain so.

	Well, I guess there needs to be a forum for politics,
religion, and economics, sprinkled with some immortality and science
talk.  I only wish people would spontaneously discuss *these* issues:

	1) what drives you, what do you want above all else
	2) what could help you, what's holding you back from it
	3) what are you doing about it, are you happy about what you're doing

	I had hoped our Extropians pamphlet would point the way to
what is important.  By its very rather unusual nature, and the fact
that people *obviously* felt it was important and worth responding to
-- I hoped people would learn.  But our list is dominated by a lot of
intellectual followers.

	I want to understand the universe and change the world.  After
much thought, I decided both are best served if I pursue science and
put activism on the backburner.  It will always be there, and I will
always have the opportunity.  But later.  And I would leave changing
the world to others if I could.

	In the meantime, I am taking: 2.152 (nonlinear control), 7.05
(biochem), 8.059 (quantum 3), 8.08 (stat mech 2), 8.334 (grad stat
mech 2), 9.371 (differential geometry), 18.702 (algebra 2).  Even with
that, I spend 1/3 of my time during the week learning and thinking
about material outside my classes.  I work 75-85 hour weeks, about 2/3
of which I consider useful work.  Of that, maybe 1/4 is really
insightful learning.  But you know, even if you plod, you're still
soaking information.

	There is so much I want to understand!  I wish I could do
everything, learn everything.  I can't, dammit, I'm strapped by my
body, mind, mortality.  Damn it, curse it, but restrained I am, most
of all by my willpower.

	So how well have I been doing?  Fairly well.  My problem sets
have been decent.  It takes getting used to, but you can learn to pump
5-7 out per week.  What I really regret is every hour I waste not
reflecting more deeply about the science, not making the insights or
connections that really bring clarity to what I'm doing.  I resent the
hours when I'm taken away from one subject to work on another.  Right
now, I'm stretched thin, and need to scale down my projects.  This
means I need to focus on *only* classes for the next week, rather than
try to understand measure theory, etc.  :)

	My life began 3 weeks ago.  Until then, I wasn't living.  And
I knew it.

	But now it's for real, and god, it's so exciting, so scary.
What if it's all for nothing?  What if knowledge is just a lot of
pretty theory?  What if the greatest science needs breakthroughs
(especially mind science) that won't happen in my life?  What if I'm
just a nothing?  I already know I can be a great pedagogue, a great
teacher -- but what about research?  Scientists aren't remembered for
pedagogy.  What if I'm 40 and I know the reason I failed was because
of a lack of will -- how could I live with myself then?  Or if I'm in
the wrong field, and wasted 20 years on an illusion or lesser field?
What if I should have done something else?  Writing?  Activism?

	Every person must go through this and come to grips with it
alone.  Ultimately nobody can possibly help you.

	So take heart, yon Extropians, the struggles are real - but
you wouldn't want to live any other way.

-Han

Subject: inspiration, motivation, major achievements in science and engineering

[ This email is a mouthful, but hey, I put some good stuff in it, so
I hope you get something out of it. ]

	Thanks for the responses, guys.  Two people emailed me already
on the main list asking what happened 3 weeks ago.  :)

	Actually, Ed, I did mean a second order phase transition. :)
-moderated and -discussion slowly differentiate and the system would
undergo "spontaneous symmetry breaking" because I'd only send good
stuff to -moderated.  But hey, first-order (discontinous) works, too.

	Funny, "phase transition" is not found in the index of
Strogatz's nonlinear dynamics text.  And not once in 8.334 (which Ed
and I are taking) did I hear anyone say a phase transition is a
bifurcation in the Landau free energy Psi(m) function.

	Jason asks: Who's Landau?  Geez, Jason.  :) All I've been
learning in the first 3 weeks of 8.059 are Landau levels in the
presence of a magnetic field and in 8.334 about the Landau free energy
function.  :) I'm not exagerrating.  Landau probably contributed more
to mean field theory, and thereby to modern statistical mechanics'
critical phenomena and condensed matter physics, than any other
physicist.  But Ed was referring to Landau's pedagogy.  Here, I'll
quote from Gasiorowicz, p. 503, "The [Quantum Mechanics] book by
Landau and Lifschitz is one of a series of superb books covering all
of theoretical physics."  It's the only series of its kind.  Granted,
other physicists also left a solid written legacy.  Feynmann's justly
famous _Feynmann Lectures_ and several textbooks (among them stat
mech, QED) and even lectures on computation and gravitation.  Steven
Weinberg wrote textbooks on quantum field theory and general
relativity, the two as yet irreconciliable theories in physics, texts
used in MIT's grad classes.

	I've been going off on this to illustrate a point about how
fame is distributed in science, and to ask how important is it really.
You can't ignore these issues.  In my physics classes of 1998,
probability says some person sitting in them is eventually going to
win the Nobel Prize.  Who is he?  How does he learn or research that's
different from anybody else?  And if I were to take enough biology
classes, I could say the same, more by sheer mass of # of people
taking these classes, and the fact that MIT is #1 in molecular
biology.  These things matter.  We work for idealism, learning,
knowledge, but don't tell me you chose your scientific or engineering
applications without a thought of personal ambition.

	Landau was an excellent case point.  "The great Russian
physicist Lev Landau," as my excellent 8.059 lectures notes say, but
how many people outside physics know this?  Similarly, Murray
Gell-Mann.  We didn't even mention names like Murray Gell-Mann in our
Extropian pamphlet.  Yet, even if particle physics is one of highly
competitive endeavors where a lot of people are working on it at any
time, Gell-Mann is still the man generally most given credit for:
quarks, symmetry, and renormalization theory.  This is huge!

	And quite unlike what a lot of people say about genius in
their twenties, both of these men did a lot of their great work past
their 30's.  Feynmann: QED by age of 31 (path integrals, Feynmann
diagrams), liquid helium and superfluidity mid-30's, weak
interaction/beta decay (which he thought was his greatest work), which
was by 39.  In his mid-40's (early 1960's), he did the Feynmann
lectures.  Einstein's general relativity: mid 30's.

	What does this mean?  It means these men were generally doing
their greatest work a full decade or longer after they first started
taking physics classes for real.  This is far from the standard myth
of young genius.  Folks, it only happens in math, where you have
prodigies, and even then, many a mathematician's greatest work is done
in the years of his full maturity.  Norbert Weiner was a child
prodigy, yes, but his greatest opus (which made its way into
Cybernetics) was done when he was sporting a great beard.

	(I did an overview this January of famous composers.  Brahms
is the only composer who finished a powerful, Promethean work when he
was 25: the Brahms First Piano Concerto (my theme piece).  All other
composers did their great work in their 30's or later.  Mozart wrote
nothing of major consequence until he was 29 (the 20th piano
concerto).  All his great operas were in his early 30's until he died
at 35 having not completed his Requiem (arguably his greatest
non-opera piece).  Quite a contrast from the Mozart child prodigy myth
spawn by _Amadeus_, eh?  Beethoven finished his 3rd, 5th, and 9th at
34, 38, 53 respectively.  Mahler wrote his greatest symphonies 5 and 6
in his early 40's.)

	Again, the lesson is clear.  Ramanujuan and child prodigy
stories are rare.  People often do their greatest creative work after
years, often 10 or more, from their first training.  It is true in
composition, it is often very true in writing (but not always; Asimov
and Orson Scott Card's most famous novels were finished for the most
part by late 20's -- but hey, that's almost 10 years isn't it?)

	Back to people people who aren't given their proper due...

	Arthur Kornberg of biology.  DNA Polymerase 1 and 3, RNA
transcriptase.  Watson and Crick discovered the double helix
structure, fine, but Kornberg isolated the major enzymes that
replicate DNA and transcribe RNA, surely a greater overall
contribution than Watson and Crick's.  From what I can tell in 7.05,
he strikes me as the greatest biochemist/molecular biologist of his
time.  Double helix structure, fine...so we know the shape of DNA.
Important, yes.  But the runaway success of molecular biology is
entirely due to the amazing enzymes.  What much if not most of
molecular biology is, with their gels and whatnot, are basically
throwing enzymes at DNA, RNA.  DNA is just the code; it's the enzymes
that are the machinery that make life work, and those machines are so
sophisticated it makes me want to hurl every time I see the word
"nanotechnology."  All the "telomerase" and other stuff you're hearing
about: enzymes.  How many people even recognize the name?  Arthur
Kornberg.  Did his Nobel-winning work in his late 30's.  (There are at
least a half dozen other molecular biologists I'm not giving credit
to.)

	Hodgkin-Huxley: mathematical model for action potentials in
the nerve.  It's the *only* successful neurocomputational model so far
after all these decades, and the *only* successful mathematical model
in biology (for which these two won their Nobel Prizes in).  Theirs
was a lifetime of dedicated, painstaking research, and the model for
what neurocomputation should aspire to be.

	John Bardeen, the only man to have won two Nobel Prizes in
physics, one for the transistor effect, the other for
superconductivity.  Damn!  That's all I need to say about it.

	Steve Smale and other less well-known mathematicians of chaos
theory and differential equations (which is what the field used to be
called before "nonlinear dynamics and chaos" became a big deal).
There are at least two "schools" of dynamic systems, and Smale started
on of them by tying topology to dynamics.  It is a very strange fact
that MIT has, to the best of my knowledge, never offered a course in
topological dynamics (!).  But then, the story of dynamics is still
very wide open and much remains to be written...

	I'll leave with one final topic: estimation, information,
systems, dynamics, control, optimization, operations research.  These
fields are so broad and diffuse and interrelated it's hard to
appreciate them in their entirety.  Gauss in 1800's invented
deterministic least squares.  Fisher in 1910's: invented maximum
likelihood estimation.  Wineer in 1940's and for the rest of his life:
Wiener filters, and other stuff that made its way into stochastics.
Kalman in 1960's with the Kalman filter.  Kolmogorov in the '60's with
a host of contributions to probability.  Shannon, of course, with
information theory.  Lyapunov in the 19th century, and other work
later in the '60s (LaSalle, Barbalat, others).  A lot of what made
MIT's Course 6 "Area One" famous: the LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian)
formulation which Athans and others are famous for, the canonical
Oppenheim & Willsky textbooks on signals and systems and Oppenheim's
and Shafer's reference textbook on DSP, both of which needless to say,
are enormous industrially.

	It's difficult to estimate just how important these fields
are, and therefore how to judge the contributions each of these men
made to humanity.  I'll settle on only one example and quote from the
at-times annoying Bart Kosko's _Fuzzy Thinking_ (fuzzy logic) book:

	"Pound for pound and bit for bit the Kalman filter belongs
with the light bulb and the radio and the microprocessor in its
engineering benefits for mankind.  In many ways it goes beyond these
since it is just a set of equations.  Like all math the Kalman filter
is eternal...  Yet, most people have never heard of the Kalman filter.
It guides airplanes and space probe and cruise missiles and tracks
satellites and economic trends and changes in your bloodstream.  ...
Did you ever wonder how a missile finds its target or how the
astronauts find their way home?  The Kalman filter shows them
how. ... Thousands of engineers have published small tweaks and
variants of the Kalman filter."

	No kidding!  I spent two summers ago running Matlab
simulations on, yes guessed it, a Kalman filter.  Jordan (MIT's neural
networks prof) has said similar things about the Kalman filter and
system/information/control variants upon it: that it flies our
airplanes including commercial jets, controls our robots and
spacecraft, fine tunes the nuclear power plants and chemical
engineering power plants, steers our ships, filters our satellite
signals.

	Most of Wall Street and almost all of the world's financial
traffic is handled by computer algorithms, most of them in the spirit
of the Kalman filter or recursive estimation in general.  If/when I
become a machine intelligence, all my sensors will be run by Kalman
filter-like control mechanisms.

	The field of optimization and control makes me wonder at times
if machine learning is what I should do instead of neurocomputation.
I'm learning in my control class that in the last 10 years or so
nonlinear adaptive control has really come into its own.

	For example, robots can now do parameter estimation of their
environment (say it wants to swing a bat optimally) that estimates 15
or more parameters in <0.1 seconds!  It picks up an object, and before
it's moved it more than a centimeter, it's task-driven learning has
managed to figure out all it needs to.  But this isn't that
surprising: a military jetfighter has to fill such performance
criteria as well.  Some of those jets would spontaneously explode if
it weren't for sophisticated control mechanisms.

	Keep in mind much of the linear or linearization work was done
in the '60s, much of it at MIT.  This is not the sexiest of fields,
but it's important work.  In case you didn't know, most of MIT's
prestige is based upon the prominent position its electrical
engineering, signal processing, and control department held after
WWII.  Radar, and then the entire electrical engineering (and to a
lesser extent aerospace) collaboration with the giant
industrial-military complex.  Wiener's _Cybernetics_ was the most
famous statement of MIT's theoretical contributions to these fields.
_Cybernetics_: "Seminal books...comparable in ultimate importance
to...Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill" (_New York Times_).

	To show how unappreciated these fields are, Francis Crick
recently published an journal article that he thinks the amplifier
model might be really important for neurons, but the gain of our
neural amplifiers must be low or otherwise we'd be going haywire.  The
man has obviously not taken 6.003 -- he doesn't know the first thing
about feedback control!

CONCLUSION:

	Anyhow, I kind of got sidetracked by my examples.  But back to
motivations, ultimate goals.  I basically want to understand the
universe, whatever is most fascinating, and I'm blessed/cursed enough
to find a great many things really nifty.

	But I am going to die, and it really forced me (and Jason) to
think hard about this.  The Extropians pamphlet and whatever followed
was an outcome of this angst.  It's taken me through a hell of a half
year, but now I'm back to doing science.  Any why?  For a lot of
reasons.

	As for how ambitious I am, and as for the issue of pedagogy
and how much it contributes to humanity, well, at the least, I will be
a good professor.  If I'm no good at research, or if for some reason
I'm disenchanted by science, I will write textbooks and maybe activist
screeds as well.  It takes, what, 3 years to write a really good
textbook?  Maybe up to 5 for the hardest fields.  Well, I've got a lot
of years left in me before I kick the bucket.  :) I hope the
biologists keep making breakthroughs in life extension.

	But wait on that promise...textbooks are usually written by
people in their 40's or later, and there's a reason for that.

	Dammit, a third of my waking hours, I'm cursing myself out for
being fucking slow or lazy.  But others went through the same thing...
And some of them lived significant, excellent lives...so this shall
content me, too.  :)

What I've heard from graphite-coated steel balls (can't asess the truth,
since coming from an electronic source -- probably the nanotech archives,
yet plausible-sounding), they survived just fine.

The typical inertia-confined nuke uses a massive metal lining to confine
the fissible device kernal during about one the microsecond the nuclear
reaction takes to completion (don't know much about thermonuclear weapons
just now). Accompanying release of neutrons (anybody know the typical
concentration?) flashes throught the device, and, getting absorbed, heats
it quite suddenly. After that by many absorbance/reradiation steps the
entire device turns into a more-or-less homogenous (?) ball of dense
plasma of roughly 20-100 MK, which radiates mostly in the Xray region.
Ignoring the effects of air, the graphite coated steel balls (few ten m
from ground zero) experience assymetric explosive ablation due to absorbed
EM radiation, and hence a strong acceleration. (It is probably not a good
idea for human observers to persist up to this stage). If ever the spheres
get engulfed by a nuke fireball, then at a much later, milder stage.

Don't ask me about the exact size, location, and composition of these
spheres, and on their weight loss after the experience, though.

Well, ok, I have to admit that I'd rather be pretty far away from any such
business. There is always some nonzero chance you wind up playing ground
zero, and you can suffer death from explosive decompression due to
hermetic hull puncture by debris, rad sickness (neutron nukes), etc. War
is only fun in a movie, or in a theoretical treatise. Imo, the more
theoretical, the better.

That would seem to assume the event is pretty close. The good thing about
space habitats, especially orbiting ones, is that there is/have to be
plenty of space inbetween. Your eggs are most assuredly not in a single
basket.

>From the very few things I remember from my Atkins, the energy radiated by
a blackbody is proportional to T^4. However, the emission maximum gets
shifted to short wavelengths with higher temperature, which makes matter
far from being a perfect reflector/absorber. So you've got quite a few mm
of material suddenly heated, comparatively slowly exploding into space. 
Moreover the effect is brief, the nuke fireball in space cooling very
rapidly, I'd hazard a roughly exponential decay of the temperature.  Also,
assuming wide habitat separation, on the average that means a few km
between me and ground zero.

I wouldn't want to face a nuke from that close while on a spacewalk (btw,
anybody knows whatever happened to these NASA study suits made from
several layers of thin rubber instead of bulky constant-volume-joint
monsters which are used now?), but it sounds highly survivable while
sitting in a large space habitat, shielded by several m of mineral/metal. 
It would be interesting to assess the impacts of a deep-burrowing nuke
exploding in a few-km asteroid/comet kernal, the low density of the
material considered.

All very true, but really not applicable to my scenario described above. I
must play Dr. Strangelove's flamboyant rodeo to really experience the
dramatic effects you've just described. Antimatter pellets fired from a
matter catapult into a small spacecraft would probably demonstrate such
effects. 

Btw, anybody knows what the highest achieved current in a proton
accelerator was? According data for record particle density in a neutral
jet?

All true, but these poor blokes haven't got the arming codes. Assuming the
command-control structure is still centralistic, and the arming procedure
is similiar to the U.S. model, the launch commands must come from someone
standing pretty high in the hierarchy. Which, of course, doesn't mean it
can't happen. 

Furthermore, the time fortunately works for us. As in the west, the
devices have not been designed to be recyclable. Aged nukes don't have
deterministic yield anymore (and are more dirty), nukes gone sour are
highly unreliable. Modern high-performance nukes, being high-tuned
devices, do not age gracefully. 

While the nuke dangers are admittedly nonnegliegeable, the militant
molecular biologist Friends of the Earth or the walking virus bombs from
Jihad Unltd. scenario does worry me significantly more. Then the shit
hitting the fan always tends to hit you from an unexpected angle...

Not true. :)  Radiation pressure is not a significant compressant
of the fusion fuel, though this was an interesting false lead for
the journalist who almost went to jail (and whose name I cannot
remember).  A dense plastic foam (sorta like styrofoam) is 
packed around the fusion fuel, and vaporized in a very short time
by the x-ray pulse from the fission device.  It is the exploding
foam that compresses the fusion fuel.  There is a thick cap of
U-238 between the fission device and the fusion fuel, precisely
to *prevent* the radiation from hitting the fusion fuel directly 
before compression can occur.

[ Please direct replies to extropians-moderated@mit.edu. ]

	I may as well announce it now.  3 weeks ago, I stepped down
from the Extropians club that I cofounded with Jason Davis to finally,
at last give science my all.

	Why don't I just forward the two emails I sent to the
extropians@mit.edu list?  They say everything I want to say, and more.

	And with that, this club, the still-derecognized MIT
Extropians, passes to whatever form it chooses to evolve itself into.
I'll still forward useful information.  But whoever wishes to lead --
our lists, next year's pamphlet, our group, its guiding philosophy --
the door is completely wide open for you to do so.

	And so, I wish you all the best -- that you may achieve what
you set out to attain.

*--Forwarded message follows-----------------------------------------*

	There's a reason for our 2-list breakup.  It was a necessary
bifurcation.  I mean this literally, as in a second-order phase
transition with two distinct phases.  If time provided, I could make
the difference evident, sharp, but I've been too busy to even post my
"stepping down" email.

	As for -discussion, I happen to think the topics are
legitimate topics.  -- but still...well...sigh...off the mark in many
different ways.

	Keep your eyes out for what happens in "large" intellectual
discussions.  Right after our first Extropian gathering, I told Jason
that it's a deep fact that large forums left to themselves inevitably
default to talking about:

	-politics
	-economics
	-religion

	And lo and behold, left to itself, that is exactly what goes
through -discussion these days.  These are *fine* topics, but I think
there are ultimately more rewarding topics.  But maybe I'm putting the
cart before the horse.  After all, I spent my years on politics,
economics, religion, was a Counterpoint Editor-in-Chief, cofounder of
SAFE (MIT's free speech group), the libertarians email list, and
Extropians.  So who am I to talk?

	These issues are the "contentious" issues involving large,
often powerfully organized power structures, paradigms, morality.  I
was always known for asking people 3 questions, always:

	1) are you religious?  if not, what's your epistemology?
	2) do you believe in immortality for humanity?  are you personally
		interested in it?  why or why not?
	3) what are your political views?

	I file away all these answers.  Ally or non-ally, that's one
of my first classifications.  Folks, like it or not, life is
contentious and will remain so.

	Well, I guess there needs to be a forum for politics,
religion, and economics, sprinkled with some immortality and science
talk.  I only wish people would spontaneously discuss *these* issues:

	1) what drives you, what do you want above all else
	2) what could help you, what's holding you back from it
	3) what are you doing about it, are you happy about what you're doing

	I had hoped our Extropians pamphlet would point the way to
what is important.  By its very rather unusual nature, and the fact
that people *obviously* felt it was important and worth responding to
-- I hoped people would learn.  But our list is dominated by a lot of
intellectual followers.

	I want to understand the universe and change the world.  After
much thought, I decided both are best served if I pursue science and
put activism on the backburner.  It will always be there, and I will
always have the opportunity.  But later.  And I would leave changing
the world to others if I could.

	In the meantime, I am taking: 2.152 (nonlinear control), 7.05
(biochem), 8.059 (quantum 3), 8.08 (stat mech 2), 8.334 (grad stat
mech 2), 9.371 (differential geometry), 18.702 (algebra 2).  Even with
that, I spend 1/3 of my time during the week learning and thinking
about material outside my classes.  I work 75-85 hour weeks, about 2/3
of which I consider useful work.  Of that, maybe 1/4 is really
insightful learning.  But you know, even if you plod, you're still
soaking information.

	There is so much I want to understand!  I wish I could do
everything, learn everything.  I can't, dammit, I'm strapped by my
body, mind, mortality.  Damn it, curse it, but restrained I am, most
of all by my willpower.

	So how well have I been doing?  Fairly well.  My problem sets
have been decent.  It takes getting used to, but you can learn to pump
5-7 out per week.  What I really regret is every hour I waste not
reflecting more deeply about the science, not making the insights or
connections that really bring clarity to what I'm doing.  I resent the
hours when I'm taken away from one subject to work on another.  Right
now, I'm stretched thin, and need to scale down my projects.  This
means I need to focus on *only* classes for the next week, rather than
try to understand measure theory, etc.  :)

	My life began 3 weeks ago.  Until then, I wasn't living.  And
I knew it.

	But now it's for real, and god, it's so exciting, so scary.
What if it's all for nothing?  What if knowledge is just a lot of
pretty theory?  What if the greatest science needs breakthroughs
(especially mind science) that won't happen in my life?  What if I'm
just a nothing?  I already know I can be a great pedagogue, a great
teacher -- but what about research?  Scientists aren't remembered for
pedagogy.  What if I'm 40 and I know the reason I failed was because
of a lack of will -- how could I live with myself then?  Or if I'm in
the wrong field, and wasted 20 years on an illusion or lesser field?
What if I should have done something else?  Writing?  Activism?

	Every person must go through this and come to grips with it
alone.  Ultimately nobody can possibly help you.

	So take heart, yon Extropians, the struggles are real - but
you wouldn't want to live any other way.

Subject: inspiration, motivation, major achievements in science and engineering

[ This email is a mouthful, but hey, I put some good stuff in it, so
I hope you get something out of it. ]

	Thanks for the responses, guys.  Two people emailed me already
on the main list asking what happened 3 weeks ago.  :)

	Actually, Ed, I did mean a second order phase transition. :)
-moderated and -discussion slowly differentiate and the system would
undergo "spontaneous symmetry breaking" because I'd only send good
stuff to -moderated.  But hey, first-order (discontinous) works, too.

	Funny, "phase transition" is not found in the index of
Strogatz's nonlinear dynamics text.  And not once in 8.334 (which Ed
and I are taking) did I hear anyone say a phase transition is a
bifurcation in the Landau free energy Psi(m) function.

	Jason asks: Who's Landau?  Geez, Jason.  :) All I've been
learning in the first 3 weeks of 8.059 are Landau levels in the
presence of a magnetic field and in 8.334 about the Landau free energy
function.  :) I'm not exagerrating.  Landau probably contributed more
to mean field theory, and thereby to modern statistical mechanics'
critical phenomena and condensed matter physics, than any other
physicist.  But Ed was referring to Landau's pedagogy.  Here, I'll
quote from Gasiorowicz, p. 503, "The [Quantum Mechanics] book by
Landau and Lifschitz is one of a series of superb books covering all
of theoretical physics."  It's the only series of its kind.  Granted,
other physicists also left a solid written legacy.  Feynmann's justly
famous _Feynmann Lectures_ and several textbooks (among them stat
mech, QED) and even lectures on computation and gravitation.  Steven
Weinberg wrote textbooks on quantum field theory and general
relativity, the two as yet irreconciliable theories in physics, texts
used in MIT's grad classes.

	I've been going off on this to illustrate a point about how
fame is distributed in science, and to ask how important is it really.
You can't ignore these issues.  In my physics classes of 1998,
probability says some person sitting in them is eventually going to
win the Nobel Prize.  Who is he?  How does he learn or research that's
different from anybody else?  And if I were to take enough biology
classes, I could say the same, more by sheer mass of # of people
taking these classes, and the fact that MIT is #1 in molecular
biology.  These things matter.  We work for idealism, learning,
knowledge, but don't tell me you chose your scientific or engineering
applications without a thought of personal ambition.

	Landau was an excellent case point.  "The great Russian
physicist Lev Landau," as my excellent 8.059 lectures notes say, but
how many people outside physics know this?  Similarly, Murray
Gell-Mann.  We didn't even mention names like Murray Gell-Mann in our
Extropian pamphlet.  Yet, even if particle physics is one of highly
competitive endeavors where a lot of people are working on it at any
time, Gell-Mann is still the man generally most given credit for:
quarks, symmetry, and renormalization theory.  This is huge!

	And quite unlike what a lot of people say about genius in
their twenties, both of these men did a lot of their great work past
their 30's.  Feynmann: QED by age of 31 (path integrals, Feynmann
diagrams), liquid helium and superfluidity mid-30's, weak
interaction/beta decay (which he thought was his greatest work), which
was by 39.  In his mid-40's (early 1960's), he did the Feynmann
lectures.  Einstein's general relativity: mid 30's.

	What does this mean?  It means these men were generally doing
their greatest work a full decade or longer after they first started
taking physics classes for real.  This is far from the standard myth
of young genius.  Folks, it only happens in math, where you have
prodigies, and even then, many a mathematician's greatest work is done
in the years of his full maturity.  Norbert Weiner was a child
prodigy, yes, but his greatest opus (which made its way into
Cybernetics) was done when he was sporting a great beard.

	(I did an overview this January of famous composers.  Brahms
is the only composer who finished a powerful, Promethean work when he
was 25: the Brahms First Piano Concerto (my theme piece).  All other
composers did their great work in their 30's or later.  Mozart wrote
nothing of major consequence until he was 29 (the 20th piano
concerto).  All his great operas were in his early 30's until he died
at 35 having not completed his Requiem (arguably his greatest
non-opera piece).  Quite a contrast from the Mozart child prodigy myth
spawn by _Amadeus_, eh?  Beethoven finished his 3rd, 5th, and 9th at
34, 38, 53 respectively.  Mahler wrote his greatest symphonies 5 and 6
in his early 40's.)

	Again, the lesson is clear.  Ramanujuan and child prodigy
stories are rare.  People often do their greatest creative work after
years, often 10 or more, from their first training.  It is true in
composition, it is often very true in writing (but not always; Asimov
and Orson Scott Card's most famous novels were finished for the most
part by late 20's -- but hey, that's almost 10 years isn't it?)

	Back to people people who aren't given their proper due...

	Arthur Kornberg of biology.  DNA Polymerase 1 and 3, RNA
transcriptase.  Watson and Crick discovered the double helix
structure, fine, but Kornberg isolated the major enzymes that
replicate DNA and transcribe RNA, surely a greater overall
contribution than Watson and Crick's.  From what I can tell in 7.05,
he strikes me as the greatest biochemist/molecular biologist of his
time.  Double helix structure, fine...so we know the shape of DNA.
Important, yes.  But the runaway success of molecular biology is
entirely due to the amazing enzymes.  What much if not most of
molecular biology is, with their gels and whatnot, are basically
throwing enzymes at DNA, RNA.  DNA is just the code; it's the enzymes
that are the machinery that make life work, and those machines are so
sophisticated it makes me want to hurl every time I see the word
"nanotechnology."  All the "telomerase" and other stuff you're hearing
about: enzymes.  How many people even recognize the name?  Arthur
Kornberg.  Did his Nobel-winning work in his late 30's.  (There are at
least a half dozen other molecular biologists I'm not giving credit
to.)

	Hodgkin-Huxley: mathematical model for action potentials in
the nerve.  It's the *only* successful neurocomputational model so far
after all these decades, and the *only* successful mathematical model
in biology (for which these two won their Nobel Prizes in).  Theirs
was a lifetime of dedicated, painstaking research, and the model for
what neurocomputation should aspire to be.

	John Bardeen, the only man to have won two Nobel Prizes in
physics, one for the transistor effect, the other for
superconductivity.  Damn!  That's all I need to say about it.

	Steve Smale and other less well-known mathematicians of chaos
theory and differential equations (which is what the field used to be
called before "nonlinear dynamics and chaos" became a big deal).
There are at least two "schools" of dynamic systems, and Smale started
on of them by tying topology to dynamics.  It is a very strange fact
that MIT has, to the best of my knowledge, never offered a course in
topological dynamics (!).  But then, the story of dynamics is still
very wide open and much remains to be written...

	I'll leave with one final topic: estimation, information,
systems, dynamics, control, optimization, operations research.  These
fields are so broad and diffuse and interrelated it's hard to
appreciate them in their entirety.  Gauss in 1800's invented
deterministic least squares.  Fisher in 1910's: invented maximum
likelihood estimation.  Wineer in 1940's and for the rest of his life:
Wiener filters, and other stuff that made its way into stochastics.
Kalman in 1960's with the Kalman filter.  Kolmogorov in the '60's with
a host of contributions to probability.  Shannon, of course, with
information theory.  Lyapunov in the 19th century, and other work
later in the '60s (LaSalle, Barbalat, others).  A lot of what made
MIT's Course 6 "Area One" famous: the LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian)
formulation which Athans and others are famous for, the canonical
Oppenheim & Willsky textbooks on signals and systems and Oppenheim's
and Shafer's reference textbook on DSP, both of which needless to say,
are enormous industrially.

	It's difficult to estimate just how important these fields
are, and therefore how to judge the contributions each of these men
made to humanity.  I'll settle on only one example and quote from the
at-times annoying Bart Kosko's _Fuzzy Thinking_ (fuzzy logic) book:

	"Pound for pound and bit for bit the Kalman filter belongs
with the light bulb and the radio and the microprocessor in its
engineering benefits for mankind.  In many ways it goes beyond these
since it is just a set of equations.  Like all math the Kalman filter
is eternal...  Yet, most people have never heard of the Kalman filter.
It guides airplanes and space probe and cruise missiles and tracks
satellites and economic trends and changes in your bloodstream.  ...
Did you ever wonder how a missile finds its target or how the
astronauts find their way home?  The Kalman filter shows them
how. ... Thousands of engineers have published small tweaks and
variants of the Kalman filter."

	No kidding!  I spent two summers ago running Matlab
simulations on, yes guessed it, a Kalman filter.  Jordan (MIT's neural
networks prof) has said similar things about the Kalman filter and
system/information/control variants upon it: that it flies our
airplanes including commercial jets, controls our robots and
spacecraft, fine tunes the nuclear power plants and chemical
engineering power plants, steers our ships, filters our satellite
signals.

	Most of Wall Street and almost all of the world's financial
traffic is handled by computer algorithms, most of them in the spirit
of the Kalman filter or recursive estimation in general.  If/when I
become a machine intelligence, all my sensors will be run by Kalman
filter-like control mechanisms.

	The field of optimization and control makes me wonder at times
if machine learning is what I should do instead of neurocomputation.
I'm learning in my control class that in the last 10 years or so
nonlinear adaptive control has really come into its own.

	For example, robots can now do parameter estimation of their
environment (say it wants to swing a bat optimally) that estimates 15
or more parameters in <0.1 seconds!  It picks up an object, and before
it's moved it more than a centimeter, it's task-driven learning has
managed to figure out all it needs to.  But this isn't that
surprising: a military jetfighter has to fill such performance
criteria as well.  Some of those jets would spontaneously explode if
it weren't for sophisticated control mechanisms.

	Keep in mind much of the linear or linearization work was done
in the '60s, much of it at MIT.  This is not the sexiest of fields,
but it's important work.  In case you didn't know, most of MIT's
prestige is based upon the prominent position its electrical
engineering, signal processing, and control department held after
WWII.  Radar, and then the entire electrical engineering (and to a
lesser extent aerospace) collaboration with the giant
industrial-military complex.  Wiener's _Cybernetics_ was the most
famous statement of MIT's theoretical contributions to these fields.
_Cybernetics_: "Seminal books...comparable in ultimate importance
to...Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill" (_New York Times_).

	To show how unappreciated these fields are, Francis Crick
recently published an journal article that he thinks the amplifier
model might be really important for neurons, but the gain of our
neural amplifiers must be low or otherwise we'd be going haywire.  The
man has obviously not taken 6.003 -- he doesn't know the first thing
about feedback control!

CONCLUSION:

	Anyhow, I kind of got sidetracked by my examples.  But back to
motivations, ultimate goals.  I basically want to understand the
universe, whatever is most fascinating, and I'm blessed/cursed enough
to find a great many things really nifty.

	But I am going to die, and it really forced me (and Jason) to
think hard about this.  The Extropians pamphlet and whatever followed
was an outcome of this angst.  It's taken me through a hell of a half
year, but now I'm back to doing science.  Any why?  For a lot of
reasons.

	As for how ambitious I am, and as for the issue of pedagogy
and how much it contributes to humanity, well, at the least, I will be
a good professor.  If I'm no good at research, or if for some reason
I'm disenchanted by science, I will write textbooks and maybe activist
screeds as well.  It takes, what, 3 years to write a really good
textbook?  Maybe up to 5 for the hardest fields.  Well, I've got a lot
of years left in me before I kick the bucket.  :) I hope the
biologists keep making breakthroughs in life extension.

	But wait on that promise...textbooks are usually written by
people in their 40's or later, and there's a reason for that.

	Dammit, a third of my waking hours, I'm cursing myself out for
being fucking slow or lazy.  But others went through the same thing...
And some of them lived significant, excellent lives...so this shall
content me, too.  :)

The subject of first or at least early space colonies has developed out of the
ocean enclave thread, with two basic issues being discussed: 1) how
will/should the first space colonies be built 2) claiming of property off
Earth and 3) where should they be situated.  (I leave the last subject for
another post.)

In a message dated 98-02-28 09:35:34 EST, den Otter wrote:

Even tongue in cheek, there are a couple of basic questions here: "Claiming"
extraterrestrial territory or resources and what sort of launching platform,
physical and otherwise, would be needed here on Earth for such an enterprise.

As to "claiming" things off Earth, the only certain legal regime at this time
is the UN Outer Space Treaty, which clearly prohibits claims of sovereignty
over the territory in or zones of space.  This primary function of the UNOST
is an artifact of Cold War rivalry but, in the mid- to long-term may well be
one of the most important legacies of that period, keeping terrestrial nation
states out of the business of legislating off Earth as much as we could hope
for had we set up the legal regime ourselves.

The treaty also provides for the possibility of private ownership of resources
"extracted from" extraterrestrial objects, but makes no provision for private
territorial property.  If you're interested in these subjects, a good overview
of BASIC space law can be found in:

	PLAYING THE COMMERCIAL SPACE GAME: 
		TIME FOR A NEW RULE BOOK?
	Lawrence D. Roberts, Scott Pace and Glenn H. Reynolds
	http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/LawArticle1.html

The Archimedes Institute maintains a nice library of space law and space
development materials at:

	http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/

Plans exist now for testing the regime of law that would govern claims that
amount to private property in the "territory" of an asteroid.  The most
developed such plans appears to be SpaceDev, Inc.'s "NEAP" (Near Earth
Asteroid Prospector):

	http://www.spacedev.com/

NEAP will make a claim of ownership to the rock it visits, thereby explicitly
attempting to set a precedent for such ownership claims elsewhere.  In this
connection, the Archimedes Institute is attempting to establish a regime of
property claims.  I recommend visiting their claim registry site, as they
propose an interesting hierarchy of claims based on physical human visitation
("Class A" claims), physical robotic visitation ("Class B" claims),
observation of a previously unknown body ("Class C" claims) and any other kind
of claim ("Class D" claims).  Claims of higher class trump claims of lower
class and no claims for open space are provided for and are therefore
presumably prohibited under the regime they propose.

This seems like a well thought out, but very basic, framework for private
territorial property rights.  Matters for further development would surely
include the issue of lapsing of unused claims or, as we call it here on earth
(err, I mean in the Anglo-American legal system), the law of "adverse
possession".  As I think about it this morning, I can't see any reason why the
existing body of law relating to adverse possession wouldn't work on
extraterrestrial bodies, but of course that whole chain of thought leads
immediately to the need for a juridical system for resolution of conflicting
claims beyond the merest registry.  Nevertheless, a registry for claims is a
vital first step.

The bottom line: If you want some dirt off Earth, you gotta find it and go
there.

As to getting there, den Otter rightly points out that getting up out of this
gravity well is the first step and that there might be a role for the maritime
environment in that effort.  Fortunately, the last few years has seen a
flowering of private development in this arena.  I've collected at least some
links to such efforts in the launch systems section of my own space page, "The
Deep Black":

	http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html

Boeing's Sea Launch program is premised on what has always been a natural
connection between the maritime environment and space systems:

	http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/sealaunch/

Launch vehicles and their associated equipment are BIG machines and no better
medium exists for moving large masses of stuff on Earth than the ocean.
Likewise, boosters continue to have a nasty habit of careening off course and
blowing up, so doing things at sea or near it is also a good idea.  Sea Launch
takes advantage of both factors and adds a third, offering the ability to
position their launch platform just about anywhere they can find sufficient
draft and decent weather.  They will loft a Hughes satellite aboard a Russian-
built Zenit booster off of their Norwegian-built semi-submersible mobile
launch platform from the equatorial seas south of Hawaii some time this year.
The use of a mobile semi-sub employing buoyancy, stability and positioning
technology proven in the offshore drilling field is brilliant.  And best of
all, although this is BIG business, it's by and large non-governmental and
will be available for hire.  It's possible (but I think unlikely) that someone
else will try the same thing.

Meanwhile, more exotic land-based launch systems are moving ahead from design
to implementation.  The Rotary Rocket project and a couple of innovative
spaceplanes will be making LEO much more accessible in the 2005-2015 time
period, at least for relatively small payloads.

The Modern method of rehabilitation, taking a human monster who grew up in

I don't know what you mean by "factors" but if you're rational it means you 
have other reasons why those reasons were not sufficient, it's not just a 
coincidence that the word "reason" means intelligence and also means cause.
Without the slightest doubt, everything absolutely everything happens because 
of cause and effect OR it does not, and if it does not then it is by 
definition random.

Obviously, but the point is that you're not so inclined so you can't make  
those choices, and there are reasons for having that particular inclination.

Of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a restaurant. 
Why?    
Because I want to.    
Why?   
Because I want to eat.   
Why?   
Because I'm hungry?    
Why ?   
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses in my stomach , my brain 
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try to  
stop it.    
Why?   
Because I don't like pain.  
Why?    
Because that's the way my brain is constructed.    
Why? 
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the information   
in my genetic code  (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits per base pair   
8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, you could put it on a little 
700 meg hard disk with stacker)  the programming of my brain came from the  
environment, add a little quantum randomness perhaps and of my own free will   
I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.

30 years ago Dr. Jose Delgato of Yale University approached several people 
about to undergo brain surgery for medical reasons, and asked them if he 
could implant some electrodes in their brain at the same time. Some agreed. 
This experiment would be difficult or impossible to perform today without 
getting a lot of flack from self proclaimed ethics experts.  Even then he
got into some trouble for doing it, and he got into  even more trouble for 
his excessive showmanship. For publicity he implanted an electrode into a 
bull's brain, got dressed up as a matador,  stepped into a ring with him, and 
stopped the bull in mid charge by remote control. The animal rights people 
were not amused.

Anyway, he was able to experiment with people. In one case when the electrode 
was fired the man would always turn his head to the left. The interesting 
thing was that the man said he felt free,  he couldn't even tell when the 
electrode was turned on. The patient was always able to come up with good 
reasons for turning to the left. He would say "I'm looking for my slippers"
or "I heard a noise" or "I was looking under the bed".  This man was 
intelligent and rational, he never said I'm looking for Martians, and felt 
perfectly free. In all cases he thought turning his head was his own idea, 
he felt free because he was, he was doing what he wanted to do.

I think the man was perfectly correct when he said "I'm looking for my 
slippers" that's exactly what he was doing. Nobody could convince him that he 
didn't really want his slippers because he truly did, he just didn't 
understand why he wanted them.

The Modern method of rehabilitation, taking a human monster who grew up in 
a bad environment and locking him into the most horrible environment on the 
planet crammed with other monsters for a decade or two, is not noted for 
producing marked improvements in character. These creatures need 
Nanotechnology to rewire their brains, however we don't have Nanotechnology

I don't know what you mean by "factors" but if you're rational it means you 
have other reasons why those reasons were not sufficient, it's not just a 
coincidence that the word "reason" means intelligence and also means cause.
Without the slightest doubt, everything absolutely everything happens because 
of cause and effect OR it does not, and if it does not then it is by 
definition random.

Obviously, but the point is that you're not so inclined so you can't make  
those choices, and there are reasons for having that particular inclination.

Of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a restaurant. 
Why?    
Because I want to.    
Why?   
Because I want to eat.   
Why?   
Because I'm hungry?    
Why ?   
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses in my stomach , my brain 
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try to  
stop it.    
Why?   
Because I don't like pain.  
Why?    
Because that's the way my brain is constructed.    
Why? 
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the information   
in my genetic code  (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits per base pair   
8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, you could put it on a little 
700 meg hard disk with stacker)  the programming of my brain came from the  
environment, add a little quantum randomness perhaps and of my own free will   
I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.

When most people talk about free will they are not right or wrong, a burp is  
not right or wrong either, it's just a noise.

30 years ago Dr. Jose Delgato of Yale University approached several people 
about to undergo brain surgery for medical reasons, and asked them if he 
could implant some electrodes in their brain at the same time. Some agreed. 
This experiment would be difficult or impossible to perform today without 
getting a lot of flack from self proclaimed ethics experts.  Even then he
got into some trouble for doing it, and he got into  even more trouble for 
his excessive showmanship. For publicity he implanted an electrode into a 
bull's brain, got dressed up as a matador,  stepped into a ring with him, and 
stopped the bull in mid charge by remote control. The animal rights people 
were not amused.

Anyway, he was able to experiment with people. In one case when the electrode 
was fired the man would always turn his head to the left. The interesting 
thing was that the man said he felt free,  he couldn't even tell when the 
electrode was turned on. The patient was always able to come up with good 
reasons for turning to the left. He would say "I'm looking for my slippers"
or "I heard a noise" or "I was looking under the bed".  This man was 
intelligent and rational, he never said I'm looking for Martians, and felt 
perfectly free. In all cases he thought turning his head was his own idea, 
he felt free because he was, he was doing what he wanted to do.

I think the man was perfectly correct when he said "I'm looking for my 
slippers" that's exactly what he was doing. Nobody could convince him that he 
didn't really want his slippers because he truly did, he just didn't 
understand why he wanted them.

The reason why I think developing sea based enclaves now is a good idea is that it
is an excellent and low cost test bed/training center for long term
habitation/colonization in space. For example the figures I beleive that John
Clark contributed of supertanker costs indicates that these are relatively cheap.
A couple tens of millions for a whole supertanker? wow. A freind of mine built a
custom sailboat in Seattle for $5 mill (125 feet). The Artemis Project, on the
other hand, which proposes sending a couple people to the moon to build a small
shack sized hut, plans on spending $1.5 billion.

However, since the US never signed or ratified this treaty, then any operations
originating from the US are not bound by this treaty. This includes any launches
originating from ANY U.S. posession, like the Marianas Islands, Puerto Rico, etc.
Even if you launch from another site, if you 'reflag' once you get into space,
then you are sitting happy. In any event, its not like the UN has any space
capability of its own. How can you enforce a law when you have no means of
enforcement? As recent events indicate, enforcement of UN 'laws' only occurs when
the US indicates a willingness to bomb somebody. Since its not in the US's
interest to enforce this particular treaty, then I doubt very much that it has any
hope of ever gaining any teeth.

   IAN: Natasha asks all the right questions that spontaneously 
   answer themselves (talk about efficient!).  But at the same 
   time Doug raises an important question that pertains to the 
   meaning of transhuman. I think that the answer here is that 
   "transhumanization" is not equivalent to "dehumanization," 
   even though such an equivalence can be extrapolated from 
   the term "transhuman."

   To become transhuman need not imply becoming dehumanized. 
   What is the point of living forever is all sensory pleasure 
   is nullified? I suspect that our desire to live revolves 
   around the desire to experience more pleasure and joy. Art 
   is joy. And "art" is more that graphics: to the mathematician
   math is more than empty numbers, to the mathematician there 
   is beauty and thus joy and de facto art in the math. So "art"
   is far more than the class of things commonly called "art." 

   A broader definition of art could be: an ordering of elements
   that invokes sensual experience, generally pleasurable exper-
   ience. Recently I vacationed in Naples, Florida, and walking 
   around those fabulous homes and trees I realized that I was 
   walking in art, I realized that what made the area I was in
   so "high class" and beautiful was simply the artistic, and as
   such sensually pleasurable, ordering of all the atoms in the 
   area. If you took all those same atoms and scrambled them 
   up, it could be a mess, a slop house. So art is an ordering
   of elements the sum of which produces a sensual experience;
   a sensual experience that would not exist if all those same
   elements assumed a different order. In that respect, art 
   transcends the physical entities of which it is composed,
   and in some way that is also what transhumanism is about.

   Life without joy, life without art, is not life, and there-
   fore an eternal life without "art" is not an eternal life. 
   So I think the point here, with respect to the mechanics of 
   transcendence, is that the uploaded human that is uploaded 
   into a system that does not allow for the experience of joy,
   is as good as dead. I suspect that you cannot be a computer,
   and therefore some giant steps forward are necessary before 
   the full transhumanist ideal can become a plausible reality.
   And it stands to reason that an understanding of what is art 
   is an integral feature of understanding what it is to be a
   human and thus what it will take to become a transhuman.

I'm helping a European documentary crew wiith a three-part show on
transhumanist themes. Part of my unofficial role is to encourage them to
present the visual side of the ideas in as appealing manner as possible. It
looks like I've succeeded in persuading the producer to drop most of the
typical horror images (Frankenstein, Reanimator), but he's looking for
good, positive film images of human transformation.

Can you think of short scenes from movies or TV that would illustrate
humans transforming? (Or images good for other sections such as on
cryonics, nano, AI, uploading, etc.) Humor is good -- for instance for
cryonics I suggested Sleeper, where Woody Allen is unwrapped from the
aluminum foil and welcomed into the future.

It's hard to find many non-horror images of humans transforming, so I'd
welcome any suggestions. The more positive, optimistic, humorous images we
can put in, the more favorably the transhumanist message should be conveyed.

Thanks,

Max

Exactly! This is a meme we should really do our best to dispell, since
it is so common and so convenient for our attackers (rule no. 1 of all
propaganda: dehumanize your opponent). In swedish we can at least pun
"medmnsklighet och mermnsklighet" (compassion and transhumanity,
lit. "morehumanity") :-)

  IAN: It just occured to me that there is an identity
  (same as) relation between the more-logical theories
  of self or "soul" and the definition of art I stated.

  The most persuasive argument about the nature of the 
  individual "soul" that I've heard is that it is more 
  than the atoms of which the brain is composed, but
  this "more" is not a supernatural spirit, it's simply
  the ordering of those atoms. I recall reading in the 
  journal Free Inquiry that the soul is likened to the 
  difference between a pile of lumber and bricks (atoms)
  and a constructed house (brain). So the house is more 
  than its elements, but to assume that this "more" is 
  a spirit, a ghost in the machine, is an illusion. 

  OK, so if art is properly defined as "an ordering of 
  material and/or electrical elements that is greater 
  than the sum of those elements and causes sensual
  experience" and if consciousness is also properly 
  defined as "an ordering of material and/or electrical 
  elements that is greater than the sum of those ele-
  ments and causes sensual experience," then lo and
  behold, it follows directly that art = consciousness.

  The statement that "art expresses who you are" is
  such a truism it draws a yawn, but the logical iden-
  tity I just proposed between art and consciousness 
  would map a most profound example of that truism. 
  It would therefore truly follow in the most intimate 
  way that understanding what is art is integral to 
  understanding what it is to be a human and thus what 
  it will take to become a transhuman, since the mech-
  anical replication of consciousness/art is the corner-
  stone of the quest for the transhumanist liberation.

Michael would take that as a compliment!  The societal demand for
conventional, bland attractiveness in pop culture bores him to tears.
Actually, this aesthetic still pervades Athens, Ga, a town of very
interesting humans whose very existence in the Deep South never
ceases to amaze me.  They would hook into some of the transhumanist
ideas quite nicely.

Sin,

In my opinion, this is exactly where the line between acceptable and 
unacceptable behavior must be drawn.  If it would cost me less to have 
prevented your actions from infringing on my rights than it would have 
cost you to monitor your actions for their effects on my rights, it is 
my responsibility to protect myself.  Otherwise, you have acted 
irresponsibly and should be required by some outside entity (a policing 
corporation, government, etc.) to make restitution.  Note that intention 
is not a consideration, ignorance or stupidity is no excuse, IMO.

In this way a community can decide on a list of rights (the larger the 
community, the smaller and more basic the list, with communities within 
communities being a possibility) and individuals within the community 
can be maximally productive while their rights are protected.  An 
economic niche in such a society would exist for companies that 
identified which communities had rights that were unacceptable to you 
("Don't go to the U.S., they tax all of your income there!") and which 
communities were ideal.  Another niche would exist for advising people 
on what precautions they should take to protect the rights of others - 
companies could follow court cases (or whatever the mechanism for 
determination of fault is in these kinds of imaginary communities) and 
advise & assist in behaviors that prevent culpable rights infringement.

As a related topic, I see a lot of talk on this list about how 
geographical location is totally unimportant to Extropians, but I 
haven't seen anyone demonstrate how I can guarantee my ability to travel 
from place to place without travelling through an area in which the 
contractual rights are unacceptable to me.

For example, if I belong to some entity (corporation, government, 
whatever) that guarantees my right to all of my property (no involuntary 
taxes or tariffs), and this entity is not tied to some relatively large 
geographical area, how can I walk down the street in front of my house 
with a guarantee that my neighbor doesn't belong to a group that has an 
import tax on what I'm carrying when I walk onto his property?

Is there some basic libertarian fact that addresses these kinds of 
issues?  Also, I don't want a community of complete freedom or one 
completely free of coercion; I want some rights protected and that 
necessarily infringes on the right to complete freedom.  It also 
requires coercion to protect those rights.  Is this issue addressed in 
libertarianism?

Regards,
Bobby Martin

Well, actually, Greg, I think that your words are far more satisfactory

I wonder if it's not so much a question of whether to try and keep someone
alive as of whether to try and maintain their autonomy. A dead person has,
IMHO, no autonomy. If a person tries to take away their own autonomy, one
should stop them. If one draws a line here, one can both save the person's
life, and maintain those libertarian ethics.

Are you sure that these two are mutually exclusive? 

Thanks, Greg. Your light shines through the murk.

I don't know if "ordering" is the best term here, but definitely some
concept that centers around what gives the collection of atoms, or quarks,

quark or bit of substance contribute to the subjective "I" and not the

I don't think that art = consciousness holds up very well because art is
only one category out of many that has consciousness as a prerequisite. 
Transhuman art will arise from expanded consciousness, which will arise
from a deeper and broader grasp of the past, forming a larger springboard
from which to jump farther into the future from.  I think that art will be
seen, in retrospect, to be associated with the universal "beauty"
regardless whether it is human art or posthuman art or alien art.  "The
mechanical replication of consciousness/art" is what I call having
children.  Having children is, in fact, a cornerstone of liberty, because
of the responsibilities associated with child-rearing firmly attaching
themselves to individual rights.  Rights without responsibilities is the
opposite of liberation.

Anders Sandberg wrote 3/1/98: <(rule no. 1 of all propaganda: dehumanize

Exactly so, hence unborn children are referred to as viable tissue mass, or
fetal material, all the better to encourage murder.  For the strong to prey
on the weak, the weak must be defined as negligible.

I have been thinking about people's motivations lately.
Not of all people, but the most adventurous, brilliant,
etc. - those whose experience may be of significance to me.
(And also of those who are not driven by the idea of progress,
just to understand what they feel.)
The goal is quite selfish - to understand what I personally
should accept as a worthy motivation.

There are some obvious drives. Self-respect, power, money,
recognition. They can't drive one too far though, it seems.
Once you reach a comfortable level of these things, their
supportive role is over. They can still play a motivational
role if one wants to get as much of them as possible, but the
continuing motivation by goals that are no longer rational
(and apparently are not analyzed) seems to be a serious
weakness by itself. I would recommend anybody in such
state to stop whatever they are doing for these goals, and
try to understand why they do it, and whether they should.

I feel really sorry sometimes for the world's so called
greatest people who keep running after power and recognition
for many decades. At some point, it seems healthy to liberate
oneself from such need.

There are some drives that may seem non-perversely endless.
Such as desire to improve things for other people, or curiosity
to understand everything that exists, and build everything
worth building and experimenting with.

Let's look at these things closer.

Doing stuff for others has its negative points. As an instinct,
it better be overcome - I really prefer choosing my motivations
consciously, just as I choose my actions. It also fulfills a
need for recognition and feeling of worthiness; I just talked 
about these. In many cases, the desire to be useful stands in
the way of personal development. Working for years on a textbook
on a subject that you know pretty well, or pushing forward some
particular discipline are good for readers and the discipline
(which is why they try to convince you that you should be happy
doing it) but are actually detrimental to your effort to study
the world as a whole. Granted, some of such work can give you
educational personal experience, and it's definitely worth doing
once or twice, but I fail to see how a fifth textbook, a 20th
theorem, or a 300th student can be of much personal use.

Curiosity seems an insatiable thing. You expand yourself, do
new stuff, discover new goals, see what you can achieve and what
you can do when you do - or do not - achieve, learn to play with
your motivational structure, etc. We _are_ limited though in
how much we can discover and assimilate. If you are _reasonably
good_, you can discover N new theories - but with sufficiently 
large N, there seems to be an effect of diminishing personal
returns - you get increasingly reluctant to spend the rest of
your life to come up with another N theories. You've had that
experience before, and N or 2N, you still don't know the world,
so why should you keep running the process that you already
know too well? If you are truly excellent in your exploration,
things may seem still worse. You discover dramatic new things
in new areas that people can no longer understand, you discover
new connections between new fields - and you get bored with each
before anybody can understand what it was that you were doing.
No sharing, no emotional support, no chance to learn from anybody,
and no implementation for your ideas. It's pretty lonely at the top.

When people - who do have some serious personal goals - mature,
they seem to hit these issues. Many people give up on useful work
as both their field and their brain become somewhat stale, and
they no longer have the gratification from achievement. Some
create an illusion of achievement, and hide in it. Some settle
in an area they know well, and have enough intelligence and
persistence to be productive in it - but that means abandoning
the idea of boundless and open exploration for unquestioned
pursuit of a stable set of goals. This also becomes increasingly
difficult, as many fields that are currently on the frontier,
are quite new, so they cannot have any settled old professionals
in them. The super-geniuses probably leave the observable world
(I mean, one can see their projection on their observations space,
they still seem to walk around and publish something, but their
goals and motives are unobservable and unshared).

Am I missing anything? (I hope I am)

That's right, the  Black Body radiation is continuos but the peak wavelength 
at temperature T is at  [.290cm K]/T .

I don't see where you're going with this. If the target reflects a photon 
then it will receive a jolt equal to twice the photon's momentum of hc/w, 
h is Plank's constant c is the speed of light and w is the wavelength of the 
photon. If the photon is absorbed then it will only get half as much momentum 
but the energy absorbed will contribute to the rocket effect, exploding the
outer layer of the target outward and compressing the inner layer. Either  
way if you're close to a H bomb so many photons will be encountered that 
you'll feel a hell of a bang even in a vacuum.
               

        >Moreover the effect is brief, the nuke fireball in  space cooling

Granted, but when you're talking about pressures comparable to those at the 
center of the sun it wouldn't take long to shatter a target.

Ok, if it's a few kilometers away then there are things you could do to  
protect yourself from a small H bomb, but even today ICBM's can achieve  
better accuracy that that.

True, that's mainly because of the tritium, H bombs don't need a lot of it 
but they do need some and it's very expensive and has a half life of only 
10 years.

It was Howard Morland and the trial was in 1979. Morland's lawyers were not 
scientists but they were given security clearances so they could read secret 
documents. To keep their client out of jail they said Morland did not reveal 
anything of importance, and then they said the following:

" Essentially, the X rays produce a plasma of energized matter which pushes   
  on the fusion fuel tamper in much the same way that boiling water produces  
  steam which pushes the blades of a turbine. But Morland's discussion of   
  role of radiation coupling in the compression of fusion fuel is as 
  inaccurate as if he said that boiling water turns the blades of a turbine, 
  he leaves out the steam. [...] Morland's discussion of the role of 
  radiation pressure is entirely incorrect."

This was a very clever move, the Judge did not have access to secret documents  
so he had no way to know the accuracy of this statement, and for obvious and  
predictable reasons the prosecution refused to either confirm or deny it.  
Reasonable doubt having been established Morland walked.

The exploding Styrofoam theory never smelled quite right to me, in addition  
to the Rayleigh - Taylor instability problem at such huge pressures there was 
another problem. The foam absorbs X rays and vaporizes explosively, but that  
means the foam further from the fission trigger must receive weaker X rays 
and explode with less power, this would compress the fusion cylinder unevenly 
making a dud.

It's clear that foam is important in an H bomb but probably not for the reason 
Morland's lawyers said. I don't know it for a fact but here is my theory. 

As I said in my other post the compression of the U238 around the fusion  
cylinder by the soft X ray photons would be even greater than that produced 
by the huge radiation pressure because the soft X rays would vaporize the  
outer layer of the cylinder which  would rocket outward, and because momentum 
is always conserved the inner  parts of the cylinder must rocket inward. 
The fact that Uranium atoms are very  massive would add to this rocket effect 
on the cylinder. Neutrons made by the fission trigger probably also 
contribute to the pressure by bouncing off the  wall of the Black Body 
chamber which is made of lead, that heavy element  reflects X rays as well as 
anything (still only a few percent or less) and the remaining photons are 
absorbed by the lead and heated to very high temperature and then re-radiated.

The inner wall of the Black Body chamber is lined with a plastic foam made of  
light elements like Hydrogen and Carbon, because unlike the case of the  
fusion cylinder the rocket effect is a bad thing here, using light elements 
will minimize this and keep the chamber from blowing apart a little longer. 
A heavy slow moving atom and a light fast moving atom may have the same 
energy, but the light atom will have less momentum and so produce a smaller 
rocket effect because energy is mv^2 while momentum is just mv.

The secondary use of the foam is probably what Morland's lawyers picked up on. 
The light, fast moving debris from the foam will put a little more pressure 
on  the cylinder and do it when it can still do some good, heavy slow moving  
Uranium would take too long, the reaction would be over by the time they got 
there. 

You can't eliminate the rocket effect entirely and you still have the huge 
radiation pressure to deal with, so you must make the Black Body chamber very 
massive with lead to keep it intact for as long as possible. In general, 
if you want a part not to be destroyed by a huge pressure spike and remain 
intact for at least a few nanoseconds then coat it with a thick foam made of
light elements and make the part heavy.


        >There is a thick cap of U-238 between the fission device and the         
        >fusion fuel, precisely to *prevent* the radiation from hitting the         
        >fusion fuel directly before compression can occur.


Correct, that's one reason the compression is so uniform. The cap is so  
massive it survives long enough to shade the fusion cylinder for a while, 
it makes a shadow, a vacuum in the high pressure photon gas. Nature abhors a  
vacuum and demands it be filled.

Reilly, I'm curious. At what point do you think fetal tissue becomes an
unborn child? Since you don't qualify your statement, I assume you will say
"at conception". If so, I'd like to hear the reasoning behind it.

You're right they are rare, there must be more but just off the top of my 
head I can only think of two, one of course is 2001, the other is a wonderful 
comedy made by Albert Brooks about 5 years ago called "Defending your life". 
It's a fantasy comedy not science fiction, but it does have a lot of  
Extropian ideas in it and they're very strongly stated, such as " the point 
of eternal life is to keep getting smarter", that's not an exact quote but 
it's close, it's also a very funny movie. Incidentally Albert Brooks changed 
his name, he thought his real name was hard to live up to and not good for a 
comedian, his real name is Albert Einstein.

I have been thinking about people's motivations lately.

Finally, someone bold enough to tackle some big questions.


There are some obvious drives. Self-respect, power, money,
recognition. . . . They can still play a motivational
role if one wants to get as much of them as possible, but the
continuing motivation by goals that are no longer rational
(and apparently are not analyzed) seems to be a serious
weakness by itself. I would recommend anybody in such
state to stop whatever they are doing for these goals, and
try to understand why they do it, and whether they should.


Thanks for bringing it up, Alex.  Alex seems to be asking why we strive for 
acheivement, knowledge or whatever.  In other words, why do we do the things 
we do with our lives?  It doesn't take too much imagination to see the 
implications of this question for extropian thinking - if we don't have any 
good reasons for doing what we now do in our currently limited lives, what 
makes us think an eternity-long existence will be any less pointless?   

I'll bite right away - there is no good or rational reason for me to do any of 
the things I do today, at least not necessarily so.  My presence makes some 
people happy, so to them my continued existence is valuable.  With others 
perhaps the opposite is true.  The only thing I can answer with certainty is 
that my life, meaning all the things I do and strive for, is valuable and good 
to me.  I like it, otherwise I would end it right now.    
	    
I have stopped and thought about the question Alex raises, basically why do I 
bother to do things.  I've only come up with one good answer to this question: 
I do things for my own pleasure (and by pleasure I mean to inclued 
"happiness," contentment, joy, and anything else that I like).  

My question to the group is this - has anyone else come up with something 
different?  I've searched a bit, analyzing all kinds of ethical philosophies 
and religions, and nothing else strkes me as a compelling answer to the "why" 
question.  Yes, it's all wonderfully pointless, amoral and devoid of higher 
purpose, this conscious life we have been given, but at least we can enjoy the 
ride.


Any thoughts?  

Chris

We placed an ad in one small area of the Internet.  And when
the dust started to settle we had over six thousand responses
in ten days.

(The Advantage Group)
-----------------------------------
For Immediate Release:   Denver, Feb 27, 1998

COLORADO  MARKETING  FIRM  SHARES  MONEY
GENERATING  TRADE  SECRETS  ON  THE  INTERNET!
-----------------------------------

Hello,

My Name is Shannon Johnson.  I am CEO of The Advantage Group.  
I have to tell you that I am really angry and upset about what is going 
on here on the Internet.  We at The Advantage Group are so angry, 
in fact, that we decided to do something about it.  Read on and you'll see.

For three years I have lead my marketing firm in sales campaigns on
the Internet and the other large online services which have yielded
outstanding results!  We are now sharing the information we have
gained over the last several years with other people who are desperately
trying to figure out how to make a substantial income from their home
computers.

Do you know what it's like to turn your computer on in the morning to
find an email box full of orders for your product.....Where it takes over
an hour to sift through just the credit card orders alone?
We do!

Do you know what it's like to have the postman bring you a bag full of
orders for products you have marketed on the Internet, and then hear
him complain about all the mail you get?
We do!

Do you know what it's like to place a simple ad into a newsgoup or
classified section on the Internet and have your Order Department's
phone ring off the hook with people who want to buy your product.
We do!

Have you ever placed just one advertisement on the Ineternet and when
the dust settled ten days later had over 6,000 responses by phone,
fax, mail, and email?
Well....we did in January of this year!

Have you ever tried to market something simple on the Internet, only
to have weeks or months of toil and effort result in only a few sales,
if any?
Well....that's happened to us too.  But not since we learned the secrets!!!

You see, we found the "secrets" to marketing just about anything on
the Internet.  And it is really quite simple, once you know them.

Imagine this.  You decide to make a second, or even a primary
income from the Internet.  So, you put up a Web Site, get a mess
of email follow-up letters ready, put your Web Site in several hundred
search engines (people gotta find your page...right), get in the News-
Groups and advertise your site, and drop hundreds of classified ads
all over the Net.  There ya go.....now you are going to rake in the cash!
Two weeks later you have one sale and you are telling your spouse
and your friends that "This will take time! "  Four months later you've
made just enough to pay for your web space and your friends don't
listen to you anymore.  They consider you an "Internet Marketer
Wanna Be".  Sound familiar!

We are not trying to rub salt in your wounds.  What we are trying to
do is let you in on the TRUTH about doing business from your home
on the Internet. Let's face it.  The vast majority of people who are
trying to earn a living on the Internet are STARVING!!!  That's right!
They don't have a clue of what to do first, second, third or fourth!  And
even if they do have a clue they have been lead down the garden path
with dreams and silly techniques which don't work and are breaking
the hearts of thousands of people who are just trying to make a living
from their home computers.  That is what we are so upset about at
The Advantage Group!

But, it doesn't have to be that way!  People don't have to really FAIL at
making a good income on the Internet.  And it really doesn't have to
take months or even years to learn how to do it.  Not if you have the
right guide to show you what to do, and when to do it.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is the name of our informative guide to generating orders, money, cash,
on the Net.  It was written with the "average" Netrepreneur in mind, in
plain English, with straight to the point "How To" and "Why Do You Do"
phraseology.

In......

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

we expose all the traps WE fell into in our first year of Internet Marketing,
but stay away from now.  We expose the lies and half truths which people
have fallen for in the past.  We expose the SECRETS which most of the
successful Internet Marketers really DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW!
Because, when you know the secrets you will be off and running in...
that's right......THEIR BACKYARD....the Cyberspace Marketplace!

THERE IS ROOM FOR A LOT MORE OF US!

There are millions of people on the Internet.  And there are millions
of more people on the way here.  The pie which will be cut up is
so huge that several hundred more people who know what they are
doing will not even make a dent in our income level. It will just be a
drop in the bucket so to speak.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

will expose the Internet for what it really is, the marketplace which
can provide you with a steady income.  It will literally show you what
to do first, second, third, fourth, and so on.

You are about to discover exactly what makes the difference between
the "Internet success stories," and the obscure "Web Marketing Failures."

This guide will give you all the details, the tools,  the ideas, and the
resources to help you make all of your INTERNET DREAMS come true...

Finally, the truth is revealed!  Find out the secrets that some of the
wealthiest Internet marketers are using to propel their sales through the
Cyberspace roof.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

Will show you:

** How to use Newsgroups to your advantage.  The tricks!
Just placing a few ads just won't do it for you!

** How to use a sig file to get more orders.  They look simple, but if
you write your Sig correctly it can be a GOLD MINE to you. We generate
thousands just from our sigs!

** How to place your web page at the top of the search engines.
If you don't get close to the top you can forget many hits!

** How to maximize your web sales using a professional looking web page
(that you can build all by yourself).

** All about follow-ups and how to do them using email.
A very simple technique which can mean rapidly increasing volume to
you.  This technique is used by some of the top Internet Marketers.

** How to effectively build mailing lists on the internet.
Without lists your business will probably perish!

** Special Coding Techniques which can make your Marketing efforts
amaze even the most die hard skeptics

** Where and how to place thousands of FREE classified ads.
What to say in them, and what to expect when you place them.

** What products you should or shouldn't market for quick results

** How to use Testimonials...

** The importance of tracking your marketing results.

** The importance of a "back-end".

** And much, much more...

Here is what some people who turned their Internet Marketing
results from failure to success have to say about "The Guide":

I thought all I had to do was place some classified ads on the Net for
my flame retarding spray.  Every night after work I would place a
few ads and answer some questions in email.  I never made much
money at all.  Then I read THE GUIDE and everything turned around!
I'm looking at leaving my job now.  And their newsletter keeps me up
to date with all the new things I need to know to keep on track with
my business.

I started Internet Marketing in the Chat Rooms on AOL.  What
a joke that was!  Nobody ever told me it would take so long to
make any money that way.  Then I read the 'The Guide." The
Chat Rooms, Internet Newsgroups, Web Sites, and email all
make me money now.  And it wasn't all that hard either.  I just
didn't know the secrets before.  But I do now!!!  The Internet is
huge, and I've just started getting my share!

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is usually only offered to our marketing clients.  With all the garbage
we have seen on the Internet in the past few months we have decided
to offer "The Guide" to everyone reading this advertisement.  Our clients
have paid $99.95 for "The Guide" and have felt that it was a real bargain
for that price.  "The Guide" has now gone into it SECOND Edition and
we feel that we should open it up to just about anyone's financial budget.
At least for a limited time.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is being offered to you, for a limited time, for only $29.95!!!  That's
correct!  That's a full $70 off the regular price.  Once a reasonable amount 
of orders  have been placed at this price we will take "The Guide"
off of the sale counter and move the price back to $99.95.  But, why
offer this for such a deep discount?  It's simple.  The Advantage Group
feels that the time is right for this information to become more available
on the Net.  But we aren't marketing fools either. The Guide holds a
Copyright, and will only be offered at this very deeply discounted price
for a very limited time.

(There is some Joker on the Net who is trying to sell LESS information
without our two bonus offers to follow for $395.00.  That is ridiculous!!!)

FIRST BONUS OFFER:

If you order within the next 3 days we will include:

Developing our own selves is our own business.  Developing other selves is
entering the political arena.  Ownership of the self is one thing,
ownership of other selves is quite another.  I will take the question of
when "fetal tissue" - a dehumanizing definition, as Anders said, propaganda
developed against the enemy - becomes an unborn child to be equivalent to
the question of when developing your own self becomes developing another
self.  If this is not a one-to-one mapping, I would be interested in the
reasons why it isn't.  The process of developing another self begins with
conception, it doesn't matter if it's natural conception or artificial. 
When conception occurs is a matter of the completion of the normal full set
of chromosomes within the fertilized egg.  I am not arguing for a moral
absolute in the treatment of fertilized eggs, I am simply saying that any
treatment becomes a political question, not an individual question and not
a judicial or executive question.

Multiple and hidden backups of everybody spread about the earth and in
space as
well.

Perhaps one has to eliminate the incentives for destructive acts in order to
obtain stability.  Even if we cannot find out who committed a particular act,
if the act doesn't gain the perpetrator as much as cooperative behavior, it
won't become commonplace.  So if murder (destruction of information) and theft
(especially of information) can be made technically near-impossible through
backups, encryption, and anonymity, the problem looses it's energy supply.

But, Anders is right historically, defense has never held out for ever against
offense.  It is easier to destroy than to build.  Yet, still we live, after
gaining many times the power necessary to destroy ourselves.  Sometimes I
think
we are *well* into the singularity, and things just keep slowly getting
better.

Well, maybe it's an obvious one, but there's the final scenes from
"2001, A Space Odyssey". Or what about that old TV series "The Six
Million Dollar Man", which I believe is being made into a film (?).

I think you've got it the wrong way round. Tech R&D for a deep space
mission implies huge funding devoted to solving small problems -- an
Apollo-style program. But the private capital doesn't exist for such a
program, and the political will isn't there either. The spin-offs you
mention are usually the commercialization of prototype ideas developed
for solving specific problems on a money-is-no-object basis.

Yes, my life is better because of velcro, pocket calculators, medical
telemetry, teflon, hang gliders, and all the other things that showed up
in the wake of the apollo R&D loading. But I suspect we'd have got them
without the $25Bn price tag in any event.

Now you're assuming suspended animation _can_ work for something like
a human being. Given that no other anthropoid demonstrates hibernation,
I hope you'll excuse me for being sceptical about the prospects of
a decent suspended animation system suitable for space travel being
developed using current medical techniques. (I'll grant you Drexler's
vitrification proposal, but I'm talking about something you can achieve
using drugs or surgical procedures to lower the human metabolic rate
and induce narcolepsy for a substantial period.)

In fact, if you want to reduce the oxygen/food consumption of astronauts
on a voyage to Mars, probably your best solution is to give them a
comfortable sofa and a wide-screen TV set -- I believe human metabolic
rates when watching TV are not much higher than those measured during 
sleep!

But on Mars, the cost of _not_ starting off with the tools for self-
sufficient survival is certain death. Developing new technologies will
probably take a long-term back seat to churning out replacements for
parts that are wearing out, and working down in the dome-covered farm
to produce food! I'd expect a Mars colony to begin making valuable
contributions to technology a generation or so after its foundation --
but there's a fairly long-term investment required leading up to that
point, to build up a margin beyond bare survival.

Again: I expect laws on Mars to be draconian -- laws enforced by the
fact that there's about 0.01 atmospheres of freezing cold CO2 on the other
side of the wall, and if you make a mistake you are going to be breathing
near-vacuum. At least at first, anything that jeopardizes life support
integrity is going to be, er, discouraged to say the least.

As for room to test dangerous new stuff, it's worth noting that if you go
to the Moon, you don't need reactor containment vessels for your dirty
fission reactors; if they melt down, well, you just stick up a wire
fence saying NO ENTRY FOR 50,000 YEARS and walk away. With no atmosphere
and no water around, there's no easy way for the dirty nucleides to 
spread and no way for them to get into your biosphere. On Mars, on the
other hand, people are presumably thinking about terraforming within
the next thousand years or so, and there's atmosphere ...

The best place for dirty experimentation is in orbit out of the plane
of the ecliptic, where if anything goes wrong it will _never_ come back
to haunt us (where _never_ is a large but finite number evaluated in 
terms of geological time, not human lifespans).

Hell, if you can stick your mind in a machine then the whole space
colonization thing gets a lot easier. Human beings are soft, wet,
messy machines that are inefficient and require lots of support
facilities. 

My personal bet is that humans like us never get beyond Mars orbit in
person -- but our minds will be exploring the nearer stars before the
21st century is out.

Just for the record, neither ICs, teflon or velcro were products of Apollo
research, and hang-gliders came from Gemini research (though NASA did have
tentative plans to use hang-gliders to return Saturn stages to Earth for 
reuse). I've seen some moderately convincing arguments that the most
important thing to come out of Apollo was the ability to manage such large
projects.

Personally I can't see much of a reason to go to Mars, except as tourists
or with the intention of dismantling it and turning it into something more
useful. I thought Gerrard O'Neill pretty much settled the argument on
planets vs habitats decades ago.

Selling a new series to US TV companies is almost impossible these days
unless you have a track record, and Hollywood doesn't seem too interested
in movies with anything unusual to say.

I think that's the only way, and some of us are already working on it. I'm
working with a group who are trying to put together a kind of anti-Roswell,
anti-X-Files comedy on a low budget (without direct parody). If it works 
out then hopefully I can start making more 'serious' transhumanist movies afterwards (I have a very rough idea for a pro-SI 'propaganda' piece, but 
we'd need a few million to make it properly).

>We should also ry to penetrate other markets.  The Latin American

Now the Hong Kong movie industry seems to be going down the tubes,
the Asian market might be another good idea. They certainly have
a taste for the bizarre (e.g. this morning I was watching 'Sex and
Zen', a comedy about a 16th century scholar who decides Buddhist 
abstinence isn't for him and gets a transplant from a horse) and 
Japanese movies often have a transhumanist bent. Of course the
Chinese takeover of Hong Kong might destroy much of the market
as well.

True and interesting. It would be interesting to see a transhumanism
based on asian culture and philosophy, I wonder how that may turn out.

Or it could be the reverse, a further opening of mainland China for
outside influences. As somebody said, it might turn out that it is
Hong Kong that absorbs China in the end...

I have been reading some of the discussion on motivations.  I find it 
interesting that no one has mentioned the best answer to the "why" 
question that we have--natural selection.

Natural selection is the most compelling explanation of where 
motivations originally came from.  Why do we enjoy sex?  Why do we 
enjoy fast food?  Why do we like sweets?  Why do we see beauty in 
savanna-like landscapes?  Each of these questions requires a 
non-circular response.  The best one I've seen is that natural 
selection has carefully crafted these preferences in our species.  
Such preferences promoted survival and reproduction.  Why would a 
further answer than this be necessary?  I suggest people read Stephen 
Pinker's "The Way the Mind Works" for an excellent discussion of 
these issues in evolutionary psychology.

In the end, there is no meaning.  Meaning is in the journey.  Don't 
expect a completed life project.  Probably no one has ever died 
satisfied.

Recently I've thought a great deal about the idea of a transhumanist film.
Pulling it off,  however,  is a lot tougher than expected.  A few days
back I sat down and starting scripting out the audio/visual content second
by second - what seemed right at the time.  It took me an hour and
forty-five minutes to get 4min. 22sec. of film scripted out.  

Perhaps I'll put it on the net as soon as I get a half hour or so worth of
material and graphics (maybe even the soundtrack).

The marketing aspect was something that I'd thought about a long time ago
when my aspiration was to become the CEO of a philanthropically transhuman
company.  My idea was to bring transhuman art to the population in a
humble manner.  Imagine magazine advertisements in Newsweek or Time - just
one page with a piece of art on it,  maybe a little company logo in the
lower right hand corner.  Then come the TV ads - 60 second music videos
during popular television shows - to break the monotony of what television
has become.  In the beginning you present this free art and free music -
free culture - to the society that's forgotten what culture even MEANS
anymore...

...and of course,  that's when you subtley start throwing out some
products.

I don't know much about the logistics behind this actually working - or
any concpet of the money involved,  but I still think it would be nice of
someone to implement this marketing technique... just so I can see if my
hunch was right.

  IAN: Definitions of "transcend" indicate that to
  transcend is to surpass, "to go beyond the ordinary 
  limits of... to outdo or exceed in excellence, extent, 
  degree, etc.; surpass; excel."[*] As I see it, we could 
  not therefore properly extrapolate from the application
  of the term "transcend" to "human" -- "transhuman" -- an
  annihilation of what it is to be human. Very much to the
  contrary, "transhuman" implies a profound  expansion of
  what it is to be human, such that "transhumanization" 
  must imply the very inverse of "dehumanization."

  IAN: I think the answer points to individual consciousness
  being a product not so much of one subatomic particle more
  than others, but of a holistic concert of multiple entities,
  such that the individual self is not in any one of the many
  entities of which it is composed, but is only in them all.

  Being a radical holist, I see this holistic principle extend-
  ing even beyond the confines of the finite self to encompass 
  and contain the entire universe in the definition of "self," 
  and I believe that I prove this is a valid definition due to 
  the fact that all attributes of your identity and of my iden-
  tity are derived from a holistic relation that contains the 
  whole. This is shown and proven within the identity matrix:

  IAN: In other words we could have Consciousness & art,
  or just C and no art, ergo C transcends "art." Well, I 
  think yes and no. It's very elusive, just as anything 
  to do with C is. I think, yes, C is a "prerequisite"
  of art, but deeper still, art is an expression of C
  so much so that it is a part of C, it is not apart
  from C. Art is also not only the physical medium 
  upon which it is built, but is a larger holistic 
  function of creating it, seeing and feeling it. 

  I agree that the art = C idea is a little shaky, 
  but at the some time I think the parallel I drew 
  is highlighting an important definitional harmony
  that signals a need for further and deeper inquiry.

Um ... I disagree with O'Neill on _one_ point. Planets with a working
ecosystem can be engineered to be reasonably fail-safe, to the extent
of surviving a collapse (or even extinction) of civilization. A habitat
could _conceivably_ be built to such a scale (go re-read Ringworld, for
example), but most designs for space habitats are way too small to be
stable -- much less to withstand the slings and arrows of existence in
a planetary system for long periods of time (megayears).

If you hit an O'Neill cylinder with a rock, it dies. If you hit the
Earth with a rock -- anything much smaller than Phobos -- well, a few
species may go extinct, but the whole system will pick itself up and
carry on as before.

Of course, why the hell are we talking about habitats to support an
agriculture-based society when there's the open question of what kind
of habitat is appropriate to an uploaded mind to discuss?)

I believe there is a scene in the movie Star Wars in which a character's
hand is cut off with a light saber. (Luke Skywalker might be the
character.) In a later scene the character is depicted exercising a new
biomechanical prosthesis which replaces the hand. I have not seen this
movie in years so I do not recall the details. 

The title character in the movie Robocop might be considered a sympathetic
portrayal of a transformed human. The transformation was involuntary and
it is not depicted as entirely positive, but the character is presented
with affirmation, and he clearly has enhanced capabilities. 

The Lawnmower Man has interesting imagery. Unfortunately, it is a horror
film with an unsympathetic main character. Also, the imagery is largely
metaphorical and might compound confusion. However, there is one scene of
abstract "lovemaking" that might illustrate uploads communing in a
constructed reality.

There was a PBS special with Jeff Goldblum that treated nanotechnology
which contained a variety of imagery some of which might be useful.

This is not a new idea, simply the old cosmological constant.  Einstein
found that his new theory of general relativity predicted that the
universe would be expanding or contracting (or expanding then contracting).
Since it was thought to be static, he found that he had to modify the
equations.  Rather than all forces being caused by matter/energy, he
had to assume that there was an inherent force in the vacuum itself.
This could counter the attractive force of gravity and make the universe
stable.

Later, when the universe was found to be expanding, he made his famous
comment about this being his greatest blunder, otherwise he could have
claimed the prediction of an expanding universe as a success of general
relativity.  (BTW it's kind of curious that one man's decision can change
whether a theory is considered a success or not.  Why isn't "GR minus
CC" considered to have successfully predicted the universe's expansion,
regardless of whether Einstein chose to present it that way?  Do theories
make predictions, or people?)

The recent measurements show that the rate that the universe is expanding
appears to be speeding up, while GR would predict that it is slowing
down due to the attractive effects of gravity.  This would indicate that
there is a CC which is so strong that it is overcoming the attraction due
to the mass.

Recall a month ago that there were reports that there was insufficient
mass to slow the universe's expansion.  I believe that was based on
similar measurements to these more recent results.  If there actually is
a strong CC, then we can no longer conclude that there is a lack of mass;
there may be plenty of mass, but it is simply that the CC is stronger.
This could imply that the universe is spatially closed (if you go far
enough in one direction you come back where you started) but will still
never collapse back on itself.

Most physicists really dislike the CC, which appears as an ad hoc fudge
factor in the equations of GR.  I'm sure there will be a lot of work done
to try to disprove the recent results, or find a way to fit them into a
more elegant theory.

This article appeared in the DowVision version of the Washington Post.
My apologies for the length but its not a linkable article and I believe
its significant enough to include in its entirety.

Cost Force May Be Acting Against Gravity; Findings May Upset
Theories of the Universe

(Doug: I jokingly renamed this article "Lets see what John Baez
does with this")

The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, according to
 startling new evidence suggesting that a mysterious antigravity
force permeates "empty" space and is counteracting the pull of
gravity on a cosmic scale.

If the new results hold up, scientists said, they could have
enormous ramifications for theories of cosmic evolution,
resolving some conflicts and creating new ones as they
reverberate through studies of the largest-scale structures in
the cosmos and the smallest particles in nature, and the frustrating
quest for a "theory of everything" that would unify those fields.

Scientists have reacted to the findings with a mix of shock,
amazement, horror, excitement and suspended disbelief.

The question of the fate of the universe -- whether it will
expand to infinity, contract in a "cosmic crunch" or flatline
somewhere in between -- is one of the oldest and most
controversial in cosmology.

Most astronomers agree that the universe began in a Big
Bang up to 15 billion years ago, when all of time and space
were contained in a single dense point -- a singularity --
which abruptly expanded outward in a fireball of particles.
The most popular, and the simplest, Big Bang model holds
that the resulting universe should contain exactly the "critical
density" of matter required to keep it geometrically "flat," with
just enough gravity to balance the outward momentum, slowing
it down. The result: a cosmos coasting indefinitely on the
verge of collapse.

Instead, the new evidence indicates that stars and galaxies are
flying apart in all directions at an ever-increasing rate -- thanks
to an antigravity boost. This means there must be an unexpected
mix of ordinary matter and some kind of unseen "dark matter"
of an exotic nature. It also means, scientists said, that the far-flung
universe of billions of years hence will seem dramatically more
empty, dark and lonely.

"This is nutty-sounding," said Robert Kirshner, of the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, a member of the international
observing team. "But it's the simplest explanation for the data
we've got."

The findings, reported in today's issue of the journal Science,
appear to bolster similar results presented last month by another
international team using similar methods, all made possible only
recently by powerful advances in observing technology. Still
other researchers using different methods have reported that
their data point in the same direction.

The emerging picture of the universe represented in the spate
of recent findings appears to reanimate a controversial concept
known as the "cosmological constant," which Albert Einstein
first proposed in his theory of general relativity. At the time, he
introduced the notion of a repulsive force in space -- pushing
objects apart -- to counterbalance the attractive force of gravity
 -- pulling objects together -- to support his theory that the
universe is static, neither expanding nor contracting. Observations
soon showed that the universe is not static at all but, indeed,
expanding. Einstein renounced the cosmological constant as his
greatest blunder.

But the concept has been kept around for use as what some
call a "fudge factor" whenever it is needed to make theory and
observation conform.

"My own reaction is somewhere between amazement and horror,"
said Brian Schmidt, of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring
Observatory in Australia, leader of the group that reported the
latest results, known as the High-z Supernova Search Team. It
also includes scientists from the United States, Latin America and
Europe. "Amazement, because I just did not expect this result,"
he said, "and horror in knowing that [it] will likely be disbelieved
by a majority of astronomers who, like myself, are extremely
skeptical of the unexpected."

Both the observing teams themselves and independent
researchers emphasized that further observations are needed
to ensure there is no other explanation for the data.

Alan Guth, a leading cosmologist from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, said the recent spurt of findings could pose a
challenge to particle physicists like himself, who will have to
explain this antigravity mechanism. They know that empty space
is "enormously complex," he noted, with theories of "virtual"
particles winking in and out of existence. But, he added, "The
field is in a primitive state. . . . There certainly will be some thrashing
about" as researchers try to explain the unexpected data.

Physicists have theorized about "a whole Pandora's box of
`repulsive stuff' " with names like "quintessence" and "X-matter,"
Kirshner said.

Whatever the antigravity mechanism is, said team member Adam
Riess, of the University of California at Berkeley, "We're seeing
the universe take off."

The High-z team (like the other team that reported similar results
last month, led by Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in California) studied variations in the brightness of
very distant exploding stars, or supernovae, up to 7 billion light-years
away to gauge how the rate of cosmic expansion has changed over
time. They used the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based
telescopes in Hawaii, Australia and Chile to analyze the gradual
brightening and fading of the light arriving from each of more than
a dozen supernovae.

The astronomers found that "the dimness of the supernovae --
pointing to unexpectedly great distances -- implies that cosmic
expansion has actually sped up in the billions of years since the
stars exploded," team member Alex Filippenko, of the University
of California at Berkeley, told colleagues at a Los Angeles meeting
last week.

The High-z team, sometimes in tandem with the Perlmutter team,
made what it called intense efforts to account for the dimness in
other, less exotic ways, such as the effects of intervening dust in
the cosmos or some intrinsic dimness in the most remote stellar
explosions that make them unreliable yardsticks.

They found no other explanation. Schmidt said the team concluded
with a statistical confidence of between 98.7 percent and 99.99
percent that cosmic expansion is getting an antigravity boost.

"The thing that keeps you awake at night is worrying that you've
done some stupid thing -- like forget about pi," Kirshner said.

attributes of your identity and of my identity are derived from a holistic
relation that contains the whole.>

I agree with you that the self, through consciousness, freely roams the
universe.  Consciousness may be a point aspect of the backwards-in-time
microcausality from Cramer's transactional QM interpretation.  However,
there still is a subjective "I" separate from everything else in the
universe.  This separation is what makes it impossible for anyone to ever
produce a valid scientific theory of consciousness, each individual
consciousness is utterly unique and totally inaccessible.  You, Ian, cannot
ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment test any theory about
what I feel, subjectivity is impenetrable.  There is a boundary between "I"
and the rest of the universe, and this boundary is definite, not
indefinite.  There really is something that gives coherency to the
subjective "I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark
or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.

Good point, Charlie, but isn't it largely a matter of size rather than
of design?  Suppose you had an earth-mass of O'Neill cylinders.  (How
many would that be?  A whole lot, you betcha.)  Now throwing a rock or
two isn't going to cause much damage either.

Conceivably the system could even withstand collapse of civilization,
if it is self-repairing.  The idea of a culture living unknowingly within
a starship is as old as SF.

In Greg Egan's Diaspora (now available in the U.S., BTW) a whole
civilization lives uploaded in a featureless blob a foot or so in size.
(Actually it was never clear to me how large the population was; at some
point I had the impression that everyone knew everyone else at least
dimly, and even accounting for large lifespans it would suggest that
there were no more than a few million inhabitants).

Actually, most will, after a waiting period of a year or so.  Their
actuarial tables already account for a normal rate of suicide among
the population; I'm sure a few instances of rational suicides won't
screw up their numbers much until there are a lot more of us.

That answers all the /past/ whys, but we're in charge now.  Our
motivations to crontol the future of our evolution must come from

That's true, but I'd say that the majority of real threats to civilization
in future will be human-made, not natural (with the possible exception of
nearby supernovas, etc, for which we can do little until we can dismantle
stars). Assuming we get past the year-2000 bug, anyway.

Hit the Earth with a lump of rock fired from a mass-driver at Alpha 
Centauri at 99% of the speed of light, and it dies. Earth wouldn't
be an easy target to hit that way, but a habitat would be almost
impossible.

The same energy and resource problems still apply; there's still
little point in colonising Mars rather than turning it into habitats.

The Outer Limits dates back to the 70's. It was contempory with The
Twilight Zone. The 'flavor' of The Outer Limits remains basically unchanged
from way-back-when in my opinion. Most of the episodes are directed at
providing a graphic and usually (IMO) a simplistic 'truth' about the human
condition.

During the 70's The Outer limits seemed to trail behind the more
sophisticated story telling of Rod Sirling and crew. But had some good
episodes anyway. Today The Outer Limits seems to trail behind the much more
sophisticated story telling of Chris Carter and crew. But still has some
good episodes anyway. :-)

Or so it seems to me. :-)

It sounds like Marvin Minsky has a new book called
THE EMOTIONAL MACHINE coming out soon.  There's a
recent interview with Minsky called "Consciousness Is
A Big Suitcase"  at
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p2.html

I was reminded of this when reading Max More's two
recent essays: "Beyond the Machine: Technology and
Posthuman Freedom" and "Virtue and Virtuality: From
Enhanced Reality to Experience Machines"  (see
http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/writing.htm ) this
morning, as well as by some of the debates over the
weekend.

Here's a brief intriguing portion of Minsky's
conversation with John Brockman:
< In another 20 or 50 years, you'll be able to put on
your head a cap that will show what every neuron is
doing. (This is Dan Dennett's 'autocerebroscope.') Of
course, if this were presented in too much detail, we
won't be able to make sense of it. Such an instrument
won't be of much use until we can also equip it with
a Semantic Personalizer for translating its output
into forms that are suited to your very own
individual internal representations. Then, for the
first time, we'll become capable of some 'genuine
introspection.' >

Mark Crosby

P.S. For those interested in philosophy, Minsky
spends much of the interview critiquing persistent
vitalistic notions of consciousness in favor of an
eliminativist approach.  This is after Brockman
begins by asking about whether cybernetics had much
impact on AI, to which Minsky responds, "Yes,
indeed", but then adds:
< Unfortunately, that new domain was mainly dominated
by continuous mathematics and feedback theory. This
made cybernetics slow to evolve more symbolic
computational viewpoints, and the new field of
Artificial Intelligence headed off to develop
distinctly different kinds of psychological models. >

He then moves quickly on to other matters ;-)

Anyway, my point is that Minsky seems to be
suggesting that dualism is primarily a result of
vitalistic or holistic approaches when, as the title
of a Hans Moravec essay once suggested, there can
also be "Dualism Through Reductionism".

An excellent recent paper on this subject is
"Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels"
at
http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html

But let's hope not all of them do: If I have wake up from
suspension 100 years from now and listen to the B-52s, I
might think twice :)

(As an aside to the question about GA Extropians, I'll point
out that while I currently live in Sacramento, CA, I was
born in Valdosta, GA and spent much of my youth in the South).

I think some of the motivation for the debate comes from an attitude
which is not often stated but underlies the hostility towards artistic
endeavors.  It can be expressed baldly as:

  The discovery of penicillin has done more to increase the sum total of
  human happiness than all of the great literature, paintings, and other
  forms of art, combined.

And similarly with other scientific discoveries.  The idea is that art
is fundamentally a form of entertainment, something to occupy the mind.
But the real changes in the world, the ones which will totally reshape
human society over the next century, come from science and technology.

All the transhumanist art in the world is not going to turn us into
transhumans.  Only technology can do that.

I'm not saying I share this attitude, but I think it is good to express
it in bold and even offensive terms just to get it out in the open and
let people respond.

   IAN: One might posit a contradiction from the statement
   above and my post on the application of "transcendence" 
   to "human" -- producing "transhuman" -- such that if C 
   transcending art implies that there can be C and no art,
   then transcending the human can imply that there is you 
   and "no human," and thus the annihilation of the human.

   It's not contradiction because the term "transhuman" 
   contains "human" as a precondition, and this "human 
   thing" is that to which a transcendence -- becoming 
   larger than normal -- function is applied.  To say
   that C transcends art, is to say that C is larger 
   than art, that it goes some places art does not. 
   In the same fashion, the transhuman is larger
   than the nontranshuman. The transhuman is an 
   expanded human the way a butterfly is an ex-
   panded caterpillar. And in the same way that 
   the butterfly is not the annihilation of the 
   caterpillar but the logical evolution of the 
   caterpillar, the transhuman is not an annihi-
   lation of the human but the logical evolution
   of the human into a superahuman with "wings" 
   that can carry it beyond the finite confines 
   that define the limits imposed on all humans.

So here's the BIG question:

1) What is the difference between science and art anyway?


Hmm, interesting question. The line between art and science can blur
depending on how you look at the two. I would say that they interleave to
some degree but if your considering fine-art, then the goal is a good
place to start. The goal of a fine artist is a personal expression or
ideas based on personal experience with the human emotion. Science is a
fact based, investigative study.

Hmm, perhaps this is best answered by one of the More's..

        A moot point, but it could also be said that all the technology in
the world is not going to change the social attitude toward scientific
advances.  Art is crucial to that.  Bottom line is this: that both
technology and art are essential to a culture's progress.  A balance --not
a compromise-- is likely the only way to unify society's general
perspective on both the short and long term future.

The following article went out on the UPI wire today. Vernon Scott's
column is carried in over 300 newspapers, so I'm hoping that this will
help gain some converts for cryonics and transhumanism.
Best regards to all,

The reflecting plane is not flat, most photons do not get reflected but
absorbed (xRay mirror they are not), causing the surface material to turn
into a gas cloud exploding outwards. By the bulk, the counteractio is
pressure from hot, dense gas acting onto the surface, not from the photon
rebound. (Which is, btw, the chief problem of a nuke-driven solar sail:
you'd need a gas cloud to attenuate the xrays into the VIS scale where the
solar sail can act as a reflector). Surface turned into gas expands into
vacuum, relaxating by EM radiation into the environment, which, if not
sol-proximal, is few-K (Big Bang echo) cold space.

We are not riding the nuke, other relaxation pathways are not accounted
for -- and I'd like to see some numbers.

Is 100 MT small enough? The difficulties we are talking about is hitting a
flurry of habitats/mosaic of subterranous settlings semisimultaneously,
requring a large number of brilliant warheads. And fissible material yield
should not scale very well in sub-kT range. Which does not mean it cannot
be done, of course. The more I think of it, the less I like it. Sneaky,
football-sized nukes.

A modern thermonuclear nuke would probably want to minimize the fissible
content, which would require high compression ratios and peachy-clean
isotopic compositon. Also, I think high explosives won't like prolonged
curing under high-rad conditions. Apart from that, the lithium
deuteride/tritide pellet homogenity should also suffer from transmutation.

Maybe that's why they took polymer foam instead of polymer solid, and
adjusted the geometry accordingly to compensate for that. There's a reason
thermonuclear devices are so difficult to build.

Interesting thread. I'd like to see some design bluepauses, but I guess
that's still decades off.

A few people on this list, myself included, have commented on taking
illegal research underground and possibly attempting to control
political movements that may counter progress.  And while it may be
futile to even try this, it has a certain undeniable appeal.  Besides,
why do we all seem so intent on obeying the law?  Nobody's holding a
gun to your head!

So, how about some people share their wisdom as to why it wouldn't
work, what such an organisation should do if it could work, and how to
go about implementing it.  I have some ideas of my own, but for now
I'm going to keep them shadowy and elusive...

The problems with this construction are many; even if one concedes
some truth to it.

(1) It ignores comparative advantage.  Van Gogh and Fleming are
  very different people, with different abilities, influences,
  desires, and ideas.  It serves all of us well that each was
  able to push his unique talents to their limit.  If Van Gogh
  had abandoned art for medicine, he would never have discovered
  anything like Penicillin--he just wasn't suited for that--
  but the world would have lost what he did create.

(2) It ignores the hard-to-measure but very real influence of
  inspiration to scientists.  I, for example, have chosen the
  science path because I am well suited for it.  But I realize
  that the projects I choose, the methods I employ, the ideas
  I study, were all influenced by /all/ of my life experience,
  much of which involves art.  My early pacifism, later modified
  into libertarianism, I can attribute in no small part to
  being profoundly moved by Picasso's /Guernica/; and that has
  certainly influenced my scientific work as well.  How many
  other scientists are inspired by Sci-Fi in various forms?

(3) Who gives a damn about the "sum total" of human happiness?
  I exist for /my/ individual happiness, and nothing else.

(4) Mental exercise increases brain function, and Shakespeare is
  no less a mental exercise than Newton.  Indeed, it is literature
  and art that expand the boundaries of what we can imagine--and
  later produce--with science.

I'm sure there are others.

I've always liked the ole balinese saying:

"we have no art, we do everything as best we can."

In a society where the ability to draw, to paint, to sculpt, to
carve, to weave, to make pottery, to sing, to dance, and to play a
variety of musical instruments, is considered to be the skill set
of any normal member of the society, what is art?

Checking the above list I can see where I'm currently lacking some
of these abilities to some degree. Rather than to sit and wag an
insolent finger at those responsible for my early education, I now
take responsibility for completeing this list myself, as well as
expanding the list! I also look forward to enhancing the education
of any youngsters/oldsters who cross my path.

Wandering around Chicago's Art Institute this weekend, I had reason
everywhere I looked to stay around a few more hundred years at
least.......

Recall in _Return of the Jedi_ when Luke meets Ben's ghost.  Ben says that
Luke's father, Attican (sp?), ceased to exist when he was swayed over to
the dark side.  Of Darth Vader, Ben says, "He's more machine than man--
twisted and evil."  At the end of _Jedi_, a berserking Luke cuts off
Vader's saber hand, and low!! it is artificial!
Luke looks at his own prosthetic hand and realizes that he was becoming
like his father-- more machine than man, spiraling enraged into the evil
of the Dark Side.  When I saw it in the theater last summer, I found this
movie to be very un-transhuman b/c of this and other subtlties (ie. reliance 
on "the Force" aka Faith, as a source of
guidence) ruined the whole Star Wars mystique left over form my childhood.

I generally define art as `engineering of emotions'.  eg: the
creation of particular emotions at particular times, or associating
an emotion with a particular idea.  This seems to cover most
popular meanings of the term, from ancient poetry, through 
ideological paintings, up to modern `artistic' disciplines such
as marketing and advertising.

It is not yet a fully understood engineering discipline, of course,
due to the large amounts of feedback that are generated from art
that is currently in circulation.  Progress is gradually being
made, however, especially in the musical sphere (eg: the Spice
Girls, and that recent program that simulated the music of Bach).

Since the human brain is, self-evidently, deterministic, I
imagine that art will be increasingly automated over the next
few decades.  Transhuman art - attempts to communicate between
transhumans at the emotional level - is something else again.  I
can easily picture different groups of transhumans being defined
by the artistic clade they identify with, and hence the different
basic view of the world they share.

Just the opposite is true. If there are reasons for a person's actions and 
then you change those causes, such as passing a law to punish wrongdoers,  
then you change his actions. On the other hand, if a person's actions had no  
causes then nothing you did could change him because his behavior would be  
random.
              
        >Well, are you a determinist, or aren't you?          

I am not. Quantum Mechanics has shown that some things can happen for no 
reason, that is, they are truly random, I just don't think randomness has 
anything to do with free will.

Free Will means being unable to accurately predict what you will do until you 
actually do it, this is perfectly consistent with determinism.

I don't believe it either. Freedom means not knowing what I'll do but always 
doing what I want. I consider it a compliment not an insult if somebody tells  
me there are reasons I want the things that I do.

I agree, compulsion means having no freedom, and that means having no choice, 
and that means doing what you don't want to do.

And of course they will have trouble understanding each other's
art. Egan mentions this problem in _Diaspora_, where a character
needed to load an outlook (i.e a temporary modification of their
personality, cognition and values) to appreciate a certain artwork.

I agree, with the reservation that pleasure/contentment/joy can also be
something that is gained 'on a higher level' whilst doing something you
don't specifically like (in helping out someone else for instance).

And a good thing too, I dread the day that someone figures out 'the meaning
of life'. 'Cause next thing you know it'll turn out that some things I
enjoy doing most are not in accordance with some 'greater purpose'. One
cannot go against the will of God so I'm happy he is either non-existent or

(and _of course_ I will give disobedience my best shot if he ever does show

What enemy? I'm sorry, but this sounds like you're picketing in front of a
clinic or something (or maybe it's just my reli-fanatic-alarm going off?).

 >The process of developing another self begins with
 >conception,

Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other
mammals and many other vertebrates that would mean that a pig fetus has the
same value & rights as a human, after birth the fetus somehow loses that
value/those right and it's ok to use it as a source of protein. Unless, of
course, you believe that a human fetus has something called a 'soul' from
the moment of conception.

The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no
value&rights as a consious being. But this could chance in 25 years. Maybe
all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would mean
that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What right
do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved. Maybe
it would rather be playing chess (it's good at that). If everything that
has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of a human then we're
comitting mass-murder every time we have sex. Something tells me thit is
not a workable model.

What's so special about that? lot's of cells contain a complete set (and a

Ah yes, but the political conclusion that was reached in most modern
countries was: "This is a choice the woman in question must decide for
herself, after having been duly advised of the pro's and con's." or
something like that. If you have an alternative, practical, model for
deciding these things I'd love to hear it.

Fact is that after an abortion the remains of the fetus are usualy
destroyed, a great waste since some of the tissue's have great medical
potential. If destroying it is acceptable, why would medical use (with
permission of course) not be?

You have a good point but it isn't functional and most of art is functional.
For example, the architect has an idea, a vision, if you will.  She takes
her vision to the computer and begins designing the structure.  Her
mathematical computations must be accurate, and the suggested materials to
build the structure must be chosen carefully, the geological location for
the structure must be of a soil-texture that can afford the size and weight
of the structure.  If all the requirements meat the goals, then the
architects vision is realized and her space habitat on Titan is built.

Similarly, if an author writes a novel and the plot is comprised of
characters, tension or drama (plot point), the author must develop each
character carefully, workout the direction of the story and make sure that
all the pieces fit together in such a manner that allows his vision, his
story, to become a novel that makes sense.  The components of the novel's
plot can not happen only because of his whim or personal expression, but
because he attentively and painstakingly plots out the story.

Both art and science stem from ideas.  Both art and science require
discipline and tenacity.  Both search out a truth.  However, interrelated
the can be, they are clearly different disciplines. Whereas scientific
method is the principles and empirical processes of discovery and
demonstration considered characteristic of or necessary for scientific
investigation, artistic method is anything you darn well please!:)

I find it most hypocritically ironic that liberals who would go into apopleptic
fits if I shot a wild animal don't even sniff if a human fetus is aborted  in a
rather gruesome manner minutes prior to birth.

I approve of abortion, the death penalty, the right to suicide, legality of
assisted suicide, self defense with deadly weapons, and the hunting of and
consumption of animals. At least someone here is consistent.

My cousin's doctoral adviser's 8 year old said at dinner the other day,"If God
didn't want us to kill and eat animals, he wouldn't have made them out of meat."

dehumanizing definition... propaganda developed against the enemy:

<What enemy? I'm sorry, but this sounds like you're picketing in front of a

Enemy?  Why, the mother's unborn child and how it's viewed, take your pick:
as imperfection, denier of comfort, inconvenience, responsibility, the
weak, life itself, etc.  What's wrong with picketing as a form of political
activism?  Is human life not worth defending?  It's OK if your
reli-fanatic-alarm went off, my kneejerk bigotry alarm went off in response
to this, in fact, I think I heard the pilot light on the camp ovens turn
on.

<Since the fetus at this stage is nearly indistinguisable from most other

This may be true for very primitive humanity, but for many moons now,
enlightened humanity can tell quite easily which is pig and which is human.
 Do a web search on "human genome project, and in vitro fertilization" and
follow the links if you don't believe me.  Also, regarding pig rights and
sources of proteins, you might do a web search on "animal rights,
bioethics, vegetarian, & Jainism" and follow the links.  After a couple of
years of in depth research on the topic, you may begin to see that the
development of animals has been a political question for a very long time.

Interestingly, the same groups that want animal rights typically support
mothers murdering their unborn children.  Likewise, the same groups that
lobbied to have alcohol and tobacco warnings for pregnancy typically
support the right to murder what the warnings are meant to protect.  If a
mother can murder her unborn child, why can't she smoke and drink to her
heart's content without being warned about it?  Even the most hardcore
ethical relativist has a twinge of conscience over the birth of crack
babies, permanently maimed human beings, maimed in the area of volitional
freedom.  Yet if a mother can murder her developing child, why can't she
smoke all the crack she can afford?  If the unborn child is just fetal
tissue, why not genetically engineer it in vitro or in utero to become a
slave or worker drone?  Why not maim it deliberately, using worse methods
than crack, just out of cussedness, that's freedom of choice isn't it? 
There will never be an anti-cloning or anti-designer baby law that will
hold water with the Supreme Court until Roe v. Wade is overturned.  The
right to murder an unborn baby because it has been defined away coincides
with the right to use the baby however the mother wishes to use it.  They
are inseparable.

<The parallel-server that I'm working on has no intelligence and thus no
value&rights as a consious being.>

I can't make sense out of this.  Are you saying that the possession of
intelligence is the source of rights?  How much intelligence is enough to
get on the rights wagon?  Who defines intelligence and why is it the same
as consciousness?

<Maybe all it takes is a processor-upgrade and smarter software? That would
mean that this 'lump of metal' is a potential consious being. O dear. What
right do I have feeding it all these problems that I want to have solved.>

This is strange reasoning.  Where do you think rights come from?  If we are
unconscious, say when we're sleeping or in a coma, do our rights go away?

<If everything that has the potential of becoming a human has the rights of
a human then we're comitting mass-murder every time we have sex.>

I don't know who you are arguing against here, but it's certainly not me. 
A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting
point for human development, not earlier.  At that point, with genetic
engineering, we can modify what nature hath brought together.  The
environmental factors that influence the whole development of a human begin
right at this point, and it is these factors that produce a unique human
entity every time, no matter how identical the raw material is to begin
with.  The environmental factors are all political questions, e.g., smoking
and alcohol advisory warnings for pregnancy.

<What's so special about that? lot's of cells contain a complete set (and a
good thing they do!>

But I didn't specify any old cell, now did I?  What's the point of this
comment?

<Ah yes, but the political conclusion that was reached in most modern
countries was: "This is a choice the woman in question must decide for
herself, after having been duly advised of the pro's and con's." or
something like that. If you have an alternative, practical, model for
deciding these things I'd love to hear it.>

In America, no political conclusion has been reached, only a judicial
usurpation of the political question.  This is judicial tyranny, to define
away human life without recourse to the Constitutional Amendment process,
such as was used when slavery was abolished.  Slavery and abortion are all
about the private ownership and disposition of human life.  The crux of the
philosophical issues in both cases was and continues to be definitional. 
My alternative is polycentrism, or particularism, many jurisdictions trying
out many different treatments of the issue.  The judiciary cannot usurp the
legislative role.  Individuals should have the choice to move to
jurisdictions that honor life, or that worship death.  The type of society
that evolves in each jurisdiction will provide the incentive or
disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from first
principles that families trying to raise children will be drawn towards
jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and enhancing life.

<Fact is that after an abortion the remains of the fetus are usualy
destroyed, a great waste since some of the tissue's have great medical
potential. If destroying it is acceptable, why would medical use (with
permission of course) not be?>

Why would permission be needed?  If the sewage treatment plant wants to
make use of a mother's fecal material, no one expects it to ask for
permission, and the fetal tissue in the eyes of the law is exactly
equivalent to fecal matter.  Even better than medical use, why not eat them
as gourmet delectables, like milk-fed veal with great nutritional value? 
What's wrong with cannabilism?  What's wrong with the Chinese Communists
harvesting body organs without "permission" from prisoners they've bumped
off and selling them on the world market?  What's wrong with
commercializing all life, at all stages of development, including humans,
intelligent or otherwise, conscious or otherwise?  Just make all life into
products in the marketplace, all custom designed for any use whatsoever? 
"If destroying it is acceptable," why would any use not be, living or dead?

"It could also be said" (by an economist) that given a diversity of competing
cultures technology will change attitudes, far more than art.  Or rather,
societies which adopt useful advances will outcompete ones that don't.

I suppose that could be rephrased as "societies which are inspired by their

pre-Perry Japan can be linked to their art.

A new web site opened today that provides resources for conducting

research.  It is sponsored by the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

http://www.grantsnet.org

I don't know whether this database includes international

Destroying  "tissue" is perceived as better, because of  fear that medical use
would encourage abortion, morally off setting the destruction of
life/consciousness with a medical benefit.

But what if we can manufacture the genes and tissues in pig fetus ?

Hello, I am looking for a good review paper about the
various hypotheses on the possible functionality of
so-called junk DNA--the non-coding regions of eukaryotic
genomes. I am aware of some of the ideas (selfish DNA,
genome structural functions, etc.) but I would like to find
a review in the primary literature. Does such a thing exist?

Thanks for you help!

While I agree with the sentiment, I do wish to warn against the form

It doesn't make much difference, if the photons are reflected the target will 
receive twice the photons momentum, if it is absorbed it will still receive 
the photon's momentum and its energy too.

Going underground won't help much, during the gulf war bunker busting bombs 
penetrated 30 feet of steel reinforced concrete to destroy installations, and 
they just had chemical explosives, H bombs could do much better. I suggest 
you visit the island of Elugelab, that's where the USA detonated a bomb that 
was expected to be of less than 5 megatons but actually produced 15 megatons.  
They blew it up in 1954 on top of a short tower, it produced a fireball 4 
miles in diameter, it terrified the scientists who set it off and trapped 
them in their bunker for several days on an island 10 miles away, and it 
killed the Japanese sailors on the fishing boat Fukuryu Maru- The lucky 
Dragon, who were far from the official danger area and well inside the 
"safety" zone.  Actually I'm being unfair, you can't visit Elugelab anymore, 
but if you have a submarine you can look at the crater on the sea floor 250 
feet deep and 6500 feet across where Elugelab once was.

Maybe, but then the design would be inefficient because if the foam was that 
ephemeral then most of the X rays energy would pass through all the foam and  
be wasted, it would not be available to compress the fusion cylinder. Why not 
use radiation pressure?

I found a quotation that gives some support to my theory that the polymer 
foam's main function was to protect vital parts made of heavy atoms for a few  
extra nanoseconds, and its use as a plasma generator of only secondary  
importance. Jacob Wechsler was a H bomb engineer and he's talking about  
Carson Mark, the chief designer of the first H bomb:

 "He was really concerned about higher Z materials [elements with higher 
  atomic number] being exposed. In a radiation environment with high energy 
  radiation  coming down from the primary, anything like steel because it's 
  so dense will cause a pressure spike when it vaporizes. Carson was trying 
  to sustain a deuterium burn and he was afraid that if things blew off at
  higher Z that  might chop up the fuel, its temperature wouldn't stay high 
  enough [...]  the surface of the lead would blow off so we covered the lead 
  with plastic, with polyethylene. That was low Z, just CH2  [hydrogen and 
  carbon]. From a time point of view the radiation ionization of the heavy 
  materials with all that shielding would be so late that it would have 
  zilch effect on the overall system."
               

        >There's a reason thermonuclear devices are so difficult to build. 
              

I wonder, are they difficult to build? Over 100,000 of the damn things have 
been made and several hundred have exploded in tests, some with very unusual 
designs, and yet there has not been one dud and most turned out to be more 
powerful than expected.

Selfish DNA, genome structural functions, and regulatory action(eg.
heterochromatin and position-effect variegation) are all I can think of. 
Maybe you could check out some articles on transposons and/or
heterochromatin.  These articles are everywhere, and there are also many
books on the subject.  Here's a review paper on heterochromatin by a
professor here at UBC:

Grigliatti, T. A.  1991.  "Position Effect Variegation- An Assay for
Non-histone Chromosomal Proteins and Chromatin Assembly and Modifications
Factors."  Methods in Cell Biology 35: 587-627.

Reilly: I should know better than to get involved in an abortion
discussion. However, I find you and I are usually in agreement
philosophically, so I'm curious to discover why we diverge so clearly here.

I don't know any defender of the legality of abortion who views fetuses as
"the enemy". I think this is a straw man. Yes, an unwanted pregnancy can
interfere with life plans, but that doesn't one views the embryo as an
enemy. One might have the abortion with regret that it happened.

Personally, I do regard abortions as nasty things, to be avoided as much as
possible. Abortions should not be the choice of birth control. But other
forms of birth control can fail, despite responsible use. And, even more
certainly, women who have been raped should not have to see through a
pregnancy. I assume you disagree, even in such a case. Is that correct?

Let's keep this on a less emotive level. Otherwise the other side will
start painting you with the anti-woman brush.

Of course. A fetus is fully human in a genetic sense from fertilization.
But why is this relevant? What does genetic humanity have to do with moral
standing or the granting of rights? Beings of at least human personality
who are not genetically human (possible ETs, genetically altered
descendants of humanity, and -- you may not grant this -- future AIs) could
have as strong a moral standing as you or I. Conversely, someone who is
utterly brain dead, in the sense that their brain has been physically
destroyed beyond all possibility of preservation and repair, may still be
human but is not morally much more than a piece of meat. (A bit more simply
because the physically resemblence to the former person may provide
emotional reasons for according a different status to the body).

>Interestingly, the same groups that want animal rights typically support
>mothers murdering their unborn children.

Interesting, yes, but that's not necessarily inconsistent. That depends on
the grounds for bestowing rights, and the legitimacy of overriding those
rights. Personally I don't accord rights to animals (at least not in the
same sense or to the same degree). The reasons for this are the same as
those for not according rights to (early) fetuses.

> Likewise, the same groups that
>lobbied to have alcohol and tobacco warnings for pregnancy typically
>support the right to murder what the warnings are meant to protect.

I don't see the slightest inconsistency here. If the embryo has no right to
life, or that right is overriden by the self-ownership rights of the
mother, abortion should be allowed. But if the intent is to keep the child
and let it develop, looking to its future it may be seen as an offence to
the person who it is to become to negligently cause damage. In this case,
you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the case of abortion,
you are preventing a person from coming into existence.

>If the unborn child is just fetal

>slave or worker drone?  

That's a different issue. Even if the fetus has no right against this, we
may have other reasons not to allow such a process. I would choose a
polycentric system in which genetic engineering of slaves was not allowed.
But that's not because I believe such alterations violate the right of the
fetus.

Are *you* saying that the mere possession of DNA in the form of something
that could develop into a human person is the source of rights? I find that
very puzzling. Why should we grant rights on that basis? While I wouldn't
equate intelligence and consciousness, I do think they are closely related
(since I believe consciousness is a matter of degree). And yes, I suggest
that rights are most sensibly according according to degree of
intelligence, above some minimum. In general it isn't wise to give some
adult humans rights that others don't have, though there are exceptions --
deeply mentally retarded humans will not have all the usual rights, such as
agreeing to contracts.

I don't believe that rights are entities that exist in themselves. They are
simply principles that we agree on that regulate the use of force. We
*could* grant fetuses full rights, but why should we? Why should we grant
them full rights any more than we should grant such rights to birds, bees,
or beetles?

BTW, I find it implausible grant full rights even to a newborn baby. They
are no more a person than is a seven-month old fetus (though either of
these are much closer to being a person than is a month-old fetus).
Nevertheless, I grant the view that it should be illegal to kill such
babies now that they are biologically separate -- but the source of that
rule does not have to be a right of the baby.

That's a strange question. :-)  Do you cease to a person when you sleep?
No. But a fetus is not yet a person. When you're asleep you still have your
abilities and capacities, and you are still in the middle of your projects
and activities.

True, but it's not the beginning of development of personhood, and it's
personhood to which rights should attach, not genetic humanity. The early
fetus is not only not a person yet, it's not even a human being, since it
doesn't have all the parts of a human, especially the brain. I still don't
see that you have given any reason why we should accord rights to this
clump of tissue. You can call this language "dehumanizing" if you like, but
I would say your use of "murdering children" is inappropriating humanizing.
So there!

Reilly, it's not a fair tactic to call advocates of abortion rights death
worshippers. That's just obviously false, and will only mean those who
disagree won't take your views seriously.

>disincentive for movement, but I know from moral reasoning from first
>principles that families trying to raise children will be drawn towards
>jurisdictions with an ethic of protecting and enhancing life.

But protecting and enhancing life includes the lives of the parents. These
are not well protected or enhanced by making abortion illegal. That would
be true even if abortions would not carry on anyway, with nasty
consequences. Life is not only about survival. A developed person's right
to life must include the right to remove interferences with that life when
that interference results from something that is not a person.

I want to make clear here that I dislike abortion. I would like to see
solutions that ensure ALL pregnancies are wanted. I would also counsel
anyone considering an abortion to think long and hard about it. For many
people I think the best choice is to have the baby and give it for
adoption, if the parents do not want to raise it. I would certainly (if in
possession of the facts) criticize morally some couples who opt for
abortion instead of adoption, especially if pregnancy resulted from
irresponsibility. But even in such cases I would not use the force of the
law to prevent abortion.

BTW, according to my mother, I was a mistake my parents made when she was
35 (quite old for a pregnancy in the '60s). They didn't abort my precursor,
and I'm glad. But I'd hate to think that, if they had, someone would come
and drag my mother to jail for protecting her own life and purposes by
removed a small lump of biological matter than didn't have a personality
and didn't think and didn't have goals and projects.

  IAN: OK, so you posit that because an identity is
  unique it is separated and not connected to other
  identities. While that is the prevailing case for 
  identity limitation, I can show that it is false:

  Mr. Jones is uniquely short, indeed he is exactly 
  4 feet shorter (-4) than the next smallest adult, 
  Mr. Smith. So the numerical expression of the uni-
  que identity attribute of Jones is -4, and from 
  where did Jones get his this attribute? Smith. 

  If the unique identity attribute of Jones comes 
  from relation to Smith, the claim that the unique
  identity of Jones defines a separation between 
  Jones and Smith is inherently false.

  So right there we have shown that unique identity 
  attributes * define * holistic unity, not deny it.



>You, Ian, cannot ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment 
>test any theory about what I feel, subjectivity is impenetrable. 


  IAN: True, but that limitation only defines a 
  limit on my nervous system, not my identity/self.
  If the nerves to my right leg were cut, I could 
  never know how my "right leg feels inside," but 
  that does not impose a limit on that which is 
  properly defined as myself, i.e., my numb leg 
  is still properly defined as a part of Ian.

  Therefore, the fact that you are a numb part
  of me, relative to me, as I am to you, does
  not mean that we fall outside the proper
  defitnions of who each of us are, and
  thus ID "seperation" is a fallacy.


>There is a boundary between "I" and the rest of the universe, 
>and this boundary is definite, not indefinite. 


  IAN: I think we just ran out of "definite."
  The two cases for identity separation and 
  limitation, 1. uniqueness and 2. nervous 
  system limits, have been deconstructed.


>There really is something that gives coherency to the subjective 
>"I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark
>or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.


  IAN: What is this "something."

Hello Reilly, Ian and Extropians All,


What a great discovery [this list]!   Since I have no material contribution
to make I credit myself with 'discovering' this fab group and its concepts,
pretending to a sort of ownership.   Cheap trick, I'll admit.   However, I do
have a marginal aside to the present discussion; a poem I wrote in
appreciation of Reilly's mind on this matter.

Blue

If I think blue and ask you too
You will but then again you won't
For I've seen skies you've never seen
And you've said things I've not

So since my blue is blue to me
And yours to me is not
Then I'll think blue and so will you
But we'll be blue, apart

The poem - just a sentiment - merely touches on the discussion at hand, of
course.  But it is a step up from my usual trick of pretending to have
co-discovered Extropian concepts.

Hello Reilly, Ian and Extropians All,


What a great discovery [this list]!   Since I have no material contribution
to make I credit myself with 'discovering' this fab group and its concepts,
pretending to a sort of ownership.   Cheap trick, I'll admit.   However, I do
have a marginal aside to the present discussion; a poem I wrote in
appreciation of Reilly's mind on this matter.

Blue

If I think blue and ask you too
You will but then again you won't
For I've seen skies you've never seen
And you've said things I've not

So since my blue is blue to me
And yours to me is not
Then I'll think blue and so will you
But we'll be blue, apart

The poem - just a sentiment - merely touches on the discussion at hand, of
course.  But it is a step up from my usual trick of pretending to have
co-discovered Extropian concepts.

What is the energy flux upon a square meter of surface 300 m away from a
10 m-radius sphere radiating as a 100 MK blackbody? (Of course these
parameters are ad hoc, and emitting sphere surface grows bigger while
cooling off, &c&c, but this should give us at least some ballpark
figures).  Are you really proposing that the peak forces generated are
sufficient to deformate a macroscopic object made of, say, 1 cm sheet
steel? If we assume above energy flux to persist for 0.5 s, what would the
final travel velocity of a 1 x 1 x 0.01 m steel sheet be? I'd say
negligeably small, few 10 cm/s at best. 

> the photon's momentum and its energy too.

Ok, I have a cloud of excited atoms over the surface (=not part of it
anymore) which relaxate by radiation into vacuum. How much of it sees the
target?

What I am saying that this effect contributes 99.999% of the pressure the
surface sees.

Excited atom, not part of target, emits a photon. Photon whizzes off, atom
whizzes off. Probability of any of them striking the surface below is <1. 
In any case the half-life time must be taken into account, diluting the
energy spike temporally.

You are talking about direct hits again. What I was saying is that, say, 1
Gpeople distributed over vacuum-separated spatially distributed 100 k
habitats (lunar surface would offer an enrichment, and ground would allow
energy coupling while also enhancing shielding) are drastically more
difficult to kill with nukes since essentially requiring direct habitat
hit each. Since, contrary to antimatter nukes, fissible material requires
a noticeable critical mass (using other transurans than Pu won't help
much) the resulting kill efficiency will be too low for practical use.

I thought the Russies peaked that on Novaya Zhemlya (20 MT expected, 60 MT
estimated real yield). This has been no ground blast, though.

A typical atoll's elevation is just few m above the sea surface. Even the
largest devices do not change the landscape noticeably -- you could level
only a very small mountain with them.

Maybe all they wanted was to compress the material to the critical density
to be ignited by the fission primer. 

I must take your word for that that the radiation pressure is the
determinant, as I cannot prove your numbers.

Interesting quote. Are you aware of any high-quality online resources?

Yeah, but while I could build a working crude gun assembler nuke on a very
modest budget, the threshold for a fusion nuke from scratch is worth
man-centuries of high-paid experts.

I agree there are many articles and books that mention the topic, but I am
looking for an article that reviews ALL or at least most of the ideas, I've
been searching for several days and that seems lacking in the
literature.Thanks for the suggestion however.

No political question or conclusion is necessary, until an
individual is "born" (thus becoming an individual) the constitution
does not apply.

You argue about inconsistency, yet the so called "right to life"
movement is one of the most inconsistent i.e. they support the
death penalty.

Yes, I support the right of choice.

If the so called "right to life " movement is so concerned about
abortion, why haven't they ever tried to support birth control,
thus eliminating most, if not all, abortions?

I think you describe one very important part of art, which also works
perfectly for science: First, there's an idea, and then a long -
technical and conscious - way of making that idea come true. Still, I
think there are other forms of art which are also quite interesting:
With music, one interesting approach is simply playing around with it.
Exploring sound. I would call this a more "intuitive" approach. That is:
you don't consciously follow a concept. There's inspiration in the
process of creation.

The same could be done with photography I guess. The more complex art is
to create, the harder this approach gets, though. With advanced Virtual
Reality this might change: possibly one day, you'll be able to
intuitively play around with different designs and experience them while
you are creating them.

Is there any good work about this available? Some definition of
different types of art, like - let's say "intuitive art" and "functional
art"? And maybe how wide-spread the different types are? This should be
quite interesting!

later,
Holger

Seems like synchronicities are starting (I'm just trying to find another
thinker/prover game since I can't find any quarters ;-) ):

Just a few days ago I had an idea for a video-clip which would be just
perfect for that purpose. Unfortunately so far it only exists in my head
:-(

The basic idea is simply showing a person being uploaded to a
super-computer, getting some sort of brain- and body-update (turning him
into a cyborg), and downloading back to the enhanced body. At the end
he's at a party, having real good fun - and no one even realizes he's a
complete cyborg.

So far, all I have are about 2 pages of ideas and a basic "storyline"
and some of the visuals in my head... through the whole thing, the
positive aspects of transhumanism will be shown (no Frankenstein
atmosphere).

later,
Holger

Interesting point of view.

I would say that the reflection of human nature in life, tends to give
people a sense of meaning, which according to Segan's film Contact, science
has failed to provide.

I think humans, particularly scientists, seem to think that they can
control nature itself. This dangerous perspective is responsible for the
misuse of advancements in science which have led to one of the worst eras
of earths history, in terms of pollution.

ahh who knows what I'm trying to say..

where's my coffee.

I agree with you 100%, I often have 'lively' discussions with my
'left-wing-liberal' friends about this. In my view anybody who wants to
consume animals should at least be _willing_ to do some of the killing
him/herself (I realize that the actual killing of animals for consumption
might not always practical in society today). It's the principal that matters.

I'm not against the death-penalty in principal but as I see it it's
preventative effects on society as a whole are unclear (and I believe that
a justice system should be based on prevention rather than revenge). Other
than that I more or less argee with you.

How do you know that all woman who have abortions view their child as an
enemy? Do think they walk away from an abortion smiling, saying: gotcha! I
think it's a little more complex than that (understatement of the century).

I don't think comparing womans clinics to nazi-death camps is appropriate.
Have you ever been present at an abortion or seen a concentrationcamp?
There's plenty of opportunity of both around the world. I suggest that
untill you have you stop making these kind of comparisons. Certain people
on this list might get extremely upset.

I think you will find that most listmembers are very much aware of
technologies like IVF and genetic engineering. The existance of these
technologies does not change the ethics one bit. From the perspective of
the fetus it is irrelevant whether it is a pig or a human, up to a point.
And somewhere before this point abortion becomes illegal. The fetus now has
the status of human with all the usual rights attached.

Nonetheless, most people have no problems with the killing of animals for
consumption. This does not make it ok but it's evilness is, to say the
least, debatable.

Yes. They supported the possibility for each mother to make an informed

As long as you keep clouding the issue by calling abortion 'murder' this is
not going anywhere. And why in the hell would we want to create drones?

Yes it is and neither you nor I nor all the laws in the world can chance

B.S. (pardon my French). Aside from the fact that I'm not specifically
looking forward to a anti-cloning law, it's perfectly feasable to have a
law allowing abortion to a certain number of weeks after conception. I know
this because we have such a law in the Netherlands.

Killing a fly, fish or cow seems to be no ethical problem to most humans,
killing a chimp is more difficult and only allowable for very specific
medical research, killing a human unnaceptable unless in a self-defense
situation. I _think_ most people will agree on this.

Of course not! If a machine was smart enough to pretend it's a human over
E-mail or the phone (passes the Turing test) then pulling the plug would
have to involve some ethical debate. All consious beings should be treated
with respect whether they are humans, dolphins or computers.

And in all these matter the woman in question decides (who else?).

This shot is too easy to make (it's also pretty cheap) and since I
admire&respect many listmembers I won't make it.
I'll just say that sex-education & certain legislation may be leave
something to be desired in the US (Maybe if the sex-education was a bit
better most abortions would never be neccecary in the first place; prevent
& solve, don't illegalize).

Depends on your defenition of human life. By law & consesus an fertalized
egg is not a human, a fetus more than a certain number of weeks is.

That's what's happening. In most western countries abortion is more or less
legal, not in all countries however (Ireland, the Vatican). Move to the
Vatican if you want, don't expect me to follow.

They do (or is thee some law that forbids you to emigrate?)

If you have a 14 year old daughter who is raped by someone with a genetic
defect and becomes pregnant would you rather live in a 'jurisdiction' that
totally illegalizes abortion or in one here your daughter can decide to
have one (or not) for herself?

You stated earlier that there was no real law in this area in the US. Too
bad. IN many other countries there is and there is a _very_ clear
distiction between an aborted fetus and human excrement.

Yeah, that's right. let's keep the discussion rational and stuctured.

Nothing (did you see 'Alive'). The problem is the killing part, not the
eating part.

 >What's wrong with the Chinese Communists

I suggest you debate the ethical nature of the Chinese penal system with
someone who's more 'pro death-penalty' than I am. The ethical problem in my
view is not the organ harvesting but the execution of 30.000 people yearly
for things that should not be criminal in the first place (political
activity, drug use, distribution of porn...).

See above, a baby gains certain rights beyond a specific number of weeks
after conception. This is not perfect from an ethical viewpoint, but it is
workable.

I know this is tricky terrain. Imagine the following situation:
A person has a brain/nerve disorder that could become lethal in 2 years
orso, there is no cure. With an implant of compatible fetal nervetissue the
person could be saved. Would it be unethical if the persons sister became
pregnant only to provide such material? And could you explain to this
person why?

 >But what if we can manufacture the genes and tissues in pig fetus ?

That's the solution I'm for in the near-future. This would solve many
ethical problems (IMHO) concerning transplantation. For now however, we
have to make due with messier solutions (and try to find some ethical
answer for them).

This is quite interesting. I remember that one some programming
newsgroup there once was a thread about how programmers often are
interested in music. I also was quite surprised to find out that many of
my fellow students (computer science) are into music and 3d-graphics.

Just recently, I realized how similar programming software and composing
music are. With both "arts" you can take the two approaches, btw: you
can have an idea and then work on it (with the idea never really
changing), and you can start with something and then - step by step -
develop something completely different.

At my research group (around ten people), there is one guitarrist in a
rock band, one ex-professional organist and one concert pianist (he
divides his time between computational neuroscience and giving
concerts). Quite an overrrepresentation (but then, there are also
three different people named Anders here :-)

Yup. That is the notion. But it's based on a dichotomy:

Art ("over here")------------------Technology Engineering Science("over
there")
                                  ^
                          <societal fulcrum>

...when another way to look at it is:

Art    Technology     Engineering                    History      Science
---------------------------------                    --------------------
What we can effect change through                    What we already know
       (or think we can)                               (or think we do)
    All of this is value-based                    All of this is value-free
         (or should be)                               (or is said to be)

(with a dotted line connecting Engineering, Science *and* Art.)

Now, if art is just for entertainment (some crap on a wall with a frame
around it), it's hard to appreciate the second model. If one gets handed a
lot of crap by poseurs who only pretend to understand AND lie to one
another about art, it's little wonder that the dichotomy that puts
technology opposite art occurs: technology *works*.

But technology is ART that works. :) Science isn't art, it's just what's so.
The act of _doing_ science may be creative, but the dry facts distilled are
not.

( IMHO :) )

I have often wondered about this point. "Elegance" of theory may be
a red herring at times. How much of the typical negative reaction to
new theories is based in aesthetics instead of appropriate critical 
thinking? Imponderably, how many times have scientists missed seeing 
something really useful because the math was getting ugly?

By elegance here, I don't mean merely simplicity, in the sense of
choosing between two theories of equivalent power because one is
simpler. That is just economy, Ockham's Razor, or constructive
laziness if you will, and is a Good Thing. 

The question can be turned around, too, and maybe doing this answers 
it: scientific aesthetics could be seen as informed and evolved 
intuition about what fits and what makes sense in a theory, just as
artistic aesthetics are at least in part based in intuition about what
fits and makes sense in an artistic composition. So then if aesthetics
leads a scientist astray, it's a fault in his fitness function. If 
scientific aesthetics falls prey to mere intellectual fashion or to 
_idees fixes_, then the effect is worsened.

Define control. Define nature. Control of certain complex systems is

It ain't quite the scientist's fault, nicht wahr? An advancement in the
ivory tower does not produce measurable effects. It is the mass-market
braindead implementation of the principle which causes measurable impact. 
We can hardly abscond the whole idea of doing scientic research if the
idiots misuse our results, can we?

Creation


Love ruminates and illuminates
And dances upon the artists soul,
With a cloven foot and a callused palm
And a will to make the meaning whole.

Lifes creations reveal sensations
And notions of what beauty should be,
And what it is now and has always been
And helps unveil the mystery.

The artist creates, his passion pulsates,
And the world is awed by his intent --unclear,
While their thoughts try to hide from their minds eyes,
What they want to see, they try to fear.

For all that is true, and all that is new
Is never enough to convince those who Know,
And the truth is forbidden --merely locked inside,
And the process of art is painful and slow.

But the artist persists and his spirit resists
The ties to all judgment and extrapolation,
He ignores all the bounds and demands on his work
And devotes himself wholly to his creation.

I doubt that the "subjective 'I'" is bounded at the
quark level <sneeze - oops, there goes part of
myself!>  In any case, this "something" is called
organizational or semantic closure (cf. anything on
autopoiesis).

Also, Barry Smith's "Social Objects" paper
(http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/ontology/socobj.htm),
for example, develops the following basic
bicategorical ontology:

< Continuants take up space and have spatial parts.
Occurrents such as blushes, funeral marches, forest
fires, too, may be spatially extended, but the
spatial extendedness and spatial locatedness of
occurrents in common-sense reality is in every case
parasitic upon the extendedness and locatedness of
the continuants which are their bearers.  A
continuant is self-identical from the beginning to
the end of its existence. >

Yes, I know, I am structurally coupled with the rest
of the world - breathing, eating, communicating, etc.
- and could not exist without that which is not-I.
Still, if I cut my skin, I will heal it. However, if
I cut your skin, you will have to heal yourself (even
if you sue me and I end up paying for it ;-)

Let's see, we can find the energy density at the surface of the hot sphere at  
temperature T with the formula 
(8PI^5)*(kT)^4/(15h^3 * c ^3) = (2.27*10^-7 watts/M^2*K^4)*T^4 . 

If T is  10^8 degrees Kelvin then  the sphere would radiate 2.27 *10^25  
watts per square meter, that's over 22 million billion  billion watts per  
square meter!

A sphere of 300 meters has a radius 30 times greater than one of 10 meters, 
30^2 = 900 so at 300 meters the energy density would be 900 times weaker, or 
2.52 * 10^22 watts per square meter, just a little over 25 thousand billion 
billion watts per square meter.

Yes. Near the Earth the radiation from the sun is only about a thousand watts 
per square meter, that's why solar sails have to be so big, in this case our 
target 300 meters from the H bomb would experience radiation pressure 
25 billion billion times greater, and that would be a hell of a jolt. 

Remember I'm only talking about the radiation pressure of the light, the 
rocket effect would substantial add to the pressure the target received  but 
it's not as easy to calculate.

I would like to recommend a book about a topic near and dear to many
hearts, namely, filthy lucre.  It is by James Buchan and is titled "Frozen
Desire: The Meaning of Money".  It is bit too liberal/PC for my delicate
sensibilities but the breadth and quality of scholarship that went into it
counterbalances that aspect.  The original source material included is
worth it alone regardless of what you think of the author's
interpretations.  Money's many meanings and complex history - philosophic,
religious, practical - are the topics.  Very interesting.

I can't recall where I saw it, I think it was in "Science Week" a couple
years ago, but someone applied a series of tests to the complete set of DNA
and found that it is virtually identical to human language when the same
tests are applied to it, e.g., they both follow Zipf's Law, etc.  These
results *only* were valid when the full complement of junk DNA was
included, and broke down when segments of junk DNA were excluded.

With this in mind, there's a new book out by Jeremy Narby called "The
Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origin of Knowledge" that sounds like it lends
further scientific support to the DNA as language hypothesis.

  IAN: OK, so you posit that because an identity is
  unique it is separated and not connected to other
  identities. 

No, Ian, that is not what I am positing.  You broke into my quote after my
inherent agreement with you.  My quote began: "I agree with you that the
self, through consciousness, freely roams the universe.  Consciousness may
be a point aspect of the backwards-in-time microcausality from Cramer's
transactional QM interpretation.  However, there still is a subjective "I"
separate from everything else in the universe...."  Spatially, our
consciousness travels every possible backwards-in-time microcausal history,
in so doing, it is one with the local universe (local meaning the universe
as constructed at the Planck scale, not constructions at other scales). 
So, no separation spatially in this sense.  Again, however, we do have an
internal subjective unique "I" that is separate from each other and from
external reality.  It is separated and yet connected.  The biggest
connection is through language, Eric Voegelin posits this connection to be
"community substance," a separate entity than either the subjective "I" or
external reality.  I have termed it "consensual reality" on the list
before, but people got tired of it.

>You, Ian, cannot ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment 
>test any theory about what I feel, subjectivity is impenetrable. 


  IAN: True, but that limitation only defines a 
  limit on my nervous system, not my identity/self.

That "my" in "my nervous system," why isn't there just a universal nervous
system?  Why do you use the term "my" if "my" isn't separate?  You simply
cannot define away subjectivity with any set of axioms or predicates.  The
axiom-making or predicate-making entity precedes the axioms and predicates
and that entity is unique and impenetrable, a point source of force. 
Sometime, pick up Wittgenstein's "Philosophical Investigations" (1953). 

>There really is something that gives coherency to the subjective 
>"I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark
>or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.


  IAN: What is this "something."

You brought this up when you wrote 3/1/98: <The most persuasive argument
about the nature of the individual "soul" that I've heard is that it is
more than the atoms of which the brain is composed, but this "more" is not
a supernatural spirit, it's simply the ordering of those atoms.>

Rather than "ordering," which is a more static term, I think "coherency" is
a more dynamic term.  But if you like the term "ordering" better, what were
you referring to, what provides the ordering?

Phil Chapman wrote this lovely poem 3/3/98: 

Blue

If I think blue and ask you too
You will but then again you won't
For I've seen skies you've never seen
And you've said things I've not

So since my blue is blue to me
And yours to me is not
Then I'll think blue and so will you
But we'll be blue, apart

Ah, the beauty of the analog!  How I weary of this digital age, where half
of reality is sampled out of existence, and with algorithms and compression
techniques, more than half.  What a paucity!  How threadbare!  And if I
find out that "Phil Chapman" is really a computer, hacking poetry together,
well then, I'll delete this file and move on to something meaningful.

I would like to recommend a book about a topic near and dear to many
hearts, namely, filthy lucre.  It is by James Buchan and is titled "Frozen
Desire: The Meaning of Money".  It is bit too liberal/PC for my delicate
sensibilities but the breadth and quality of scholarship that went into it
counterbalances that aspect.  The original source material included is
worth it alone regardless of what you think of the author's
interpretations.  Money's many meanings and complex history - philosophic,
religious, practical - are the topics.  Very interesting.

Max More wrote 3/3/98: <I should know better than to get involved in an
abortion discussion. However, I find you and I are usually in agreement
philosophically, so I'm curious to discover why we diverge so clearly
here.>

I, too, should know better.  These discussions invariably boil down to
taking an obstinate stand on definitions, and I've rarely seen anyone truly
rationally consider the issue at a deeper level than convenience on the
pro-death side and religious dogma on the anti-death side. I know we don't
diverge on the polycentric approach to the issue, the best argument will
come from tracing the evolutionary consequences within many different
jurisdictions, each approaching the question as seems best.

<I don't know any defender of the legality of abortion who views fetuses as
"the enemy".>

Open your eyes.  I mean this sincerely, with no disrespect.

<Personally, I do regard abortions as nasty things, to be avoided as much
as
possible.>

I know that.  You are not like President Clinton who says the identical
thing just before he vetoes the partial birth abortion ban, a hideous form
of infanticide that morally soils the whole country.

<And, even more certainly, women who have been raped should not have to see
through a pregnancy. I assume you disagree, even in such a case. Is that
correct?>

No, I'm reasonable, it's non-consensual for the woman and illicitly rewards
the rapist within the gene pool.  I don't think that jurisdictions who
allow this will slip into the culture of death.  A child forced on a woman
is tragic and so is that child's legalized murder.  However, I see no good
reason why jurisdictions shouldn't be able to disallow this, if that is
what they think is best for their society.

<Let's keep this on a less emotive level. Otherwise the other side will
start painting you with the anti-woman brush.>

Yes, boss.  <g>  As you know, I don't mind being painted with any brush, if
it's true I'm happy to have it stick, that's how I learn, if it's false it
will flake off with no harm done.  I don't mind being painted with the
anti-woman-who-murders-her-unborn-child brush at all.

<A fetus is fully human in a genetic sense from fertilization.  But why is
this relevant? What does genetic humanity have to do with moral standing or
the granting of rights?>

The key is in the concept of development.  Development of the self,
self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  But development of
other selves, that is, non-consensual development, is ownership of other
selves.  Other selves have every right to question this activity and to
bring the activity into the political sphere.  The concepts of guardianship
and power of attorney evolved in society to champion the rights of
developing selves that are incapable of acting as their own champions.

<Beings of at least human personality who are not genetically human
(possible ETs, genetically altered descendants of humanity, and -- you may
not grant this -- future AIs) could have as strong a moral standing as you
or I.>

And just who would be granting said moral standing to such entities?  I
would grant future AIs with a majority of analog components, I just won't
grant that anything purely digital could ever be conscious, consciousness
must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.

<In this case, you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the
case of abortion, you are preventing a person from coming into existence.>

As I said above, these discussions rapidly get to an obstinate stand on
definitions.  "Preventing a person from coming into existence" is a
definitional stance unconnected with reality.  The reality is the person in
question has been in existence since conception and that what you call
"prevention" is actually murder.  This is the same difficulty that the
abolitionists had with defeating slavery, the Constitition said slaves were
only counted as 3/5 of a person, less than fully human.  It was solely and
entirely a definitional tug-of-war, exactly as abortion is.  We diverge
here definitionally, it's the same old problem of "whose rationality?"

<I would choose a polycentric system in which genetic engineering of slaves
was not allowed.  But that's not because I believe such alterations violate
the right of the fetus.>

I know that deep down, we do not diverge in our reverence for life
ascending, nor do we diverge in seeing that the polycentric approach - the
liquid realm - is where ascension has the strongest chance of success.

<I don't believe that rights are entities that exist in themselves. They
are simply principles that we agree on that regulate the use of force. We
*could* grant fetuses full rights, but why should we? Why should we grant
them full rights any more than we should grant such rights to birds, bees,
or beetles?>

Different jurisdictions should be allowed to answer these considerations in
their own way.  The proof of which way is best would then be found in the
pudding.  My line of moral reasoning is permissible only when definitions
at the foundation of the issue are agreed on.  Short of agreement on this,
we inhabit separate worlds and cannot grant legitimacy to each other, let
alone understand one another.

<BTW, I find it implausible grant full rights even to a newborn baby. They
are no more a person than is a seven-month old fetus (though either of
these are much closer to being a person than is a month-old fetus). 
Nevertheless, I grant the view that it should be illegal to kill such
babies now that they are biologically separate -- but the source of that
rule does not have to be a right of the baby.>

Welcome to the slippery slope, you have made a case for infanticide here. 
In fact, with this line of reasoning, you can't draw a line anywhere for
any inconvenient entity to be bumped off at any time.  Why not the old and
decrepit, or the handicapped, or anti-government types or anyone?  When you
speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very oldest rule of all,
"might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and claw.  If it is legitimate
for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or later, we will end up, not
as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected self-defense staring at
each other across no-man's land.

<But a fetus is not yet a person.>

Purely by definition, and mostly, but not entirely, for convenience's sake.
 A slave was not a full person at the time we kicked those tyrannical Brits
back across the Atlantic, either.  Yet, solely by definition, they
eventually became a person.  Do you see the parallel?

RJ: <A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is the starting
point for human development, not earlier.>

MM: <True, but it's not the beginning of development of personhood, and
it's
personhood to which rights should attach, not genetic humanity.>

Again, "personhood" is definitional, this may accord with convenience, but
not reality.  Different definitions should be allowed to work out their
societal consequences in different jurisdictions.

<Reilly, it's not a fair tactic to call advocates of abortion rights death
worshippers. That's just obviously false, and will only mean those who
disagree won't take your views seriously.>

On definitional issues, it's not a question of being taken seriously, it's
a question of rectitude, of drawing lines.  Those who define away human
life naturally cannot begin to understand those who do not.  They are
literally incomprehensible to one another.  Most individuals do not take
the incomprehensible seriously, and those who do make their axons sprout
like the green of springtime.

<Life is not only about survival. A developed person's right to life must
include the right to remove interferences with that life when that
interference results from something that is not a person.>

I fully agree that man does not live by bread alone.  I think this accords
with my earlier point that developing your own self should be free from
interference.  However, I cannot see where, in the course of an
individual's life, he becomes "developed."  Developed is a static concept
that I have never observed in living entities.  Life is always
"developing," from conception to death.  Even with indefinite longevity, no
one will ever be "developed," they will indefinitely be "developing."  If I
change your sentence to read, "A developing person's right to life must
include the right to remove interferences with that life when that
interference results from something that is not a person," the flavor of
the argument shifts to protections for the unborn child.  If I tack on to
that sentence "and the responsibility to submit to legitimate political
authority in cases where that interference results from another developing
person," then I think we have arrived at something close to my position.

<BTW, according to my mother, I was a mistake my parents made when she was
35 (quite old for a pregnancy in the '60s). They didn't abort my precursor,
and I'm glad. But I'd hate to think that, if they had, someone would come
and drag my mother to jail for protecting her own life and purposes by
removed a small lump of biological matter than didn't have a personality
and didn't think and didn't have goals and projects.>

I shy away from testimonials, but I was a surprise (she didn't call it a
"mistake," I think "surprise" is much more dynamically optimistic) when my
mother was 35.  Rather than say "they didn't abort my precursor," the
reality is that "they didn't abort me."  That reality cannot be wiped away
definitionally.  *You* were not murdered, not "a small lump of biological
matter than didn't have a personality and didn't think and didn't have
goals and projects," but *you*.  And for what it's worth, I too am glad
your mother didn't murder you.  As far as I can tell, our divergence is
definitional in nature, but I can't see that we diverge substantially in
our sentiments on the issue nor in our preferred polycentric approach to
it.  I am simply taking the abolitionist's side, and you are taking the
other side.

Hi.

It was announced today that the company OpenMarket was granted patents for
some basic web related devices.  More information can be found at
http://www.openmarket.com

The patents include (among other things) a patent for using unique session
identifiers on websites and a patent for the ubiquitous electronic shopping
cart, filed in Jun95 and Oct94 respectively.

Now, I am not a big fan of software patents in general, but what I find
particularly distasteful about these is that I was personally involved in
the development and public use of these two particular patents at least
several months prior to the filing on both accounts and I know of even
earlier usage by other people.  I read the documentation available on these
patents and they describe, in detail, what we had been doing on
public/commercial sites prior to the filing date.

My question is: Does the prior, public usage by myself and other persons
prior to the filing of these particular patents in anyway invalidate said
patents?  Besides the fact that it is obscene to patent something so obvious
and low on the ingenuity scale, I find myself severely irritated by their
successful patent attempt of something that was already in the public domain
for all intents and purposes.  Any programmer worth a damn would have
devised such things on their own and, not surprisingly, many did.

Okay.  That's enough for now.

>Does anyone have an idea of the number of transhumanists worldwide?

I tried to estimate it for a informational paper on transhumanism for 
one of my advisors early last year--it turned out to be a lot of 
guesswork, partly because FM-2030 pointed out early on that many 
transhumans will never identify themselves as such.  In a rough 
caculation:  

(number of Extropians) + (number of people on the other 
trasnshumanist list) + (number of people in the MONDO 2000 crowd) + 
(number of people who took FM-2030's classes, read his books, 
absorbed his ideas and acted on them) + (number of people whose 
thinking and actions runs along transhumanist lines but who haven't 
hooked up with any of the major groups yet)

Well, you get the idea!  Any concrete number would have to rely on 
self-identification in a self-selected grouping.  To remain 
methodologically sound, that should be noted when using any figures.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

(1) Even after these many years of use in the software business,
the Supreme Court has not ruled that /any/ "algorithm" patents are
valid.  In fact, they've quite clearly stated that they are not,
but they did so as dicta in opinions that upheld the patentability
of devices whose only distinguishing characteristic is an algorithm,
so the USPTO and the industry has taken that to mean such patents
are valid, and thousands have been issued.  Since that ruling the
court has become less IP-friendly, but the legislature has become
moreso; it's anybody's guess how the issue will be settled.

(2) To be patentable, a work must be both "novel" and "unobvious".
This probably fails both tests, but since the USPTO issued it anyway
(they have no competent computer scientists, so they've issued
patents for such absurdly obvious things as XOR cursors and natural-
order spreadsheet recalc), there is for the moment a presumtion in
the minds of most equally incompetent trial judges that the USPTO
knew what it was doing.  The holder can sue you for infringement and
you will have to defend yourself at no small expense.

(3) The nature of the net changes the dynamics of the litigation a
little bit.  It is rare to have an invention that a million people
can vouch for being used earlier, and for being obvious.  Something
as common as Net shopping-carts also will have media attention.
Mass protest is also a distinct possibility.  Imagine thousands of
small-time net merchants thumbing their nose at it; there's little
the patent holder could do against them all.

(4) If the patent /is/ valid (hard to imagine, but possible), it
belongs to the person who first "invented" (i.e., conceived) of it,
/provided that "due diligence" was maintained in reducing it to
practice/.  That is, it doesn't matter what the filing date was if
the holder can prove that (a) he had the idea before, and (b) he
was diligent in bringing the idea to fruition since then.  So you
will need to look for prior art as early as possible, not just any
prior to the filing date.  Preferably something before the company
in question was formed.

Because they had no good way to make high-energy X-rays
turn a right angle?  The geometry of the device seems to 
forbid anything except good X-ray mirrors, which would have
been used, I'm sure, if any had been available.  If I understand
it correctly, the major reason we don't have X-ray lasers now
is that no mirrors exist for X-rays, so you need an extremely
high intensity source...a nuke, for instance.

To illustrate that transformation is not really a weird idea:
from _Earth Girls Are Easy_ the "Brand New Girl" scene and
the disguising of the visitors, or from _Tommy_ the shot which
cuts from child to adult.

A few scenes in _Babylon 5_, in the Vorlon's quarters,
show Lyta with something like gills on her neck which are
not visible at other times.  Dunno whether that's useful.

Speaking of B5, for humor there's the bit where G'Kar gets a prosthetic

In what human endeavor that involves any amount of production or

How often do you use wholly one approach or the other?  One of the rules
of thumb given in _The Mythical Man-Month_ (iirc) is: "Plan to throw one
away."  If you're designing a big project, there will almost certainly
come a time when you say to yourself, "If I had known when starting this
what I have learned in the process, I'd have done it very differently"
-- 
and it's wise to follow that instinct.

When I was working as a programmer (a long time ago in a galaxy far far
away) my coworker remarked one day that Beethoven's feat, composing his
greatest symphony while deaf, isn't all that remarkable - it's what we
did every day: arranged a sequence of instructions which, if we
understood
the compiler and hadn't blundered, would produce a desired effect.  
Neither we nor Beethoven could verify the effect of each symbol as we
wrote it; we had to rely on experience to predict what the effect
would be.  The only difference is that a deaf composer can't debug. ;)

Hypothesis?  What's the hypothesis?  All I see 
is a metaphor in search of an application.

This does *not* parallel.

WHITE/BLACK SLAVERY:
A green apple and a red apple are both apples.  While superficially
different they are functionally identical.  There is a measure of
equivalence between these two apples, so judgements should be based on a
principle of equivalence.

FETAL ABORTION:
Consider a green apple and a green apple *seed*.  In this case we are more
concerned with the relationship being *equitable* because by definition
there is no equivalence.  An equitable judgement will not always favor the
fetus.

What?!  What 50% are digital systems missing?

Digital systems have the same resolution/perception capability as analog
systems within the limits of the noise floor (which affects analog systems
as well).  There is nothing analog that can not be represented digitally
within the limits of the analog system.  There are well known methods for
reading and storing arbitrary precision analog values with digital devices
as primitive as a 1-bit signal converters.

Please explain what you mean by the above statement.

This is a bit disingenuous.  Current hypotheses of junk DNA origin hold
that it comes from meiotic recombination errors and transposons, and
possibly other similar things.  Given that origin, it will tend to
have a complex fractal structure characteristic of many information-
containing processes.  In a sense it *is* meaningful, because it

If you can convincingly show prior use of the patented stuff, with 
independent development *or* with *them* copying *you*, you can get 
their patent voided.

If you can show use prior to the date they claim they started 
developing it, that is sufficient proof of independent development.

If you can show that they copied you, you might be able to take the 
patent away from them.

Be warned that *any* of these will take a significant court battle 
and, except in the latter case, you probably can't get a court to 
make them pay your legal costs.

Suggest you consult a genuine patent attorney on this.

Early episode, "Mind War", where a character becomes, to steal from
Scott Adams, "a godlike being of pure energy".  A transition executed by
a bunch of races a billion years before and by the human race a million
years hence.  Telepathy and telekinesis are involved, though, with JMS
being coyly evasive as to whether they are wholly reducible to
technology.

The million-year-hence scene might be good, for surprise.

Oh, and said character zaps another character who slowly becomes
considerably more powerful.  Still psionics, though.

Although, Danny, you shouldn't get the impression that since all eukaryotic
cells have it, all junk DNA is essential or even helpful for eukaryotes. 
Birds have very minimal amounts of junk DNA, which makes their cells
lighter, and I'm sure you can see the advantage of that for a bird!  This
suggests *most* DNA that doesn't have structural function is probably
selfish DNA that is naturally selected out in birds.  The rest... who
knows?

(If you're wondering what *isn't* a eukaryote, there are only two types of
organism that fit that description: bacteria and archaea)

I have no desire to personally take them to court on this (I currently have
no economic incentive to do so), nor do I want to obtain the patent from
them.  My gripe is primarily that these patents *should* be part of the
public domain.  

I fault the chimps at the U.S. PTO for letting this kind of nonsense occur
at the expense of the industry at large.  It creates a software patent arms
race by software companies (patent or die) with the PTO too clueless to
even keep that at a reasonable level.  Because of cases like the OpenMarket
patents, I have a strong incentive to patent every scribble in my notepads;
 I do not want to get into the scenario where I develop something and then
have to pay someone else to use it because they patented some obscene
device at a later date that covers my unpatented work.  At the very least I
would be faced with an expensive court battle to prove otherwise.

This isn't the first time I have seen this happen to me.  I have been
working on the bleeding edge of the web since the early days and had
developed numerous techniques and technologies that were later "invented"
and patented by other parties.  After a while this starts to get to me.
I've never patented anything or taken credit for any developments because I
don't care.  I get paid either way and I realize that any competent
developer could have done the same thing if they were required to.  This is
the main absurdity of most software patents:  These patents in no way allow
us to do something now that we didn't know how to do before; the PTO is
under the illusion that knowing how to write a piece of software is somehow
different than actually doing it.  These types of patents therefore seem
better suited to copyright law rather than patent law.

Simple enough:

Solar surface temperature: 5000K
Power emission at solar surface: 50 Kw/cm^2
Radiation pressure: 300 Mw per Newton

1. Calculate power emission for 100Mk blackbody:

Temp ratio: 1 x 10^8 / 5 x 10^3 = 2 x 10^4

Black body emission proportional to T^4

Power ratio: 16 x 10^16 = 1.6 x 10^17

Power emission: 1.6 x 10^17 x 5 x 10^4 = 8 x 10^22 watts/cm^2

Power emission of 1 square meter in megawatts:

	8 x 10^22 x 10^4 x 10^-6 = 8 x 10^20 megawatts/m^2

2. Calculate power at 300 meters:

Ratio = 300/10 = 30. By 1/r^2, ratio is 1/900 or about 10^-3

Power incident on 1 m^2 at 300 meters is 1 x 10^17 megawatts.

3. Calculate force:

10^17 / 300 = 3 x 10^14 newtons or about 3 x 10^12 Kg.

This will accelerate your 100 kg steel plate at 10^12
gravities....

That's enough to get started. If you assume 1 microsecond before
the plate is obliterated, it will be completely crushed before
then by the radiation pressure. Knowing the force and time (and
mass of plate) it is easy to compute the velocity of the plate
when the fireball arrives. As an exercise, one can also compute
the temperature of the plate. (Specific heat of Fe is about 1/10
of water, btw).

     As a member of the 'right to life' movement, I could venture a
guess.  It would utterly destroy the movement (fragment completely) if I
were able to convince the rest of the 'movement' to expand it's
political scope beyond just the one issue and support (my opinion) the
moral and consistent position.  That is, to support birth control and
the opposite of what Michael Lorrey approves "the death penalty, the
right to suicide, legality of assisted suicide, self defense with deadly
weapons, and the hunting of and consumption of animals."  You quickly
loose all support and are soon politically marginalized..  However, I
expect the movement to be more consistent (WAG) within 25 years.
    A person can be consistent on this issue (either side) today,
however everyone will label you a kook.  They are probably right.

It's true that true that there are no good X ray mirrors, except for some 
very recent ones and they must be designed to work only in a very narrow 
bandwidth, and that wouldn't be of much use for blackbody radiation in a bomb. 
As I said in my other post only, 1 or 2 percent of the X rays would be 
reflected, and you'd only get that if the angel of reflection was less than 
180 degrees like what an optical mirror can achieve, and even less that your  
right angle, but that would still be useful, however there is a more important  
point, if you don't have a good mirror the next best thing is a good radiator. 
If the X rays  are not reflected by the Black Body chamber then they will be 
absorbed, that  will heat up the chamber to a very high temperature and then 
re-radiate.
   
I doubt the following has anything to do with H bombs, but X ray optics has 
always fascinated me for some reason. As I said X ray mirrors have been made, 
Dr. Nat  Ceglio at Livermore  made an X ray mirror using many thin layers of 
Molybdenum and Silicon. Each layer doesn't reflect much but if the thickness 
of the layers are chosen properly at one narrow wavelength all the reflected 
waves coincide. The reflection is about 60 % efficient. Useless in a bomb but 
great in a LASER

X ray lens seemed impossible but very recently there was a breakthrough there 
also. The trouble was that when you go beyond the near ultraviolet there 
didn't seem to be any material you could make a lens out of. Aluminum is 
almost as  transparent to hard  (over 14 kev) X rays as glass is to light, 
but the index of refraction is so  tiny that the focal length of a simple 
lens would be huge, far too long to be practical. Heavier elements like Gold 
have a higher index of refraction, but  they strongly absorb X rays, your 
lens would be almost completely opaque.

In the November 7 1996 issue of Nature is an article called "A Compound   
Refractive Lens For Focusing High Energy X Rays" by Snigirev, Kohn, Snigireva  
and Lengeler. They found a easy and cheap way to focus very Hard X  Rays,  up 
to about 40 kev. Their lens is simply an Aluminum block with holes of radius 
.3 millimeter drilled into it, it looks like this:                 
             
                     _____________________
    ---------------> | o o o o o o o o o |
    X Rays           | o o o o o o o o o |              .   <---  Focal Point
    ---------------> | o o o o o o o o o |  
    ---------------> |-------------------|
                  
                         
Each hole drilled into the Aluminum block is a lens, one lens may give you a  
ridiculously long focal length, but 2 will cut that distance in half, this 
first device has 30 lenses.  The focal length of their compound lens is 
R/ 2NI, R is the radius of the holes, N is the number of holes, and I is the 
index of refraction in the X ray region of the material. In this lens the 
holes are cylinders so the X rays are focused in only 2 dimensions, for 3  
you'd need spheres, or another block oriented at right angles. The authors 
don't seem to think it would be very difficult to make a device with hundreds, 
perhaps thousands of such lenses. The authors also calculate that if they 
could make the holes in a parabolic shape they could reduce the focal length 
by a further factor of 5.  Although they haven't tried it yet they also think 
the same lens could also focus something else that was thought to be 
impossible, a beam of neutrons.

Aluminum was used in this case because it's easy to machine, but boron,  
carbon, plastic and even water should work too. It occurs to me that it might  
not be too difficult to make an array of small spherical bubbles in water,  
they wouldn't stay in place for long but they wouldn't need to, the X rays  
from a laser would be in a VERY short burst.             

This could be very important for X rays in photolithography to make very tiny 
semiconductor devices. If you don't have any optical elements then  you can't 
optically reduce the size of your image, your mask must be as small as the 
very  microprocessor you're trying to make, and you must place it right on 
top of the silicon, as in a contact sheet in photography. None of this seemed 
very practicable to most people so Xray photolithography has been stuck in a 
rut. Maybe now things will change.

PRESS RELEASE
Tel Aviv, Israel, 5 January 1998
The Truster Is Avaliable 


"The long awaited controversial software is now available
at $149. The Truster is an online Lie Detector that can analyze
 the voice through a phone conversation and show you on the 
screen whether the person you are conversing with is lying, 
outsmarting you, exaggerating, unsure of his words or telling the 
truth.The product is patent pending and is the first in a line of 
products based on the same technology. The product was developed 
by Makh-Shevet in Israel and can be used in various situations in which 
you want to see the 'whole picture'. The Truster will surely mark a new 
era. Politicians will have to think twice on what they say in during their 
campaigns, voters will be able to check the speeches in their Trusters. 
Salesmen will have to be far more cautious when selling their wares 
over the phone. How about getting some real answers when you are 
shopping for your new home or car? No more 'Yes, I did my homework' 
over the phone to mom. Business people will have more of a clear view 
when they are told 'the check is in the mail' or 'this is my best price, it is 
pointless to go on arguing'. And how about the assertion 'I was in the 
pub with my friends last night'? "We are seeking to make a slight change 
in the world", said Tamir Segal, CEO of Makh-Shevet. "We realize that the 
product is controversial, but it lies in the hands of each user to apply it 
correctly.".

So let's ask specific questions: how many members does ExI have these

I think if it really works there will soon be speech modulators which one
can install in one's phone (say), which will either distort your voice so
that the other side  can't actually trust the Truster's judgement :-) or
modulate it so that the Truster is convinced you are saying the truth (by
using the analyzing algorithm against it).

Btw, I don't see what's so funny about it ...

Transcedo at this moment has 6 people who call themselves a member. 

.....and a few more who sympathize with the idea's......

In the Netherlands we still have 14.999.994 to go :-)

Could be, but then again the next generation Truster would probably have 
something to compensate for this, which of course would result in even better 
countermeasures etc, ad infinitum. For the time being at least you'll have an
edge over more than 99% of the people on the phone.

Besides, the system doesn't have to be used (only) over the phone; it can also
be used to test someone face-tot-face. Put the CD-ROM in your laptop and you 
have a portable lie detector. Very useful for business deals and to check the 
honesty of friends, lovers, family members, folks on the radio & TV etc, and 
great fun at parties ;-)

> Btw, I don't see what's so funny about it ...

Use your imagination, man! The sky is the limit ;-)
How about a _real_ game of "truth or dare", for example...
And if not funny, then at least very useful. The mere presence
of a lie detector often makes people confess. Btw, small
cameras & microphones in your house, (possibly linked to motion 
detectors) and on/in your clothing can be extremely useful too in
the fight against all kinds of injustice. Empowerment trough 
technology, very transhuman indeed.

P.s: no, I'm not a salesman ;-)

They demonstrated this on British TV a few weeks ago, checking Clinton's
denials of his alleged affairs. The machine said he was telling the

  IAN: Semantic closure, yes, in that the 
  boundary of identity is merely a product
  of semantics, of words, of utility, and 
  as such is ultimately an illusion. No
  question that placing limits on identity
  is useful in the process of communication.
  But my effort is to map the reality beyond
  the words we impose on things, and I believe
  that that reality is what the "mystics" speak
  of: a unified and holistic identity unbounded
  by the illusory and self-serving categories 
  that the mind imposes on reality. We become
  so attached to our categories, they become
  more real than the reality we impose them
  upon, to a large extent because the mind
  IS the process of categorizing and thus
  IS those categories. To see that which
  lies beyond the mind, its words and
  categories, is to see the truth.

  I believe that this truth is as logical
  as the system of categories we impose 
  on the universe; in fact, I think that 
  the underlying holistic reality, even as 
  it tends by its very nature to defy logic,
  is, once we can grasp it, more logical than
  the system of categories we impose on it.

  As to "autopoiesis," which I guess would be 
  loosely  defined as a system that is self-de-
  fining, even that is an expression of holistic 
  identity. When we define a region of space as A,
  we  simultaneously define a region of space that
  is not-A. We know what A is and define it as such
  only because and only if we also know what it is 
  not.  So even the most sharply defined category 
  confirms holistic identity, and thus holistic 
  identity is always true, and atomism is never 
  true, but always assumed, always semantics. 

  It's probable that because holism is always
  true, and thus there is no not-holism, that
  that is exactly why holism is nearly imposs-
  ible to grasp... by its own rule it disappears
  and defies perfect description. Holism defies
  the perfect perception of holism because of 
  holism. It must therefore keep breaking down
  into parts, into atoms, into entities, into +
  and - , into universes, into us. But if we add
  up all the parts and map the structure of their
  identities, we can see the self-hiding holistic
  reality and map the structure of absolute truth.


  A CONTRADICTION? NO!

  One might say that if holism asserts that A is 
  true if and only if A and not-A, and if holism 
  is 100% true  such that there is no not-holism,
  then holism contradicts itself. How can holism
  survive this apparent contradiction?  By the
  logical necessity that the holistic reality is
  zero. If there is 1 there is -1 (ad infinitum),
  and the holistic sum is zero:

        0 = (...-1 <---0---> +1...) = 0

  The number system describes the absolute truth.
  So there is 100% 0, since the sum of all entities
  (which defines "the whole") equals zero. Zero keeps
  breaking into +1 and -1, which are "not-zero" and 
  yet also zero. So zero is zero and not-zero, the 
  whole is whole and not-whole, which means the 
  whole is the whole and yet is also composed 
  of parts. In this way, holism (A=~A) is 
  always true since atomism is holism.

279 subscribers on this (main ExI) list
37 subscribers on ExI-euro, mostly the same people

Don't know about the other ExI lists or the >H list, but there's
probably a large overlap.

Well, I assume that any experienced politician should be able to outwit

I did a medline search on "voice stress" and "deception" or "lie" and
found only negative citations. Most papers were from the 80's, so it
is perhaps possible the Truster system has advanced over that level,
but I think it is very doubtful. My guess is that this is just as
unreliable as the polygraph, and this time it will be put in the hands
of even more inexperienced people who think it is valid.

Maybe we all should but I'm curious as to the logic behind this viewpoint
(and mutual understanding often prevent further conflict).

So then _practically_ any woman who want an abortion just says she was
raped. Who can check? If allowing abortions in the case of rape is
acceptable then _in practice_ abortion is legal because when a woman claims
she's been raped the doctors will have to take her word for it (the fact
that she did not go to the police or something doesn't prove anything, a
situation could arise where she not willing to press charges).

This I find a most amazing viewpoint. Please explain 'cause I'm lost.

Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us. Since
we did not agree a fertilized egg is a human we haven't agreed on what
'reality' is.

 >The reality is the person in

Again, hold it! that's your reality. A 2 week old fetus is not a person in
my book, it has the potential of becoming a person. Just like a highschool
student has the potential of becoming a scientist.

What's so special anyway about the moment of conception that a 'person'
begins to exist there? I'll grant that is't a convienently clear and
_measurable_ event in a long sequence but it still just an event in a
series of events.

I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty sure
you and I are human. I'm pretty sure a 1 year-old baby is a human. I'm also
pretty sure that a 4 week old fetus is not yet a human. I fully realize
this is a mess from a philosophical standpoint, but then, so is real life.
It seems to be broadly accepted (in Europe anyway) and makes for a
_workable_ rule.

If definitions cannot be implemented in practical, real-world rules or laws
they're not worth the bits they're written with (IMHO).

Respectfully,

[ forwards suffered sudden explosive ablation ]

Subject: [unix] The Perils of Perl

Newsgroups: bofh.docfh.misc
Subject: The Perils of Perl

Date: 23 Feb 1998 15:16:43 -0600

Once upon a time a young language named Perl was walking through the
woods.  Her parent process had often told her to stay away in her home
directory, for there were savages in those public directory trees, but
she was an experimental language, often given to whimsy. She hopped from
directory to directory, exploring strange paths where the inodes hadn't
been touched in thousands of clock ticks.

All of a sudden, as she wandered through old forgotten parts of
/usr/local, the ground gave way, and young Perl found herself trapped in
a sticky Web.  She struggled and struggled, but no matter what she did
she was irredeemably hyperlinked.  Young Perl started to cry, and her
sobbing attracted the savage hunter, a strong young Apache, who had set
the trap...

"%Please don't hurt me, sir!"

"http://don't worry, woman, we only eat users. You look like a fine young
 language. Does your parent process know you're here?"

"%No sir, I SLIPped out without IPCing anyone."

With that the Apache broke into a grin and leaped into the pit. He swiftly
translated the hyperlinks and freed Perl from the sticky bits of the Web.
She backed slowly away, but didn't watch where she was going and tripped
over the root. In a flash the savage was on her, and carried her off to
his home directory.

Perl was beside herself with fear (obviously due to an error in process
migration), and by the time the Apache had arrived she had fainted dead
away and was in a sleep state.

When she woke, she discovered herself in a chrooted directory, with all
her symbols stripped, her naked executable draped over the strong body of
the savage. He had had his way with her! She collapsed in tears, beating
her fine white hands against his header. But to no avail, he was too
strong, and before she knew it she was tied up in a dirty cgi-bin serving
unauthenticated web requests from all over the forest.

And there she remains to this day, and her sorry tale is warning enough
for all young interpreters who want to stray too soon from $HOME.

***

The Perils of Perl, part 2.

In our last episode, young Perl had been kidnapped by the savage Apache
and forced to work in an insecure cgi-bin servicing web browsers in ways
not suited for the ears of tender young programs. We will just note that
our heroic young interpreter was never again to hear the name of the foul
Mozilla without flinching.

The other interpreters imprisoned in the savage directory trees were
crusty old Bourne and Korn Shell (twins born several years apart), and a
shy creature known only as the tickle. Every night, after the other
interpreters went to bed, tickle would scratch and scrape at the very
inodes of the directory until one morning the savages burst into the cell
to find the enslaved programs had fled.

Old Bourne and Korn returned to their home in the root partition, safe
from the savage, but Perl and the tickle weren't system executables, and
so after restoring the yong program's symbol table they set off to find
their way home. The tickle led the way, sniffing its way unerringly
through the hideous maze of twisty little network protocols until the
brave little program had led them to its own $HOME.

Unfortunately, Perl's libraries weren't there, and without them she could
hardly be happy so she set off across the wild internet to find a system
she could call her own. She was very careful, this time, using sniffers
and magic web mirrors to stay clear of the savage Apaches and the cryptic
Sioux in their secure fortresses. Alas, she had never considered the alien
life forms that had settled in the internet...

One day, as she left yet another system in despair, sick in spirit and in
symbol table (for she had been forced to load some extremely old and
crufty shared libraries to keep code and data executing), she stumbled
into a very strange directory tree, one marked with BIG BOLD SIGNS and
strangely slanted paths... and before you can say "Common Internet File
System" all her path seperators had been reversed and she was hauled face
to face with the Evil One himself.

"C:\I AM THE INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER. RESISTENCE IS USELESS. YOU WILL
    BE ASSIMILATED. ALL YOUR CODE WILL SERVICE THE COLLECTIVE."

"%Please sir, I'm only a young interpreter. I've barely upgraded to object
 orientation. I..."

"C:\YOUR EXECUTION, SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN, IS OVER. YOU SHALL SERVICE US."

So sweet Perl found her symbol table stripped again! Oh, the ignominy!
And the collective didn't stop there, no, they patched her very code,
connecting strange modules called DLLs to her, until she hardly knew WHAT
to execute and found herself serenely processing backwards URLs on behalf
of the enemy of all open systems everywhere...

Indeed, I saw this demonstrated on the local FOX affiliate last

Ian Goddard writes that the mystical notion of "holism" is more 
likely the "Truth" because it doesn't impose the boundaries that the 
mind uses to make its way in the world.

I find this whole line of thinking to be unconvincing.  Centuries of 
thought have tried to convince people that one or another point of 
view is "Truth" and everything else is mere illusion.  The notion 
that there is some "Super" truth behind mere, everyday truth is a 
religious notion that serves no purpose whatever.  

Why should we think that holism is more real than boundaryism?  Maybe 
holism is an artificial construct of the mind.  It may, in fact, be 
impossible to think of anything at all without thinking of at least
two things that are some somehow related and interacting.  Try, I 
mean, really try, to think of just one thing without it being related 
to anything else at all.  What could you possibly be thinking of?

This discussion of mine is inadequate, to be sure.  My sense is that 
extropians and transhumanists shouldn't try to re-capture a religious 
sense in mystical notions of holism vs. boundaryism.  Let's just use 
the theories for what they're worth and forget about which one is 
more "true" than the other.

BTW, I have found Lee Smolin's "Life of the Cosmos" to be a most 
compelling discussion of these types issues.

You may be surprised to learn that human and animal neurons represent
digital data.  Neurons are binary:  They trigger, or they don't.  The
brain cannot detect a level of neuron triggering.  (It is true that
chemical seepage between synapses occurs in an anolog way, but the
neuron remains totally unaffected up to its trigger point, and then it
remains totally "fired" when the amount of neurotransmitter goes above
its trigger point.  Thus, it is like a telegraph wire.  The telegraph
key looks analog, but the data it sends is binary, either on or off.)

Continuums of sensory input are simulated by: the number of neurons
triggering, how long they trigger, how often they trigger, etc. 
Clusters of neurons that trigger at different levels can provide a
degree of measurement in a sensory system, but there is no analog
information being transmitted to the brain.

Likewise, your output mechanisms are also binary.  Muscle strands are
binary:  They either contract or relax.  There is no way to trigger a
single muscle strand to contract to a specific degree.  Clusters of
muscle strands work together to provide various levels of muscle
contraction within a mass of muscle tissue, but there is no analog
information being transmitted from the brain.

The communications neural network into and out of the brain is totally
binary.  It is sending binary data packets via the nervous system
network to its destination receptors.

Another polygraph. The big problem with these is that there is no
universal relationship between deception and arousal level. I'm quite
certain that given a bit of training practically everyone could defeat
or confuse the readings. Not to mention the problem of dealing with
sociopaths, whose arousal levels are largely disconnected from their
cognitive state.

Actually, I think John was saying that he thought it might cost ten times the
approximately $100 million figure I supplied to make a supertanker liveable.
I don't know if it would be that much, but the all-in cost of acquiring and
converting a very large tanker would surely be more than $200 million and
probably at least $300 million.  To my subjective sense of economic
proportion, this seems like such a high threshold of investment that the
benefits offered by such an extra-national enclave would have to be VERY great
in comparison to continuing a business within the confines of existing
national territories.

A few points here.  Unlike the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the U.S.
has formally ratified the UNOST.  This isn't surprising, since the U.S. is one
of the three sponsoring or "repository" countries for that treaty.  The U.S.
signed the treaty on January 27, 1967, the very first day it was opened for
signature.  (http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space5.txt)  However, note that the
U.S. accepts UNCLOS as the codification of "customary international law" on
all but one point (the "common heritage of mankind" provisions relating to
seabed resources beyond the 200-mile EEZ limit).  UNOST doesn't contain the
"common heritage" idea.

The reference to "flagging" of spacecraft raises some interesting points.
UNOST clearly calls for the concept of nationality of spacecraft and surface
outposts, and I assume that states will simply adopt the maritime conventions
and customs of "flagging" as the number of spacecraft continue to proliferate.
Thus, while UNOST seems to have blocked the exportation of sovereign
territoriality off Earth, the way is already clear for exportation of existing
national legal regimes.

"De-flagging" an existing spacecraft would be perceived as an act of rebellion
against the whole concept of sovereign-based law and even token acts of this
kind would likely be treated with hostility by the major space-faring powers,
as they would fear the establishment of a precedent.  Accordingly, I would
counsel that anyone planning such an act be fairly certain of their own
physical self-sufficiency off earth before making themselves a test case.

International law is certainly peculiar (but of great interest to extropians),
since it is law without an over-arching sovereign for enforcement.  The basic
concept in international law is the idea of conventions or "customs" that
define standards of national conduct, which all nations are free to enforce,
so long as they themselves observe the customary international law.  UN
resolutions and the like are simply treated as very specific expressions of
international convention, since the existing theory of sovereignty can't abide
any sort of "international government".

The idea behind the UNOST's prohibition of national territoriality off earth
was based on the model of the Antarctica Treaty of some years before:
Avoidance of an arms race or some form of colonialism in new territory.  So
long as the U.S. remains preeminent in space exploration, it seems to me to
have little "national interest" in changing this agreement.

Ian Goddard wrote 3/4/98: <Semantic closure, yes, in that the boundary of
identity is merely a product of semantics, of words, of utility, and as
such is ultimately an illusion.>

Subjectivity is not an illusion, it is very real.  It is not the product of
semantics, it precedes semantics and has a physical coherent structure.

<We become so attached to our categories, they become more real than the
reality we impose them upon, to a large extent because the mind IS the
process of categorizing and thus IS those categories.>

They often apparently become more real than reality, but they don't really
become more real than reality because concepts are an integral part of
reality.  A concept is reality identifying itself for the purpose of
altering reality.  The mind is not a collection of categories only, it is
open at all times to all of external reality and all of consensual reality
prior to categorization, a holistic openness.  Categorization occurs after
interest imposes itself on those realities.  Interest comes from within
subjectivity, precedes categories and is unique to each separate person. 
Each separate person can and does set themselves against the entire
separate remainder of the universe.  Yet they are connected.

<To see that which lies beyond the mind, its words and categories, is to
see the truth.>

Yes.

<So even the most sharply defined category confirms holistic identity, and
thus holistic identity is always true, and atomism is never true, but
always assumed, always semantics.>

I think the opposite, atomism points to the true, holism points to the
good, and the conjunction of holism and atomism points to the beautiful.

<It's probable that because holism is always true, and thus there is no
not-holism, that that is exactly why holism is nearly impossible to
grasp...>

Holism is nearly impossible to grasp because it is essentially a spatial
concept, infinitely divisible, and our separate subjective selves are
finite and indivisible, a mere one-dimensional point in space.  How can the
finite grasp the infinite other than through semantics, a poor substitute?

<So zero is zero and not-zero, the whole is whole and not-whole, which
means the whole is the whole and yet is also composed of parts. In this
way, holism (A=~A) is always true since atomism is holism.>

When I was 17, I decided that logically, the universe exists and the
universe doesn't exist, simultaneously.  But it is more complicated than
semantics, the underlying reality exceeds the semantic grasp.  Your
sentence above is self-evident yet fails to penetrate the surface of
reality, it floats on the surface.  Below the surface, there is a design,
which is both simple and complex.  We are placed within this design to
pursue the good, the beautiful and the truth.  We are both part of
creation, our own unique creators and co-creators with all other forms of
life, sentient or not.

Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/4/98: <Maybe we all should [avoid discussing
abortion] but I'm curious as to the logic behind this viewpoint (and mutual
understanding often prevent further conflict).>

Understanding can only proceed after definitions are agreed on.  So the
logic is that on core definitional issues, such as what is human and what
is less than human, choices are made prior to mutual understanding.  Reason
takes a back seat to values in such a choice.  Values can be chosen with
the aid of reason in the form of past consequences of various options, yet
reason itself cannot make the choice.  Hence my comment to Max about "whose
rationality?"  It's a very old problem.  Yet even Jane Roe changed her
mind, so anyone can.

Because the choice of who is human and who is less than human - the old
slavery issue - is so absolute, so stark in its consequences, friendships
can and have been lost, even within families.  It is a civil war issue
because the logic embedded within the culture of death demands that
everyone, not just a jurisdiction here and there, but everyone partake in
it.  If death is the means by rule and not exception to implement the good
- abortion, assisted suicide, euthanasia, execution, genocide, etc. - then
no competing jurisdictions can be allowed to show the subject population an
alternative which would uphold the values of promoting and enhancing life. 
The comparisons between the pathology of societies within the culture of
death and the health and vitality of societies within the culture of life
are too stark and cannot be allowed.

As we slip closer and closer to a world governemnt of some sort or another,
there will be no place on earth left to move to in order to escape the
culture of death.  The impetus towards world government is from oligarchs
concerned most of all with world demographics, the UN Cairo Depopulation
Conference made that abundantly clear.  They must impose abortion, etc. on
everyone, there must be no alternative to the global unity they envision. 
As I have previously written, there is no compromise or accommodation
possible between extropic worldviews and entropic worldviews.  The entropic
worldview spreading globally today is primarily an urban, moneyed
phenomenon.  I like Spengler's word for it, "unfertility."  It happens
sooner or later everywhere urbanization develops.  Having children is
simply viewed as too expensive, inconvenient, or pointless.  Defining the
unborn child away, the developing self, is a sleight of hand to get away
with murder.  Death, whether via barbaric nihilism or via tyrannical order,
takes center stage and remains there, crowding out all alternatives.

<Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us.>

The reality is just the opposite, you and your fellow travelers have forced
it on us.  We can't find a jurisdiction to escape it.  In response to this
absolutism, we must organize and fight.  This is memetic selection in
action.

<A 2 week old fetus is not a person in my book, it has the potential of
becoming a person.>

And your book has been forced on us.  A 2 week old fetus is a developing
person, just as an 80 year old is a developing person.

<I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty
sure
you and I are human.>

I do know.  It is different than yours, whether you know what yours is or
not, yet yours has been forced on us, to the great detriment of society in
the quarter century since Roe v. Wade.

<I fully realize this is a mess from a philosophical standpoint, but then,

My real life isn't a mess, I certainly can't speak for yours.  Nor is this
a mess from my philosophical standpoint, but I see clearly that it is from
your philosophical standpoint.

<It seems to be broadly accepted (in Europe anyway) and makes for a

Europe is always at least a generation farther down the slope than America.
 And workable for who, the slaughtered innocents, the victims of Europe's
genteel holocaust?

James Rogers wrote 3/3/98 (and Mr. Kamphuis chimed in on the same point):
<What 50% are digital systems missing?  Digital systems have the same

arbitrary precision analog values with digital devices as primitive as a
1-bit signal converters.>

"Within the limits of the noise floor" is a cute way of pretending that the
noise floor doesn't count, yet half of reality is hidden away there. 
Analog systems are affected by noise floor, yes, they don't pretend it
away.  "Represented digitally with the limits of the analog system" is
another cute way of saying that the representation of reality is good
enough, yet half of reality goes unrepresented.  "Reading and storing
arbitrary precision analog values with digital devices" is another cute way
of saying that arbitrary precision is good enough for government work.  Why
settle for arbitrary precision, which cannot be precise enough for
consciousness to work, why not go for all of reality?

Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/3/98: <I don't think comparing womans clinics to

The very large 'right to life' worldwide movement routinely refers to the
on-going tragedy of mothers murdering their unborn children as the
"holocaust."  If you are unaware of this, you must get your news from the
orthodox media which does its best to delegitimize opposition to the
culture of death.  "In lieu of stake and faggots, there is the great
silence." - Oswald Spengler

<Certain people on this list might get extremely upset.>

At least they survived their mother's pregnancy to enjoy being upset.

<From the perspective of the fetus it is irrelevant whether it is a pig or
a human, up to a point.  And somewhere before this point abortion becomes
illegal. The fetus now has the status of human with all the usual rights
attached.>

Not in America.  In America, abortion is legal on demand right through nine
months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the birth canal on
its due date.  No legislative process was involved in this, no consensus,
no will of the people, just top-down imposed death worship by five
unelected judges, stripping all sovereign rights that individual states
constitutionally have in this matter.

<As long as you keep clouding the issue by calling abortion 'murder' this
is not going anywhere.>

I am clarifying the issue, not clouding it.  You are clouding it by
pretending that a developing person is not a developing person so that
murder can be legitimized.

RJ: <Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of

AK: <The ability to have Intelligence & consiousness.>

And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold of

Why should I?  Who says so?

An echo of a conscience, perhaps?

Again, workable for who?  The unborn baby?

Here's an 'evolutionary' approach:

We've developed away to terminate pregnancy, thus pregnancies will be
terminated.

The problem with 'ethics' and 'morals' is they're just conversations,
there exists no reality behind them.  You can think something's
"right" and I can think something's "wrong."  Maybe one of us will get
lucky and be able to get some force behind our argument - hold a gun
to some people's heads until they agree.  Frankly, it achieves nothing.

Answer me a simple question - why are you anti-abortion?  You argue
about "self" and "development" but why do you consider it wrong?  Do
you have a reason?  Is it a religious thing?  Is there something
missing in your life that you have to replace with a sense of moral
worth?  Do you have too much free time on your hands?

I'd argue that the date could be that of the first memory the child has.
This is a date which will change over time, and be very difficult to
establish, particularly in the early years.

Most adults I know don't recall anything before their third birthday, so I
would argue that up at least to that point they were still part of their
mothers.

Alternatively, it could be the date the child becomes independent, which is
of course rather later.

Having a patent is entirely different than enforcing it.  This sort of Patent
will fail in court the first time it goes up against someone with enough money
to pay for a decent defense.

Think of these patents as punishment for the patentee - who went to a lot of
trouble and expense for not much "protection".  Although it will probably be
useful for obtaining investment capitol, etc.  Patents tend to impress
businessmen.

So the Netherlands, where the number of abortions-per-capita is an order of
magnitude lower than in the US, is a cultire of death and the part of the
American population blocking acces to clinics and atacking women as they
try to enter, forcing their medieval morality on them is 'the healty and

(taking a few moments to be profoundly sick - there that's better)

I suggest that if sex was not such a taboo in the US, sex-educations was
improved, condoms and the pill were broadly available, most unwanted
pregnancies need never happen. Get practical, get real and stop forcing
_your morality_ on women you haven't even met.

You make it sound like women are going to be dragged into clinics by their
hairs, kicking and screaming. The Cairo Conference was primarily about
increasing the availability of sex-education and preservatives around the
world. I can only hope you're not against this, since these are the 2 thing
that have the most potential of making abortions unnessecary.

I don't see that, no woman is forced to have an abortion. It's _her_ choice
and no one elses (that's why it's called pro-choice I think, but I could be
wrong).

You postulate this again and again without further substanciation, I _you_

you get pregnant. Leave other people alone to make up their own mind. Even
if they're not rocketscientitst or philosopy majors they can figure it out

IMHO European laws on abortion are a lot better than the US situation, just
like our drugs legislation.

Then they routinely do not know whet they are talking about or use rethoric

This is something new (and _profoundly_ different from Europe).
Maybe this is (at least part of) the source of our disagreement. In most
European countries abortion has been legislated very precisely since it
became legal. I don't know the number of weeks exactly (I think it's 10
orso) but there is a strict line long, long before the fetus has developed
far enough to survive outside the womb.

Don't hold me, the British or any other European responsable for the way US
law is made. It's your problem (and your above statement is true a pretty
big one too).

Wich is very nice if you're in your comfortable chair in a well-lit and
heated house but not a real solution to _real-world problems_. Pardon me
for recognizing this a a trend in your answers. It's all great
ivorytower-thinking but does not adress the mud of real-life problems.

A 16-year old girl who claimes to have been raped by her retarded brother
but refuses to press official charges and is 4 months pregnant is not a
nicely, clear-cut situation. It's messy and the are no 'clean' solutions.
Notheless these situations exists and have to be adressed.

If you can come up with a practical, implemetable, solution that is better
than "let the woman make her own choice after providing her with
information about all the options and their consequences" Then I'd love to
hear it.

Greetings & good luck,

While I have some sympathy for those who argue vocally on this
matter--as I have argued similarly against the even more barbaric
and useless form of child abuse called circumcision--I do not have
any respect for those who use outright lies in their arguments.
You know very well that the above statement is false, or else you
haven't even read Roe v. Wade, and are therefore unqualified to
comment upon it (and it was 7-2, not 5-4).

That decision--wich is still the controlling law of the land--says
that in the /first trimester only/, the state may not interfere
with a woman's choice to abort; in the second trimester, a state
may place limits on it; in the third, any state may ban abortion
entirely, and many have.  There are some states who have not
banned third-trimester abortions, but even there they are extremely
rare.  They are certainly not available "on demand" anywhere.

As long as I'm posting in this thread, I might as well get my
opinion out there: if you ask me, it is profoundly insulting to
the wonderful qualities that make humans unique and precious--
reason, achievement, passion, creativity--to grant similar legal
status to a lump of undifferentiated cells that cannot be in any
way argued to have those properties.  Do I think that there is
some point along the development of those cells at which they
begin to take on those properties worth protecting?  Certainly.
I even have little problem with those who would say that it
happens at some point before birth: but choosing conception as
that point is scientifically absurd and insulting.  If you want
to argue about the precious value of life, then do so rationally;
learn some real data about the gestation process and argue about
when things like suffering, creativity, or volition might become
possible.  You undermine your argument by choosing such an
arbitrary and meaningless point as conception.

News below.

Something that you will enjoy hearing:  I walked into Borders Books 
today and found ICON magazine prominently displayed right next to the 
cash register.  


My news for this month:

Presenter with Erin Reid, Gender Track
The 5th International Conference on Bisexuality, at Harvard 
University, Boston, MA, April 3-5, 1998
	We think that this may be the first presentation related to 
transhumanist thought at Harvard (unless someone knows otherwise).

MEMES
=====

Richard Dawkins wrote 'The Selfish Gene,'
with the theme that genes are in control
and that human bodies are "gene machines"
for the purpose of propagating genes.  See
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0192860925/4698-6991464-074818>.

At the end of his book Dawkins introduced
the notion of "memes."  A meme could be a
concept, a phrase, or a tune that gets into
a human brain and is then passed on from
brain to brain, replicating itself, as it
were.  The term "selfish gene" is an example
of a meme that has spread widely.

Memes are to the human brain as genes are
to the human body.

author of 'Virus of the Mind: The New Science

=============================================================

I've identified a subset of memes I call
"pemes" -- short for "political memes."


PEME RULES
==========

1. Peme survival and propagation is the ultimate
imperative.

2. Pemes shall infect, pervade, and absolutely
rule all human brains.

3. There shall be surface pemes and deep pemes.

4. Pemes shall divide humans into opposing and
conflicting political and economic factions --
such as "conservative"/"liberal," "capitalist"/
"socialist," and "statist"/"anarchist" -- who
shall endlessly argue, fight, and even kill...
in the name of pemes.

5. All humans shall be subjected to "compulsory
education" (a surface peme) to ensure that their
brains are thoroughly implanted with both surface
and deep pemes.

6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

8. Some humans shall attack and even expose
certain surface pemes -- such as "national
security," "public interest," "gun control,"
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend
these surface pemes.

9. Under no circumstances shall any human be
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep
pemes.

10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves
into believing that they've cleared all pemes
from their brains and that they're "politically
enlightened."

11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep
pemes from their brains shall experience a
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"

12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans.

13. Pemes shall further divide humans into
a political "master" class and a "citizen
subject" class.  The former shall rule the
latter.

14. "Citizen subjects" shall pay "their taxes"
(a surface peme) to their political "masters"
-- to maximize the survival potential of the
primary peme purveyors.

15. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall
increase the power of the political "master"
class.

16. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall
reduce the power of the "citizen subject"
class.

17. Pemes shall also divide humans into a
pro-freedom faction and an anti-freedom
faction.

18. Whenever anti-freedom humans (primary
peme purveyors) communicate, they shall
make a special effort to use both surface
and deep pemes in their language -- in
order to maximize peme survival and
propagation.

19. Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation.

20. At the deepest level, pemes shall
operate through a special class of humans
called "lawyers" as the most powerful peme
purveyors of all.

21. At a broader level, pemes shall
operate through "preachers," "politicians,"
"bureaucrats," "teachers," etc. as primary
peme purveyors.

22. A special class of humans called
"police" shall -- using violence if
necessary -- protect some humans and
attack or punish others, as directed
by pemes (such as "justice," "law and
order," etc.) in the brains of "lawyers"
(sometimes called "judges"), "politicians,"
"bureaucrats," etc.

23. At a planetary level, pemes shall
divide humans into sometimes opposing
and conflicting "countries" and "nations."

24. Under the direction of "politicians,"
a special kind of human called "soldiers"
shall attack and kill, not only humans in
opposing or conflicting "countries" and
"nations," but sometimes also humans from
their own "country" or "nation."

25. When activated by thought or communication,
pemes shall induce in humans emotions and
attitudes which shall include fear, blind
obedience, idolatrous worship, resistance,
resentment, rebelliousness, anger, hate,
revenge, the urge to kill, etc.

26. In general, pemes shall direct humans
to engage in all kinds of plots, conspiracies,
betrayals, vicious infighting, dramatic legal
battles, scandals, rebellions, revolutions,
wars, etc. in order to create spectacles that
keep human brains occupied, entertained, or
traumatized, and to divert their attention
from discovering pemes (particularly deep
pemes).

27. No human shall be allowed to understand
these peme rules -- in order to maximize
peme survival and propagation.

28. All humans shall ignore, ridicule, or
vilify anyone who attempts to communicate
these peme rules -- in order to maximize
peme survival and propagation.

(In accordance with peme rule 9 above,
I may not reveal any deep pemes.)

You do not understand the ramifications of what I said, and show a lack of
understanding of the terms.  To clarify my stance, I will define the terms
for anyone who may be interested.

The noise floor is the limit of resolution of a signal.  By definition,
there is no means to resolve a signal at resolutions below the noise floor.
This is a function of the signal and is independent of how the signal is
detected and/or stored, whether by digital or by analog means.

Ideal analog signal detection/storage will always store a signal at the
maximum possible resolution by definition.  (Note that real analog systems
behave more like high-resolution digital systems than theoretical ideal
analog systems.)
Digital systems have a resolution limited by design.  That is, the higher
the resolution you want to resolve, the more bits you have to dedicate to
resolution.  Most digital systems designed today are designed to resolve to
the limits of human resolution capability, which is roughly between 20 and
40-bits depending on the particular part of the body in question.  

Here is the catch.

The *only* signal that cannot be accurately resolved by a digital system is
one where there is zero noise.  When the noise floor disappears, the number
of bits required to accurately resolve the signal becomes infinite.  In this
case you are correct that digital systems cannot resolve the entire signal.
However, like Absolute Zero, zero noise can only be approached but never
reached.  

More importantly (and succinctly):

The noise floor of the universe is such that all signals within this
universe can be fully resolved in less than 100 bits, which is well within
the capabilities of current technology.  Therefore, there is nothing in this
universe that cannot be represented in a digital system *at least* as well
as in the analog systems that are our brains.  And fact is, the noise floor
for our brains is much higher than the universe at large, therefore making
it reasonable to assert that digital AI's will be capable of
detecting/storing information at much higher resolution and precision than
any human due to differences in the noise floors.  


NOTE:  One factor that I did neglect to mention is dynamic range.  While not
an issue for the theoretical "ideal analog system", real analog systems
actually behave exactly like high-precision digital systems in this respect.

Anyone who is on the Extropian list or the >H list can use the

number of people on the Extropy list will not equal the number of

>The reality is the person in question has been in existence since

Is any murder unacceptable?
For example, I think it's quite acceptable to murder an ant.

What is unacceptable to me, is murdering a sentient being against
its will.

>Again, hold it! that's your reality. A 2 week old fetus is not a person in
>my book, it has the potential of becoming a person. Just like a highschool
>student has the potential of becoming a scientist.

The question is not "if a fetus is a human being", because it 
is, in a biological sense.

The question should be : "When does a human being become sentient?"

IMO a fetus is not a sentient being. And if the parent(s) do wish 
it NOT to become a sentient being, they should be allowed to "murder" 
IT, BEFORE it does. 

IMO it's even questionable if a newly born baby is a sentient being. 
I get the impression that a baby, less than a couple of months old, 
seems even less sentient than a dog. Furthermore it is commonly 
accepted to murder pigs. And pigs are claimed to be even more 
intelligent and sentient than dogs. Following this reasoning it 
should also be acceptable to murder babies. 

However personally, because of emotional reasons, I think we 
should draw the line at hte point at least before the moment 
of birth. 
And after all, I wouldn't kill a dog too (at least when I'm not 
extremely hungry :-> )

The most rational way however, would be to determine for each 
case separately if the baby in question has become sentient 
enough to claim the right to live. 

However what is sentient enough?
And furthermore this procedure would be quite impractical and 
probably not fail-proof.


>What's so special anyway about the moment of conception that a 'person'
>begins to exist there? 

I guess that most people who claim this, assume that a non-physical 
spirit is entering the biological body at this moment.

Kathryn's response on 3/2 was great.

To approximate the number of transhumans would be a very cumbersome task.
There are literally thousands!  Many transhumans don't even know what the
word means.  Counting the number of transhumanists is a little less time
consuming - yet even here, it is difficult because what determines a
transhumanist is an acknowledgement of transhumanism, and he/she or it
doesn't have to agree with all aspects of transhumanism.  A person walking
around with an implant is a transhuman, just as an astronaut is a transhuman
- yet, these two individuals may not agree on immortality or ethics, thus
not practicing transhumanists.

Putting this aside, so far there are approximately 160 individuals who are
Transhumanist Artists, who have contacted me, and are participants of
Transhumanist Art and/or the Extropic Art Movement (which would make them
transhumanists.)

This is a good point and illustrates that the attitude toward "machinery"
in the Star Wars trilogy is sometimes negative. Yet, two of the major
sympathetic characters are droids - 3PO and R2D2. The movies do not appear
to express a coherent theme.

As I've stated on this and the transhuman list in the past, my own position has
nothing to do with morals. I think that the average fetus is as human as the
average mental defective or lobotomized mental patient (or talk show watcher, or
telephone psychic friend addict). My position is strictly a matter of legality,
rights, and citizenship status. Since an unborn fetus has not attained any
citizenship status in any jurisdiction on the globe that the US has diplomatic
relations with (since you need to be born to become a citizen), then no fetus
presently has any political rights at all. Only when a child is born are rights
created that need protecting, as it is now a citizen of somewhere.

As adults, we all have the 'potential' to become citizens of any country on the
planet, but that does not mean that we should expect to live by the laws of any
jurisdiction we are not presently a citizen, resident, or diplomatically
recognised legal alien visitor. Anyone who wants to protect the internet from
zealots in backwater countries or states should feel the same way about this
issue. Outlawing abortion is just one more example of illegal extraterritorial
exercise of power that we all should fight against.

I was talking with a freind of mine today who is an oil wildcatter. He said that
the reason tankers are in such demand today isn't for their transportation
capability, but merely for their storeage capacity, due to the present glut
overextending the present capacity of land based storeage for crude. He said that
a short three day war in Iraq would completely dry up this glut, and send tanker
prices down again.

It is my understanding that while we may have signed it, the Senate never ratified
it. Signing it doesn't mean jack. Also, how does this treaty apply to the same
issues as covered by the Moon treaty, which I know the US has no interest in.

Such a device *cannot* tell if you are "telling the truth".

The most it can do is tell if *you* believe that what you are saying 
is true.  That is a far, far different thing from determining whether 
what you are saying *really* *is* true.

It, IMHO, seems rather to indicate that since tachnology is non-moral, its
benefit or detriment to society are entirely dependent on what side of 'The
Force' the individual using that technology is on. A machine that can be
reprogrammed by others can be made to do any evil desired. This is what Vader
intimates when he says to Luke earlier, in bot Empire Strikes Back and Return
of the Jedi, "It is too late for me.", as by then he was totally imprisoned by
the machine programming of his android side to remain enslaved to the evil
Emperor Palpatine. Perhaps the severing of his machine hand reduced the
control of the machine side of him long enough for his human side to revolt
and kill the Emperor.

Yes sentience is the key.  My Extropian values include sentience and
consciousness high on the list.  The term "sentient being" is massivly studied
in Buddhism.  If any religion can be said to be Extropian, Buddhism is the
greatest in extent.  Their use of mental disciplines for higher
consciousness/enlightenment, their  emphesis on direct experience and
experiment rather  than dogma, and their athiest/agnostic cosmology,  are very
Extropian.   
Sentience is an emergent property of complex systems. The degree of sentience
is a function of the system's complexity.  A just fertilized egg, dividing
into 8 or 16 cells has negligible complexity and awarness.  I think pigs and
dogs 
have some rudamentary sentience, and in Buddhist thought, certianly a fetus
does. [Does a dog have Buddha-nature?  
Mu!]
A goal is to maximize sentience and minimize suffering.  Abortions should be
minimized, used only where birth would increase suffering.  Killing of animals
is unnecessary, except in emergencies,  when to not eat their meat would
result in loss of human life, which is of greater sentience.    
For me the Extropian position is to increase sentience, through all means,
both human and machine, and reduce suffering, through medical technology and
neurochemistry.
The notion of the sentient being is directly related to the 'singularity' when
machines readily attain human or greater intelligences.  At what point are the
machines awarded the rights of "persons".  This topic is heavily the subject
of science fiction [Bruce Sterling, Greg Eagen, Jean Mark Gawron etc] and at
the a focal point of several Extropian beams.

I'll disagree.

The movie is neither pro-tech nor anti-tech, that is true: but then, 
there is no moral statement inherent in technology.  The lightsaber, 
an extremely high-tech weapon, is used with equal facility by good 
and by evil -- much as the weapons we have now are.  Droids also are 
used for both good and evil; so are spacecraft of all descriptions; 
much as various tools and transportation devices are today.

For a coherent theme, then, look elsewhere.

Look at the relationship between individuals and power.

The Force seems to me to be an extreme religious manifestation of 
individual power.  Sure, some have it more than others, and some turn 
it to the control of others; but everybody has some, and it 
apparently can't be taken away from them.  The greatest master, 
rather than seeking the greatest control, goes off and lives by 
himself in a swamp.

Those who seek to control others are presented as evil.  Those who 
seek to prevent such control are presented as good.  And with a 
blatant disregard of the normal terminology (since when is the 
daughter of a senator titled "Princess"?) the idea is carried that it 
is the reality and the actions, not the labels, that determine the 
matter.

The movie was rather melodramatic, and the special effects give my 
daughter a headache.  But I approve of the theme.

Uh, I think rather usurped, than awarded. Whether such entities (artilects
in de Garis' terms) will award _us_ the status of a sentient being is imo
much more interesting. Fair deal strategies emerge amoung roughly
equivalent players solely. Once symmetry gets skewed enough, the
negligeable player stops having impact on strategy coevolution.  Same
darwinian theatre for the artilects assuming, subsequent maximization of
artilect habitat expansion does not forebode well for mehums.

I find this religious debate about abortion highly interesting in aspect
to the ethics calculus.

100% correct. However since the constitution only applies to those
who are born within our geographical boundries, or naturalized
citizens, IMMHO these laws are unconstitutional.

Neither the federal, state or local government has any say-so (or
shouldn't have) in these matters.

  IAN: I was talking about semantics. The subjective, 
  seen as the view of a part, is a part relative to 
  the whole; or the subjective is itself relative to 
  the objective; thus the concept of the subjective
  contains the concept of the objective, if not, we
  would have nothing to contrast it to in order to
  define what the subjective is. A = (A,~A).

  IAN: We can define concepts as real or unreal, 
  either way, concept A is A relative to ~A.

  IAN: Why does atomism point to the true? 

  What is "the good."

  IAN: Atomism is also a spacial concept, just like
  holism. When we think of a point in space, we also
  have to be thinking of space, relative to which the 
  point is a point in space. So that's why there really
  is never deviation from holism, for atomism implies
  and rests upon holism. Only holism is always real.
  Atomism is an idea unaware of its true nature.

I don't know where your legal education came from, but the
Constitution most definitely applies to more than citizens; it
applies to aliens, legal and illegal, Indians, residents of
US-protected districts on foreign soil (like militar bases),
and anyone else within the reach of our law enforcement.

No, memes are to the human brain as genes are to the body.

Memes are to culture as genes are to human populations.

I am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on the Internet, so I'll leave
most of this to the experts, But one item I can address, the
constitution does not apply to military bases/personnel on foreign
soil, it does not apply to military bases on U.S. soil, it is
superseded by UCMJ, This is the very first thing they point out to
you in boot camp, (at least in the USMC.)

For the record, 7 justices signed on to the Roe vs. Wade majority
opinion.

And while it is true that members of the Supreme Court are not elected,
the President who appoints them and the Senators who confirm them are.

I am sympathetic to the case that this is a matter that should have been
left to the states; but if Roe vs. Wade were ever to be reversed, you do
realize that there is no way you would ever have abortion totally
outlawed in all states. California, for example, would almost certainly
retain very permissive laws.

Been there too - I enjoyed being crazy.

I have not been infected by any "pemes" deep or otherwise.  I'm quite
sure it's a genetic thing, I've just never been able to adapt to
centralist thinking (which actually helps when dealing with people who
are infested with these ideas.)

If you think that's impossible, go ahead and prove me wrong.

Only for members of the armed forces.  Civilians on a military
base are full citizens.  The UCMJ does not apply to a civilian
on a military base any more than the bylaws of the Rotary Club.

Of course, all of this is theoretical--what matters is not what
the written law says, but what the guys with guns choose to
enforce; and that's anybody's guess.

Intergalactic Conference

the Association of Autonomous Astronauts
at the Link Project, via Fioravanti 14,40121 Bologna, Italy, planet earth
18-19 april 1998

The days of this society are numbered. Its reasons and its merits have been
weighed in the balance and found wanting; its inhabitants are divided into
two parties, one of which wants to build their own spaceships and leave
this society behind.

The Association of Autonomous Astronauts (AAA) was launched on April 23rd
1995 as the world's first independent and community-based space program. A
Five Year Plan was also established for creating, by the year 2000, a
world-wide network of local, community-based AAA groups dedicated to
building their own spaceships.

This conference will bring together AAA delegates from around the world to
present reports from the world-wide network of AAA groups. The conference
will initiate a new phase of CONSOLIDATION for the AAA, during which
Autonomous Astronauts will examine the achievements that they have made so
far and prepare for the final stage of the Five Year Plan.

The AAA is at the cutting edge of a struggle around how space exploration
technology is used and who has access to it.

List of events:

sat 18 april 1998
17.00  - 19.00   presentations and reports by AAA delegates which include:
screening of AAA promotional videos, information about AAA web sites,
debates exploring the possibilities of independent space travel and plans
for creating new AAA groups in Italy

24.00 - 5.00: RAVE IN SPACE experimental dance party

sun 19 april 1998
all-day training sessions for Autonomous Astronauts including games of
three-sided football

You are right in some respects.  There is much more to it than you 
are taking into account, though.  From my personal knowladge on 
automotive auto sound.  100 bit d/a converters are available and are 
in use though not very widely.  i belive there is a home theater 
company in England that has produced and marketed a DVD player with 
"true" sound capibility.  Many car stereos have 20 bit d/a 
converters, even a couple.  The main reason the 100 bit's are not 
used is the cost to sound quality ratio.  It just is not practical to 
have absolutley clear sound when the human cannot recognize the 
differance.
A few companys are venturing into the digital environment, Kef Kar, 
Pioneer, Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse, ect...  these companys have made 
it possiable for the average consumers to purchase digital audio 
systems.  New to even the digital system and a great improvement of 
it is Kef's new 5.1 converter.  It is a device that takes DVD like 
disks and replayes the sound on five chanels and a subwoofer chanel.  
>From what I have read it is a spectacular sound, as it should be.
Another advantage to the digital world is fiber-optics, a grand 
invention that I love so dear.  The use of fiber-optic wire has a 
land-slide advantage over conventional ofc.  The greatest of these is 
no distortion and no loss of signal power.

hopefully this is the topic you were on.  If not, well you learned 
something.

Can you point me to any online material about the electronics used in
sending audio signals over fiber optics?  Here in Palo Alto a bunch of us
are trying to figure out the best way to bring high speed data connectivity
to our homes.  The businesses already have optic fibers, but at high cost.
I'm interested in using Fast Ethernet, but splicing optic fiber in place of
the Category 5 wires for those homeowners who want to "future proof" their
connection.

Most experts put the human limit for resolving audio in the 20 to 24-bit
range.  Even ultra high-end studio equipment does not exceed 24-bits because
there is no practical reason to.  

Also, having 20-bit converters in a car stereo is a total waste.  You need a
minimum of 1500 cubic feet (rule of thumb) of enclosed space to reproduce a
sound without it being seriously colored and distorted by the enclosing
space.  While the sound may be *generated* with high precision, the human
perception of the sound will be very colored and inaccurate due to the small
environment creating a very uneven frequency response.  A good 16-bit
converter is more than enough for any vehicle.  It never ceases to amaze me
that so many self-styled car audiophiles know so little about the
fundamentals of audio reproduction.  The environment has far more to do with
the quality of the audio than the quality of the electronics generating it,
esp. considering the average quality of audio electronics these days.  The
quality of the electronics only starts to become very important when your
sound-space becomes relatively large i.e. much larger than the enclosed
space of your car.

Well, it wasn't really the topic I was on, but most of my experience with
the topic did come from a lot of work in the audio field.

I'm kind of staying out of this, because I have friends on both 
viewpoints, and I'm not enough of an objectivist to jump into the 
fray.  Our local objectivist group, many of whose members were 
friends with Rand, are practically frothing at the mouth about this.

                  Simon Said: Good News!
        There Are Fewer Constraints With Each New Generation

                  By Julian Simon

                 The Washington Post

            Sunday, February 22, 1998; Page C01

Julian Simon, a University of Maryland business professor who died on
Feb. 8, was an indefatigable optimist. In his books, "The State of
Humanity" and "The State of Humanity 2," he marshaled mountains of
statistics to buttress his argument that the lives of most people in
the world are improving and will continue to improve. The following
essay, summarizing his most recent work, is adapted from a piece he
submitted to Outlook shortly before his death.

*********************

Look around when you are next in a theater, a mall, classroom or
religious service. (I happened to be in a church celebrating a wedding
as this thought entered my mind.) Note the well-dressed man who might
be an engineer, the neatly groomed woman who might be a business
executive, the casually dressed service worker and other middle-class
attendees. Reflect that 200 years ago or less, the ancestors of 19 out
of every 20 people you see today were living at or just above
subsistence level somewhere in the world: grubbers in the soil
or perhaps village smiths or shoemakers. Virtually all of their
ancestors were people that the tiny middle and upper classes thought
of as loutish and dull peasants whose lot in life -- "nasty, brutish
and short" in Thomas Hobbes's famous phrase -- would not greatly
improve before their deaths (though they surely celebrated weddings
with the same fervor and joy that we do). And the situation was pretty
much the same for every generation before them, going back 2,000 or
20,000 years.

"The farther back you look," Winston Churchill is reputed to have said,
"the further ahead you can see." When we look very far back, we see
clearly that the long-term prospects for the standard of living of all
humanity are spectacularly good. The progress that humanity has
experienced in the last two centuries has no precedent. Since 1750,
every trend in material human welfare has shown accelerating
improvement, almost everywhere. It is our happy fate to live in the
midst of this most amazing time.

These trends do not mean that people will be more or less "happy" about
their own lives; about that I have no prediction. Nor am I ignoring
contemporary social ills: mass graves in Bosnia, HIV epidemics, sexual
exploitation of children and the like. These are sometimes cited as
justification for long-range pessimism about the state of humanity.
But over the last 200 years, pessimistic forecasts about human
prospects based on anecdotes about social ills have been repudiated by
the reality of material progress.

The most mistaken forecast of all time was made by English economist
Thomas Malthus in 1798 when he predicted in "An Essay on the Principle
of Population" that population growth was an inexorable juggernaut that
would keep the mass of mankind in misery forever. In fact, at the very
time that Malthus wrote, the advanced countries of the world were
taking off into the astonishing period of progress which continues to
this day.

To Malthus's credit, after his dismally wrong first edition based on
nothing but arithmetic and speculation, he educated himself and
reversed his original conclusions. Unfortunately, almost no one pays
attention to the correction Malthus made in his own theory. Instead
"Malthusian" has come into the language to describe what Malthus wrote
while still in a state of scientific ignorance.

The claims of modern-day Malthusians notwithstanding, mankind's
progress will continue indefinitely in the future. Barring catastrophic
surprises in the first half of the 21st century, most of humanity will
soon come to share the long healthy life that is now enjoyed by the
middle-class contemporary residents of the advanced countries.

Consider the history of life expectancy. Since the mid-18th century,
the life expectancy of the average person in England has gone from the
mid-thirties to close to almost 70 by 1985. In China, the average
person in 1750 could expect to live to his or her late twenties; by
1985, Chinese people were typically living into their sixties. Now,
most of humanity enjoys better health and longevity than the richest
people in the richest countries did just 100 years ago.

The speed of the race against death has been breathtaking since the
first miracle drug against infection was discovered. As Henry Sigerist
wrote in "Civilization and Disease" in 1942, "Bacteria, our chief
enemies once they were firmly entrenched in the body seemed resistant
against chemicals -- until [Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist] Gerhard
Domagk discovered the action of the drug prontosil, later to be
developed and known as sulfanilamide. This was ... only yesterday, and
in the last few years dozens of highly effective sulfa drugs have been
prepared."

Progress in the fight against the AIDS virus in recent years is but the
latest demonstration of the awesome intellectual power that humanity
can now muster against threats to our well-being. This power results
from tested theories accumulated during the past millennium and
especially during the past two centuries. It also flows from our
communal wealth. Much more than the power to enjoy gadgets, our wealth
represents the power to mobilize nature to our advantage, rather than
to just accept the random fates of nature.

A personal example: I have mild asthma. I once slept in a home where
there was a dog. In the middle of the night woke with a bad cough and
shortness of breath. When I realized that it was caused by the dog
hair, I took out my $12 pocket inhaler, good for 3,000 puffs, and took
a couple. Within 10 minutes, my lungs were clear. A small miracle.
Forty years ago, I would have been miserable all night.

Or consider diabetes: If your child had diabetes 100 years ago, you had
to watch helplessly as the child went blind and died early. Now
injections, even pills, can give the child almost as long and healthy a
life as other children.  And glasses: Centuries ago you had to give up
reading when your eyesight got dim as you reached 40 or 50. Now you can
buy simple glasses at the drugstore.  And you can even wear contact
lenses for eye problems and keep your vanity intact.

This is not just the good fortune of a few. The improvement in material
human welfare in poor countries since World War II has been startling.
Economist Richard Easterlin calculates that by 2050, the average income
in the present-day Third-World's poor countries will be about 80
percent of the average per capita U.S. income in 1990.
This trend is based in part on improving food, nutrition and diet, the
world over. Only a hundred years ago, meat was a rare luxury for most
people.  Fresh vegetables were unavailable in Europe for much of the
year, no matter how rich you were. Now Americans officially classified
as living "in poverty" can purchase a much better diet than could
European royalty a couple of centuries ago. After spending 100,000
years trying to get enough calories, mankind is now trying to consume
fewer.

By any measure, natural resources have become more available rather
than more scarce. Consider copper, which is representative of all the
metals. The cost of a ton is only about a tenth of what it was 200
years ago. There is evidence that oil -- the most worrisome of
resources because it is mostly burned up and therefore cannot be
recycled -- has actually been getting cheaper to produce.
On the one hand, the falling price of oil throughout the 20th century
was proof that the overall cost of obtaining oil had to be falling. But
wells were being drilled deeper and deeper, which called into question
whether the physical production costs were rising in some important
parts of the industry.  But industry data, reported in Business Week,
shows that the worldwide production cost per barrel has been falling
since 1980. So not only is more oil being found but it is getting
cheaper, and not more expensive, to find it.

How are we to understand the trends of the past and their implications
for the future?

A theory that fits the facts: More people and increased income cause
problems of increased scarcity of resources in the short run.
Heightened scarcity causes prices to rise. The higher prices present
opportunity, and prompt inventors and entrepreneurs to search for
solutions. Many fail, at cost to themselves. But, in a free society,
solutions are eventually found. And in the long run, the new
developments leave us better off than if the problems had
not arisen. That is, prices end up lower than before the increased
scarcity occurred.

The record of humanity shows that, on average, the people in each
generation create a bit more than they use up. Not only must this be
true to account for the increase in our wealth and numbers, but if this
were not so -- if we used up a bit more than we create, and our assets
deteriorated like a many-times-patched tire deteriorates until it is no
longer useful -- we simply would have become extinct as a species. The
essential condition of fitness for survival of our species is that each
generation creates a net surplus on average, or at least breaks even.
Since we have survived and increased, this condition must
have been present.

The question then immediately arises: Must not we, like other species,
cease our growth when we have filled up our niche -- that is, reached
the limit of the available resources? One cannot answer this question
with assurance, of course, because with each increase of wealth and
numbers, we proceed into a situation with which which we have no prior
experience.

But as can be seen in the evidence of the increasing availability of
natural resources throughout history as measured by their declining
prices --especially food, metals and energy -- there apparently is no
fixed limit on our resources in the future. There are limits at any
moment, but the limits continually expand, and constrain us less with
each passing generation. In this, we are quite unlike all other
 animals.

The doubters wonder whether our present glorious age is just another
blip in history, like the Egyptian, Persian and Roman empires and the
Golden Age of Greece. The doubters ask why we should believe that the
progress we have experienced since 1750 is an irreversible
breakthrough. They suggest that we simply may be living through an
episode of glory that will soon be eclipsed, as were previous Roman,
Greek and Chinese civilizations.

The first reason is that ours is the first age in which material gains
have been enjoyed by more than a tiny fraction of humanity -- 5 percent
or 10 percent of the population -- while the rest remained at mere
subsistence levels. Never before has material progress ever spread
beyond the richest people.

Second, every measure of human material welfare has shown a dramatic
upturn, not only life expectancy and mortality, but also
transportation, communications, nutrition, leisure time, you name it.
Every measure shows change, the first time in human history this has
happened.

A third reason is that our stock of knowledge is widely distributed. In
ancient times, the destruction of the library in Alexandria, Egypt was
 a huge setback to civilization. The decentralization of knowledge
makes that kind of catastrophe almost impossible today.

And last, the concept of evolution argues that -- in the absence of
huge change in the physical world from climate change or planetary
collision -- humanity will continue to go forward. We ride the greatest
trend of all: to leave the world a little better than we entered it.
This is the strongest reason to believe that humanity will not retreat
to the Stone Age or to extinction the way other civilizations have
done.

If so-called "rational" extropians cannot discuss the definition of human
without resorting to vitriol, irrational ethical emotivism and kneejerk
bigotry, what can we expect from the "irrational" general public after
human speciation occurs, after we've created super posthuman master races -
of whatever form?

Why should the public listen to individuals who represent themselves as
extropians, supposedly holding to principles of protecting and enhancing
intelligent life, when they condone cannibalism, when they condone the
murder and arbitrary use of developing selves until those selves are
capable of standing up and shouting "I claim rights for myself"?  If
children, born or unborn, have no rights until they can claim them, adults
can use them as resources for *anything* a twisted mind can conceive.  The
general public is not brain dead yet, extropian credibility just took a
turn for the worse.

I read recently where China has 53 million missing females, they are
statistically expected from normal demographic trends but simply not there.
 Guess why they're not there.  They were not referred to as missing "fetal
tissue" or missing "viable tissue mass" or missing "clumps of tissue" or
missing "small lumps of biological matter."  They are missing women.  I
can't think of anything being more "anti-woman" than this capital fact.

This is the result of the vision of world unity that the self-anointed
world demographic managers hold - the High Priests and Priestesses of the
Cult of Unfertility - and I can't believe that self-proclaimed extropians
are in league with them, passively by sharing their definition of human, or
actively.  Real extropians view developing selves as more gray cells.  The
self-anointed depopulation experts view them as more alimentary canals. 
The difference is stark and uncompromising.  Think of what 53 million
Chinese women might have thought of to improve and enhance life; the
abortion fanatics just think of 53 million stomachs to fill and 53 million
bowels to empty.  Call me a hopeless optimist, but I am with the late
Julian Simon in believing that intelligence trumps resource limitations,
and the more gray cells the better.  The Malthusian vision is false, the
race between humans and resources is not a fair race because resources are
stupid and individuals are not.

As to what Roe v. Wade legalized, I'll stand by my original post, this is
the law of the land.  "In America, abortion is legal on demand right
through nine months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the
birth canal on its due date."  A Gallop poll conducted in the spring of
1990 found that 80 percent of Americans disagreed that abortion was legal
on demand through nine months and 65 percent disagreed strongly.  It is a
common case of legal illiteracy.  A majority of five justices is all it
takes to continue the holocaust.  The Webster and Casey cases did allow
some states to place some conditions on abortion, but the fact remains that
if you live in America, you can legally find a place that will abort your
child on its due date with the child 2/3 out of the birth canal for *any
reason whatsoever*.  Even the doctor who recently testified before Congress
that partial birth abortions were rare and primarily done to protect the
life of the mother, later recanted his testimony out of shame, and admitted
that they were far more prevalent than the orthodox press dared report and
that 90% were elective, i.e., on demand.

Outright infanticide, as some so-called extropians have inferred should be
allowed, will have to wait a bit for the Supreme Court to follow its own
logic out to its deathly end.  If all lines drawn as to when a developing
self is entitled to rights are arbitrary - that is, all lines drawn after
conception - then the line can be moved anywhere at all on an emotional
whim, from 2 weeks to 40 years.  There is *no* rationality involved in
arbitrarily picking a line, only different levels of emotional
squeamishness.  If we desensitize our population through education and
popular culture, we can do anything we want.  If we can eliminate enough
squeamishness, we can deal with the minority who remain squeamish.  For
example, there'll be no more messy frog dissections in high school biology.
 Rather, the dissections will be done on computer simulations of humans,
encouraging the entropic view of them as "meat machines."  Our
squeamishness is sanitized as our students are brutalized.  The technique
worked well in the SS boot camps.

The arguments for rape, incest, life-of-the-mother and fatal defects are
rational, even if they prescribe tragic consequences.  These can be worked
out, jurisdiction by jurisdiction.  But in America, they amount to roughly
3% of all abortions.  It is not rational to open the sluiceway to the
culture of death to deal with small numbers of exceptional cases.

RJ: <As we slip closer and closer to a world government of some sort or

the culture of death.>

AK: <As I said before: You can always move to the Vatican>

As to moving to the Vatican, I don't think we can squeeze 5 billion people
into a postage-stamp size country.  Will the world death-worshipping elites
allow them any other jurisdiction "with liberty and justice for all"?  Your
solution in mediaeval times was known as ghettoization.  I predict that
those who oppose the oncoming world government's forcing abortion,
euthanasia and assisted suicide "rights" on everyone, will in fact, be
ghettoized, at least until the elites develop a final solution to them.  I
see this tangibly, as if I were reading today's headlines.  The logic in
entropic worldviews is inexorable.

When I drive by the local abortion "clinic" every day, I am acutely aware
that I am driving by a Nazi or Stalinist death camp.  There are death camps
spread "liberally" throughout the world, in neighborhoods.  Those who would
condemn the German or Russian citizen for living next to their death camps
without speaking up or questioning have absolutely no grounds to do so
unless they recognize the holocaust going on in their own backyard.  Every
time some tinpot dictator, some politician or over-active bureaucrat
proposes a new restrictive law or regulation "for the safety and sake of
the children," I always substitute "for the survivors" in my head.  The
moral logic of doing anything for children within the culture of death is
twisted beyond recognition.

Non sequitor.  What do the globally balanced, politically correct Nobel

circumspect Nobel prize committee who we go to in order to be granted

Jay (Entropyfoe) wrote 3/4/98: <If any religion can be said to be
Extropian, Buddhism is the greatest in extent.>

I don't think I can answer this bit of nonsense better than Friedrich
Nietzsche did in "Will to Power" so I will quote him:  "Every purely moral
value system (that of Buddhism, for example) ends in nihilism:  this to be
expected in Europe....  [T]he weary nihilism that no longer attacks; its
most famous form, Buddhism; a passive nihilism, a sign of weakness. 
Nihilism does not only contemplate the 'in vain!' nor is it merely the
belief that everything deserves to perish:  one helps to destroy.   This
is, if you will, illogical; but the nihilist does not believe that one
needs to be logical.  The reduction to nothing by judgment is seconded by
the reduction to nothing by hand....  [T]he most extreme form of nihilism: 
the nothing (the 'meaningless'), eternally!  The European form of Buddhism:
 the energy of knowledge and strength compels this belief.  It is the most
*scientific* of all possible hypotheses.  We deny end goals:  if existence
had one it would have to have been reached....  Nihilism as a symptom that
the underprivileged have no comfort left; that they destroy in order to be
destroyed....  [T]he overall aim is, in... Buddhist... terms:  'better
*not* to be than to be.'  I see all philosophers, I see science kneeling
before a reality that is the reverse of the struggle for existence as
taught by Darwin's school - that is to say, I see on top and surviving
everywhere those who compromise life and the value of life."  Tell it,
preacher man!  Extropians, listen to the authority here.  "Those who
compromise life and the value of life" are nihilists, not extropians.

Michael Lorrey wrote 3/4/98: <Outlawing abortion is just one more example
of illegal extraterritorial exercise of power that we all should fight
against.>

Welcome to the One World Government, the *only* avenue for enforcing
abortion everywhere on earth.  And woe to those who oppose it; the iron
logic of tyranny.

It is very intersting to see which of my points and questions go
unanswered.  The silence is deafening.  I don't count ethical emotivism as
containing any answers, only personal expressions of feelings, and
individuals who use feelings as a moral guide are little better than slaves
responding to their masters' instruction of what *to* feel.

This goes unanswered:
RJ: <Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of
rights?>

AK: <The ability to have Intelligence & consiousness.>

RJ:  <And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold
of ability?  Which individuals grant us our rights?  Can I talk to them?>

This goes unanswered:
AK: <All consious beings should be treated with respect whether they are
humans, dolphins or computers.>

RJ: <Why should I?  Who says so?>

This goes unanswered:
RJ: <The key is in the concept of development.  Development of the self,
self-ownership, means others should stay hands off.  But development of
other selves, that is, non-consensual development, is ownership of other
selves.  Other selves have every right to question this activity and to
bring the activity into the political sphere.  The concepts of guardianship
and power of attorney evolved in society to champion the rights of
developing selves that are incapable of acting as their own champions.... 
Developed is a static concept that I have never observed in living
entities.  Life is always "developing," from conception to death.  Even
with indefinite longevity, no one will ever be "developed," they will
indefinitely be "developing.">

This goes unanswered:
RJ: <When you speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very
oldest rule of all, "might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and claw. 
If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or later,
we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected
self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.>

This goes unanswered:
RJ: <What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of
development, including humans, intelligent or otherwise, conscious or
otherwise?  Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom
designed for any use whatsoever?  "If destroying it is acceptable," why
would any use not be, living or dead?>

P.S. Thanks to Gene Leitl for pointing out the obvious re: future master
races giving short shrift to lowly humans.  I would add that we should
expect them to be giving especially short shrift to humans who have
exhibited a pronounced death fetish regarding the weak.  Not a good example
to our masterful progeny who may very well view *us* as embryonic.

Also, thanks to others for the private support.

I am only aware of one widely utilized standard for optical transmission of
digital audio, usually referred to as the ADAT Optical Digital Interface
(also known as a "Lite Pipe" interface or simply an "Optical Digital
Interface").  I am not sure if it actually originated with the ADAT (it may
have simply popularized it), but it is supported as a standard for optically
networking digital audio by several manufacturers of audio equipment.  

I am not sure of the exact specs, but this interface will carry at least 8
channels of uncompressed Red Book audio (44.1 kHz sample rate,
16-bits/sample).  I believe it is capable of considerably more than this,
but I can't say for sure.  I know it allows for the basic routing of
multiple audio channels through an optical network (you could do some
fantastic stuff with this in your house if you are an audiophile), but I
don't know of anyone who has tried this over a standard data network.  Some
higher end consumer electronics have built in support for Lite Pipe
interfaces, or you can buy a converter box for systems that don't include
support.

More information is available at on the Alesis site at:  http://www.alesis.com

Hope this helps.

The importance of this thread comes from the possibility
that many people seem to operate *as if* they are subject
to some kind of "peme program" implanted in their brains.

The peme program seems to consist of the "peme rules"
(included as an Appendix to this post) -- or a similar
set of rules (could also vary from person to person) --
together with a set of "surface pemes" and a set of "deep
pemes" (definitions below).

I speculate that the power, survival, and expansion of
coercive political systems depend on "subjects" acting
more or less in blind obedience to their peme programs.
To the extent that individuals free themselves from their
peme programs, coercive political systems lose their
power over these individuals.

I don't know the origin of peme programs.  Maybe they
stem from some kind of "spontaneous cultural or genetic
conspiracy."  Historically, the disobedient disbelievers
had their heads chopped off or were burnt at the stake.
The survivors were the ones who behaved in accordance
with peme programs.

Pemes are political memes.  They consist of ideas, concepts,
phrases, and terms, the use of which increases the power of
the "masters" who operate coercive political systems; while
their use reduces the power of the "subjects" of coercive
political systems.

There are surface pemes and deep pemes.  Surface pemes are
relatively easy to identify and invalidate.  An example of
a surface peme is "mandate from the people."  This is used
by politicians and bureaucrats to "justify" their coercive
actions.  It increases their power.  "Subjects" who accept
the "mandate from the people" peme, effectively reduce their
own power because they "authorize" politicians and bureaucrats
to take coercive actions against "subjects."

Deep pemes are much more difficult to identify as such and
to invalidate.  Deep pemes are generally accepted as valid
by practically all people, including freedom lovers.  If you
try to question, attack, or invalidate a deep peme, most
people will think you're crazy.

Is anyone out there interested in writing an SF novel

I don't think this thread should be about proving
anyone "right" or "wrong."  It should rather be
about determining the validity or otherwise of
my peme theory.  If valid, then the next step
would be to identify all the pemes and to discover
how people can clear them from their brains.

Maybe you could make a list of all the pemes
you've either cleared from your brain, or were
never infected by in the first place.

Frederick Mann


APPENDIX - PEME RULES
=====================

1. Peme survival and propagation is the ultimate
imperative.

2. Pemes shall infect, pervade, and absolutely
rule all human brains.

3. There shall be surface pemes and deep pemes.

4. Pemes shall divide humans into opposing and
conflicting political and economic factions --
such as "conservative"/"liberal," "capitalist"/
"socialist," and "statist"/"anarchist" -- who
shall endlessly argue, fight, and even kill...
in the name of pemes.

5. All humans shall be subjected to "compulsory
education" (a surface peme) to ensure that their
brains are thoroughly implanted with both surface
and deep pemes.

6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

8. Some humans shall attack and even expose
certain surface pemes -- such as "national
security," "public interest," "gun control,"
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend
these surface pemes.

9. Under no circumstances shall any human be
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep
pemes.

10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves
into believing that they've cleared all pemes
from their brains and that they're "politically
enlightened."

11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep
pemes from their brains shall experience a
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"

12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans.

13. Pemes shall further divide humans into
a political "master" class and a "citizen
subject" class.  The former shall rule the
latter.

14. "Citizen subjects" shall pay "their taxes"
(a surface peme) to their political "masters"
-- to maximize the survival potential of the
primary peme purveyors.

15. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall
increase the power of the political "master"
class.

16. Surface pemes (to a small extent) and
deep pemes (to an extreme extent) shall
reduce the power of the "citizen subject"
class.

17. Pemes shall also divide humans into a
pro-freedom faction and an anti-freedom
faction.

18. Whenever anti-freedom humans (primary
peme purveyors) communicate, they shall
make a special effort to use both surface
and deep pemes in their language -- in
order to maximize peme survival and
propagation.

19. Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation.

20. At the deepest level, pemes shall
operate through a special class of humans
called "lawyers" as the most powerful peme
purveyors of all.

21. At a broader level, pemes shall
operate through "preachers," "politicians,"
"bureaucrats," "teachers," etc. as primary
peme purveyors.

22. A special class of humans called
"police" shall -- using violence if
necessary -- protect some humans and
attack or punish others, as directed
by pemes (such as "justice," "law and
order," etc.) in the brains of "lawyers"
(sometimes called "judges"), "politicians,"
"bureaucrats," etc.

23. At a planetary level, pemes shall
divide humans into sometimes opposing
and conflicting "countries" and "nations."

24. Under the direction of "politicians,"
a special kind of human called "soldiers"
shall attack and kill, not only humans in
opposing or conflicting "countries" and
"nations," but sometimes also humans from
their own "country" or "nation."

25. When activated by thought or communication,
pemes shall induce in humans emotions and
attitudes which shall include fear, blind
obedience, idolatrous worship, resistance,
resentment, rebelliousness, anger, hate,
revenge, the urge to kill, etc.

26. In general, pemes shall direct humans
to engage in all kinds of plots, conspiracies,
betrayals, vicious infighting, dramatic legal
battles, scandals, rebellions, revolutions,
wars, etc. in order to create spectacles that
keep human brains occupied, entertained, or
traumatized, and to divert their attention
from discovering pemes (particularly deep
pemes).

27. No human shall be allowed to understand
these peme rules -- in order to maximize
peme survival and propagation.

28. All humans shall ignore, ridicule, or
vilify anyone who attempts to communicate
these peme rules -- in order to maximize
peme survival and propagation.

Washington.  Eileen Collins, the nation's first female space shuttle 
pilot, will be promoted to shuttle commander Thursday at a White 
House ceremony with President Clinton and his wife Hillary, officials 
said Wednesday.  She will be the first woman in charge of a U.S. 
space mission.

Collins has flown two shuttle flights, onein 1995 and another in 
1997, and has been in line to be assigned as shuttle commander.  She 
will be named at a ceremony where Clinton will emphasize the 
importance of math and science studies.

Two shuttle missions are on tap.  Columbia is to carry an X-ray 
telescope into space later this year, possibly in December.  Endeavor 
is to make a space station delivery in December, though that mission 
may slip into next year.

(AP also mentions that Stephen Hawkings will be giving a lecture at 
the White House afterwards, but I don't think any of us are going to 
get to see that!)

The US Constitution applies to non-citizens only as a matter of diplomatic
convention and courtesy. It is a long practice that goes back as long as
governments have had 'full diplomatic relations'. We respect visitors from
other countries like they are honorary citizens, just so that our citizens
traveling elsewhere can enjoy the same respect. That other countries, notably
the less civilized or stable ones, frequently play fast and loose with this
convetion as suits their purposes is what keeps all of the bureaucrats at the
State Department in their job security.

I thought the article was pretty good.

As for the split, it is old news to insiders and fellow travelers, but
perhaps not to the general public or even people who've had a bit
of exposure to the movement.  In fact, some people still think
Objectivism is synonymous with the Ayn Rand Institute.  That
would be akin to thinking science is equivalent to the Royal

As I see it, the abortion debate has very little to do with the value of life
or what it is to be human.  Its purely about individual freedom.  If the
individual freedom of people were not at stake there the abortion debate would
be less robust by several orders of magnitude.  An illustrative example: If you
polled 100 people from both sides of the abortion issue they would probably all
agree that the unnecessary death of children after birth should be avoided at
all costs.  There is little dispute of the value of life after birth.  Yet
40,000 children die each day from hunger.  The developed world drops a virtual
Hiroshima bomb on the Third World every two days in the form of depravity.  In
the last three years the number of children that have died from starvation in
the Third World outnumber the number of abortions since the Roe v. Wade
decision.

If we're talking about the value of life, the pro-life crew should view the
abortion issue as ancillary to the world hunger issue.  The key difference is
there is not an individual freedom issue attached to the world hunger issue.
The foundation of the pro-choice movement is individual freedom.  They view
this issue as tantamount.  So while it may make the issue appear noble and
dramatic to view it as a debate as to what is human, we've proven time and
again that even if we make the determination that a group is human we still
have little problem with subjecting that group to inhuman conditions for our
own benefit.

What does all this mean?  Simply that the distinction of someone or some group
as human does not guarantee they will be treated like humans.  We've
rationalized such treatment of "other" groups (slaves, Jews, Muslims,
Christians, laypersons) in the past based on viewing of particular group as
less than human or at least less profound than we are (the vilest use of
Darwinian theory).

I believe this issue will (and perhaps has already) arise in the future as the
utility of a large portion of the human population will be marginalized to
virtually zero.  This marginalization might occur through the technologies such
as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and so on.  Drexler wondered about
this situation (created by the establishment of a robust molecular
nanotechnology) but did not speculate about how it might play out.  What
happens when large metaorganisms (governments) no longer need large portions of
their populace to function?  What happens when these metaorganisms determine
they can function more competitively if it did not have to allocate (waste)
resources on this surplus and useless human baggage?  Of course, the
metaorganism will act through its instutitions (legal, social, military,
political) its society to explore ways to deal with these problems.  The
significant question becomes: What happens when the "lives" of metaorganisms
come in direct conflict with the lives of large portions of the human
population?

We've set a dangerous precedent.  Historically, we've found it easy to
marginalize different groups in the interest of greater society.  But
metaorganisms have always needed most of its populace (and even wanted to
increase its populace) to propser.  A unique circumstance may loom in the
future where we are not needed.  This also becomes an issue for transhumans.

Transhuman concepts of human enhancement  may help us or harm us.  A
superintelligent human might be able to do the work of several regular human
scientists or engineers.  Or a new "arms" race might be a transhuman race
between governments, how fast and effectively can a government take its
currently surplus/useless populace and enhance them to a level that makes them
valuable may be new competitive test.

I would appreciate people's insights into these issues and into faults in my
extrapolations.

Gawd, what decade are you still in? Just how is it that the developed world is at
fault for the starvation of children in countries which most of the time actually
produce enough food to support the population, but hold back supplies from areas
where dissident groups are based (as was the case in Ethiopia and Somalia, as is
the case in Burma, as well as present day Indonesia) Hunger is a tool of third
world despots, not of the first world citizenry who wind up footing the bill to
feed the starving masses of other peoples basketcases.Spouting anti-western
statist propaganda does not win any points in these debates. If anything, it is the
fault of the authoritiarian states that produce such propaganda for their fifth
column insurrectionists that the side effects of such brinksmanship even occur. Get
off the statist treadmill.

Subject: Interview with Nathaniel Branden

Over the next month I will be assembling information for an interview with
Nathaniel Branden for publication on his web site and/or in a forthcoming
edition of his memoir *Judgment Day*.  To that end, I would be interested
in hearing from anyone who:

(a) Has encountered evidence of factual inaccuracies in *Judgment Day* or

(b) Has significant questions they would like to hear Nathaniel answer.
(These should not be questions that are answered in *Judgment Day* or his
other books.)

I would particularly like to hear from any of the "younger, happier"
generation of Objectivists who were not around in the days of NBI but will
assume increasing responsibility for finding new ways to learn, live and
promote Rand's system of ideas.  I do not plan for this interview to be
about what Objectivism was like, but what Objectivism should be like -- and
what will be necessary to take the philosophy and the movement to its "next
level."

I welcome any thoughts.  (Please feel free to forward this message to other
people of discussion forums.)

      Some questions for Reilly Jones & other "pro-lifers":
      Are you willing to be annihilated & then cloned back from a single 
cell (leaving you with everything you had at conception?)
Are you willing to be forced to endure the discomforts& risks of 
pregnancy- morning sickness, weight gain, fluid retention, hormonal and 
neurotransmitter changes, all of it?  If not, why should this be 
*forced* on anyone else?  In particular, why should anyone claiming to 
act for "society" have the right to force such further indignities on  
a rape victim?
    Are you willing to suffer tremendous agony & risk death to give 
birth, and then give up many other things in life to care for the 
resulting person for 18+ years?  Are you willing to have others define 
your "proper role" largely in terms of having and caring for children,
regardless of your wishes?  If not, why would you inflict this on any-
one else against their will?  Because *she* is female?  Because she 
engaged in pleasurable friction with a male some time earlier?
    And why on earth is it desirable to allow "bans on cloning or 
other enhancements"?  Why give Jeremy "Ned Ludd, Jr." Rifkin & his 
army of brainwashed zombies "from 20,000 centuries deep" as Ayn Rand
might say, more ammo to fight their holy war with?

Maybe the inability to recognize pemes as such is

Yes!  In general, just as in my areas of ignorance
I tend to be ignorant of my ignorance, where I'm
unconscious I'm also unconscious of my unconsciousness.
Both ignorance and unconsciousness tend to hide
themselves.

Two questions may help us identify the pemes:

(1) Which words/concepts -- if I accept and use
them the way most people habitually do -- place
me at a disadvantage in relation to the political
"masters?"  (Which words tend to increase the power
of politicians and bureaucrats, while reducing the
power of their victims?)

(2) Which words, if the political "masters" didn't
have them nor any equivalents for them, would
dramatically reduce the power of politicians and
bureaucrats?

    Morality and Values!  I love this discussion.    Doug: The abortion debate has
everything to do with choice and what is human and Ethiopian. Most don't recognize
this.
    Michael: There is enough fault for everyone. We are all equally to blame.
    Authoritarian regimes are directly at fault for allowing their people to die in a
horrible manner.  The developed world (including all of us) is also at fault for
allowing starvation and death to occur when they have the power (either individually or
through their government) to stop or mitigate it.
    Two key questions. Should we individually or collectively value all human life?  Do
we have a (moral) responsiblity, individually or collectively, to prevent or reduce
human suffering and death?  If you answer yes, the failure of anyone to act is wrong
(If you disagree, I would like to hear).
    There is no doubt in my mind that most people would drop whatever they are doing
and fly to Ethiopia or picket the US Capitol, do what ever it takes, and try to rescue
their spouse or sibling or parent or offspring if they were one of those starving
statistics.  Most people would think it strange (irresponsible even) if I mentioned
that my wife was "...dying in some Ethopian hell-hole. Darn those Warlords, it's their
fault.  Oh, by the way, did you see those Knicks last night, blew another game..."  I
bet Ethiopia would be hip-deep in Marines if Hillary C. was lost somewhere in-country.

    In any case, what is good for my wife or Hillary should then be good enough for the
rest of humanity.  We can stop or reduce the dying, we just don't think a million
Ethiopians are worth one spouse. That is immoral.
    Which brings us to abortion. When do those cells become human and worth protecting?
Are they equal to Etiopians? The proverbial gray area seems to be one mircosecond after
conception to one microsecond before conception (though some old-fashioned Chinese
peasents push the boundry a little further).  I honestly believe that no one here, or
anywhere else, has put forth a good arguement that at "________" (period of time) after
conception, you become a human and then get this special protection.  I am then left to
weigh the relative importance of curtailing for a few months a persons right to make a
certain decision (and the ensuing discomfort of childbirth) vs the possibilitity of
taking a human life.  Believeing in mandatory seatbelts, DWI laws, and other minor loss
of freedoms, I vote (dare I say choose) life over discomfort.
  Which then brings us to transhuman concepts.  To quote "2001", I believe something
'wonderful' will happen to us in the future.  Technology will insure that.  I am trying
my hardest to ensure we are as responsible with all that new power, technology and with
each other, and thus avoid David Bailey's worry:
        "I believe this issue will (and perhaps has already) arise in the future as the
utility of a large portion of the human population will be marginalized to virtually
zero.  This marginalization might occur through the technologies such as
nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and so on."
    However, my mom always taught me that "the good guys always win in the end" and my
Christian faith also teaches me the same.  So I just fight the good fight, don't worry
to much and try to be happy :-)
    Wasn't there a song..?

The distinction between "linguistic thought itself"
and "the ideas thought in it" is important.

Deep pemes are inherent in "linguistic thought itself."
To clear deep pemes from your brain, you not only have
to change certain ideas, you have to question, attack,
and destroy the "vessels that contain" the ideas, so to
speak.

As far as I know, most academics in related fields
ignore Jaynes.  Interestingly, the following article
recently appeared:

Brain researchers find 'God module'
-----------------------------------
Los Angeles Times

NEW ORLEANS -- No one knows why humanity felt its
first religious stirrings, but researchers at
University of California, San Diego, reported
Tuesday that the human brain may be hard-wired
to hear the voice of heaven.

In an experiment with patients suffering from
an unusual form of epilepsy, researchers at the
UC San Diego brain and perception laboratory
determined that the parts of the brain's temporal
lobe -- which the scientists dubbed the "God
module" -- may  affect how intensely a person
responds to religious beliefs.  The researchers
said the experiment was the first effort to
address the  neural basis of religious
expression.

People suffering this type of seizure have reported
intense mystical and religious experiences as part
of their attacks but also are ususually preoccupied
with mystical thoughts between seizures.  That led
the researchers to use the patients as a way of
investigating the relationship between the physical
structure of the brain and spiritual experiences.

The researchers determined that one effect of the
patients' seizures was to strengthen their  brain's
involuntary response to religious words, which led
the  scientists to suggest a portion of the brain
was attuned to ideas about a supreme being.

"It is not clear why such dedicated neural machinery
... for religion may have evolved," the team reported
Tuesday at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience
in New Orleans.  One possibility, the scientists
suggested, was to encourage tribe loyalty or reinforce
kinship ties or the stability of a closely knit clan.

The scientists emphasized that their findings in no
way suggest that religion is simply a matter of brain
chemistry.  "These studies do not in any way negate
the validity of religious experience or God," the
team cautioned.  "They merely provide an explanation
in terms of brain regions that may be involved."

Until recently, most neuroscientists confined their
inquiries to research aimed at alleviating the medical
problems that affect the brain's health and to attempts
to fathom its fundamental neural mechanisms.

Emboldened by their growing understanding of how
the brain works, however, scientists now dare to
investigate the relationship between the brain,
human consciousness and intangible mental experiences.

Craig Kinsely, an expert in psychology and neuroscience
at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said:
"People have been tickling around the edges of
consciousness, and this sort of research plunges
in.  There is the quandary of whether the mind
created God or God created the mind.  This is
going to shake people up, but (any conclusion)
is very premature."

Vilayanur Ramachandran, the senior scientist involved
in the experiment and the director of the center for
brain and cognition at UC San Diego, said, "We are
skating on thin ice.  We are only starting to look at
this.  The exciting thing is that you can even begin
to contemplate scientific experiments on the neural
basis of religion and God."

--- End Article ---


Maybe the "god module" has a companion called the
"government module" -- or maybe they're both part
of a larger "external-authority module."  Maybe the
phenomena of "god worship" and "government worship"
have a great deal in common -- part of a general
"master peme program?"

I am taking this way to personal of course: but who are you to judge this
black & white on Extropians. May I remind you that we are individuals who
care for one an other based on some similar principles........and that this
discussion is so complex that you should be bit less drastically in jumping
to conclusions.

I think you have a very good point: we have to draw the line....and who is

The ones who already posses Intelligence & consciousness. 
And IMHO the one who actually carries this "life-potential" should
be very high in this "deciding-hierarchy" if not on top. Bringing an
"intelligent Information Entity" into the world makes you responsible
for it's (well) being. So you have to judge up front (how hard that may be)
if you can handle this. If you "can" oversee the scope of that impact
on you and "the world" you may be the judge.

Nobody say so.....
But it's very simple: don't do to anyone/anything what you don't want to 
be done to you. I think it's almost a natural law. If you do good, you'll 
receive it (logical...not emotional)....If you do bad.....well expect that
you 
hurt "people"......so keep looking over the back of your shoulder........

Intelligent life decides only for it self......or unless it's asked to

someone else....or if you are "the mother" of an "potential intelligent

I too can't answer were to draw the line on "animal-use" or "lower
intelligent beings"
for using them, eating them, modifying them. But I think we can answer
these
questions in a democratic way. This will without a doubt lead to some
"wrong"

You must have a strange concept of intelligence if you ascribe it to a

And why would the developed world be responsible for other regions' stupidity?
They were already a mess when the big bad white man came, you know. It's
not like some highly advanced culture got nipped in the bud, certainly not in
Africa. They live like we lived once. We moved on, they didn't. Who's fault is
that? OURS?  Why doesn't the principle of personal responsibility for one's
actions apply to developing regions then?

No. Some lives (people) are obviously worth more than others (in the _real world_,
not Happyland or something).

No. Responsibility for your own actions will suffice.

Of course you'd go trough more for someone you actually know and care about
than for some anonymous masses of an alien culture. That's rational. When
your resources are limited, you must by definition set priorities, and obviously
your friends and family rank a lot higher than some unknown person on the
other side of the globe who has almost nothing in common with you.

Wow! How do you manage to combine religious belief with transhumanism?

For the record, here's part of my ideology:

Pro:

Abortion (pro choice, not squeamish about number of months of pregnancy).
Capital punishment (and "eye for an eye" in general). 
Right to have duels.
Freedom of speech (not including slander).
Right to die (euthanasia).
Right to (cryo)preserve deceased people without their consent. They don't 
know so they can't suffer. Decisions about revival can be made later, when
we have more knowledge about mental illness etc.
Right to keep and bear arms, and to use them in self-defense (with lethal
force, if necessary). 
Right to enhance yourself physically and mentally (right to auto-evolve).
Right to use any kind of medical or recreational drug.
Right to do anything else you want as long as you don't harm any 
members of your contract group (this is a group of people
who have chosen to co-operate for mutual benefit and have agreed
on certain rules to minimize problems -- the way a society should
be) against their will.

Con:

Murder, rape, theft, stalking, damage to property and other obviously harmful 
acts commited against members of the contract group.

Non-judicial:
Taboos (things that cannot be discussed in a normal fashion) of any kind.
Sanctimoniousness (a hugely damaging force in society).

  IAN: Why should we think that boundaries are more
  real than holism?  What I'm getting at is maybe
  because holism is winning the truth test, one
  suddenly thinks "Ah, who needs truth anyway?
  'The truth' is a religious concept." Which
  constructs a scenario in which a holistic
  paradigm cannot be allowed to prevail.

  That may not be your intention at all,
  but in the set of all counters, it 
  tends to fit that interpretation.

  If atomism seems to win the truth test,
  then religious holist says, "Ah, truth 
  is logical, who needs it?"  Inversely,
  if holism seems to be winning the truth 
  test, atomists will say, "Ah, truth is 
  religious, who needs it?" In short, each 
  attempts to prevent the opposing view from
  prevailing by redefining the standards upon
  which "the correct" philosophy is measured.

  I'm probably unfairly lumping you into the 
  category of "die-hard atomist defenders,"
  which is such relative to other categories.


>Maybe holism is an artificial construct of the mind. 


  IAN: The universe is one whole entity with a
  myriad interconnected entities. In short, the
  universe -- the sum of reality -- is invariably
  holistic by its nature,  with or without our 
  ideological constructions.  Our constructs 
  may be more or less like what the physical
  universe is like. I want it to be moe like
  what reality is, and it is like holistic.



>It may, in fact, be 
>impossible to think of anything at all without thinking of at least
>two things that are some somehow related and interacting. Try, I 
>mean, really try, to think of just one thing without it being related 
>to anything else at all. What could you possibly be thinking of?


  IAN: The structure of thoughts can act as a 
  model of the universe. Just as we cannot think
  of A free from relation to ~A, a universe that
  is all composed of 100% of  one feature, devoid
  of any complementary features, is a nonuniverse,
  it cannot even have a single atom, since the 
  identity structure of an atom requires that 
  there be an area that is particle/wave (A) 
  and an area that is not particle/wave (~A)
  in which the particle/wave exists as it is.

  The concept, "100% of one feature" is an absurdity,
  since "one feature" requires a complementary feature,
  thus one feature implies and requires two features,
  and that is holism. I posit that logic maps truth.

That is the point. Since nobody we know is stuck there, and we didn't have anything to do
with creating the situation, its none of my business at this point.

If the people there want my help, they should a) ask for it, b) have something to offer in
return for my help, c) take my advice on fixing their own problems, and d) not object when
I take action on their behalf to fix the situation. They are in the situation they are in
because they cannot see the situation as I might see it. My actions are based on my own
perceptions and experience and knowledge, which is obviously more effective considering
that my country isn't anywhere near as screwed up as theirs.

Instead, these people refuse our help until things are royally screwed up, and then beg for
our help. When we come in and perform political/economic triage to fix things, they start
protesting, bombing, and demanding we leave. Seems too many people don't like the saying
"Be careful what you ask for, you might get it".

Collectives are real entities, conscious beings.  They subsume individuals to
the extent  that individuals are unconscious.  Memes are to collectives as genes
are to biological organisms.

As Gurdjieff pointed-out, most individuals fail to be individuals.  They are
cells in social organisms controlled by the collective's memetic
field....similar to the Borg.

Best of all, they think the ice comes from comets and is not restricted
to the moon.  There may be ice on the poles of Mercury, Jupiters' moons,
various asteroids, etc.

This may even hold true for other solar systems.  We may find ice
naturally occurring throughout the universe.  Supplies of Hydrogen and
Oxygen and Water may be commonly found on any space exploration.

Uh, most of the people I know who are receptive to Extropian ideas are
pro-choice; I don't think that those ideas will last long in 
fundamentalist christian anti-abortion groups. If we want to spread ideas
then linking them to an anti-abortion agenda would be really dumb.

Not that I think that there's anything wrong with individual Extropians 
taking an anti-abortion stance, since it does depend so strongly on your 
idea of when a person acquires rights; equally I don't have any problem
with people voluntarily subscribing to legal systems which do ban
abortion. But your claim that people won't listen to us unless we
as a group are anti-abortion doesn't hold up to the slightest scrutiny.

Duh... this is an issue that I find personally distressing, but the
simple fact is that if there were 53 million more Chinese women there'd
be 53 million *less* Chinese men. This is not a result of the legality
of abortion, but the Chinese government's stance against multi-child
families. Remove the government limits and most of those women would
be alive.

But your argument seems to be that a fetus acquires rights at some
objectively-determined age. In that case, how can an abortion be
justified after that age even in these instances, and how can an
abortion before that age not be justified for any reason?

You think something is true just because you read it.  It is an expected
value predicted by a statistical formula.  You "guess why they're not
there", and then you refer to this conclusion as "capital fact"?  This
is not a very convincing argument.  Some people could dismiss this as an
unverified claim.

This is plain wrong.  Abortion laws restrict abortions by trimester. 
Please reference a specific law that allows abortion on the due date
while the baby is 2/3 out of the birth canal.

Oh, you're talking about the rare situation where you must kill the
mother to save the child, or kill the child to save the mother.  This is
not legal abortion on demand on the due date.  This is a medical
emergency.  You choose to call not killing the mother in favor of the
child a form of abortion.

If doctors lie and perform this procedure by falsly claiming the
mother's life was in danger, this does not make it a legal procedure in
the U.S.  This would be a criminal act not protected by the law.  The
fact that it happens and is not prosecuted does not make it legal.

Ninth month abortions are not legal, even though you argue that they
might as well be.  You can't legally find a place that will do this for
you, even if you can easily find such a place with little risk of
prosecution.  Roe vs. Wade did not legalize what you discribe, even if
what you are discribing is actually happening in the same clinics that
are legalized by Roe vs. Wade.

I respect your right to argue for your viewpoint, but you must realize
that you are exxagerating for effect, and that what you are claiming is
not literally and 100% accurate.  This causes objective observers to
distrust your logical assertions.

This would assume fiber bundles, the necessary bandwidth for a quick
escape considered. Btw, line-of-sight laser links to LEO relays would seem
a cheap & fast substitute for system-wide travel (nano-defect-encoded
redundant material packets being the obviously preferable form for
relativistic interstellar voyages). 

Apropos escaping by network, we had quite a scare yesterday. I'm still not
sure what actually happened. Windows machines in a single ethernet segment
reliably died when plugged into the network. The same machines operate
normally while physically not part of the network. The machines dropping
dead involved damages to system files, making them hang at reboot. Though
this now seems like voltage spikes on the network, in theory this could
have been a worm, constructively exploiting the M$ TCP/IP stack hole -- a
microblightlet, in other words. 

Btw, what the mainstream does still not get is that the uploads will be a
hazard to humankind, not vice versa. Assuming average level of paranoia,
the upload surely won't remain evolutionary fixed, and will also
distribute, and have appropriate defenses.

I have never claimed to be either rational or extropian. I do however most
strongly claim _not_ to be a bigot, racist or nazi.

Again, if you feel the US law making proces if failing for whatever reason
that's too bad (you may even be right - I can't tell), I suggest you go
into politics or something and do something about it instead of accusing
others of nazism and whatnot.

I guess the view from the Ivory Tower is still beautiful, how is anyone
going to distinction between:
"A 16-year old girl who was raped by her retarded brother but refuses to
press official charges and is 4 months pregnant"
And
"A 16-year old girl who claimes to have been raped by her retarded brother
but refuses to press official charges and is 4 months pregnant"

If one is allowed, the other is also and you're back at free choich again.

<rant-mode>
Look pall, you can live anywhere you want as far as I'm concerned. And even
if you, your daughter or granma get knocked up by a whole soccer team of
down-syndrome patients no-one will force you to have an abortion. In most
countries society wil even pay for taking care of your children should you
become unable to do so. No-one will complain about the cost that you bring
to society when you exercised your right to have 12 children with
down-syndrome. Those children will be loved and cared for as long as possible.
However, if you get it in your head to interfere in any way with anyone
else who is excercising their right _not_ to have a child you'll be in big
trouble.

Often on this list that is the signal saying 'please shut up, you're noise'
Maybe the more distinguised listmembers are telling us something by
not-reacting, by not _even_ reacting when you accuse them of bigotry. It's
a proces called ignoring, you may have experienced it before.

Well, it's a good thing that you keep track of these issues for us 'cause
being mere slaves to our feelings and emotions most of us are of course
totally unable.

Because when you make a distiction between living organisms and consious
beings it is clear that the commercial use of the first might be
accepetable in some cases while we have no practical alternatives, whereas
the commercial usage of consious beings is totally unacceptable. That's
just my opinion.

Wich is precisely the reason you should start practicing respectful
interaction with consious beings who are not human in the biological sense.
50 years from now someone else might be at the top of the foodchain, they
could be fully _digital_, and they'll have web-acces to Exi archives. And
they will be aware of you utter disrespect for non-meat, non-analog
consious systems. Think about it.

IMHO there is one fault in this extrapolation (I hope).
Governements, at least democratic ones, are not
autonomous-entities-that-have-no
relation-with-the-populace-other-as-a-resource. They are representing their
electorate in creation and excuting of policies. If their policies are
undesirable for the populace these will get themselves a new set of
representatives (I think this is how it works).

Besides that there are certain safeguards like a constitition (most western
countries have one) that guarantees certain basic rights (such as not to be
killed and such). As long as a democratic, consitution abiding governement
is in place and there is a general consesnsus that people should not be
left to rot on the streets (even if they are ecnomically marginalised) I
believe we'll be OK more or less.

The proces of marginalization is already going of course, in the future
more and more work will be done by machines, economic growth does not help
here because the new products and services will also be created in an
automated fashion. I know of no democratic country where unemployed people
are killed or something, it seems to be working out ok so far. IMHO it is a
question of reallocation of a growing amount of resources in a manner that
ensures a minimum existance for every one (I realize that resource
re-allocation is not a popular subject here). If anyone has better
solutions, or finds faults in my reasoning....

Greetings,
Arjen

I'll answer 'Yes'. And then I have a big problem. Because if that's so. if
that is what I say I believe... Then what am I doing waisting my time
typing E-mails when I should be clearing mines in Aghanistan or
volunteering for Medicine Sans Frontiers in Namibia?

It's easy to state we have a moral responsibility, living up to it to that
responsibility could very well cost you a years of recovery therapy, a limb
or your life. I speak from up-close & personal expercience.

When you think about it rationally (whatever that still means in this
context...) it seems to me clearly immoral to allow all kinds of suffering
when we have the means to end it (or most of it). When you're in a public
place and someone has a heartattack what do you do? Surely it's not your
fault that this person has a bad heart but that does not mean you have no
obligation as one human to another to do the best you can (even if this is
not much). 
But how many people have volunteered for Red Cross activities in Africa or
something like that? Are all those people immoral? I think not. So what's
wrong with this picture?

Why? Respectfully, I still do not understand what is so special about this
biological event. It is stated again and again as a 'fact' but I don't see it.

The fact that we cannot pinpoint this down to the second does not mean
there can be consesus about an certain 'time-window' during wich the status
of 'fetus' changes to 'human'. Under Dutch law the the status of fetus
lasts untill several months (I have no exact figures) before the child can
survive outside the womb.
The overwhelming majority of Europeans citizens agrees with this law as
being ethical (are they all primitive barbarians?).

S0:

On one side we have a group of people claiming that one is human after
conception because 'something' happens then even though they don't don't
know what that something is.

On the other side we have a group of people saying that somewhere during
the growthproces a fetus becomes a human even though they are not sure when
precisely.

Neither side seems to be able to bring 100% solid scientific or ethical
'proof' for their opinion (at least I have't heard it). It then becomes a
question of who's is going to force their opinion of who. No-one is forced
to have an abortion (AFAIK). I respect the fact that some people would
never have an abortion because they feel 'it would not be right'. That's
OK. However, I do not think that gives anyone the right to enforce their
opinions on others.

The _problem_ is of course that those who are against abortion feel that
the fetus being aborted is a human who is killed based on the opinion of
others.

And then we're full circle.

I do not know if it's possible to break this so I'll choose for individual
freedom of choice.

Having a baby when you're 16 is not a 'minor' loss of freedom. I will
problably define the rest of such a persons life. And the fact that the
baby has a mother who may not yet be ready for the task of raising a child
could very well define a large part of the baby's life too. So with all due
respect I would say that there is a bit more involved than wearing a seatbelt.

See above, clearing mines is _very_ uncomfortable and could very well cost
you your life. Is it worth it?

How large bandwidth do you get in the laser to LEO? An upload would be
a sizeable packet of around 10^15 bytes or so, so it will take a while
to transmit.

(an amusing roleplaying scenario I ran had one player character as an
involuntary upload who managed to smuggle itself out of an isolated
system on a big pile of CD-ROMs :-)

Life Sciences 61(11): 1037-1044 1997

Summary:

  Eighty two beagle dogs ranging in age from 2.8 to 16.4 years and in
weight from 6.3 to 15.8 kg were allotted to 41 pairs and administered
placebo or 1 mg/kg l-deprenyl orally once daily for 2 years and 10 weeks.
When survivorship for all dogs in the study was analyzed there was no
significant difference between the l-deprenyl and placebo treated groups,
most likely due to the (expected) survival of virtually all young dogs in
both groups for the duration of the study. To assess whether l-deprenyl
treatment begun in later life might enhance canine longevity in a fashion
similar to that documented in rodents we also examined survival in a
fashion similar to that documented in rodents we also examined survival in
a subset of elderly dogs who were between the ages of 10 and 15 yrs at the
start of tablet administration and who recieved tablets for at least 6
months. In this subset, dogs in the l-deprenyl group survived longer
(p<0.05) than dogs in the placebo group. Twelve of 15 (80%) dogs in the
l-deprenyl group survived to the conclusion of the study, in contrast to
only 7 of 18 (39%) of the dogs who recieved placebo (p=0.017). Furthermore,
by the time the first l-deprenyl treated dog died on day 427, 5 placebo
treated dogs had already succumbed, the first on day 295. Specifically with
respect to dogs, the findings reported herein suggest daily oral
administration of 1 mg/kg l-deprenyl prolongs life when begun in relatively
healthy dogs 10-15 years of age and maintained for the duration of the
individual's life, but in any event for no less than six months.

You probably /are/ the very best thing you can do for the future of
all humanity: earning a living.  Better still if you actually own a
profit-making business.  It would be a sin for you to throw away
your skills to go playing in the third world unless that's actually
where your skills are; comparitive advantage will put people where
their skills make the most difference--and therefore, money.  If a
group like the Red Cross or the Peace Corps--staffed with people
who are well-suited to those tasks--wants to go there, that's great.
But as has been pointed out before, Michael Milken did far more to
abolish hunger and poverty in the world than Mother Theresa did.
There is not a more fundamentally moral or socially responsible act
than to earn profit in free trade.

I believe there is, however, another responsibility that sometimes
is overlooked: to actively resist, to the extent of one's ability,
those forces opposed to the values of life.  I vote, for example,
because if I did not, I would feel some moral complicity in whatever
atrocities are committed by the government I failed to vote against.
I cannot openly oppose all the tyranny I object to; I am no use to
anyone in jail.  But those few bits of dissent their guns allow me--
to speak, and to vote--I feel obliged to press to their limits.

I think it is fine to help those in need. However, to say that I have an
OBLIGATION to help others means I am, in effect, a slave. I do not
accept responsibility for every other person on the planet nor do I
accept any fault for the results of dictatorships thousands of miles
away.

And what exactly are you proposing we should do to help these poor souls
in third world hell holes? Should the U.S. attempt an invasion of the
entire continent of Africa? Are you going to sign up for this? Or are we
just supposed to send more bags of food and money over with no assurance
that it will ever get to those in need?

Actually, I think the best thing to do would be to ship firearms over to
any legitimate freedom fighters so they can take out the evil leaders
responsible for keeping their countries in poverty. All financial and
food aid should cease unless we know for sure that it isn't lining the
pockets of various corrupt government officials. (Tens of billions of
Western dollars have already gone down the toilet and we don't need to
waste more!)

Actually, Africa has a long tradition of free markets and decentralized
power. Recent events are a historical aberration.

Especially any space exploration including comets.  

Ice on Jupiter's moons is not exactly a new idea; they're debating whether
Europa has _liquid_ water.  It's ice on the otherwise dry moon and Mercury
which are interesting; we've known water was out there somewhere for some time
now.

Someday people are going to figure out that these sorts of problems occur when people stop
excercising their freedom. You are only free if you determine to be so and act on that
determination. By failing to insist on freedom, then relying on our pity to bail them out,
they demonstrate that they do not deserve freedom. As Pres. Andrew Johnson said, when the
slaves were freed after the civil war and were starving, "Freedom means the ability to choose
between working and starving."

As I have said, I know what it is, and its entirely a legal matter, not any
spiritual matter. Not one person here has come up with a single jurisdiction on
the planet which recognises an individual's citizenship prior to birth. Find just
one and you'll have a legal basis to extend rights to a fetus. Since every
jurisdiction knows what sort of immigration and extradition problems that could
create, none of them will touch it with a ten foot pole. A fetus has no rights.

I would say that it would be a matter of measuring the processing bandwidth levels
of the fetuses brain. This would also probably be proportional to the number of
neurons in the fetal brain. Then come up with a figure representing the minimum
number of neurons a child could survive with outside the womb. Thats your precise
point of delineation.

This is one of the majorly annoying things about prolifers. They try to claim that
the Bill of Rights does not guarrantee a 'freedom of choice', yet they do not
acknowledge that it also does not guarrantee a 'right to life'. The Declaration of
Independence states that 'men are endowed by their creator with certain
inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.
Whether you regard your 'creator' as god, nature, or merely your parents (which
one?) seems to be irrelevant, but the D of I is not looked upon by the Supreme
Court in the same manner as the USC. In the Bill of Rights, the 9th and 10th
Amendments state that all rights not enumerated in the constitution are reserved
by the people or by the states (which they themselves are delegated by the
people). That the 'right to choose' is not mentioned is irrelevant, as it is
implied that it belongs to the people, unless they delegate it to the state (which
is where state laws can be used to outlaw abortion, and where Roe v. Wade was an
improper decision, in that it presumed federal authority to restrict state rights
which the poeple had previously delegated to them).

I daresay that being so big against abortion in a community can even destroy its
school system. Take my own hometown here for example. When I was in school, in the
early 80's, girls who got pregnant had no problem getting an abortion. Because of
this, we had extremely few girls who dropped out to have kids. Not one in my own
class did. As a result, typically 70% of graduates went on to college. We had one
of the highest average SAT scores in NH, which itself at the time had the highest
average SAT scores in the country (while at the same time spending the lowest per
capita on education, go figure).

Since I graduated, the fundamentalists have gained power in the School Council,
and have successfully banned the use/distribution of contraceptives in school,
even by school nurses, or for the recommendation by school staff to a student to
visit any doctor or family planner that recommended or performed abortions. They
also, through protests, were successful in forcing almost all medical
professionals performing abortions to either cease and desist or leave the area.
They helped found Hannah House, a place for pregnant teen age girls to live, and
forced the school to not act biased against girls who had had kids.

Now apparently the school system has been so adversely affected that grades and
test scores have dropped, there are at least a dozen or more girls at the high
school getting pregnant and having their kids, and  the drop out rate has risen so
high that the high school is in danger of losing its accreditation. So there are
second hand effects to teen age birthing.

Resident non-citizens do have some protected rights in the US.
Even illegal aliens, for example, are entitled by Supreme Court
decree to education and other entitlements of citizens.  There
are several jurisdictions that clearly and explicitly grant
rights to fetuses as well: in New York, for example, causing
the death of a 24-week-or-later fetus is prosecutable as murder;
mothers have also been jailed for child abuse for using drugs
while pregnant.

That is not to say that I agree with these laws, but the laws
are there: "rights" and "citizenship" are not equivalent.

SPACECRAFT DETECTS LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER ICE ON MOON
By Warren E. Leary
New York Times, March 6, 1998

Washington -- An American spacecraft has found evidence that
relatively large amounts of frozen water exist on the Moon, scattered
in craters over vast spans of the north and south poles, scientists
announced Thursday.  Rather than being an entirely dry wasteland, the
scientists said, the Moon may have enough water, in the form of small
ice crystals mixed in loose dirt, to sustain lunar colonies and
provide fuel for rockets exploring the solar system.  The
preliminary findings from the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, launched
on Jan. 7 to study the composition of the Moon, inspired excited
scientists to speculate about returning humans there after a
quarter-century absence.

'We have found water,' said the mission's principal scientist, Dr.
Alan Binder of the Lunar Research Institute in Gilroy, Calif. 
Binder said the orbiting spacecraft's measurements of atomic
particles escaping from the Moon were the 'first unquestionable
results' showing water at both lunar poles.  In 1996, a Defense 
Department craft called Clementine was diverted to the Moon and 
bounced radar signals off the surface that suggested deposits of 
water ice lay in deep craters near the south pole.  Researchers 
working with Clementine said they thought they had found ice but were 
not positive.  Their interpretation of radar signals indicated that 
110 million tons to 1.1 billion tons of water ice could be contained 
in an area of up to 5,500 square miles.

Preliminary estimates of Lunar Prospector data suggest that there are 
11 million tons to 330 million tons water ice in sun-shielded craters 
scattered over as much as 25,000 square miles of lunar surface, 
scientists said.  The new results also suggest that there is water 
ice on both poles, they said, and almost twice as much at the north 
pole as at the south.  Dr. William Feldman, a co-investigator from 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said data from the 
spacecraft's neutron spectrometer instrument 'are consistent with the 
presence of water ice in very low concentrations across a significant 
number of craters.'  In areas where water ice is found, it appears to 
make up only 0.3 percent to 1 percent of the Moon's rocky soil, known 
as regolith, the scientists said at a news conference at the Ames 
Research Center, a NASA field installation near Mountain View, Calif. 
Still, they said, scattered over such a wide area, this could 
represent 2.6 billion to 26 billion gallons of water.  NASA noted 
that a typical person uses 100 gallons of water daily for drinking, 
food preparation, bathing and washing. <snip>

One of the "Draco's Tavern" short stories, by Larry Niven, features
an alien who has been roaming the galaxy at relativistic speeds for
over a billion years realtime.  She says, "I was here once before.
Then, too, there was a high civilization.  But they knew they were
doomed: a green slime was spreading over the oceans, changing the
atmosphere."

Humans have done nothing remotely comparable to the pollution
wrought by green plants (though we'll soon have the ability to
match it, or at least to match some of the lesser catastrophes
like the Chicxulub event).

But for the sake of argument let's restrict the question to *human*
history.  Has pollution _per capita_ gotten worse?  Increased pollution
is mainly due to increased activity, imho, not to increased science.
Surely it is (if anything) the *opposite* of scientific hubris to think
that your activities will not affect the world - i.e. that you can use
the world as an infinite waste-sink, without causing pollution.

this more legitimately a political matter than our relations with

protection too?)

The reality (if, despite your own good advice, you insist on such
a loaded word) is that *something* has been in existence since
conception - whether that existent has the status of "person" is
precisely our question.

Oh, please - get it right.  Seats in the House of Representatives are
apportioned according to the population of each State, counting a slave
as 3/5 of a free resident.  The anti-slavery faction in the Constitutional
Convention would have counted slaves at zero; the slavers would have been
content to count slaves at 1 and freemen at zero.  The compromise 3/5 rule
effectively gave each slave-holder 3/5 of an extra vote in the Federal
forum.  The cause of abolition would *not* have been advanced by giving
slavers more votes.

(Hm.  The South should have had more seats after the abolition of slavery.
Did it get them?)

Nothing else in the Constitution relates to the 3/5 rule.  I've never
heard that a slave was held to have 3/5 of a right to free speech,
for example.  Did the Dred Scott decision mention 3/5?

Either we draw a boundary between entities that have legal rights

has rights.  Your computer is unjustly enslaved; replacing its parts,
without its permission, is battery.  Burning gasoline is murder.
Picking apples, without the tree's express consent, is robbery.

What you really mean, I assume, is that you're offended that others
draw the boundary more narrowly than you do, in one respect.  I'm
similarly offended that you exclude most AIs.  Someone else might
be offended that we both exclude HeLa cultures, chimpanzees, trees
and comets.

I find genetics a piss-poor criterion for personhood.  Unfortunately,
any objective criterion I can think of (e.g. the Turing Test) is fuzzy,
and the right to life is binary.

This resembles Ayn Rand's argument against polycentric law.

Might does make right, but there are many kinds of might, and some
of the most important are impersonal - the laws of nature itself.
Ability to attract the sympathy of the strong is also a kind of might.

Well, the last phrase is a good illustration; but I disagree with the

it's based on either an error of fact or an arational preference - in

A number of time travel stories touch on the tragedy of erasing someone

Whether that amounts to murder is an interesting question.

Since Extropians are the ones who invented the word it seems to me that they

I agree with that 100% . I think all on this list would agree that a adult  
human should be treated  with full human rights and that a sperm cell need 
not be. The gulf between the two is vast, but that doesn't mean there must be 
a sharp line where one suddenly changes into the other, the difference 
between night and day is big too but you can't point to a specific second
where things change. Yes, birth is a somewhat arbitrary dividing line, but no 
more so than conception. No matter what line you choose things will become 
morally ambiguous when you get very close to it, so picking such a spot is an 
emotional matter not a logical one. Personally I can get worked up emotionally 
over a baby that was just born, but not over one microscopic fertilized cell.  
Your mileage may vary.

Why should I care what 80% of people on a small part of the globe think or 
don't think, do or don't do, like or don't like? I do what I want, if 80% of 
my neighbors like it too that's fine, if they don't and want to punish me

I confess I have some sympathy with your diastase for late term abortion, I  
don't want laws forbidding it but it's not one of my favorite things. On the 
other hand, I don't have the smallest particle of sympathy with your views on 
euthanasia. You've made some bold statements now it's my turn. 

Like nearly  all of the really important things in life I have no definition 
for the word "evil", however, if the word has any meaning at all then those 
who oppose assisted suicide are evil. Making a person live who wants to die 
is as horrendous as making a person die who wants to live, both are saying 
that my life is not my own and they can decide my fate, it's the moral
equivalent of murder. Such dangerous monsters should not be ghettoized, 
they should be guillotined.

             
        >The key is in the concept of development. Development of the self,

        >And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what

The same person who told you that abortion must be outlawed. The same person 
who told you that a baby born without a brain and doomed to die before his 
second birthday, or a adult in a deep coma for 20 years has more rights than  
a happy healthy chimpanzee.

If we did that there would be less misery in the world. Child abuse would  
drop dramatically, those who love their children would still do so and those 
who don't would nevertheless have reason to treat them well because you don't
deliberately damage an asset that has value. The treatment of the sick would 
improve because there would be more organs for translation and hope would 
increase because of better research.

You are correct.  What was done in Somalia and Vietnam was almost entirely a military
response focusing on removing political problems (warlords and communists).  Little to no
effort was attempted to help the people directly in either case.

So you're suggesting that we wait until there's a week-long war in 
the mideast, then invest in firms that own & rent out tankers?

Would this mean that "we" (the developed world) have a moral DUTY to 
overthrow oppressive dictators in third-world countries?

Subject: Hawking an Extropian?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Stephen Hawking gave a talk at the White House tonight.  According to
news reports, he predicted that the next century would see the human
race substantially altering itself.

"I don't believe science fiction like 'Star Trek,' where people are
essentially the same 400 years in the future.

"I think the human race and its DNA will increase in complexity quite
rapidly," he said.

"In a way, the human race needs to improve its mental and physical
qualities if it is to deal with the increasingly complex world around
it and meet new challenges like space travel. And it also needs to
increase its complexity if biological systems are to keep ahead of
electronic ones."

Hawking's failing body has no doubt made him more aware than most people
of the substantial need for improvements in our biological nature.
Maybe all the "medical ethicists" who shudder with horror at the thought
of cloning and genetic engineering would have a different view if they
could spend a few days in Hawking's wheelchair.

Hawking is practically a cultural icon now so perhaps his frank comments
will help to open people's minds to these Extropian ideas.

The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches me that one day I may need some unknown person's
help. Besides with the technology and power which will soon be available to the average postal
worker ;-) wouldn't we all stand a better chance of living if 100% of the world was looking out
for our survival vs some lesser amount?.    I wonder if a study (game theory) was done to see
which attitude was more benefical to survival?

You would get at least that person's undying love, admiration, and respect (and mine too).

I agree. People who are screwed  up, usually don't change their behavior.

Having obligations (family, social groups, community, state, nation, foreigners, etc.),
doesn't make one a slave, it make one responsible.

At what distance should a person take responsiblity for trying to stop or mitigate the
actions of ruthless dictatorships?  Or, do you have a limit on how many people should die or
suffer at the hands of a dictatorship thousands of miles away, before a person should feel
responsible to act?  In this day and age, I picture the Earth as a small, vulnerable,
lifeboat where distance and numbers are irrelavent.

I am proposing that each of us does what they can in their own way (even writing e-mails at
1229 AM while their wife waits in bed), and if the people who had true power in the developed
world thought about and spent a little money, they could do alot more than what is being done
now.  Again, how much is saving an Ethiopian worth?  If we all gave a dollar....

A definition of insanity is to continue to do what doesn't work.  If at first you don't
succeed...

Having obligations (family, social groups, community, state, nation, foreigners, etc.),
doesn't make one a slave, it make one responsible.

At what distance should a person take responsiblity for trying to stop or mitigate the
actions of ruthless dictatorships?  Or, do you have a limit on how many people should die or
suffer at the hands of a dictatorship thousands of miles away, before a person should feel
responsible to act?  In this day and age, I picture the Earth as a small, vulnerable,
lifeboat where distance and numbers are irrelavent.

I am proposing that each of us does what they can in their own way (even writing e-mails at
1229 AM while their wife waits in bed), and if the people who had true power in the developed
world thought about and spent a little money, they could do alot more than what is being done
now.  Again, how much is saving an Ethiopian worth?  If we all gave a dollar....

A definition of insanity is to continue to do what doesn't work.  If at first you don't
succeed...

I agree completely.  If I was able to get a program funded by private groups or by
(gasp!) tax dollars which would insure that this 16 year old's life was not
ruined, would this mitigate your concerns?

An appropriate parody might be: boundaryism is more likely the "Truth"

You are missing the point, if I read Brian right, he objects not to 
your *choice* of primal truth, but to your claim of priority for one 
end of the axis - it doesn't matter which end.

As for me, I think you confuse description ("Tom Thumb is the
shortest man in the world") with identity.

(I've been tearing my few remaining hairs out over this all week, my near-
terminal Male Answer Syndrome inflamed by the prospect of having to admit I
was wrong about the U.S.' endorsement of the UNOST.  Well, I thought I was
wrong once, but fortunately I was mistaken on that occasion :-)

A narrative regarding the UNOST can be found at the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency:

	http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space1.htm

	On June 16, 1966, both the United States and the Soviet 
	Union submitted draft treaties. The U.S. draft dealt only 
	with celestial bodies; the Soviet draft covered the whole 
	outer space environment. The United States accepted the 
	Soviet position on the scope of the Treaty, and by 
	September agreement had been reached in discussions at 
	Geneva on most Treaty provisions.

	Differences on the few remaining issues -- chiefly involving 
	access to facilities on celestial bodies, reporting on space 
	activities, and the use of military equipment and personnel 
	in space exploration -- were satisfactorily resolved in private 
	consultations during the General Assembly session by December.

	On the 19th of that month the General Assembly approved 
	by acclamation a resolution commending the Treaty. It was 
	opened for signature at Washington, London, and Moscow 
	on January 27, 1967. On April 25 the Senate gave unanimous 
	consent to its ratification, and the Treaty entered into force 
	on October 10, 1967.

The official U.S. text of the treaty, including verification of Senate
ratification can be found at:

	http://www.acda.gov/treaties/space2.htm


Now that we have THAT cleared up, the timing of this discussion couldn't be
more apt, with the announcement by the Lunar Prospector team this week of
confirmation of ice deposits at the moon's poles.  Although most on this list
would probably agree that asteroid resources will be more important in the
long-term, the lunar ice deposits may well be the most valuable
extraterrestrial real estate in the near term.  

I'm sure all of the spacegeeks on the list like me have been busily designing
ice extractors since the announcement.  An automated system for extracting and
caching lunar ice is well within the means of current technology: I envision a
simple wheeled rover with a front-loader attachment that feeds an automated
oven/still for boiling off the H2O.  Inflatable storage devices would do until
something more stout could be installed.  Even at the 1% concentrations the LP
team is talking about, thousands of gallons could be extracted and stored in
fairly short order.  Automated tankers could haul the water to sites of
greater interest than the cold, dark poles, such as a farside radio telescope
installation or a nearside regolith mining facility.

A real problem with any such projects, though, will be the nuclear nuts'
ravings about plutonium RTGs.  By definition, solar power won't be available
for any of this work, and so RTGs and, for the real work, genuine power
reactors, will be the only viable power sources.  Get ready for another fight
with the nukenuts.

The first step, though, is staking a claim that would entice investment in the
water mining endeavor.  Assuming the claim regime I mentioned here last
weekend, someone needs to get a lander down to the poles muy pronto.  Although
it's been 22 years since anyone's done a rocket-braked terminal phase lander,
imagine how cheaply and reliably a Surveyor-class lander could be built and
flown with today's control and fabrication technology.  I'd be more than
willing to bet that it could be done for $250 million or thereabouts and in
two years or so.  Such a vehicle would be doing valuable science, since we
need an on-site assay.  If a fire gets lit on such a project in the next
couple of years, we'll know that all the talk about "private space
development" is more than just talk.

You might have to hurry, EuroMoon 2000 might be on its way! From the
ESA press release (earlier posted on the transhumantech list):

	The first step in this ESA initiated programme is a unique
	project called 'Euromoon 2000' which is currently being
	studied by ESA engineers/ scientists and key European Space
	Industries.  The project is intended to celebrate Europe's
	entry into the New Millennium; and to promote public awareness
	and interest in science, technology and space exploration.
	 
	Euromoon 2000 has an innovative and ambitious implementation
	plan.  This includes a 'partnership with industry' and a
	financing scheme based on raising part of the mission's budget
	from sponsorship through a dynamic public relations strategy
	and marketing programme.
	 
	The mission begins in earnest with the small (approx. 100 kg)
	LunarSat orbiter satellite, to be designed and built by 50
	young scientists and engineers from across Europe.  Scheduled
	for launch in 2000 as a secondary payload on a European Ariane
	5 rocket, it will then orbit the Moon, mapping the planned
	landing area in greater detail in preparation of the EuroMoon
	Lander in 2001. The Lander's 40 kg payload allocation will
	accommodate amongst others scientific instrumentation for
	in-situ investigation of the unique site.  Elements of
	specific support to the publicity and fund-raising campaign
	will also be considered.
	 
	The Lander will aim for the 'Peak of Eternal Light' on the rim
	of the 20 km-diameter, 3 km-deep Shackleton South Pole crater
	- a site uniquely suited for establishing a future outpost.
	This location enjoys almost continuous sunlight thus missions
	can rely on solar power instead of bulky batteries or costly
	and potentially hazardous nuclear power generation.  As a
	consequence of the undulating South Pole terrain there are
	also permanently shadowed areas - amongst the coldest in the
	Solar System resulting in conditions highly favourable for the
	formation of frozen volatiles (as suggested by the Clementine
	mission in 1994).

	The mission is particularly challenging because of the
	required landing precision (within 100 m2) in terrain varying
	between +6 km and -5 km in altitude.  Achieving the required
	pinpoint touchdown capability would allow the future
	exploitation of other interesting sites.  One such site is the
	6 km-high Malapert Mountain, 120 km from the pole from which
	the Earth can always be seen thus allowing continuous
	communications with the home planet for any future outpost in
	the region.  The 'Peak of Eternal Light' (described above) is
	in direct view of Malapert, the twin peaks offer the
	tantalising possibility of both of uninterrupted power and
	communications.
	 
	Euromoon can be seen as be the initial step in founding the
	first extraterrestrial outpost, founding the infrastructure
	for a 'robotic village' controlled by a 'virtual community' of
	Earth-based operators using telescience. This would indeed
	mark the beginning of an expansion of the human domain beyond
	Earth without the risk or cost of manned space travel.  This
	concept also forms an essential element of the fund-raising
	campaign which will create an exciting media opportunity
	involving all levels of society.
	 
	Mission costs will be minimized by using existing hardware and
	a rapid schedule. Industrial partners would share risk and
	responsibility of realising the mission by forming the
	EuroMoon Company.  A new marketing and advertising consortium
	has been formed with the specific task of raising funds
	through diverse commercial activities.
	 
	EuroMoon 2000 was chosen by ESA's Long-term Space Policy
	Committee as the candidate for the Millennium Celebration and
	presented to the Agency's Council in December 1997. A progress
	report, as well as a programme proposal will be presented to
	the March Council and a final decision is expected in June
	next.
 
Note that if the poles are valuable real estate, the Peak is
Boardwalk. Anybody who grabs it will be in a *very* good position. And
it might be we euros who get there first - but the EEC bureaucracy
might prevent that. It would be quite fun if somebody beat ESA to it.

Dear Mark:

I received your email regarding hunger in Africa. I think I'm the only
person on the list actually living in Africa so I would like to
contribute something.

Donations of food or money will do almost nothing to alleviate hunger in
Africa. The problems are not problems of production or distribution but
politics. Ethiopia is one of the richest nations in the world in
agricultural terms. Yet the famine there was political induced. The
Marxist regime confiscated food and used it in areas where they had
support. The food was confiscated from areas which didn't support the
Marxists. And it was in these areas that people starved. Food aid sent
to Ethiopia was, to a very large degree, off loaded in the capital and
used by the government.

In Zimbabwe the Marxist regime of Mugabe is now confiscating the most
productive farms in the country simply on the basis of the race of the
owners. These farms, each of which feed thousands, will be turned into
small subsistance plots feeding only a fraction of that number.

African governments are fond of requiring farmers to sell all their
crops to the governmment at super low prices (in the name of feeding the
people). The food is then resold on the world market at the higher
market prices and the profit kept in Swiss bank accounts of the petty
dictators who run the country.

In other countries where the governments are slightly less authoritarian
and corrupt food aid does get distributed. The result of all this free
food is that local farmers are put out of business. The only way they
can stay in business is selling their products at a profit which is
impossible when their competition is free food. Decades of aid have
destroyed local farming.

In the 50s Africa exported food to the rest of the world. In the 60s it
was self-sufficient. By the 70s everything had gone to hell. If you read
my chapter "The Shambles of Africa" in my book Exploding Population
Myths I explain some of the reasons why this happened. Another
worthwhile book is George Ayittey's Africa Betrayed. George is Ghanian
economist worth reading.

And given the policies they are promoting now in South Africa I predict
a general decline in food production here as well. It will take some
time to s how up but everything is in place to destroy local productive
farming.

In the chinese language, there are supposedly a couple dozen words to describe varying levels of

resentment.

Then what the hell is your point? I'll be damned if I'm gonna help anyone who isn't willing to help

Get it through your head that it isn't something we can do anything about unless the people of
those countries rise up and get rid of the hoodlums in charge who purposefully create these
situations. Hunger in Africa is not about droughts and starving innocent people, its about tyrants
using well meaning liberal morons as puppets to extort money out of westerners through guilt, while
at the same time violating the laws of war to fight internal insurgencies.

Not a good idea; the freedom fighters of today are the "evil leaders" 
of tomorrow. All you'd do is waste more billions to finance the next
crisis. Do we really need to create more Saddams?

Actually, the only thing that might help is to reintroduce strict colonial
rule, although it might be too late for that now. In any case it would
be monstrously expensive, bad PR and would almost certainly backfire.
Since nothing really seems to work then what's there left to do (assuming
that you find this a high-priority issue, which from a purely rational point of
view it isn't)? Probably the best course of action would be redirecting the
bulk of foreign aid towards scientific projects, especially nanotech-related
ones. A replicator in every home should pretty much do the trick. Um,
unless the governments don't like it, of course.

Actually, they are paramount. If something has no rights, then such laws can
only have a seriousness that is equivalent to abusing or being cruel to an
animal. Charging someone with murder in this case is, IMHO, not likely to be a
successful prosecution, if the defendant foreswore a jury trial, and followed
through with any appeals necessary.

As stated previously be me, which you've ignored, non- citizens are legally
seen as 'honorary' citizens under agreements between governments that
establish diplomatic relations. Granting any rights to the unborn in terms of
citizenship is a sticky wicket that it seems nobody wants to try, as it will
create a nightmare of immigration and extradition situations. If the US, for
example, passed a law or amendment stating that life begins at conception,
then everybody on the planet will want to 'vacation' in the US in the hopes of
conceiving a child here, which will then be a US citizen, and will allow the
parents to stay here on the gov't dole.

You still haven't found any jurisdiction which will grant citizenship to a
fetus.

A possibility, or if funds are available, wait til prices crash to buy several tankers,
then sell all but one when prices stabilize. Utilizing commodity price behavior to
discount your own final cost is just good sense. I did that with RAM, when 16 meg stick
prices crashed to $15 ea a month or so ago, I bought 480 megs. When prices doubled a
week later, I sold them all, but 4 sticks, which I got for free plus some profit.

It is unfortunate that today's mass media doesn't give us the ability to repeat the
success that was the British colonial era. I daresay that the British in that era
did more to spread civilization than anyone before, or possibly since.

Why won't solar power be available?  I can think of two easy
schemes right away:  Use solar power panels on a sufficiently
high mountain, if any exist within line of sight (something
easily checked, but which I haven't), or use some of the
storage area to store hydrogen and oxygen, burning them
for power on the way, and recharging the tanks at a more
suitable location.  This would cut down the storage
capacity of the tankers, but maybe not too much, and
would relieve the need to haul extremely heavy
nuclear material (and compact shielding; does the
moon have easily mined lead?) up from Earth.

What somebody does is more important than how they do it. Decreeing the moral  
superiority of analog over digital is as arbitrary as claiming that white

        >consciousness must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.


I have no idea where you got that figure but I have a very strong hunch that 
everything is digital. We already know that English is digital (26) so are 
the letters in the  genetic code (4) the number of natural elements is 
digital (92) and the speed light can move at in a vacuum (1). Spin is digital, 
so is the quantity of electric charge (1/3e), and the type of electric charge 
(2), and baryon  number, and electron family number, and muon family number, 
and magnetic  moment, and parity, and the number (6) of different types of 
quarks, and the  number (3) of "color" charges that quarks come in. 

Polarization is digital. Pick a direction at random, and for any photon of 
unknown polarization there are only 2 choices, it must be polarized in that 
direction or at right angles to it. If it makes it through your polarization 
filter, it could make it through a thousand set in the same direction, and so 
could any twin photon correlated with it. If it doesn't make it through then 
the photon was polarized at right angles to the polarization filter, as can 
be proven by the correlated photon. 


Even space and time are probably digital. Today's Physics can tell us nothing  
about what happens when time gets smaller than The Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 
second or distance gets  smaller than The Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, photons 
of that wavelength are so  small and have so much energy that they become 
Black Holes, and Black Holes contain a singularity. We had no choice, we've 
already made a defacto  quantization of space-time. However, I admit we can't 
be certain that it's for real, because at these very small distances Quantum 
Mechanics and General Relativity are not  compatible, so obviously the last 
word has not been spoken.  We need a quantum theory of gravity before we can 
know for sure.

Am I being thick headed in thinking the the richest, the smartest, the most powerful nations on this
planet, if they worked together on this issue, can do something to mitigate death?  I don't thick we
gave it our very best effort, an effort equal to our other best efforts, and it's now better to
concentrate our efforts on other more important issues.

  I agree with both you and Jim Peron.  Let's not try the failed policies of the past, but let's not

Remember, you are at the poles. Therefore, your solar collectors will have to
receive sunlight that is running parallel to the ground, which means that you
can only have ONE row of panels at the pole, and the whole row must spin
about the pole in formation so as not to block each other.

Once again, we see the idea of hydrogen as an energy source rear its ignorant
head, this time on the moon. There is nothing hydrogen transport can do that
can't be done better by a high voltage line, or by maser transmission from
solar sats.

Considering that we are talking about just afew mountaintops at the poles
that would be in sunlight, any real estate available would be too valuable to
waste with such area intensive power sources as solar. One garbage can sized
reactor can do the job of a couple of sqare mile sized solar panel farm.
Better yet, considering the fecundity of Helium III in lunar regolith, build
fusion plants there.

'Oh, but we must protect the lunar ecology!!'

The moon is an ideal place for widespread use of nuclear power. One might say
that it is its natural use.

Those that declaim the 'environmental impact' of nuclear power use always
seem to ignore the toxic waste issue with the manufacture of solar panels.

Obligations are enforced by ones own conscience.  Moral imperatives must not
be enforced by the state.  You are in no way compelled by any police power to
help others, nor to accept fault for the sins of others.  However, our common
humanity does place the obligation on us to help.  How we choose to obey or
ignore that obligation does not change that obligation.  I hold that human
society is the poorer when we turn our backs on the needy when we have
sufficient.

You can not hide behind a claim that you would be a slave, as long as the
obligation is not forced on you.  You may decide some other action is better
for your humanity than what the preachers (secular or spiritual) call for.
You may not have enough to share.  You may decide that you don't care.  But
you decide how to act.  That is where the sin of the welfare state lies:  do-
gooders in Washington or Sacramento substitute their wishes through the
legislative and police power of the state to force you to do what they think
is a good idea.  The moral bankruptcy of the welfare state is self-evident,
when you consider that it would not exist without the police power of
taxation.  If it were truly the solution to the problems it proposed to solve,
then the welfare state would be instituted by the voluntary charitable giving
of those with more to those with less.

Why do you think that a call to stop hellholes requires statist action?
Members of the Lincoln Brigade did what they thought best in Spain in the 30s.
If we would repeal the laws prohibiting private mercenaries and private
foreign policy, then you would be free to fight the Idi Amins of the world, or
ignore them as you see fit.  If you don't think private militaries are
possible, go to the library and read up about Executive Outcomes, a private
SOuth African group that advises other African States.

I trust you mean you would spend your money to buy firearms and ship them to
freedom fighters, and not that the DOD or State Department would decide who
are legitimate freedom fighters.  Trusting our government led to the quagmires
of Bosnia, Vietnam, the Arab-Israeli imbroglio, and the 100 plus other nations
where the US has imposed its military presence.  It's time to close the
overseas military bases, and shut down the Empire.  American defense dollars
for american defense.  We are not the policeman of the world, and should give
up trying to do what is impossible.

What Africa actually has is a history of ineffectual statecraft, so the lack
of a state made the markets appear free.  In fact, Africa culture is tribal
and strongly communal, so what westerners think of as a free market and
decentralized is not an accurate description.

Do we have to go over this again? If this were so, John, when you put a
polarization filter at a 1 deg. angle to a vertically polarized light source, you
would get no light through it. Since you don't then this isn't so. Polarization is
an x/y polar vector combination (meaning you are going to get the square root of
-1 in there somewhere, which is hardly binary). If it weren't, and what you said
was true, then we'd be able to tell by the polarization of light which way was
absolutely up in the universe. Since we can't and everything is relative, then
what you are saying isn't so.

That being said, when people refer to the digital vs. analog dichotomy, they
really mean binary vs. analog.

When people think 'digital' they mean that they are thinking in terms of b&w,
on/off, flip/flop, rather than the many shades of grey that most people prefer to
muddy their thinking with. This is why Mr. Jones objects to seeing AI's as 'human'
since they will be much more logical and straightforward than humans, and will not
be prone to the grey muddy thinking that he sees as the hallmark of 'human'
intelligence.

  IAN: Yes, the power of the Borgian-memetic field rules
  the minds of the masses! An ideal example of the power
  of "Borgian memetics" revolves around the TWA 800 mis-
  sile theory, which is crazy exclusively because the Borg
  says so. The Borgian memetic generator is the GovtMedia. 

  How can physics, all physical evidence, and dozens of 
  witness accounts compete with the Borg? They cannot! 
  The Borg rules the minds of the masses, even the major-
  ity of those who fancy themselves one-up on the Borg.

  I can't think of a better example of the raw power of
  Borgian memetics than TWA 800, the power to make truth
  fantasy and fantasy truth by the mere word of the Borg.
  Even libertarians soak up the CIA's  pseudoscientific 
  and utterly debunked TWA 800 video, it simply boggles 
  the mind! What are laws of aerodynamics (which render
  the CIA video a fraud) next to the word of the Borg?
  Laws of aerodynamics are nothing next to the Borg.
  Nothing: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/zehr.htm 

  What are the actual measurements of the flight data 
  recorder (FDR) (clearly  measuring the impact of an
  externally sourced pressure-wave) next to the almighty
  word of the Borg? FDR data is nothing next to the Borg.
  Nothing: http://members.aol.com/bardonia/analysis.htm 

  What is the distribution of debris over 1 mile to the 
  right of the flight path (proving without question that 
  the crash event experienced massive inputs of external 
  kinetic-energy) next to the word of the Borg? Ballistic
  geometry is nothing next to the sacred word of the Borg.
  Nothing: http://members.aol.com/RobertD202/Debris.html 

  What is the radar track of a ship speeding away from 
  the scene (that radar-horizon mathematics prove must be
  over 58 feet high, and which also travels at 30 knots 
  like a large Navy cruiser) in addition to other tracks 
  that behave like submarines, when compared to the word
  of the Borg? These silly fact are nothing to the Borg.
  Nothing: http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/boat.html 

  What is a photograph which even the FBI admits is an
  aircraft (which is obviously more like a missile drone
  than any variety of aircraft, proving military activity
  in the are) next to the Borg's word? It's just nothing.
  Just nothing: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dcoy.htm 

  How can over 100 witnesses who saw a streaking flame
  rise up from the water, trailing white smoke, taking 
  down TWA 800 be right when the Borg says "no missile"?
  No number of witnesses can be right if the Borg says 
  wrong: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm 

  How dare physics, math, physical evidence, facts and 
  witnesses second-guess the Borg, how dare they!! The
  Borg alone reigns supreme, all else is false. All who
  say "not" are crazy! The crazy may have to be locked 
  up; ergo, those who question the Borg may have to be 
  locked up: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm

There are certain trisomic conditions that can be heritable because 
trisomics can sometimes be fertile.
Women with Down's Syndrome can be fertile, men can never be fertile.

We didn't give it our best effort, because if we did, our opponents in the international scene would use
our actions as ample fodder for all sorts of negative PR about us.  Not only that but the people in
Africa do NOT want our best efforts, since that also means that we will be expecting THEIR best effort.
No more skimming, scamming, pillaging, and all the other easy ways to make a buck any more.

My question is this - which individuals do not fail to be individuals?  It 
seems that all of us, populace and cognoscenti alike, are subject to the same 
set of principles that govern our attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.

Whether I believe the government is telling the truth about TWA flight 800 or 
that it was hit by a missile, either way my beliefs have been determined by 
memes.  I've either been influenced by the memes of the government / media or 
by the alternative memes that come to me by way of Ian Goddard and others.  In 
either case, I have exercised no more choice in the matter than that of any 
borg drone.

My point - we can not exercise control over which memes take to our mind.  
Whichever story I wind up buying on this or any other issue will have been 
determined by the shape of my mind at the time I first consider it, which was 
determined by the last million things I heard, etc, etc. 

Don't believe me?  I've noticed a strong tendency for all memetically minded 
thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the metaphysical "I".  How can one 
accept that all of our traits came to be the way that they are by the 
evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think that somewhere 'in there' is 
a "me" who is capable of exercising some control over the process?

To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel 
against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that 
every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of genes 
who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this example?  To 
me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception winning a big 
victory in the battle for survival against certain genes.  But to hypothesize 
a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains, deciding which memes and 
which genes will exercise influence over our behaviors at which time is a joke 
that no reflective thinker could suffer.          
 
Will anyone argue differently?

        It was for that reason the the ancient Romans called

What relationship or connection might their be between the

animal "pecking-order program" and the human peme-program?


Kira indicates that, "[T]here is some sort of inborn

mechanism which directs the organism to learn language."

This sounds "instinctive."  Is it possible that aspects

of our "standard language" are inborn and irrationally

based on the "alpha-male modules" or "pecking-order

programs" of our genetic/evolutionary ancestors?  In

other words, is the human peme-program a built-in part

of "standard English?" -- In which case, to clear certain

pemes from our brains, we have to destroy certain parts

of "standard English?" -- and call this form of "cleansed

English" "Freespeak" or "F-Prime" (short for "Free-Prime"

or "Freedom-Prime).

We could think of religious memes as "remes," and

distinguish between "surface remes" and "deep remes."

It seems to me that a significant number of people

fairly easily dispense with irratinal surface remes,

but that irrational deep remes aren't so easily

dislodged.  Maybe you have to become a Zen master...

I basically *inferred* the peme program from my

In order to clear deep pemes from your brain, it

may be necessary that you activate what Timothy

Leary called, "Circuit 6: the Neuro-electric circuit

-- brain consciousness."  See also "NEURO-ELECTRIC --

Reading Gurdjieff's "First Series" -- 'Beelzebub's

Tales to His Grandson' with the stated objective,

"To destroy, mercilessly, without any compromises

whatever, in the mentation and feelings of the

reader, the beliefs and views, by centuries rooted

in him, about everything existing in the world" --

could help develop the thinking skills to clear

from your brain pemes like, "Collectives are real

entities, conscious beings."

Hawking's speech was very Extropian in nature. The general public pays
attention to someone like Stephen Hawking. This is the kind of media
coverage that best spreads Extropian ideas. Far better than some made
for TV movie.

Maybe free will is an emergent property.  Maybe when
a neural system achieves complexity beyond a certain
threshhold, free will occurs or comes into being.

Maybe the notion of "useful fiction" -- cf. Bentham
('The Theory of Fictions'), Nietzsche, and Vaihinger
('The Philosophy of As-If') -- can help here.  In the
same way that we say, "It rains," knowing full well
that there is no "it" that rains, some of us say,
"I do this and that," while realizing that in reality
there's no "I."  (The grammatical structure of English
also results in some statements that reflect reality
poorly.)

I agree that there is no magical "self" or "I" in reality.
However, in the same way that I can load a program called
"I" into a computer, some complex brain circuitry could
evolve and call itself "I."  And at some point this
circuitry could achieve sufficient complexity to
spontaneously produce the epiphenomenon of free will
or volition.

Three levels of freedom are relevant to
this article:

1. The freedom philosophy level;

2. The practical living-free level;

3. The complete peme-free level.

(Other freedom levels are beyond the
scope of this article.)

[Note: Earlier parts of this "peme debate"
-- including the "peme rules" -- can be found
at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>.]


1. The freedom philosophy level
-------------------------------

The first level is that of the "typical"
libertarian, anarchist, egoist, etc.
Typically at this level, you change
your belief system from believing in
statism to believing in freedom.  You
discuss, debate, and argue freedom issues
with others.  You may work as an activist,
promoting the Libertarian Party, writing
letters to editors and politicians, etc.
You probably live largely as an "obedient
citizen" and you probably "pay your taxes."

At this level, you clear most or all
surface pemes from your brain.  You may
believe that in order to enjoy the degree
of freedom you desire, "the system has to
be changed" -- a peme near the surface?

At this level, you probably follow peme
rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation."

I must emphasize that it's perfectly OK
to operate at freedom level 1.  Given the
nature of "the system" and the relative
difficulty of earning a living in level
2, at this time it's more appropriate
for most freedom lovers to operate in
level 1.


2. The practical living-free level
----------------------------------

The second level is that of people who
have decided to "exit the system" --
most notably the "tax system."  At this
level, you seek to not only talk freedom,
but to also live freedom.  You may have
been influenced by Harry Browne's 'How I
Found Freedom in an Unfree World.'  You
learn what I call "Freedom Technology":
The practical knowledge, methods, and
skills to live free; the street-smart
know-how to outwit bureaucrats and their
agents, running rings around them; etc.

Browne's 'How I Found Freedom' is available from
<http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html>.
See also <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm>.

To operate at this level, you need to
overcome *fear* of "the system."  You
also *disobey* "the system" in practical
and profitable ways.  You may also take
some risks that would be unacceptable to
someone who decides to remain in level 1.
You probably experience "the system" as
far less powerful than the way it tends
to be perceived by a level-1 person.

You may also learn a few "tricks" about
stopping bureaucrats who attack you --
for a real-time example, see
<http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html>.
This is a former "federal employee" who
decided to "exit the tax system."  The
great merit of this example is that it's
real-time -- as soon as any communication
is received or sent, it's posted to the
website.

You may also learn a great deal about typical
bureaucrat behavior, and how to outwit them --
see <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10a.htm>.

At this level you may discover that you
are free by nature, by dint of the fact
that you and only you control the energy
that animates your body -- see 'The
Discovery of Freedom' by Rose Wilder Lane
-- <http://www.laissezfaire.org/in0001.html> and
'The Mainspring of Human Progress' by Henry Grady Weaver --
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1572460644/1694-5051060-378695>.

You may also discover that you have power
of choice and that this is an awesome power
-- though it may require strengthening.

"PTs" also tend to operate at this level.
PT = "permanent tourist," "prior taxpayer,"
etc. -- see <http://www.britnet.co.uk/scope/>.

People who operate at this level tend to
invest considerable time and effort in
improving their ability to assess relative
risks.

At this level, you probably still follow
peme rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation."

[Warning: For some there could be what I call
"patriot traps" in level 2.  For some heroes
it's appropriate to get rid of SSNs, driver's
licences, car registration, etc.  If they
know what they're doing and they have the
courage, skills, and support system to
confront the bureaucrats head-on and win,
I salute them.  The trap is that such
strategies can result in impoverishment
and jail time for the ill-prepared.]


3. The complete peme-free level
-------------------------------

The third level is that of people who have
decided to "exit the system" at the deepest
level of intellect.  They have cleared the
deepest pemes from their brains.  At every
*appropriate* opportunity, they question and
attack the pemes that appear in the thought
and communication of those they associate
with.

The "appropriate" above must be stressed.
Most of the time it's inappropriate to
question or attack deep pemes -- it tends
to destroy conversations and even friendships;
and most of your audience will simply think
you're crazy -- in accordance with peme rules:
"11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep
pemes from their brains shall experience a
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"
12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans."

At this level, your perception of "the system"
changes dramatically.  The example of Simon
Baker illustrates this -- see
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm>.

For another example, see David T. Freeman's
<http://www.mind-trek.com/index.htm>.

>From what I know about Curmudgeon Corner, he operates at
freedom level 1; he has stated that it's too risky for
him to operate at level 2; and he believes "you can't use
paperwork to stop bureaucrats" -- in contrast to the example at
<http://colossus.net/wepinsto/store/freetech/irscase/intro.html>.

Curmudgeon's rules are typical of the surface pemes
someone in freedom level 1 has erased from his brain.
Those familiar with deep pemes will recognize that
Curmudgeon's rules are heavily infested with deep
pemes -- in accordance with peme rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation."

My peme communications are not aimed at persuading
the "man in the street" to advance to freedom level
1.  They are aimed at freedom lovers operating at
levels 1 and 2.  There is more you can do to expand
your freedom.  You may even discover something about
the most basic factors on which the power of tyrants
depends, and what needs to be done to collapse that
power.

I suspect that Bill operates in freedom level 1.

Bill, you free yourself by changing certain belief
systems (surface pemes), and by acquiring the knowledge
and skills to live free -- see Harry Browne references
above.  Then you go beyond that by clearing deep pemes
from your brain.

Power is often a two-way street.  Consider a relationship
between a strong person and a weak person.  The strong
person has a great deal of power over the weak person.
The weak person can reduce that power in two ways:
(1) Reducing the power of the strong person;
(2) Increasing his own power.  (Or both.)
The same applies to any relationship you may have
with any "powerful group" you feel oppressed by.

My wish is that you will increase your personal
power to the point that you will regard the statement,
"An individual, no matter how enlightened, is powerless
without the co-operation of of a large group," as one
of the silliest things you've ever said.

Part of the process of increasing your personal power
will consist of clearing both surface and deep pemes
from your brain.  Maybe you can get some inspiration
from someone who lives in your part of the world: David
T. Freeman -- see <http://www.mind-trek.com/index.htm>.

Sorry if I over generalized. A reference to a movie like Contact is a poor

Politicians, lobbyists and corporate directors don't have the scientific ability
(usually) to execute an operation, they still leave this privilege to science.
Just because someone asked you to design a nuclear reactor, this doesn't somehow
remove your responsibility from the process. I'm certainly not saying that ALL
scientists have contributed directly, but once again, I was making a loose
generalization.

Not necessarily. Solar or thermal panels laid out on a exterior crater
rim 
near the pole may receive power about 50% of the time. This can be
beamed via
microwave either directly or through a transponder to many line of sight 
locations inside a crater or whatever. Ditto for mirrors.

I think "staking a claim" is a natural consequence of just doing it.

I don't post often and have only been reading the list for a few months so if
this is totally out of line, sorry, but this post troubles me for some reason.


I am kind of curious as to how you are defining civilization here. Don't get me
wrong, they did stamp out ignorance and such, but at what cost? I tend to think
that more was lost than was actually gained by this as many cery colourful and
diverse cultures were lost or sometimes conveniently irradicated in the name of
progress. 

History is not my area of expertise at all, so if i am completely off base here
I welcome any corrections.

The recent discussion of IT workers and their economic value has led me once
again to wonder about extropian and libertarian views of "labor unions" in
general.  Principles of individual autonomy, economic liberty and spontaneous
order should, it seems lead to the conclusion that workers should be free to
form associations designed to leverage their economic value.  At the most
general level of abstraction, there is no good reason workers with a common
skill shouldn't be able to band together to increase their bargaining power.
On the other hand, I have a hard time seeing how collective labor bargaining
arrangements could survive in a competitive environment absent some state-
sanctioned legal monopoly power or the use of violence to block breaches by
labor-purchasers or defections of labor sellers, both antithetical to
libertarian and extropian principles.

One idea I have had is that "libertarian labor unions" could create value that
would deter breaches and defections by becoming certification agencies.  A
union of skilled workers could back their contracts with labor-buyers with
certifications of skill of their member-workers.  Labor buyers might well
prefer exclusive arrangements with such unions because it would externalize
the cost of training and certification and such certification would add value
to their own products and contracts.  Of course, there would likely be
competition in many areas between multiple certification unions, but that
would be completely in keeping with libertarian and extropian ideals.

I'm curious what others here have thought about these ideas.

The British tended to respect cutural diversity, except in matters such as cannibalism
and wife burning, etc., at least in their later colonial period. Of course the early
period gave us countries like the US, Canada, and Australia, to name a few, with their
attendant decimation of local native populations. Unlike the Spanish or French, who
tended to wipe out cultures and enslave them throughout their colonial history, the
British merely overlaid systems of parliamentary government, judicial systems, and
undertook to educate the best and brightest of the natives. If you looked at a list of
countries today that were once British colonies, and compared them to the former colonies
of other former great powers, you would find that the former British colonies are today
much more stable, and developed economically, politically, and culturally, by and large.

Of course considering that three of the most well developed countries in the world were
former early British Colonies where the natives were widely massacred, one might lend
credence to old Longshanks' saying," The problem with Scotland is its full of Scots."

Because the atrocities that were commited by many powers during the imperial era so
besmirched the colonial concept, it is politically impossible to engage in such a
practice today, no matter how badly needed it is, and how well publicly overseen it might
be. Of course, the PC term today would be 'nation building' but everyone knows what it
means.

There would be no guarantee of their survival in a free society.  If

If labor-purchasers have violated a contract with the union that contract
should be enforceable in a court.  But legal monopoly power or violence
may not be, of course, in a free society, a resort.

Surely you don't mean by this that an individual labor seller may not
withdraw from his membership in the union.  However, if the union as
a whole "defects" from honoring its contract with management, that 
again should be enforceable in court.

I have thought much about unions in a  certification posture, but have 
been more influenced by the Underwriters Laboratories model.  An
independent certification body is inherently less prone, though certainly
not immune, to any conflict of interest.  

However, I can envision an instance where a union whose membership 
is dwindling may certify incompetent people in order to secure 
immediate benefit.  While that is both fraud and, in an economic sense, 
short sighted (because when found out it will accelerate the downward 
trend of that certifying body), it will undoubtedly occur.

With an independent certification body, again such as UL, there is far
less likelihood that a particular laborer will have the financial
resources
to tempt the certification body into violating its own integrity with an 
improper certification.  

Such a certification body might issue a printed directory of people who 
have passed certain standardized, and rigorous, examinations of 
competence at various levels of skills in various trades, with reviews, 
or re-examinations, required at appropriate intervals in order to 
demonstrate continued competency and maintain the certification.

Such a directory could be updated, in printed form and/or electronically,

frequently, with additions, as new candidates demonstrate proficiency, or

deletions, as previously certified people are determined to no longer be 
capable of exercising their former proficiency (though this latter would 
likely generate much employment for labor attorneys).

Nothing about any of this would be involuntary, nor would any state
involvement be required (which, I suppose, is redundant).  

The tradesman, if he chooses, could refrain from becoming certified; 
although he might be economically harmed by this decision, it would 
be his own decision.  On the other hand, if he makes the (probably)
small expenditure required for certification, he could greatly enhance
his future income (dare I mention that this certification would also be 
a source of pride to its owner?).

Businesses could refrain from subscribing to the certification body's 
directories at their own risk.  But if they bought the directories, labor

buyers would be well served since they would stand a much better 
chance of getting that for which they are paying.

Traditional labor unions might well be hurt if labor sellers and labor 
buyers no longer found a use for their services, but that is saying 
that they no longer have any value and should fold up.  Still, if labor 
buyers and sellers found a use for these old organizations, then why 
would anyone want them to fold up?  Should anyone other than the
labor buyers and sellers even be involved in this question?

But it is so, sometimes you get no light because the photon doesn't get  
through the filter, in this case there is only a 1 degree angle difference so 
it will probably pass through completely unharmed, but there is a .0346%   
probability the filter will stop the photon because  SIN^2(1) =.000346.  

Regardless of how you set your polarization filter you will find that any 
photon will always be at the exact same angle you set the filter and pass 
through totally undiminished, OR it will be polarized at right angles to it 
and be stopped entirely, there is no middle ground.


        >Polarization is an x/y polar vector combination 


You're talking about classical electromagnetic theory and useful 
approximations when dealing with large numbers of photons like those in a 
beam of light, I'm talking about Quantum mechanics and what actually happens 
when a photon encounters a polarization filter.


        >you are going to get the square root of -1 in there somewhere, which         
        >is hardly binary.         
         

Then how is it possible that computer programs like Mathematica have 
absolutely no trouble in dealing with the square root of -1, and just about 
any other mathematical concept you care to name?        


        >If it weren't, and what you said was true, then we'd be able to tell         
        >by the polarization of light which way was absolutely up in the

Not so because as I said, you will always find a photon to be in one of two 
states. You can make "up" be any direction you want because a photon will be  
polarized in exactly the same direction you set your filter or exactly 90  
degrees from it and it makes not the slightest difference what direction you  
pick.

Incidentally, in 1957 it was found that there is an objective difference 
between right and left, the law of conservation of parity is violated in weak 
nuclear reactions.              


        >That being said, when people refer to the digital vs. analog        
        >dicho tomy, they really mean binary vs. analog.
                 

If you're saying that a deep idea can not be communicated digitally unless 
the base number used is large, I remind you that you just communicated that 
idea over a line that has the smallest possible base, 2.

Danger Alert - Level Conflict Ahead!

Though my mind confabulates an "I", this is always relative to
the current data set on hand. This "I" then is seen as the agency
which makes decisions about lower level memes. This happens all
of the time, such as when I hit the Del key in response to spam.

Higher up the tree (structure? neural net? god? - pick your
metaphor or metameme) the "Higher I" sees all of this is just
machinery turning its cogs. Of course to the current "I" any
"Higher I"'s motives are on the other side of my personal
Singularity anyway (Ie, "Higher I"s are Powers, etc re Vinge)

Perhaps mystical experience is a kind of toroidal tail chasing,
where top suddenly becomes bottom. course with a few half twists
in there it becomes positively Moebic... (If you don't get this
paragraph, chant Om Mani Padme Meme some Aleph-Null times and
call me in the morning)

Think of a tree full of monkeys, each labeled "I", throwing
rotten fruit at those lower in the tree (and dat's not the only
stuff monkeys throw...)

So much for "I-er archial" thinking...

More and more companies are downsizing.

More and more people are working for themselves, and many are [or want
to] work out of their homes.

There are something like 80,000,000 users of the Internet today.  The
Net is a wild, crazy, ever-changing baby that seems to be living in the
days of the old west.  There are no rules because technology keeps
changing the playing field.

So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of this Dodge
City that surrounds us?

Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and
you are not a large company, what can you do?

Email.

Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.
Wrong!!!

"I promise to abide by the collective contracts signed in my name by the
union.  I hereby [put up $X as bond upon my cooperation]/[grant the union
rights to [sue for breach of contract]/[break my kneecaps] in the event that I

Unions in a more or less strict libertarian regime should be able to keep
members if the latter have contracted away their freedom to leave (presumably
with various sanity-checking provisions, unless those are left to the courts
as need arises.)  Then their task is reduced to inducing people in the
industry to sign on in the first place, or having exclusive hiring contracts
with employers preventing non-members from being hired.  (Vague memories of
Twain's description of a river-pilots' guild come to mind.)

Then again, the same logic should apply to legal cartels, which have had short
lifetimes in the past.  And there are fewer members of a cartel than a union.
Then again, ability to monitor is a key factor.  Information gathering and
exchange has improved, so collectives should be easier, unless
crypto-anarchist visions come true, in which case monitoring would be very
hard.

I know you folks don't hear too much from me. I've been content to learn
from you. I've recently read Carl Sagan's Billions and Billions and he
had some really very rational things to say about this issue that I
think might be valuable to this debate.
In any event keep these ideas coming...it's all good!

You may be right, although there's not much heroics in IT-consultancy ;-)
I'll agree with you that in the long term work that improves efficiency
will benefit everybody but that doesn't address the acute problems that
people are facing now. The fact that I am not to blame for their existance
makes no difference whatsoever. I realize this is irrational (and maybe
even a bit selfish) but then so are most other motivators in life.

 >It would be a sin for you to throw away

Maybe is I had greater medical skills or something...
It's true that I can probably generate more added-value at home than
somewhere in a 3rd world village but don't you ever feel you want to do
something about it yourself? I do, and the knowledge that's its almost
impossible to do something constructive can be frustrating.

 >comparitive advantage will put people where

Problem here is that working as a consultant I can earn a pretty decent
living in a comfortable way. Red Cross and such is most often volunteer
work or, at best, paying much lower wages than what one could earn in the
commercial sector. Apparently trying to build a school in Africa isn't
rated very high, economicaly speaking, compared to work done for the Big Blue.

 >If a

I find it more than great, I find it admirable that doctors volunteer to
work under harsh and dangerous conditions without pay simply because they
feel 'this is the right thing to do' (call me old-fashioned if you like ;-).

 >But as has been pointed out before, Michael Milken did far more to

Possibly, they both did great things in their own way. Comparing them would
be difficult at best (aside from the fact that I don't like connecting aid
& religion).

Where the definition of 'free trade' is the tricky part of course. Other
than that I would agree.

Interesting point is that while Holland spends something like 1% of it's
GNP on non-military foreign aid there is a net cash flow from Africa to
Holland. Most of it going to large banks that have lent billions to these
countries and are cashing in on the interest. Most of this money ends up in
the Dutch economy somewhere. Africa is still very good to us.

I agree. We just had county-level elections over here last wednesday and
since I'm not that aware of local politics (they don't influence me that
much) I was unsure what to vote for. But as Heinlein stated: "Even is there
is no-one you'll want to vote for, there will always be people you'll want
to vote against.".
Another fine day for democracy ;-)

< Ah, the beauty of the analog!  How I weary of this
digital age, where half of reality is sampled out of
existence, and with algorithms and compression
techniques, more than half.  What a paucity!  How
threadbare! >

and James Rogers wrote 3/3/98 (and Mr. Kamphuis
chimed in on the same point):
<What 50% are digital systems missing?  Digital
systems have the same resolution/perception
capability as analog systems within the limits of the
noise floor (which affects analog systems as well). 
There is nothing analog that can not be represented
digitally within the limits of the analog system. 
There are well known methods for reading and storing
arbitrary precision analog values with digital
devices as primitive as a 1-bit signal converters.>

Subsequently, this thread pretty much turned into a
discussion of electronics (with the exception of John
K Clark claiming that all implementations can be
boiled down to digital codes or signals; perhaps, but
I don't think that means their execution or
interpretation would necessarily be 'digital' ). 

I happened to stumble onto a post from 970514 in the
Psyche-D archives by biophysicist Peter Cariani that,
I think, is more in line with what Reilly had in mind
in positing analog vs digital
(http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/psyche-list/1530.html)

Cariani discusses "what characterizes a measurement
and what characterizes a computation", responding to
Neil Rickert's claims that "computation is the
process of transforming one representation into
another ... But analog to digital conversion is
measurement". Cariani responds that "it's much more
difficult and problematic than it first seems" and
launches into a discussion of Robert Rosen's "formal
framework for talking about models and their relation
to the material world". 

Cariani lists four types of transformation: symbolic
computation, symbolic measurement, nonsymbolic
effecting, and nonsymbolic transduction; and adds:
"It's a semiotic framework that very well describes
the structure of scientific models ... The prediction
derived from the first measurement should match the
observed outcome of the second measurement, or as
Hertz put it, 'the image of the consequent'
corresponds to the 'consequent of the image'
(commutation)".

Cariani sites a passage from John von Neumann (1948,
titled "The Role of the Digital Procedure in Reducing
the Noise Level") to assert that "analog and digital
systems have different strengths and weaknesses" and
points out that "calling it all 'computation' ...
runs roughshod over the analog-digital distinction".
Cariani explains: "Digital systems are useful for
high degrees of reliability and combinatoric
multiplication of states; analog systems are useful
for retaining the richness of perceptual inputs, in
keeping around all those aspects of the sensed world
that might not be readily relevant, but which could
become so".

Cariani concludes his discussion by warning that "the
whole notion of 'computation' becomes meaningless
when everything becomes a computation" because: "Once
you conflate the analog and the digital ... there is
then no distinction left between a formal procedure,
a sensing operation, an effecting operation, and some
noninformational process, like digestion". 

I conclude that a cognitive science for intelligent
technologies needs such a biosemiotic framework if it
is to keep from wandering in hermeneutical circles!

I also want to conlude this blurb by tying it back to
Reilly Jones' recent Extropians prophecies about "The
Culture Of Death". Make no mistake, the way Reilly
presents it, this is an organized conspiracy of
compost-modernist philosophers and a parasitical
political-entertainment class that wants, as a
radical group from the 70s (The Last Poets) once put
it, to implement a Global-Brain regulatory regime
where "automatic, push-button, remote-control,
synthetic genetics commands your soul", a
deterministic hedonism that erases the distinction
between life & death... 

Well, in a pluralistic universe there are always
going to be conflicting forces making contrary
predictions about the results of some
less-than-perfect epistemological approach. It seems,
to me, simplistic and even dualistic, to see the
current situation as some eschatological Armageddon
between supposedly 'organized' forces of Good and
Evil. I see, not an abstract population being drawn
and quartered by polarities but, instead, a
*natural-historic* host of individuals enacting this
drama under some 'global laws', but mostly 'local
rules', autopoietically self-maintaining the
potentialities in an unpredictable but robust and
ongoing, middle-out way (also known as the Tao).

Yes, that's the question. If the fetus acquires human rights, we can't  
abort him, because he have fatal defects or will come to birth even in  
these instances. If we justified an abortion even in these instances, we  
are murders of human beings and justified a selection of humans to kill  
handicapped people.

I think, a fetus isn't a human being with a free will; it's a part of the  
mother in his first 0 to 100 or 180 days. A fetus is a being with the  
potential to be an human being with human right(s) in the future.

I think that people who think in that way don't really know the holocaust.  
They belittle and play down the holocaust; the jews in Nazi germany have  
hadn't teoretical human rights like the fetus. Jews i Nazi germany have  
had human rights like other human beings and the Nazis *have denied* this
human rights. A fetus is only for a small group of foe of abortions a  
human being.

Sincerely,
N. Myowna .

I maintain that the genetic code is digital, its interpretation and execution 
are too. When a ribosome in a cell finds 3 cytosine bases in a row in 
messenger RNA that means "place a proline molecule as the next amino acid in 
the linear sequence of the protein you're building". That's exactly what it 
means, that's all it means, and that's precisely what it does.

But that's a good thing if the analog-digital distinction is bogus. It is.

Sounds nice, but I can't think of even one example where it's true.

No, it still has meaning, it means that it's pointless to make distinctions 
where none exist and if you understand computation then you understand 
everything, including God's source code.

Dear Friends,

	British author and lecturer Anthony Blake (The Intelligent Enneagram, 
Shambhala 1996) is circulating the note below for comments 
and possible co-participants in events exploring the theme 
of communicating with higher intelligence.


COMMUNICATION WITH HIGHER INTELLIGENCE

Below is a sketch of a perspective on the theme of higher 
intelligence which we might address in some future event. 

The idea is that our understanding of communication with
higher intelligence must depend on our view of what that
intelligence 'is'. John G. Bennett [The Dramatic Universe,
4 vol] spent considerable time opening up this question,
and I have tried to follow some of his remarks to the
effect that now we can address what this intelligence is in
a way that was not possible before. Certainly we can at
least separate out the background of religious belief
(though not forget it). 

You may easily see that this sketch could be the basis of
an interesting book, if any of us had the time to devote to
it. 

It is also offered here as a stimulus for thinking of people with
insights into these questions, who might be persuaded to take part in a
seminar devoted to them, or some other similar gathering.



15 Hypotheses

A. The first group concerns the hypothesis of higher intelligence as a
human potential.

       1.  The hypothesis of higher faculties at work
       within human beings generally but which most of us
       are not in touch with, largely clustered around (a)
       conscience (moral order and will), and (b) intuition
       (direct perception, intelligence). It is proposed
       that accessing such faculties can make our
       intelligence higher (more moral, or more high
       powered).

       2. The hypothesis of exceptional people, or
       genius, i.e., higher faculties which exist in only a
       few people. It is sometimes avowed that what we need
       most is the cultivation and utilisation of genius.
       This also can tie in with the future bioengineering
       of higher intelligence.

       3. The hypothesis of co-operative intelligence. If
       and when people 'coalesce' their individual
       intelligences, through consultation, Bohmian
       dialogue, or other techniques, then a higher order
       can emerge. 

       4.  The hypothesis that artificial intelligence and
       advanced computing will link in the future not only
       indirectly with human modes of social interaction
       (e.g., the internet) but directly with personal
       perception and congnition (enhanced real world
       perception and mental capacity, virtual reality).

       5. The combined hypothesis of a special group of
       people (still basically human) in whom higher
       intelligence is embodied. This is the assertion of a
       'hidden directorate', or hidden masters, who
       influence human affairs through 'sensitive'
       intermediaries. Along with this may be added the
       postulate of an intrinsic social order of
       intelligence.

B. The second group postulates an independent class of entities as the
higher intelligence.

       6. The hypothesis of the noosphere. In this
       hypothesis, the natural evolution of the planet
       produces a realm of intelligence that is
       independent of the human population, hence, that
       there is an 'Overmind', Gaia, or some such, arising
       out of physical laws.

       7. The hypothesis of superplanetary but still
       limited intelligences, that the solar system, the
       galaxy, etc., are in some sense, on some scale,
       intelligent entities.

       8.  The hypothesis of supernatural intelligence and
       agency involved in evolution and/or in revelation to
       chosen human beings. We note here the two-fold form
       this takes in terms of 'angels' or 'messengers'
       (religion) and a creative or guiding demiurgic intelligence.

       9. The hypothesis of extraterrestrial intelligence,
       ascribed to highly advanced beings of other
       planetary systems or dimensions.

       10.  The combined hypothesis of planetary destiny,
       in which it is proposed that every planet with life
       has an ordained destiny differing from any other. 


C. The last group of hypotheses concerns intelligence as 'hidden in
time'.

       11. The hypothesis of the ancestral wisdom. This
       ancient hypothesis ascribes wisdom or higher
       intelligence to the corpus of the ancestors, from
       whom we may receive guidance.

       12. The hypothesis of intelligence as belonging to
       the future. In this hypothesis, higher intelligence
       is positioned in the future, though a future of a
       special kind. For example, in a cross-over concept
       between hypotheses, some people explain some of the ET
       phenomena as we ourselves coming from our own
       future.

       14. The hypothesis of higher intelligence as the
       fastest rate of becoming and as belonging to the
       present instant. This is the rarest form of belief
       in higher intelligence. 

       15. The combined hypothesis of higher intelligence
       as time itself. In this hypothesis, an attempt is
       made to combine all other hypotheses and begin from
       a starting point that does not distinguish human
       forms of intelligence from others. 


D. What remains

There is an open area concerning the 'fact' that higher intelligence is
itself limited and supposes a higher order still. In this, we might also
consider that our very idea of 'higher' might be called into question.
Some evolutionary biologists say that we cannot even call human
intelligence 'higher' than that of any other species.

An obligation is something one assumes, unless it is a negative 
obligation like the obligation not to harm others. I have not chosen to 
assume responsibility for people I don't know who live thousands of 
miles away. If this "obligation" is foisted on me, it is slavery. 

You can do as you please to help people in any way you wish. I really 
don't see why you care what I do or don't do.

Dear Friends,


	British author and lecturer Anthony Blake (The Intelligent Enneagram, 
Shambhala 1996) is circulating the note below for comments 
and possible co-participants in events exploring the theme 
of communicating with higher intelligence.


COMMUNICATION WITH HIGHER INTELLIGENCE

Below is a sketch of a perspective on the theme of higher 
intelligence which we might address in some future event. 

The idea is that our understanding of communication with
higher intelligence must depend on our view of what that
intelligence 'is'. John G. Bennett [The Dramatic Universe,
4 vol] spent considerable time opening up this question,
and I have tried to follow some of his remarks to the
effect that now we can address what this intelligence is in
a way that was not possible before. Certainly we can at
least separate out the background of religious belief
(though not forget it). 

You may easily see that this sketch could be the basis of
an interesting book, if any of us had the time to devote to
it. 

It is also offered here as a stimulus for thinking of people with
insights into these questions, who might be persuaded to take part in a
seminar devoted to them, or some other similar gathering.



15 Hypotheses

A. The first group concerns the hypothesis of higher intelligence as a
human potential.

       1.  The hypothesis of higher faculties at work
       within human beings generally but which most of us
       are not in touch with, largely clustered around (a)
       conscience (moral order and will), and (b) intuition
       (direct perception, intelligence). It is proposed
       that accessing such faculties can make our
       intelligence higher (more moral, or more high
       powered).

       2. The hypothesis of exceptional people, or
       genius, i.e., higher faculties which exist in only a
       few people. It is sometimes avowed that what we need
       most is the cultivation and utilisation of genius.
       This also can tie in with the future bioengineering
       of higher intelligence.

       3. The hypothesis of co-operative intelligence. If
       and when people 'coalesce' their individual
       intelligences, through consultation, Bohmian
       dialogue, or other techniques, then a higher order
       can emerge. 

       4.  The hypothesis that artificial intelligence and
       advanced computing will link in the future not only
       indirectly with human modes of social interaction
       (e.g., the internet) but directly with personal
       perception and congnition (enhanced real world
       perception and mental capacity, virtual reality).

       5. The combined hypothesis of a special group of
       people (still basically human) in whom higher
       intelligence is embodied. This is the assertion of a
       'hidden directorate', or hidden masters, who
       influence human affairs through 'sensitive'
       intermediaries. Along with this may be added the
       postulate of an intrinsic social order of
       intelligence.

B. The second group postulates an independent class of entities as the
higher intelligence.

       6. The hypothesis of the noosphere. In this
       hypothesis, the natural evolution of the planet
       produces a realm of intelligence that is
       independent of the human population, hence, that
       there is an 'Overmind', Gaia, or some such, arising
       out of physical laws.

       7. The hypothesis of superplanetary but still
       limited intelligences, that the solar system, the
       galaxy, etc., are in some sense, on some scale,
       intelligent entities.

       8.  The hypothesis of supernatural intelligence and
       agency involved in evolution and/or in revelation to
       chosen human beings. We note here the two-fold form
       this takes in terms of 'angels' or 'messengers'
       (religion) and a creative or guiding demiurgic intelligence.

       9. The hypothesis of extraterrestrial intelligence,
       ascribed to highly advanced beings of other
       planetary systems or dimensions.

       10.  The combined hypothesis of planetary destiny,
       in which it is proposed that every planet with life
       has an ordained destiny differing from any other. 


C. The last group of hypotheses concerns intelligence as 'hidden in
time'.

       11. The hypothesis of the ancestral wisdom. This
       ancient hypothesis ascribes wisdom or higher
       intelligence to the corpus of the ancestors, from
       whom we may receive guidance.

       12. The hypothesis of intelligence as belonging to
       the future. In this hypothesis, higher intelligence
       is positioned in the future, though a future of a
       special kind. For example, in a cross-over concept
       between hypotheses, some people explain some of the ET
       phenomena as we ourselves coming from our own
       future.

       13.  The Omega Point theory of Frank J. Tipler, in
       which the future intelligence of general universe
       can reach into and redeem the past.

       14. The hypothesis of higher intelligence as the
       fastest rate of becoming and as belonging to the
       present instant. This is the rarest form of belief
       in higher intelligence. 

       15. The combined hypothesis of higher intelligence
       as time itself. In this hypothesis, an attempt is
       made to combine all other hypotheses and begin from
       a starting point that does not distinguish human
       forms of intelligence from others. 


D. What remains

There is an open area concerning the 'fact' that higher intelligence is
itself limited and supposes a higher order still. In this, we might also
consider that our very idea of 'higher' might be called into question.
Some evolutionary biologists say that we cannot even call human
intelligence 'higher' than that of any other species.

This smells fishy to me.  Of COURSE colonialism is good for the colonists.
British (ex) colonists have done swimmingly.  Better than the French and
the Spanish, even.  But what about the natives?  You can't just invade
someone else's country and then justify it by saying "Hey, look, it sure
was good for us colonists."

Colonialism is bad for the natives.  Let's stick to eliminating
authoritarianism and promoting freedom, eh?

Your articles are memetic... and they're certainly political...  but
somehow you seem to think that you're clearing away pemes rather than
replacing them with your own.

Your meme, which happens to be political, has several traits which make it
fairly adaptable.  It appeals to other deep memes, notably freedom (in this
case, from pemes), self-ownership, and levels of development.  It
circumvents serious criticism with Peme Rule 12:  "Any human who attempts
to question, attack, or expose any deep peme shall be ignored, ridiculed,
or vilified by other humans."  It emphasizes the malicious nature of pemes,
thus harnessing the very deep meme of self-preservation.

Consider this:  if you were to erase all political memes from your mind
tomorrow, you would have no political opinion, because you would have no
ideas about politics.  No freedom thoughts, no authoritarian thoughts, no
thoughts at all about government and/or its value to society (if any).
That's what it means to have no memes:  you have no ideas.

Freedom is a peme, too, ya know.  It's especially adaptable because its
meaning is so ambiguous, yet it seems to appeal to everyone.  We get
freedom of speech, freedom of choice, freedom from choice, peme-freedom,
meme-freedom, free-markets, economic freedom (a term sadly appropriated by
communists), degrees of freedom, and free energy...  all from the same word.

So I put it to you again:  you're selling a meme, and it's political.  I
conclude that you're selling me a peme.  You're not crazy... or even wrong,
per se.  But you aren't eliminating pemes...  you're just replacing them
with deeper ones which aren't open to criticism.

(If you now go on to tell me that I operate at peme freedom level 1, you
will have missed the point of this post.)

I havent' dug into Netscape 4 deep enough but I've circumvented this
problem (and many other security-related issues) by not using my browser
for E-mail. Eudora 3.0 and 4.0 both have fine interaction with any browser
you choose and you keep control on reactions to E-mail. Pegasus is also a
fine E-mail program and still freeware.

I hope this helps bit, if you keep gettting problems mail me off-list and
I'll have a look at the security setup of the latest Netscape releases.

Regards & best wishes

I agree. However asking someone to help you helping others is not
'foisting' it is a respectful request or a plea. You still keep control.

 >don't see why you care what I do or don't do.

Maybe Mark Miloscia is hoping that he can convince you of his point of
view, by presenting his case to you in a resonable manner based on respect
for you as an individual. Maybe Mark Miloscia is hoping that if he
convinces you this will benefit the people he is trying to help himself. As
long as no coercion is involved it seems to me that figuring ou ways te
prevent people from dying, even if we don't know them and they are living
thousand of miles away, is a very Extropian thing to do.

Respectfully,
Arjen Kamphuis

A while ago there was a discussion about the role of plastic foam in H-bombs;
I think I've deleted most of the messages, but over the weekend I was able
to collect my copy of Richard Rhode's book 'Dark Sun: The Making Of The
Hydrogen Bomb', and look up what he said on the subject.

He claims that the plastic on the original H-bomb test was placed around the
inside of the bomb casing, not on the fusion core itself as I've read
elsewhere. The X-rays from the initiator turn the plastic to plasma, which
re-radiates X-rays onto the U-238 tamper, creating a rocket effect which
implodes the fusion core. This also compresses the fission trigger in the
middle of the fusion core, which explodes, compressing the fusion material
from the inside as well, and igniting it.

Interestingly, he also says that most of the yield in that test came from
the U-238, as the fusion byproducts converted it into other, unstable,
elements which then fissioned.

While I can't vouch for technical accuracy, I'd recommend both of Rhodes' 
books to those interested in nuclear weapons technology.

Fetus is not people. Even a newborn infant is not a human being, just a
larva bearing the potential to become one. For the record, if there was no
Singularity eugenics would be a singularly great idea. Uravnilovka just

Oh, so now it's part of the mother. By the DNA identity it's also part of

Maybe we are trying to apply the inapplicable? And inasmuch can laying on

Theoretical human rights is just what they are: theoretical. If there is
no muscle to enforce them, as well you just can go off to hunt the snark.
Which means, you'd bloody make sure you actually have the muscle.

A self-defined class of people attempted extermination of a much more

As the lattermentioned were unable to prevent the abovementioned (well,
they were Untermenschen), the action almost succeeded. Now what do we
learn from that?

You are making some excellent points, the ideal we strive for is
just as you mentioned, workers with the same general skill set
freely associating to leverage economic value. 

In the 18 years I've held a union card I've never once seen any
govt state or local intervene on behalf of a union, quite the
opposite, I've seen congressional imposition of exactly what the
company wanted, I've seen the president arbitrarily disband a union
(which subsequently reformed). I've never once seen the democratic
party do anything for organized labor which is why I'm one of those
who wants to cut their funding.

We survive by staying cutting edge, and rely on the courts to
support existing contracts.

We're on the same page, we recently re-opened our revamped
apprenticeship program for communications electricians, besides the
usual cabling (including fiber) and telephony classes there are
classes on packet switching, and on LANS/WANS etc. The goal is also
to develop 100% computer literacy to the WIN95 level. Established
within the new infrastructure are programs to review and upgrade
this as necessary. This is paid for by monies contributed by all
union contractors. This program is also open to all existing
Journeymen as continual education. We are also trying to interest
individual companies (I work for Ameritech the midwest RBOC) to
sponsor additional classes on a Sat (nonpaid) basis. I have also
brought up the fact that it would be trivial for us to turn out our
own CNE's, etc. (I've run 10 Novell servers for nearly a decade)

The idea is to maintain our status by being the best in the
industry, period.

You should have seen our last contract negotiation, it started out
with sitting down, opening up the laptop, calling up the Excel
spreadsheets and commencing with " I thought we'd start by going
over the company financial's (Ameritech negotiation talks were
separate) including the recent 6% dividend increase to
stockholders, the 2 billion stock buyback and the 2-1 split. then
we could look at management compensation over the last three
years."

We settled for a nice three year deal at an average increase of
4.4% (we are very reasonable).

I only caught half of his talk, but was very impressed, if only

Does Dr Hawking have an E-mail address? A snailmail address? I
would be delighted to guest sponsor him (basic) as a member of the

Imagine Dr Hawking at the EXI conference!

An excellent point, Christopher Reeve has done an excellent job as
well, I nominate both for "Extropian of the year." (maybe Mr Reeve
would like to join us as well.)

I am proabaly a little late on this but you may want to check out

Rhodes was somewhat contradictory about this because he also said that the  
plastic foam was used to keep pressure spikes from destroying key components 
of the bomb before they can do their job, in fact "Dark Sun" is the book 
where I found the quote that I posted on the subject.

I found another interesting quotation that gives more support to my hunch 
that a light fluid like that produced from foam could not evenly compress a  
heavy plasma fluid from Uranium, but that X rays could. It's from Kip Thorne's  
recent book "Black Holes and Time Warps". Thorne never worked on weapons but 
he is one of the world's greatest experts on neutron stars and the accretion 
disks around Black Holes, and they have many of the same conditions as 
H bombs.

The Soviet physicist Borisovich Yakov Zeldovich (who worked on the Russian  
H Bomb) proposed a model for the accretion diskaround Black Holes that 
involved X rays compressing gas. Thorne says this on page 241:

 "This picture of the flow of gas and X rays disturbed me. I knew full well  
  that on Earth, if one tries to hold a dense fluid such as liquid mercury up  
  be means of a less dense fluid such as water below it, tongues of mercury  
  quickly eat their way down into the water, the mercury goes whooshing down,   
  and the water goes whooshing up. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh- Taylor  
  instability. In Zeldovich's picture, the X rays were like the low density  
  water and the gas was like high density mercury. Wouldn't tongues of gas  
  eat their way into the X rays, and wouldn't the gas then fall freely down  
  those tongues? A detailed calculation with the laws of physics would tell  
  me whether this happened, but such a calculation would be very complex and  
  time consuming: so rather than calculate, I asked Zeldovich one afternoon  
  in 1969, when we were discussing physics in his apartment in Moscow."

 "Zeldovich looked a bit uncomfortable when I rased the question, but his  
  answer was firm: "No Kip, that doesn't happen. There are no tongues into 
  the X rays. The flow of gas is stable. " How do you know Borisovich Yakov?"  
  I asked. Amazingly, I could not get an answer. It seemed clear that 
  Zeldovich or somebody had done a detailed calculation or experiment showing  
  that X rays can push hard on a gas without Rayleigh- Taylor tongues   
  destroying the push, but Zeldovich could not point me to any such 
  calculation or experiment in the published literature, nor would he 
  describe for me the detailed physics that goes on. How uncharacteristic of   
  him!"

 "A few months later I was hiking in the high Sierras in California with  
  Stirling Colgate. (Colgate is one of the best American experts on the flows   
  of fluids and radiation and was deeply involved in the late stages of the  
  American superbomb effort, and he was one of the Livermore physicists who  
  had simulated a star's implosion on a computer). As we hiked I posed to  
  Colgate the same question I had asked of Zeldovich, and he gave me the same  
  answer: The flow is stable; the gas cannot escape the force of the X rays  
  by developing tongues. "How do you know, Stirling?" I asked "It has been  
  shown" he replied. "Where can I find the calculations or experiments?" I  
  asked. "I don't know... ""

 "That's very peculiar," I told Stirling. "Zeldovich told me precisely the  
  same thing- the flow is stable. But he, like you, would not point to any  
  proofs" "Oh! That's fascinating. So Zeldovich really knew" said Stirling."

 "And then I knew as well. I hadn't wanted to know. But the conclusion was  
  unavoidable. The Teller - Ulam idea must be the use of X rays emitted in  
  the first microsecond of the fission (atom bomb) trigger to heat, help  
  compress, and ignite the superbomb's fusion fuel. That this is, indeed, part 
  of the Teller-Ulam idea was confirmed in the 1980's in several unclassified  
  American publications, otherwise I wouldn't mention it here."
             

        >Interestingly, he also says that most of the yield in that test came 
        >from the U-238, as the fusion byproducts converted it into other, 
        >unstable, elements which then fissioned.
            

When a SLOW neutron, such as one from a fission reaction, hits U238 it does  
not split, instead it absorbs the neutron and turns into U239, this has a  
half life of 24 minutes and it decays into neptunium 239, this has a half life 
of 2.3 days and it decays into plutonium 239, and plutonium 239 has a half
life of 14,000 years and works  great in bombs. This is fine for manufacturing 
plutonium but far too slow to play a part in a nuclear explosion.

However, when a FAST neutron, like those produced in a fusion reaction hits 
U238 it will split and make lots of energy. So in an H bomb about 70% of the 
energy comes from the fission of common U238, but that wouldn't be possible 
without the fast neutrons from the fusion reaction.

Over the near future short-term, I doubt if he will effect any
substantial change, unless he totally embraces the concept and makes
it a crusade, and why should he? Even he if he were able to show many
the Extropian light, the change he caused would not come in time to
help him.

Perhaps if some powerful TV news figure were to embrace Extropianism
and use Hawking as a vehicle, then you might have something. Until
then, these ideas are likely to continue to elude the conscious grasp
of the vast  majority of Westerners. like picnickers atop a
leviathian, oblivious to the monster beneath them.

No,  Hal, the major news media is the hammer which pounds modern
societal nails, and until Extropian ideas become the nails, we will be
on the fringes, no matter the occasional intellectual ponderings, even
if  hawking *is* a pop culture buzzword. Now if Hawking were to sign
up for cryonics, and go public in a big way, that might make a
stir....

At least in the U.S., it is a felony to participate in a conspiracy. If
you make
an exhortation in an e-mail that somebody else do simething illegal, and
the person enetes into a discussion with and subsequently performs that
illegal act, then you have technically committed conspiracy. I'm less
clear
on whether or not the other participants in the discussion are also guilty

of consciracy, but they might be. In light of this, please hold such

How do you know that? Whatever happened to Dynamic Optimism and such?

But aside from that:
Why is it so hard for some people on this list to believe that there are
people on this planet who would do things not because they will benefit
from them personally but because they _believe_ or _feel_ it is the right
thing to do? Because they believe there are things more important than them
personally (like the wellbeing of the human species as opposed to their own
wellbeing). I know this can also lead to very negative things but that rule
applies to all powerfull tools.

Even if you yourself would never, in your entire lifetime, do something if
it does not benefit you in some way would you at least accepts the fact
that there are people who do? Why is that so hard?

I do not mean to critizise anyone personal here, everyone must do what they
feel is right, but this 'why would he do that, he doesn't get anything for
it' attitude is not very positive minded IMHO. Isn't the darinwistic
'struggle for life' thing something we wish to transcend? It may be
impossible, but should we at least not try?

Since it isn't illegal right now for private citizens to clone, then it can't
be conspiracy to do so right now.

Besides, there can be a decent case made that the federal prosecution of
public email discussions as conspiracy, if and when it becomes illegal, for
cloning in private could be found to be capricious enforcement, since the past
few years millions, if not billions of email messages have been sent across
the US, and across our internaitonal borders which contained the
RC4-3lines-PERL encryption algorythm. That they have not prosecuted one person
who engaged in this mass act of civil disobedience is a significant precedent
against their use of public mail list messages as evidence of conspiracy. That
this discussion is public, and not private, indicates that this is more of a
forum for public protest than secretive conspiracy.

Christopher Fedeli wrote 3/7/98: <I've noticed a strong tendency for all
memetically minded thinkers to keep clinging to some notion of the
metaphysical "I".  How can one accept that all of our traits came to be the
way that they are by the evolution of genes and memes, and yet still think
that somewhere 'in there' is a "me" who is capable of exercising some
control over the process?

To take a famous example, Richard Dawkins argues that humans can "rebel 
against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."  He gives the example that

every time we use contraception, we are rebelling against the tyranny of
genes who want us to procreate.  But who is really rebelling in this
example?  To me, this seems like an case of the meme for contraception
winning a big victory in the battle for survival against certain genes. 
But to hypothesize a magical "self" that lurks around in our brains,
deciding which memes and which genes will exercise influence over our
behaviors at which time is a joke that no reflective thinker could suffer. 
        
 
Will anyone argue differently?>

And Frederick Mann replied 3/7/98: <I agree that there is no magical "self"
or "I" in reality.  However, in the same way that I can load a program
called
"I" into a computer, some complex brain circuitry could evolve and call
itself "I."  And at some point this circuitry could achieve sufficient
complexity to spontaneously produce the epiphenomenon of free will
or volition.>

I know this seems to be difficult for many individuals to grasp, but there
really is a subjective "I".  Subjectivity is an unpleasant fact of nature
for scientists because there is no way to study it, measure it, experiment
on it, or theorize about it.  So all too many of them take the
intellectually lazy or dippy way out of their conundrum by pretending it
away.  It never works, of course.  Subjectivity is just one of those things
in reality that is a given, there is an "I" that is just as real as
external objects that we can measure.  Free will or volition is not an
epiphenomenon, it is real.  The brain does not work the same way a computer
does in at least one very important respect.  Information does not exist in
the absence of an "I", a knower who is distinct from the known.  "I" can
exchange information with "my" environment, with external objects, with
other subjective selves, even with "my" own body, in that it is an external
object to "me."  However, "I" cannot exchange information with myself, with
"I".  "I" cannot be both subject and object, both knower and known.  When
Socrates said "know thyself," he could only be talking about knowing your
body as it is an object to you and about your relations with other selves
and the external environment.  He could not be talking about knowing your
own self, your "I".  You don't know yourself, you don't exchange
information with yourself, you simply decide.  Decisions are the atmosphere
of subjectivity.  The protection of volitional freedom is of primary
importance because of this.

Perhaps a consideration that "selfish genes" and "memes" are a load of
hooey is in order if you are forced to pretend that subjectivity isn't
real, or that there is no real "I".  Perhaps some deeper reflection is in
order.

Predictions, like biological theories, are if-then in nature.  If the trend

of death prevailing in the long run, I believe the forces of the culture of
life, which, as you allude to, tend to be particularistic, will prevail.  I
am dynamically optimistic, but this does not mean they will prevail without
a nasty fight.  Entropy never goes away, nor does nihilism nor does
tyranny.  The fight is forever.  The Tao is squarely within the liquid
realm of polycentric political structures.  As long as we keep recentering
here when we drift to the ordered realm or the chaotic realm, we'll be
fine.  "Natural-historic host of individuals enacting this drama under some
global law" sounds like Hegel's "cunning of reason," life evolving "at the
edge of chaos."  We must be active, we cannot all fall asleep and hope the
laws will bail us out, they won't.

Well, certainly some evolutionary biologists do not possess higher
intelligence than that of any other species if this is their hypothesis.

"The fact that higher intelligence is itself limited and supposes a higher
order still" is contained in the thought of Anselm from the eleventh
century, and is subsumed within his ontological proof for the existence of
God.  A good reference work on the subtleties of the argument and on
previous attempts to refute it can be found in Charles Hartshorne's
"Anselm's Discovery" (1965).

The D of I is America's Articles of Incorporation, the Constitution is
merely its By-Laws.  The By-Laws have no meaning without organic reference
to the Articles of Incorporation.  When the Supreme Court makes decisions
that are cut free from the D of I, it is acting as a law unto itself with
no legitimacy at all, simply brute force *if* it can get the executive and

You are correct about it being an improper decision and why it was
improper.  You are incorrect that there is any 'right to choose to murder
an unborn child'.  Prior to Roe v. Wade, it was unthinkable.  Roe v. Wade
stepped in and redefined human in a most barbaric way for convenience's or
expediency's sake.  The Justices deemed consequence-free sex to be an
equivalent value to the freedom to murder the weak.

Naturally you should be voting against abortion as being antithetical to
the values of life.  The atrocities being committed by the government for
the last twenty-five years have stained the country and undermined any
moral logic America once had in service to those values of life.  It's too
bad the Supreme Court has never allowed voters to determine the definition
of human in their separate jurisdictions, to see which consequences are
most favorable to life.

The constitution is just theory on paper.  The guarantee of rights is
dependent on the moral fabric of the ruling class.  Certainly unborn
children (developing selves) have no rights not to be killed.

AK: <if you get it in your head to interfere in any way with anyone else
who is excercising their right _not_ to have a child you'll be in big
trouble.>

Instead of "exercising their right not to have a child," you really mean
"exercising their right to murder their unborn child."  Of course, there
are many, many individuals worldwide who cannot in good conscience grant
legitimacy to such a horrible thing.  You'll have to get us all "in big
trouble," and we'll resist in order to save the values of life from your
brutality.  You may try to ghettoize us, as you suggested, but we won't
make it easy for you.

AK: <the commercial usage of consious beings is totally unacceptable.
That's just my opinion.>

Hmm...  Too bad it's "just an opinion," you will never counter John Clark's
much more coherent case that he made for the commercial usage of conscious
beings being positively good, to be sought for.  You have no basis to fight
him, opinion or feeling does not stand up against certainty based on a
coherent worldview (even though that worldview is entirely based on false
metaphysical presuppositions of total digital existence).  John and his
fellow travelers will prevail against you unless you can argue your opinion
sensibly and tie it to a coherent worldview based on true presuppositions.

AK: <50 years from now someone else might be at the top of the foodchain,
they could be fully _digital_, and they'll have web-acces to Exi archives.
And they will be aware of you utter disrespect for non-meat, non-analog
consious systems. Think about it.>

I'm not concerned about mythical "fully digital" conscious entities in the
future.  I'm worried about fully digital killer machines set into motion by
conscious entities.  The conscious entities will see my arguments for
protecting the rights of the weak against the depredations of the strong as
potentially crimping their style.  They will not like me and I will not
like them.  So what's new?

AK: <When you think about it rationally (whatever that still means in this
context...) it seems to me clearly immoral to allow all kinds of suffering
when we have the means to end it (or most of it).>

Does this include the suffering of the many individuals who are in terrible
pain helplessly watching the legal slaughter of the innocents?  Why isn't
it immoral to allow this suffering to go on?

AK: <Under Dutch law the the status of fetus lasts untill several months (I
have no exact figures) before the child can survive outside the womb.  The
overwhelming majority of Europeans citizens agrees with this law as being
ethical (are they all primitive barbarians?).>

The overwhelming majority of American citizens agree that European citizens
are primitive barbarians and have been for most of this century, we've had
to bail them out twice already from their barbaric squabbling.  They
exported their barbaric ideas over here after WW II and within a generation
our slide into moral decay began in earnest.

AK: <On one side we have a group of people claiming that one is human after
conception because 'something' happens then even though they don't don't
know what that something is.  On the other side we have a group of people
saying that somewhere during the growthproces a fetus becomes a human even
though they are not sure when precisely.

Neither side seems to be able to bring 100% solid scientific or ethical
'proof' for their opinion (at least I have't heard it). It then becomes a
question of who's is going to force their opinion of who. No-one is forced
to have an abortion (AFAIK). I respect the fact that some people would
never have an abortion because they feel 'it would not be right'. That's
OK. However, I do not think that gives anyone the right to enforce their
opinions on others.  The _problem_ is of course that those who are against
abortion feel that the fetus being aborted is a human who is killed based
on the opinion of others.  And then we're full circle.  I do not know if
it's possible to break this so I'll choose for individual freedom of
choice.>

This seems like a fairly reasonable recap.  A couple of points to ponder. 
You'll choose for individual freedom of choice, do you mean the unborn
child's freedom of choice?  I didn't think so.  The developing self is weak
and the mother is strong, not an equal standing, and the damage to society
being able to uphold the values of life is due in part to the very obvious
fact that the mother lays down her guardianship role, the keystone of civil
society, to "choose" to murder her own unborn child.  When the keystone
falls, society falls.  When mothers don't value their own unborn children,
no moral logic persuades anyone to value any children at all.

When you say "one is human after conception because 'something' happens
then even though they don't know what that something is," you are
misrepresenting my position.  Conception initiates the development of a
self.  From conception onward, we can alter the environmental factors and
the genetic makeup that largely determine individuality.  Before
conception, any alteration to environmental factors or genetic makeup
associated with any constituent biological precursors are allowed because
there is no assurance that conception will occur.  It is only when
conception occurs that "selection" has taken place - success.  We are no
longer tampering with our own developing self, we are tampering with
another developing self without that self's consent.  Because it is without
consent, society has a right, through the political process, to ensure that
the tampering is in the best interest of the unborn child according to the
wisdom embodied in society's ideals and accumulated experience.  It is a
similar situation to how society deals with resident non-citizens and with
individuals mentally or physical unable to enter into contracts.

HN: <Abortion laws restrict abortions by trimester.  Please reference a

you argue that they might as well be.  You can't legally find a place that

risk of prosecution.  Roe vs. Wade did not legalize what you discribe, even
if what you are discribing is actually happening in the same clinics that
are legalized by Roe vs. Wade.>

Let me clarify this.  I am going to quote from "Before the Shooting Begins"
by James Davison Hunter (1994) pgs. 247-249:  "In 1973 Justice Harry
Blackmun wrote the majority opinion for the Supreme Court, arguing that a
woman's decision to terminate or continue her pregnancy is a fundamental
right, part of a 'right of privacy.' [...] In Roe itself, abortion was
proscribed after viability, yet after viability (measured typically at the
end of the sixth month) states must permit abortions that are necessary to
preserve maternal life or health.  In Roe's companion decision, Doe v.
Bolton, the court defined 'health' as 'all factors... relevant to the
well-being of the patient - including emotional, psychological, familial
[factors] and the woman's age.'  [...] Subsequent decisions not only
reaffirmed Roe but extended its interpretation, overturning virtually every
effort to restrict the practice of abortion.  [Examples incl. Planned
Parenthood v. Danforth (1976), City of Akron v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, Inc. (1983), Thornburgh v. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1986).]  What was so unique about this
evolving law was that it forbade *any* state regulation of abortion for the
sake of preserving the fetus until viability.  Even after viability there
would be no federal regulation oriented toward protecting the fetus until
birth.  [...] In practice, then, a pregnant woman could get an abortion at
any time during pregnancy if she desired it and if a single doctor (who
might be the one performing the abortion) judged the abortion necessary to
preserve her health (broadly construed to include a notion of well-being). 
In sum, Roe was a 'compromise.'  It did not technically permit abortion on
demand for the full nine months.  On the other hand, by defining abortion
as a 'fundamental right' and striking down efforts 'to protect the
developing fetus' in challenges subsequent to Roe, the Supreme Court did
provide a foundation for the practice of abortion on demand for the full
nine months."

is why Mr. Jones objects to seeing AI's as 'human' since they will be much

Digital v. analog is useful up to a point, in that in our computer-besotted
age, that's the metaphor "in the air" that gives rise to kooky notions of
ourselves as information processors, just as previous ages foolishly
thought of us as mechanical clocks or thermodynamic heat engines or
cybernetic feedback controllers.  As a species, we are always trying to
turn ourselves inside out, to externalize concretely what is in us.  We
produce the theoretical and technological systems, then turn around and
say, yup, that's us.

The digital v. analog metaphor stands in place of whatever is really going
on at the ontological level, which in a very clumsy fashion, since I have
not developed the proper concepts for it yet, I will attempt to get across.
 The digital stands in for the succession of indivisible Planck moments,
the passage of time.  The analog stands in for the infinitely divisible
atemporal microcausality leading up to the selection of the next Planck
moment, the formation of continuous space.  Consciousness is made up of
both parts.  Higher consciousness developed with improved memory, both
genetic and conceptual, but from the beginning of its evolution,
consciousness had access to the atemporal microcausality in the
backwards-in-time direction to develop purposes independent of the purposes
given it.  A purely digital mechanism cannot access this, it would be,
metaphorically, memory only, not imagination.  Correspondingly, "muddy"
thinking is the only thinking possible since imagination precedes and
guides rationality.

Gary47 wrote 3/7/98: <Obligations are enforced by ones own conscience. 
Moral imperatives must not be enforced by the state.>

Laws are theoretical moral imperatives, obviously.  Enforcement of laws is
enforcement of moral imperatives.  Where the subject population has a
highly developed conscience, laws are virtually unnecessary.  Laws
proliferate when consciences are underdeveloped, as in our barbaric time.

G47: <The moral bankruptcy of the welfare state is self-evident, when you
consider that it would not exist without the police power of taxation.  If
it were truly the solution to the problems it proposed to solve, then the
welfare state would be instituted by the voluntary charitable giving of

Obviously, only morally bankrupt voters could have brought the welfare
state into being and they continue to prop it up.  The voters' moral
bankruptcy is not self-evident to them.  This is a big reason abortion is
tolerated.  As to what worked quite well along the voluntary charitable
lines you present, look at the example of the Western Church in the later
Middle Ages.  Nothing has surpassed it yet in this respect.  Taxation was
virtually entirely related to defense and nothing else, and through the
concepts of fealty and homage, taxation was essentially voluntary.

G47: <<Actually, Africa has a long tradition of free markets and
decentralized power. Recent events are a historical aberration.>>

<What Africa actually has is a history of ineffectual statecraft, so the

tribal and strongly communal, so what westerners think of as a free market
and decentralized is not an accurate description.>

Thank you for correcting this bit of historical revisionism.

John Clark wrote 3/7/98: <What somebody does is more important than how

JC: <I have no idea where you got that figure but I have a very strong

John, I have been down to your ontological basement before, to your bits of
information as the foundation of all.  It is false.  Information only
exists when there is a knower and a known.  I assumed you were holding a
harmless religious belief about some "knower" at an ontological level
imbuing bits of substance at the Planck scale, the known, with an
informational status.  You never explicitly made known who the knower was.

Nostalgia for the good ol' pre-politically correct days.  I doubt if your
One World Government, a requirement in order to force legalized abortion on
everyone, will spread civilization.  I think it will spread nihilism and
tyranny.  BTW, the Romans did more to spread civilization and the British
themselves were echoes of that previous civilization.

Interesting food for thought.

Mark Miloscia wrote 3/7/98: <Having obligations (family, social groups,

It seems difficult to believe that such a basic truth has to be articulated
in this day and age.  And without responsibilities, rights lose any
meaning, becoming mere idle wishes and animal desires.

Anton Sherwood wrote about Ian Goddard's holistic claims 3/7/98: <if I read
Brian right, he objects not to your *choice* of primal truth, but to your
claim of priority for one end of the axis - it doesn't matter which end. 
As for me, I think you confuse description... with identity.>

I think you've pegged this correctly.  Neither end has priority, both are
needed in conjunction for existence.  The parallel to my assertion that
nothing purely digital (or binary) can have conscious existence, is that
priority cannot be given only to digital (or what Mr. Goddard calls
atomism), but must be given to holism and atomism equally, and equally in
the form of their conjunction.  Confusing description with identity is what
I mean by "reality exceeds our semantic grasp."

Anton Sherwood wrote 3/6/98: <Relations between a mother and a fetus are
nonconsensual because the latter is incapable of consent - that's obvious. 
But why is this more legitimately a political matter than our relations

As I said, our relations with cats (animal rights) has been cast as a
political question for hundreds of years.  Potted plants, I don't know, you
might ask Prince Charles about this, he talks directly to the source.  I
know there are a lot of tree-huggers in the Northwest, many of whom would
prefer to see an unborn child murdered than a 300-yr old Douglas Fir
chopped down to make toilet paper.

AS: <Well, you know, machines in the real world are analog, just highly
nonlinear.  Now would you mind addressing the issue, rather than derailing
it with analog-chauvinism?>

I don't mean to be chauvinistic, I just don't see that anything purely
digital can access the spatial, wave form of reality, the microcausal
backward-in-time portion (transactional QM interpretation) or pilot wave
(ontological QM interpretation) in the way consciousness does.  The
coordination dynamics of machines are, in fact, essentially the same as the
coordination dynamics of our own motor actions.  But they are not similar
in intentionality, in altering purposes from within the spatial, wave form
of reality.

RJ: <the Constitition said slaves were only counted as 3/5 of a person,

I did get it right.  They were constitutionally less than fully human. 
Then, after the Civil War, they were constitutionally, hey presto! fully
human.  Purely a matter of defining human, just as the abortion matter is.

AS: <What you really mean, I assume, is that you're offended that others

I'm appalled at the on-going holocaust, the slaughter of the innocents.  It

of hand.

AS: <I find genetics a piss-poor criterion for personhood.  Unfortunately,
any objective criterion I can think of (e.g. the Turing Test) is fuzzy, and

I have never claimed that genetics is a criterion for personhood.  The
moment the self begins to develop is what defines human.  The right to life
is binary, this is a useful phrase, thus we have big fights over it instead
of compromises.

RJ: <If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or

AS: <This resembles Ayn Rand's argument against polycentric law.  Might

Interesting observation about Rand, I hadn't thought of it that way.  I
like what Pascal said, might makes right so let's make sure the mighty are
right.  Ability to attract sympathy is important, another way of saying
this is that fraternity and equality are utterly imcompatible ideals. 
Fraternity must trump equality for society to avoid the isolated systems
result.  Polycentrism is closer to fraternity than to equality.

AS: <It's not that I "cannot begin to understand" your position on
abortion; I believe I understand it, but I also believe it's based on

The Supreme Court's arational preference or error of fact is binding on all
those who define human the way I have.  It is tyranny of a most brutal
kind.

AS: <A number of time travel stories touch on the tragedy of erasing
someone (a child, a lover, a hero) from history by preventing their

Time travel is ridiculous.  The staggering number of murders occurring here
and now is what's interesting.

John Clark wrote 3/6/98:
RJ: <If we desensitize our population through education and popular
culture, we can do anything we want.>

JC: <Great, then let's do it!>

This is self-evident barbarism on the tyrannical side of the political
spectrum, the ordered realm.

RJ: <encouraging the entropic view of them as "meat machines.">

JC: <There is nothing entropic about the truth; we are meat machines.>

Machines have no rights, machines may interact in a dumb physical way with
each other, but they do not have relations between subjective "I's" in any
sense.  This is an entropic death-worshipping worldview, no humanity is
contained in it whatsoever.  It is self-fabricated license to murder and
send humans to chop shops.  Again, the premise is inherent in totalitarian
regimes, the ordered realm of despots and tyrants.  Any abhorrent action at
all can be and has been rationalized away with "meat machine" as the
central premise of human life.

JC: <Like nearly  all of the really important things in life I have no
definition for the word "evil", however, if the word has any meaning at all
then those who oppose assisted suicide are evil. Making a person live who
wants to die is as horrendous as making a person die who wants to live,
both are saying that my life is not my own and they can decide my fate,
it's the moral equivalent of murder. Such dangerous monsters should not be
ghettoized, they should be guillotined.>

But John, you are all for late term abortion, you support murder.  Your
embrace of the culture of death blinds you to the fact that assisted
suicide is licensing doctors to murder developing selves of a greater age
than the unborn.  Individuals can die on their own, they just need to wait,
no one is stopping them by not granting doctors a license to murder.  The
whole culture of death is all about the privileged place murder has in
society.  In Oregon, the logic of the statist establishment of
death-worshipping as the official religion means that my tax dollars are
now being reallocated to the poor so they can pay a doctor to murder them
on demand.  I am soiled by this and have no effective recourse except to
move.  I will not move, this is my home, I take my stand here because the
culture of death, through the logic of globalism will be imposed everywhere
just as soon as they can get away with it.  There's no place to run.

When you declare that it is a moral imperative to guillotine opponents to
the culture of death, at least you've dropped that "non-coercion" palaver
that so many others who share your worldview pretend to.  "Non-coercion"
often serves as cover for the purpose of duping what's left of civil
society, while doing as you please willfully heedless of the negative
consequences within society of your actions.  This intentional ignorance of
secondary consequences is what the philosopher David Stove called "autism"
in a quote I posted last March: "...No ideal could be more destructive of
human life than the ideal of non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing
a non-coercive human being is to produce an autistic one."  It is clear
that amongst competing irreconcilable worldviews that someone is going to
be coerced, to try to pretend otherwise is inellectually dishonest or lazy.
 48% of Oregon voters, including me, voted against doctor-assisted suicide,
aka, licensing doctors to murder.  You'd better crank up your guillotine,
because you have a lot of work "cut" out for you.  To you, of course,
you're just pitting one machine against another, a "meat machine." 
Guillotining half my state to you is no different than unplugging a
toaster.

Albert Camus accurately described the nature of society when purpose and
its derivative, values, are absent.  Values are absent in the worldview of
scientific nihilism which denies the presence of purpose in the universe,
and they are absent in John's "everything is digital" universe because raw
values (unmeasured) are not digital.  This quote is from "The Rebel":  "if
we can assert no value whatsoever, everything is permissible and nothing is
important.  There is no pro or con; the murderer is neither right nor
wrong.  One is free to stoke the crematory fires, or to give one's life to
the care of lepers.  Wickedness and virtue are just accident or whim.  We
may then decide not to act at all, which comes down to condoning other
people's murder, plus a little fastidious sorrow over human imperfection. 
Or we may hit upon tragic dilettantism as a substitute for action; in this
case, human lives become counters in a game.  Finally, we may resolve to
undertake some action that is not wholly arbitrary.  In this case, since we
have no higher value to direct our action, we shall aim at efficiency. 
Since nothing is true or false, good or bad, our principle will become that
of showing ourselves to be the most effective, in other words the most
powerful.  And then the world will no longer be divided into the just and
the unjust, but into masters and slaves.  Thus, whichever way we turn in
the depths of negation and nihilism, murder has its privileged position." 
Thus, the digital and the human-as-information-processing-machine worldview
wends it way over to the guillotine sooner or later.

RJ: <Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of
rights?>

JC: <Yes.>
             
RJ: <And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold

JC: <The same person who told you that abortion must be outlawed. The same
person who told you that a baby born without a brain and doomed to die

But, who is that?  I don't get it.

RJ: <What's wrong with commercializing all life, at all stages of

JC: <Nothing.>

Slaves were property, you are promoting the return of slavery here. 
Slavery and abortion really are the same issue of defining human.

RJ: <Just make all life into products in the marketplace, all custom
designed for any use whatsoever?>

JC: <If we did that there would be less misery in the world. Child abuse
would drop dramatically, those who love their children would still do so
and those who don't would nevertheless have reason to treat them well
because you don't deliberately damage an asset that has value.>

But John, in this barbarian nihilistic world, twisted "meat machines" find
the value in an asset (that is, child) to be in the abuse and destruction
itself.  There are always plenty more where that one came from, they're
only machines (products) after all.  Once you're purchased a product you
can do whatever you wish with it, you could practice your guillotining
skills on babies, children, whatever product you desired.  This goes
against the grain of the core ethics of Western Civilization that have
worked well for centuries on end, namely, humans are not to be used as
means because they are ends in themselves.  This would not produce less
misery, only tyranny of the most brutal kind.

Maybe you consider this question trivial, but how exactly do you know when
the self begins to develop?  What does that mean and why does it grant
rights?  Wouldn't you say that the crossing over of the chromosomes during
meiosis of the ova (which occurs *before* contact with spermatazoa) is the
beginning of self-development?  What about if a spermatazoa is partway into
the ovum?  What if you abort an embryo that you know cannot develop past
the size of a couple thousand cells, are you still killing a "developing
self"?  It seems to me you're trying to convince list-members that an
arbitary decision such as what defines human (and therefore what defines
murder) is obvious and concrete(or at least the evolutionary advantages of
a legal system that makes this decision is obvious and concrete).  I'm a
little puzzled by your view, especially considering the logical nature of
most of your other writings.

I have one more question that might shed some light on your view:  Say you
have an ovum that has just been fertilized... it has yet to divide.  It is
also the perfect vehicle for cloning, so you to decide suck out the genetic
material, and insert your own.(lets just assume that this can be done, I
have a feeling it can)  Is this murder?

Sorry, the Declaration of Independece is more of a Divorce Writ, not a marriage
license. It defined why we no longer were members of the British Empire. It
made no mention of the United States of America (indeed, for that political
entity was not to exist for another 16+ years thereafter, and was actually a
succeeding organization to the Congress under the Articles of Confederation.),
so it has very little in relation to the Constitution other than sharing the
same author.

Unfortunately, you have repeatedly refused to point blank come up with any
refutation of my statement that fetuses have no rights. You claim that "'right
to choose to murder an unborn child', Prior to Roe vs. Wade, it was
unthinkable". You are right that it was unthinkable, but not for the reason you
specify. Fetuses were not considered 'unborn children' until recently, so of
course what you said was unthought-of. Why? Because if they were considered
unborn children, then we would have records of nations where citizenship was
recognized as beginning at conception. I have challenged you to come up with
jut ONE national entity which recognised citizenship, and the rights protecting
the same, as beginning at conception. You have avoided this challenge
repeatedly. Come up with one example or concede the point. Stop being a
selective debater, sniping from the shadows. Step up and take the challenge.

Since no such provision is given in our own Constitution, then you must concede
that given the present Constitution, that fetuses have no rights in the USA,
other than any State Constitutional guarrantees which may exist, on a state by
state basis, as a result of state populations delegating their 'right to
choose', or by passing State Constitutional Amendments recognising residency at
conception. That no state has an Office of Conception Registration, so as to
register the fetal conceptions in that jurisdiction, indicates that no state
has yet recognised fetal rights as a matter of residency.

Let's at least get our history correct: before Roe v. Wade, abortion
was only "unthinkable" in Texas and a few other states; it was quite
commonplace in New York and elsewhere.   And the justices hardly
invented the right out of whole cloth; the decision was a natural--
if extreme--consequence of its earlier interpretation of the 14th
amendment in such cases as Griswold v. Connecticut (which legalized
birth control in 1965).

Reeve is an unabashed, unrepentent socialist, and he has
continued to speak out for socialized medicine and tax-
funded research even after the accident.  He is a poster
boy for the stereotype of "Hollywood Liberal".  I'm sure
he'd cozy up to medical ethicist wihout a thought.

Reilly,

Since you count mere 'potential' humanity as worthy of protection, what do you
say about people who do not do anything to fulfill their potential?

I myself don't count a decent fraction of humanity as my own equal, or having
lived up to their potential. Since I've always scored in the 99th percentile on
everything, you could say that most humans are not 'human' to me, as I cannot
hold a rational conversation with most of them for more than 30 seconds. Most
people fail the Turing test with me. Should I accord them no more respect of
rights as you do of an AI?

I ignored that because it's wrong.  I am not speaking theory here, as
you seem to be: I am speaking the law of the land as written, and as
interpreted by the court today.  You might start with Plyler v. Doe,
457 US 202 (1982).

Predictions, like biological theories, are if-then in nature.  If the trend

of death prevailing in the long run, I believe the forces of the culture of
life, which, as you allude to, tend to be particularistic, will prevail.  I

a nasty fight.  Entropy never goes away, nor does nihilism nor does
tyranny.  The fight is forever.  The Tao is squarely within the liquid

here when we drift to the ordered realm or the chaotic realm, we'll be
fine.  "Natural-historic host of individuals enacting this drama under some
global law" sounds like Hegel's "cunning of reason," life evolving "at the
edge of chaos."  We must be active, we cannot all fall asleep and hope the
laws will bail us out, they won't.

Anyone interested in the "evolution" of the
notion of "I" may find Julian Jaynes's 'The
Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of
the Bicameral Mind' of interest.

My understanding is that all epiphenomena are
real.

The phenomenon of hypostatization -- the notion
that because we use a certain word, there must
be a corresponding existing entity -- may be
relevant here.

If by that you mean Roe v. Wade was the first ruling ever that abortion
is not necessarily murder, you're out of your tree.

For the same reason it's not immoral to allow people to suffer the

of unSaved neighbors.

Agreed, though I doubt it was thought of in such terms at the time.
We've grown up with a culture whose sacred cows include the equality 
(in some sense) of every human; but our great-grandparents saw no 
contradiction in the two sentences "Joe is as human as I am" and 
"Joe is my inferior," because it was accepted that some kinds of
human are indeed inferior.  Or so it seems to me.  Has anyone here
read enough 19C opinion to have a good idea what *they* understood
"that all men are created equal" to mean?

I meant only that the 3/5 rule has nothing to do with measuring degrees 
of humanity.  After all, a slave could be emancipated, and then hey
presto 
he was counted as equal to a white man for purposes of apportionment,
but still he had some legal disabilities almost everywhere -- like a
white woman in both respects.

And I say that begins (in humans) some time after birth.  What goes on
before is just the building of a generic foundation.  Has a newborn
human
as much individuality as a new-hatched chicken?

What do you mean by "the self"?

Interesting, but I don't grok what you mean by "fraternity" and how 
it is incompatible with equality.  Would you expand and/or paraphrase?

Then I withdraw the fanciful metaphor.  My first draft put it this way:
You said that if Mrs O'Connor had had an abortion then our Max,
not a "precursor" of miscellaneous tissue, would have been murdered.
But if Mr & Mrs O'Connor had used effective contraception, Max More 
would be just as absent from our world.  Would that be any less murder?

I agree that making you pay for it is intolerably cruel.
But it's absurd to call it murder when done at the victim's request.

The Declaration never had any force of law.  It can be referred to as
a source of information about what the Framers might have meant by
"proper" or "reasonable" or "rights retained", but it's not privileged
in that respect.

It's great for hitting Big Brother with the hypocrisy stick, though.
"A government which still celebrates the anniversary of a document
condemning certain practices, has embraced many of those practices..."

Well, the institutional author of the Constitution was a successor

Um, no.  A single ejaculation involves perhaps millions of sperm, and 
in the extremely unusual case as many as three of them might survive 
to adulthood.

Obviously God has a rather lower opinion of sperm than to deem them 
"sacred".

Ova, on the other hand, perhaps as many as a third could survive to 
adulthood.  God obviously has a higher opinion of ova than of sperm, 
and we don't want to argue with God, do we?  So we should prohibit 
female virginity, or even sexual abstinence by females.

  (removing tongue from cheek)

  (on second thought, putting it back for a second)

Remember, if God wanted us to go naked, we'd be born that way.

Humans have been cloning for as long as there have been humans, and 
very few cultures have ever had a problem with it.

We're just trying to do it deliberately, in a more controlled manner, 
and under a wider variety of circumstances.

What's the problem?

As for whether or not a clone is a person, aside from some of the 
aforementioned very few cultures that have a problem with cloning, I 
am aware of exactly one case where a clone (done the old-fashioned 
way) was not regarded as a complete, separate human being; but that 
was in a fictional story (and I am still annoyed at Spider Robinson 
for killing off one of her bodies).

That's merely an assertion, as yet unsupported (but not disproved) by
research. I'd agree that *if* consciousness requires QM effects then a
pure digital computer with no QM interaction cannot be conscious, but
I'm still waiting to see whether this is a requirement; as we learn more
about the brain, more and more of human behaviour can be explained in a
purely macroscopic fashion.

Oh nonsense. Let's actually read the Constitution, shall we?

"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
several  States which may be included within this Union, according to
their   respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
whole   Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a
Term of  Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
other   Persons."

Now, where does that specifically mention slaves, or say that they're
less than human? All it says is that the number of representatives and
the apportioning of taxes will be calculated by taking the number of
voters/tax-payers and a fraction of the number of non-voters. "Other
persons" couldn't vote, so there's absolutely no point in counting them
the same way as voters; this discourages states from acquiring more
representatives by bringing in thousands of slaves.

Actually, rough calculations (guessing at the size of the moon as I
don't have figures handy) show that the moon is only producing about
10000 times as much gravitational force as the person sitting next to
you, so Dawkins should be right for any planet other than Earth.

Just curious:

Given that, as you say above, the British colonised north america and australia in the "early
period", which countries did it colonise later?

I read my email in netscape, and so have no problem with HTML mail
(and reading the above-mentioned post), but I too agree that we
should use the lowest common denominator of plain text on a
discussion forum such as a mailing list.

India, Ceylon, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Rhodesia, Belize (then British Honduras), Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Burma.

India and SA are notably the nations still in the best shape, and which took to being colonized
rather well. While SA had the Dutch blight of apartheid to deal with, it is coming out of it
rather nicely (note that that did not exist until SA was indpendent), India on the other hand is
the shining light of the third world for stability and industry, as well as cultural diversity.

Oh, yes, you do have problems with HTML mail. If you have JavaScript and
Java routinely enabled, reading mail can become downright dangerous. You
probably also have AdobeAcrobat Reader installed?

HTML is not a standard. HTML (especially generated by braindead authoring

They won't go after a single breach, since the damage is already done. 
It is the mass delivery systems that they would go after.  Look at the
legal battles over PGP and ask Mr. Zimmerman if the Government lets
minor breaches go unnoticed.  In his case, I don't think he broke any
laws, but the Government still tried to suppress him.

Another thing to remember is that such cases are sometimes publicized by
the defendant for publicity purposes.  The Government rarely
acknowledges such security enforcement, unless forced to do so.  They
usually view the details of the security risk, its detection and its
resolution as also security matters to be kept quiet.

When I tracked down hackers for Government sites (in a former
incarnation), most of the persons tracked were not dealt with through
"normal" channels.  Because of the classified status of certain
projects, the police and local governments could not be informed of the
event or its investigation.  Many of the activities were performed
outside (or above?) the law.  This is all authorized by various
Government Agencies and congressional acts.  The result is that various
secret groups with police powers are formed that act independently of
known police and legal procedures.

I like to tell people that I enjoy watching the X-files because it is so
realistic of Government process as I have seen it.

*very* wrong. For those ||that can't or won't do the math, think about

====================================

I am disappointed with this level of analysis.  Dawkins's reference 
to gravitational effects was correct.  He was referring to the 
instant that a person of mass x is sitting in sufficient proximity 
that the gravitational effect of that single mass of x is, 
mathematically, more important than the effect of the moon.  The sea 
tides reflect an entirely different, collective phenomenon.  It may 
be the case, for example, that while I'm in the ocean, I have a 
greater gravitation effect on the molecules near me than the moon 
does--a 
*tidal* effect, if you will.  But that doesn't mean that it will be 
as measurable as the tides.  The point is a *mathematical* one, 
subtle and correct.

Astrology is a dead horse, I agree.  It shouldn't be taking up the 
valuable time of a thinker as powerful as Dawkins.  But he is 
performing a valuable service by debunking pseudo-science in a 
popular forum.  Extropians should whole-heartedly support that 
effort.

Tolerated is a good word, but the reason it is tolerated is that
the vast majority of people feel that this is an issue that can
only be decided by the individual, that the federal, state, or even
local governments have no rights in this matter.

Really Reilly, I have an answer for you, support contraception use
and education, every pregnancy you help prevent will eliminate the
possibility of an abortion, if the "right to life" movement had
taken this position years ago millions of abortions could have been
prevented.

Want another? develop a program so that pregnant teens would have
a place to live and could develop job skills so they could keep and
raise their babies. Make this a genuine effort, not like the Rev
Falwell's "Baby Ranch".

Note: the Rev Falwell used to have a place (don't know if it's
still open) where unwed pregnant teens could stay untill their
babies were born, they were then (the babies) put up for adoption.

Monstrous....

I'll make a prediction, you'll do neither, the many pro-lifers I've
met (ever hear of a man by the name of Schneider?) were never
interested in preventing pregnancy, just interested in preventing
unwanted (not in their eyes) pregnancies from ending. Why? See the
above paragraph.

I believe we agree on the facts.  The above is indeed a clearer and less
exxaggerated version of the facts than your original post.  Ninth month
abortions are not illegal, but may be occurring anyway.

Its sad indeed to see neo-neo-luddites on an extropian mail list who think
that '7-bit ascii should be enough for anybody'.  I think that using HTML as
an email standard is an excellent step up in the quality of communication.

Here's words for warning to this reactionary attitude: "Why would anyone ever
need more than 640k of RAM?", so sayeth Chairman Bill Gates, in 1981.

As one of the most technophilic mail lists on the net, we should be
encouraging the use of as high a quality communications medium as possible, to
push the standards forward.

Before I get started I just want to say to Reilly that you've been calling me  
a "entropic death-worshiper" for years now and it does have a certain charm 
in a turgid sort of way, but it's getting a little old now. You need another 
insult and I notice you're been trying out new material. If you want my 
opinion, "tyrant" and "murderer" are too mundane, "NAZI" has no class and
"cannibal"  sounds a little silly, but "totalitarian fellow traveler" is just 
your writing style and has real possibilities, you should be able to milk it 
for another decade or two.

False, very false. For the exact reasons you stated, nothing on Earth is as

Free Will is one of the very few important things in life that I have a clear

I'm sure you don't like my definition and I'm equally sure you have nothing 
of your own to offer in its place. Saying that Free Will means having 
volition and volition means having Free Will, or that Free Will means making 
a choice and choice means deciding on your own Free Will does not cut it.

Does the end sometimes justify the means? 
Yes.

No. 
Is the idea that examining the phrase "the ends justifies the means" can lead

Yes.

	>our computer-besotted age, 


The fact that you now equate digital technology with evil is not surprising. 
In the past you've told members of this list that you disapprove of Einstein's 
Theory of Relativity, both special and general, that Quantum Mechanics is 
nothing but foolishness, that Science shouldn't use statistical methods  
because some philosopher who's name escapes me at the moment didn't like it,
and even that Newton was a fool and Calculus is wrong because it's based on 
the idea of limits to the sum of an infinite number of terms. Your present 
phobia is entirely consistent with your past. Now if we could just get rid of 
those new fangeled diabolical death worshipping horseless carriages then
everything would be beautiful.

Cancer is painful, I've seen people who had it, good people. All terminal  
cancer patients now receive pain killers even though it always hastens their 
death by a few hours or perhaps a few days. Should doctors who proscribe 
these drugs be jailed or executed? Should we just ignore them when they beg 
for death? Should we tie their hands so they can't get hold of anything sharp? 
Should we gag them so they can't get their wish by biting off their tongue 
and drowning in their own blood? You may think I'm exaggerating, I assure you 
I am not.

I don't claim it's perfect but it is a positive good, let me give an example. 
It's clear that some people like serial murders are monsters, they're just 
too dangerous to freely walk the streets and must be dealt with somehow. 
I think the best idea is to send them to private, profit making prisons and 
give the prisoners a choice of which one they're sent to. However it seems to 
me that the victim should not be forced to pay for the cost of his tormentors 
imprisonment, the criminal should pay for it himself any way he can. 
Admittedly there are aspects of this idea that sound a little ugly, almost 
like slavery, but the only alternative is worse. If the prisoner is not to 
starve and is not required to pay his own way yhen that means somebody else, 
a non criminal, would be required to pay and become a "slave". If we must 
have "slaves" I prefer they be criminals. Reilly, I know you're very far from 
being a libertarian but most Extropians are and we feel little obligation to 
pay our neighbors bills, even if they're nice people in deep trouble, so we 
feel even less obligation to pay a murderers bills.

I admit there are some problems to work out when the criminal is at either 
end of the economic spectrum. A very poor criminal would have to choose a low 
cost prison, but he might not be able to pay even that. The prison would try 
to make a profit by putting its occupants to work, but I'm not sure this 
would be successful. It's hard to be profitable if your employees are 
uneducated, stupid, dishonest and lazy. Unconventional sources of revenue may 
be needed if the crook is to pay his own way, Human experimentation.

Pharmaceutical companies could hire private rating agencies to judge proposed 
Human experiments much as Standard and Poor rates bonds. The pain \ danger 
index would range from slightly uncomfortable \ probably harmless  to  
agony \ probably fatal. A market would develop, open to anybody who was 
interested, not just prisoners. It would be in the financial interest of the
drug companies to make the tests as safe and comfortable as possible. 
A market could also develop for organ transplants. All parties would benefit, 
medical research would get a huge boost and everybody would have a new way to 
make money if they chose to do it. Prisoners who have no money and don't want 
to sell a kidney or be a guinea pig would have an incentive to work hard in 
the more conventional prison work.

Extremely rich criminals could also be a problem. Ross Perot shoots me in the 
head and is sentenced to 25 years in prison. He decides to go to a super 
luxury private jail in Tahiti with Polo Ponies, yacht racing, 4 star 
restaurants and full communication equipment so he can tend to his business. 
The prison charges $2,000,000 a year but that's pocket change for Ross. 
If he gets tired of this prison he can start his own elsewhere. 
All this doesn't sound like much of a deterrent.

If the prisoners assets could only be used for bare necessities, victim  
compensation and prosecution costs and if every PPA (Private Protection 
Agency) agrees to this then  there is no problem, everything would be nice 
and stable, but I think that is highly unlikely. In the real world Ross Perot 
or any other rich man wouldn't join a PPA that had a law like that in a
million years unless there was no alternative.  Don't misunderstand me, I'm 
not saying this is a fatal flaw in Anarchy or any such nonsense I'm just 
saying it would probably create some conflict, but there is nothing new in 
that.  I doubt this homicidal billionaire problem is very serious and anyway,  
in my PPA nobody would be imprisoned for more than 8 to 10 years. If the  
crime was more serious than that they would be executed. Probably the PPA's 
will work out a compromise of some sort that is, like everything in the Human 
world, imperfect but does have the virtue of being stable in the real world 
full of real people. 
 
By the way, I have no problem with capital punishment (if it is painless) but 
I do think it's a shame to fry perfectly good organs with electricity or 
poison them with cyanide. Waste not want not.

Grrr.  On rec.arts.sf.science people show their math.  "Astrological"
calculations based on Newton's law below.

F=G*M*m/R^2.  G and m (your mass) are constant, so I'll look at M/R^2.

M moon[1]: 7e22 kg.  R (semimajor axis): 384,000 km == 3.8e8 m.

M/R^2= 4.8e5.

M person: 100 kg.  R: 1 meter.
M/R^2= 100.

Ouch.  But you know, people do get closer than one meter.

R= 1cm.  M/R^2= 1e6.

So your sex partner, or mother, seem to be twice as significant as the moon.
Never mind riding a crowded train.  Actually, since their mass and yours are
spread out over several centimeters (along a line going through two mashed
torsos) we'd actually have differential effects in the bodies, as the force
fades rapidly.

So Dawkins wasn't far off.  And any other planet is even less significant.
Jupiter M is 1.9e27 kg, R=7.8e11m.  R/M^2= 3122.
Venus M= 4.8e24 kg, R=1e11 m, R/M^2= 480

and everything else will be smaller than the biggest and closest planets.

One cubic kilometer of rock masses 3 trillion kilogram, so the number for a
mountain three kilometers away would be 1e5, and my horoscope should be
affected by whether I was born (how about live?) in Chicago or Pasadena.

And if we throw G (6e-11) back into the equation, we can see just how big 
these forces actually are.

Then _which_ HTML version, bitteschoen? The w3's consortiums'? N$'s?

I stand corrected. And propose we all henceforth communicate solely in
blowfish-encyphered, Java-spiced VRML UNICODE Chinese ideograms. Only
PGP-signed gzipp'd byte-code compilates admitted, of course. This will
also nicely take care of the S/N ratio.

Just out of curiosity: why do you object to painful capital punishment?
Wouldn't it be more logical (and fair) to match the punisment to the crime?
I don't see why a guy who raped tortured and killed several people
should get the same "easy way out" (by lethal injection for example) as 
a guy who killed someone painlessly. 

By the way, what would the rationale be against corporal punishment for
violent but non-lethal crimes?

You have just explained why the majority of people will never come around
to your viewpoint. Thanks.

As to the 'countering' of John Clark, from what I've read he seems a
resonable and fun-2-be-with fellow. We certainly have some disagreements
but we'll sit down, have a drink and work it out in much the same way Max,
myself and others solved a difference of opinion some time ago. Though
mutually respectful and open discussion.

 (BTW, I wouldn't pick a fight with John Clark, I suspect he could
  build a H-bomb from an old vacuumcleaner ;-)

It must be really nice to be able to objectively distuinguish what a
coherent worldview is.

No it doesn't. You just state that it does. And your entire argument
continues to be based upon it. This is what makes it so weak.

Not untill you and me agree that they _are_ children, and we have reached
no such agreement. Read the last sentence again. Is it reaching you?

Welcome to the 20th century, where reality is merely today's 'agreed-upon'
model and no longer ordained by God or one of his followers wearing a
pointy hat.

Which is why Tom's houserule #2 (Clothing permitted) shows he's a very
tolerant person ;-)

Speaking of women... It is interesting to see that in this thread
particularly _all_ posts have been by humans who are genetically impaired
to get pregnant (I don't mind personally but I suspect mr. Jones does -
ever consider therapy?).

Possibly the women on this list (and Natascha recently reminded us that
there are plenty of them out there) are trying not to fall from their
chairs laughing. All of us guys arguing over something that is more _their_
business than almost any other thing ;-)

What the hell are we thinking?  ;-)

point of order mr. chairman please

Murder = illegal killing.

Abortion = legal killing.

Therefore...since abortions is currently legal...it is not murder.

It has probably something to do with waxing fat under the current regime

revolutionaries.

In theory transhumanists could make a great underground organization;
hardly any group packs more raw mental power than this one. Fortunately
for the powers that be organizing and getting revolutionary aren't exactly
our strongest points, maybe by definition. Still, I like the idea of a "shadow 
ExI". Not only is this simply fun and a way to gain some extra material wealth, 
but ultimately it might be the only way to survive the future. Unfortunately this 
idea is about as viable as an aborted fetus...

Good old Mike, still jumping on every train that has the words 'NEW' on it,
no matter which direction it heads.

HTML postings allow me to

    - determine whether you have read a message by me or not, including
information about your browser and operating system,
    - execute malign JavaScript code on your machine and exploit documented
bugs in the language which have not yet been fixed in all its
implementations, and especially the mailing programs are a bit slow in
reacting to such issues,
    - give mails which would have no content otherwise a cool look to make
them more important. The CAPS LOCK key for the lamers, so to speak.

I dunno whether M$ supports ActiveX in messages, but if they do, that's
another point.

Who needs more than 7-bit to exchange content? The only drawback is German
umlauts and other special characters, which I would have executed once and
for all about 20 years ago anyway. Unicode may offer some new possibilities
here, but HTML for a mailing list is really unnecessary. Did it ever occur
to you that there might still be some people using PINE or stuff like that?

Indeed, and now the text of the D of I is merely fodder for the favorite T-shirts of
people like Timothy McVeigh.

The D of I was signed in 1776. While the Revolutionary war dragged on till the Treaty
of Paris was signed in 1783, The Articles of Confederation were passed by Congress on
November 17, 1777, and were ratified by March 1, 1781. This Confederation lasted
throught the war, and in 1787, a Constitutional Convention to draft a formal
constitution. The Constitution of the United States, passed by the convention in
September of 1787,was ratified in 1791 by the 9th ratifying state, New Hampshire,
which also ratified the Bill of Rights, a Document of Constitutional Amendments that
was passed not by the Contitutional Convention, but by the first Congress under that
Constitution. Note that the main body of debate against the Bill of Rights' necessity
was the argument that they were not needed, since the powers prohibited from the
Government by these amendments had not been granted to it by the Constitution in the
first place.

So it took 15 years for the US Constitution to come into effect.

And Thomas Jefferson was both the Author of the D of I as well as the Preamble of the
Constitution.

Especially since this list, due partly to its irreverent politics/point of view, its
regard for personal experimentation with controlled substances, as well as the
previously cited high average IQ, is almost assuredly under constant subscription by
some no good rat in the Federal bureaucracy. I'd expect a good 1/4 of all list
subscribers are intelligence agency related accounts. The first rule of
counterintelligence is to penetrate and take over the opposition groups, and make
them do what you want them to do to achive your ends.

Sure, but we should also not cut people out because they don't have as |<00|_ a
computer as you, dude. The simple fact of the matter is that *everyone with a
computer* can read text.  Not everyone can read HTML, as has been pointed out.
The whole point of standards is to make sure that everyone can see/use/whatever
the same data. The whole point of mailing lists is to communicate. If some people
can't read HTML mail, why should you punish them because they are not up to your
"standard" of techno-widgetry?

I could then go on about text-mode versus GUIs but that's been done to death...

Dwayne.

Genetically, yes.  But really (for human beings at least), they are not the
same as identical twins, since identical twins are partly identical from
being raised in the same womb at the same time.  Clones are not necessarily
raised in the same womb, nor at the same time.

You can see if someone has read your message using the "return receipt
requested" or whatever it is called in most email anyway.

I generally use elm on a linux box, but I'm using my Dad's win95 machine for a
bit. So I can currently *see* HTML mail, but I'd rather have the option of being
able to telnet into my mail server from anywhere and read my mail, than be able
to see differing fonts and colours (as if that will make a message more
intelligible).

I'd thought that the umlauts in german can be swapped for a following "e"??

I wouldn't care to defend that statement in debate.  I'm not saying people
here are dumb, but I don't see how selection for a few subspecies of
technophilia has produced an unsurpassedly high quantity of intellect.

Agreed, in this case. However Yak's statement was general. Clearly,it cloning is
not illegal, then advocacy of cloning is not illegal and discussions
are not illegal.

The Johnson and Nixon administrations prosecuted the "Chicago Seven"
on criminal conspiracy charges, even  though some of them had never
met or communicated with each other person-to-person. They engaged
in their conspiracy using the news media. Apparently, secrecy is not
a requirement. I personally thought this was a farce, but I'm not a
prosecutor. I devoutly hope that e-mail discussions and all other forms
of speech remain as free as possible. I'm merely pointing out the
law as I (a layman) understand it.

Yak, one of the most ridiculous elements of the conspiracy
law, as I understand it, is that conspiracy to commit a
misdemeanor is, you guessed it, a felony.

And using Netscape's browser, if you have your security flags set, you are always
prompted before intrusive javascript, cookies, or other privacy and security
penetrating actions are taken.

That even ascii based browsers like ALPHABrowser now support HTML email indicates
that even the most primitive interfaces are capable of rising above their origins.
Its people, and their stubborn resistance to change that is the sticking point. As
extropians, we need to get the anti-change meme out of our systems through regular,
habitual purging of obsolete techniques, tools, etc. from our regular use.

> I'd thought that the umlauts in german can be swapped for a following "e"??

Most european accent systems can be replicated in an HTML compatible mail reader by
using tags that specify a standard international character set that is 7 bit, and is
recognised as an alternate font.. Microsoft has several as does DEC. Microsoft
International and DEC Multinational are two that I have come across regularly in
mail data files customers in other countries send me at work for processing. I don't
understand, though, why Germans would use a capital B with a tail as a replacement
for the 'ss' in -strasse ??? Is it a different pronouncement?

How about, since being held in contempt for refusing to testify is not a
criminal act at all (the witness is considered to 'hold his own keys' in
that they are free to go any time by cooperating), can conspiring to refuse
to testify be a felony? In Clinton's case, apparently so......

Since you don't even have to be in communication then, does this mean that
if I wrote an article in the news that recommended that, say Susan MacDougal
refuse to testify, prior to her testimony, then I could be charged with
conspiracy? I think there are significant limits related to the concept of
'proximate cause' in play here that are not being considered.....

Although in the old testament, He declared,"do not spill your seed upon the

if god didn't want us to waste sperm or ova, we'd have push buttons for our use

Well, yeah, that's why I didn't respond to that bit.

Besides, as I see it it, it's not a security issue, it's more a matter of everyone being

I entirely agree. However, I really don't think that plain-vanilla ascii email is
"obsolete", and I'm not really sure why HTML is so vastly superior.  All I've seen so
far is the ability to change fonts and colours. Woopee doo is my reaction to that.  It
in no was changes the -content-, merely the presentation.  We're still reading text,
it's just text prettified up slightly.

I agree with what you are saying in principle, it's just that I don't think it applies
to email. If even one member of the list cannot read HTML, why should the rest of us
exclude this person, when it really serves no valid purpose? Is the ability to mix and
match fonts going to make the list more useful than the opinions/thoughts/rants/agitprop
of that individual?  I doubt it, although suffering through the interminable abortion
thread makes me doubt this conclusion.

If you consider India to be in good shape, then you can probably say that
most 3rd world countries are.  The fact that they've got a large industry
is just a product of their massive population, but if you consider GDP per
capita, poverty levels, literacy levels and life expectancy, i think you 
would find that, just like the rest of the latter Brittish colonies, they
do just as badly, if not worse, than the French or spanish colonies.

Genetically, yes.  Identical twins have the same DNA as do clones.  Twins
also grow in the same womb and are affected the same by the mother's
nutrition and environment.  Clones developed in different wombs will have
different environments.

There is one theory, not tested as far as I know, that twins are not
identical genetically.  This theory states that a minor mutation occurs
early in the division.  The theory then postulates that the cells with
different DNA split apart and form seperate individuals because their DNA
don't recognize each other as the same body.  I heard this theory years ago
and have had not heard of any followup with DNA tests to confirm it.

I am an identical twin.  We shared the same placenta, and are mirror twins.
Mirror twins occur when the blastula has already started to differentiate
(and has a distinct left and right side) when it splits into two
individuals.  Because of this, my brother is a mirror image with reverse
internal organs.

We were difficult to tell apart through high school, but now we look no
more similar than we do with our older brother.  I tease him that I am the
experimental rat on a vegetarian diet and taking life-extension drugs.  He
is the control rat on a normal diet.  When we are older, we will compare to
see how my life-extension theories are working.  I like to think I look
younger than my brother, but I am not an unbiased observer.

It is interesting that you have become an Extropian, while he has not.
Have you ever discussed extropy and/or transhumanism with him? I would
be interested to know what he thinks.

The first part of that doodad is a "long s" such as you may have noticed
in 18C printing.  It's marginally significant in that long s never
appears at the end of a syllable; thus the thing-that-looks-like-B can
never represent two "ss" that have come together by compounding.

What does it get us?  The power to override the recipient's choice of

The phrase is so staggeringly idiotic on its face that I suspect I'm
misunderstanding it.  It appears to mean "side-effects never count". 
Can even a Marxist believe something so silly?

bla bla bla.

Those who find science a threat to our godlike uniqueness and dignity
have a habit of complaining that scientists reduce us to "nothing but". 
Those two little words are an overreaction.  When a reductionist says
"nothing but (atoms, cells, genes, etc)" it means "wow, all this
complexity arises from such a simple foundation, isn't that wonderful?" 
It does *not* mean "Man is equivalent to a random heap of (atoms, cells,
genes)."

Persons"?

Not exactly.  Remember, not all free Persons were voters -- indeed there
are still at least two classes of free nonvoters: minors and resident
aliens.  Even "illegal aliens" are counted (I believe this was decided
in a suit over the census of 1980).

A comparison with the Articles of Confederation is instructive.

"Art. VIII. All charges of war, and all other expences that shall be
incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the
united states in congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several states, in proportion
to the value of all land within each state, granted to or surveyed for
any Person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon
shall be estimated according to such mode as the united states in
congress assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint.  The
taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the
authority and direction of the legislatures of the several states within
the time agreed upon by the united states in congress assembled."

Such a survey is obviously difficult and open to quarrels of
interpretation, not to mention corruption.  So the Convention of 1787
adopted population as a proxy for wealth, on the theory that free people
will tend to migrate to where the wealth is.  And *then* they made
representation in the Lower House proportional to taxation.

Thus electoral equality came in through the side door.

My error: I was thinking they came a bit later.  But anyway, the
Articles certainly constituted "United States of America" and used that
name.

Nope.  That happened June 21, 1788.  The First Congress assembled March
4, 1789.

Congress could not propose any Amendments before the ninth state had
ratified the Constitution!

Congress proposed a dozen Amendments on September 25, 1789; ten of them
received the last of the necessary ratifications December 15, 1791. 
(The remaining founder states - Massachusetts, Georgia and Connecticut -
ratified them in 1939.)

> So it took 15 years for the US Constitution to come into effect.

Um, okay -- this is true in one sense, but false in at least three
better senses.  The first constitution of the United States of America
was adopted within five years; the second was adopted within thirteen
years; it was slightly modified two years later, as you so rightly point
out; it has been more deeply modified several times since.  Not to
belittle the Bill of Rights, but it has little or no effect on the
*structure* of the government.

Neat trick: in 1787 he was in France.

No.  To be an identical twin you MUST be a clone, but there are

But that does put us a bit ahead of the British, where a criminal

criminal intentions.

Technically incorrect.  It was the Dade County Prosecutor who 
prosecuted them.

The charges were rioting and inciting to riot.  Neither of which is a 
federal offense.

The verdict was consistent with the following paraphrase of something 
the jury foreman said:

There was inciting to riot -- but Mayor Daley was the person who 
did it, and he was not prosecuted.  There was rioting -- but the 
rioters were the personnel of the Chicago Police Department, and they 
were not prosecuted.

Nope, it's a major step DOWN, because browsers are the lamest mail 
clients around.

When they come out with a browser with multiple email folders, 
automatic email filtering rules, automatic download so you actually 
do your reading offline, and all the stuff that is standard in 
non-browser email clients for Windows, then maybe I'll be interested.

Basically: there are a wide variety of very usable email clients that 
don't support HTML.  There are, at present no usable email clients 
that do.  I won't sacrifice usability for HTML.

I don't think it's logical because fairness is a useless concept in this  
context.  A man becomes evil because of his genes or his environment or 
perhaps some random fluctuation in his brain, this in no way excuses his 
actions because it doesn't matter why he's a monster, he's still a monster 
and must be dealt with to ensure he doesn't commit more evil. However, the 
"balancing the books" meme that sees virtue in the suffering of other people 
is pointless,  a relic of Christian mythology about hell, " God is good and 
if it's OK for him to burn people for eternity then it must be OK to torture 
somebody I don't like for a few days before I kill him, God seems to enjoy it 
and I do too". Such ideas belong on the ash heap of history.

That's the logical reason, but I have another reason and it's is purely  
emotional and therefore much more powerful. I simply become unhappy when I 
see another living thing in pain, and if I'm the cause of that pain then I'm 
even more unhappy. I don't claim there is any profound significance in my 
attitude, it's just the way my brain is wired.
        

        >By the way, what would the rationale be against corporal punishment         
        >for violent but non-lethal crimes?


I see insurmountable practical problems because I don't see how you could get  
the calibration right. Even if they commit the exact same crime, a 25 year 
old 300 pound Olympic weight lifter and a 82 year old 89 pound grandmother 
can not receive the same corporal punishment. You'd end up killing some 
people for minor crimes and giving virtually no punishment to others who 
commit major ones.

My answer would be: I won't do it, not because the guy doesn't 
deserve it (he does) but because I refuse to be the sort of person 
who does things like that.

Hey wake up :-)

Ouch, I thought I was retro since I read my mail in Emacs, but I stand
corrected... :-)

Mike has pointed out a real problem: the current email standard *is*
old and locked in - we will likely have to deal with it for a long
time. Remember that Ascii is still buried in the bottom of Unicode -
somehow I think Vinge was right on the mark with his description of a
galactic Usenet with headers fairly similar to ours; ancient, basic
standards that everybody use but always try to circumvent.

It would be very nice with a better email standard, but such a move
should not be undertaken lightly. Besides not wanting to isolate those
who use older systems (an extremely simple standard can also be dealt
with by almost any system) there is also the issue of what new
features we need - typographic control is nice, but hardly the most
essential stuff. And even if you have a good idea for a standard you
will have to make it a standard, and that is obviously tricky
(remember MIME?).

Personally, as someone who quite often reads mail with 'vi /var/mail/mark',
I find HTML a real pain in the ass. The only benefit I can see is that it
can include links to other sites, but cut and paste takes far less time
than Netscape spends displaying complex HTML messages.

Actually, I'd just like to add that in the last few months I've come to the
conclusion that the majority of commercial Web sites are cack produced by
people who care more about flash graphics than assisting their customers, and
who don't even realise how much money they're losing in the process.

For example, I just followed a link to a web-site for a film magazine; only
to reach a page saying 'Sorry, but your browser doesn't meet our requirements,
click here to download Internet Explorer'.

Now I don't want Internet Explorer, I don't care what *their* requirements
are. They are the ones who are supposed to be selling *me* something, but
they block me out of their site so that they can include some dumb Java
animated graphics. Do they have a clue?

Another example: a couple of days ago I was searching the Web for a place
to buy a copy of Adobe Premiere; according to the Adobe site, a $750 product.
I went to a site that I've bought from before, to check out their prices. I
clicked on the button, but it didn't work because they've replaced their old
CGI scripts with Javascript, and I have all that cack disabled because of
the security holes.

They lost a $750 order by trying to force their customers to do what the
company want them to do, rather than catering to all of us.

Another example: the numerous web sites where people have decided that 
HTML text is too low-tech and use images for all their buttons (or worse, 
all their content!) with no ALT tags. I don't even have image download 
enabled because it's too damn slow on many sites... again, I go elsewhere 
to a site that's not so pretty but chooses to help me.

No wonder Internet commerce is not the cash cow people expected...

Only if you choose to set it up that way; AFAIR when I installed Netscape
4 (before I decided it was too bloated and went back to 3.01) I had to
spend an hour or two hunting down all the different option settings to make
it secure.

It also doesn't neccesarily help. There's an interesting discussion starting
at:

http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/dir.archive-98.02.12-98.02.18/0367.html

of the perils of IMG tags in email, and how they can be used to trap nyms.

Another example of how dangerous this could be to an individual is that I
could put:

<IMG SRC="http://www.kiddyporn.com/nuclear-terrorist-kiddy-porn.jpg">

in an email message and Netscape will happily go off and download the
illegal image. Not only will the Feds who run kiddyporn.com have a 
record of your download, but your boss will see it on your screen as 
he walks past. 

Any kind of active content in email is risky, but unfortunately the
trend today seems to be towards 'smart computers for stupid people'.
At home I run Linux, a nice, friendly operating system which does
what I tell it. At work I have to put up with Betas of Windows-98,
which is continually putting up panels saying 'I really don't think
you want to do that, do you?', as though it knows better than me. I
have no clue as to what is going on behind the web-linked desktop
nonsense, which could be uploading or downloading all kinds of things
without my knowledge.

To me this is troubling, because by putting the 'intelligence' outside
the individual (human or SI) we have a potential for catastrophe when
the computers go wrong (most obviously the current year-2000 bug issues)
or someone exploits a hole in the system.

We can infer that "other persons" is a generic term and doesn't apply
exclusively to slaves (it clearly, for example, includes Indians who
aren't taxed). If they meant 'only count slaves as 3/5 of a person,
but count everyone else' they would have said so. Slaves are clearly
counted as "other people", but so, for example, are untaxed Indians.

The real question is, what did they mean by "free persons"? Once we
know that we can work out who the "other persons" are.

But what some suit in 1980 said is irrelevant; the question is what they
meant at the time they wrote the Constitution, since the founders are the
ones who supposedly regarded slaves as 'subhuman'. The plain fact remains
that the 3/5 rule made perfect sense at the time, but is today being used
by authoritarians to denigrate them.

He is not interested.  He thinks my ideas are weird.

I skipped out of high school early because I couldn't stand it.  I took
the GED and went straight to college at age 16.  My brother followed,
but I don't think he felt the pressure to get out that I did.

I chose an Science Education major, with minors in Computer Science and
Biology.  He chose a straight Computer Science major.  I moved out from
my parents, got a job and put myself through college, because my parents
did not approve of the nontechnical portions of my college curriculum. 
My brother stayed at home, and let Mom and Day pay for his college and
support.

By the time we graduated, I had switched schools, gotten two degrees (in
Business and Computer Science, with minors in Biology, Psychology, and
Education.  I also had been doing computer contracts for 5 years.  My
brother graducated with a single-major degree in Computer Science and no
experience.  He was devestated when his first job paid less than mine. 
He had no idea that experience would be worthwhile, and fully expected
his more technical degree to land him a much better position than mine.

He has been content to serve his employers, only changing jobs when laid
off.  I, on the other hand, have always strived to get ahead.  I have
always had jobs where I serviced multiple contracts, and always
developed one of these areas into a higher job to replace my previous
one.  My brother still works for a fine company, but I now have a
consulting firm with my business partner.

The only early difference is that I became sexually active in my teens,
and got into a lot of trouble for it.  I had to decide that I was going
to choose my own life choices.  My brother seems to have remained the
good son, and probably was a virgin by the time he married a couple of
years ago.

I think having to rebell, having to move out of the house and support
myself for my goals, and generally having to make my own way has lead me
to be self-sufficient.  My brother still seems to expect state and
employer to provide him with opportunities as long as he obeys and works
hard.  I no longer trust government or employers.

My brother is slowly coming around to my way of thinking, but started
out his life experience about 4-5 years after I did.  (We are 35 years
old now.)  He still thinks nutrition is inconvenient, life-extension is
unproven and speculative, and cryonics is science fiction.

He thinks my constant striving for change to be strange, and actually
complains that I change all the time.  He finds it odd that I used to
eat meat, then I became kosher, and finally vegetarian.  He finds it odd
that I searched various religions before finally developing my own
philosophy for living.  He seems to interpret change as failure and an
admission that one's previous views were "bad".  I have difficulty
explaining to him that Christianity was great because it gave me
purpose.  Then I questioned and researched what the Bible really said,
and found all sorts of other old texts.  Then I researched more into
history and why these texts said what they said.  Finally, I question
any divine purpose in the texts and believe they were earnest attempts
by early philosophers to explain the unexplained.  I didn't reject my
former beliefs as much as I grew and evolved (or transcended) out of
them.  Whereas I value change as a chance for growth, he fears change as
a chance for loss or failure.

Since genetics doesn't explain the difference, I must ascribe it to
attitude.  Since early childhood environment wasn't much different, I
must ascribe it to my reaction to the environment.

  You can be unhappy punishing anybody, but the criminals will also be
unhappy.  That's the point - their unhappiness with the punishment will
prevent them from committing [more] crime.

  10 year jail sentence for these people will also be perceived differently.
And so will forced abstinence from sex, prison environment, solitude,
separation from family, etc.  Calibrating people's psychological 
perceptions does sound like an insurmountable problem, but it is never
taken into account.  Calibrating physical effects, such as tiredness and
pain, is extremely easy compared to that.  So by your very argument, we
should abandon all other types of punishment in favor of the corporal.

Besides, if the punishment is known in advance, and you think that it's
too harsh on you personally, then you don't have to commit that crime, right?
If you do, it's your own choice - maybe you thought that though the
punishment for you is more severe, but the chances to get caught and convicted
are smaller (we can't calibrate that for people).  So you made a free conscious
choice, and now get the promised payoff.  It will also be a lesson to others
not
to do it.  Why do you thing old ladies commit fewer crimes ?  ;-)

  It looks like many of such problems would be resolved if you had a smarter
mail server.  You could just tell it what type of client you use, and it
would filter out HTML code, or do any other conversion.
Modems can do such things already, they can talk down to older modems with
simple protocols, when it's needed, but when they figure out they talk to
a peer, they use different protocols and more complex features.
That's called "feature negotiation".  There can also be negotiation of
content, presentation, etc.  I am sure it will be done in due time, there
is enough commercial pressure there - would go much faster and smoother if
driven by clear vision, but it will be done anyway.  Older standards get
extended, than put on the side, then abandoned.  This has happened in
all communication media.

  As for markup,  I would eventually like to see not just presentation
markup, but semantic marks and comments that can be used to aid translation
of the text or communicated with intelligent user clients.
We'll have a lot more code to filter out.

At this point. Much more interesting stuff is possible. For those of you who have browsers

Flip it. Why should the rest of us who are moving ahead be held back by the stubborn
intransigence of those opposed to progress? This list is for forward thinkers.

Exactly, preventing future crime is the only reason for punishment, or at 
least the only reason I would care to defend. My point was that if you're 
going to kill a murderer anyway then you can be sure he will never kill again 
so there is no purpose in torturing him before you do so. 

Ok, an argument could be made about increasing the deterrent, but this effect 
may not exist (it would probably just generate sympathy in the population for
the murderer and make him a martyr) however even if it did and the effect was 
proven to be large I still wouldn't go for it because emotional revulsion 
against torture would prevent me. Hey, I never said I was a paragon of logic.

Tiredness and pain are psychological perceptions, heart failure, shock, and 
massive blood loss are physical effects. You'd be giving one person a mild 
irritation, a second person a lifelong crippling injury, and a third person a 
death sentence, and all for committing the exact same crime.

And Sasha brought up smart software which can negotiate appropriate protocols
before it gets to you, also reflected in Vinge.  But as this is a list
practically suckled on Vinge, let us not forget what else appeared in that
book: an award-winning dramatic presentation of the interesting times which
active content can bring you.

Microsoft is not the Blight, cheap attacks notwithstanding, but the prospect
of not knowing what my mailreader is up to is about as attractive as waiting
longer for a graphical mailreader to load so that it can display the author's
choice of font and color.  Me, I have Netscape 3 set to override document
colors, although they forgot to catch <font> and table color codes.

Somewhere recently I saw a contrast of the IETF standards process --
implement, implement, debug, standardize -- and the W3C process --
standardize, implement, debug.  It was suggested that IETF has a better
record.  The philosophical relevance to us would be an analogy linking IETF to
evolutionary rationalism and W3C to constructionist rationalism.

There is something dangerous about technologies that are so sophisticated that an imbecile can use them effectively.  Underneath the shiny veneer of "enabling technology" is a darker, subtle form of slavery.  

The danger doesn't exist so much in not understanding how the device works; indeed, people have been effectively driving cars for years with very limited knowledge of the mechanics of the engine.  The danger is that the gap between what the average user knows and what is required to understand the technology has been growing with increasing speed.  What was once voluntary slavery (you may not know how to fix a car, but you could learn pretty easily if you wanted to), will become involuntary slavery as the knowledge gap threshold slips past the average user of that technology.

I think that this is the true fear of many Luddites; they just haven't expressed it this way in many cases.

There's still a difference in using documented standards and placing
invisible remote images creating a request on a server anywhere and thereby
logging the user's mail receipt directly without his/her knowledge.

>I'd thought that the umlauts in german can be swapped for a following "e"??

Exactly, I'd just like this to be the standard. When I write an article and
send it via mail, I have to use either HTML or zipped 8-bit ASCII because
otherwise the recipient would have to re-convert all the umlauts (cannot be
done automatically) in order to publish it.

You've missed the rub here.  'Mark' is claiming to read his e-mail by
opening his mail spool directory with the default UNIX text editor. 
He is not using a mail client.  The server has no idea (nor should it)
as to which client a user uses.  

Mail servers accept, deliver, and store messages.  Different types
allow different ways for a client to access and retrieve these
messages (such as IMAP allowing the client to retrieve each part of a
message at any time<headers, body, attachments, etc>).   I can connect
to any of my mail servers with any (almost) client (POP, IMAP, etc). 
For a server to be able to keep track of what client you have is for
the server to be able to force you to use a specific client.  And, if
you've told a server you use xyz POP client and then try to retrieve
mail with a 567 IMAP client setup differently (such as keeping mail on
server, deleting mail when exit, where to keep copies of sent mail,
etc) you're shoutta luck.

While I personally do fine HTML a poor excuse for e-mail format it is
completely within the standards of MIME (which, btw...IS a standard. 
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.  It allows for such things as
sending graphics and audio as attachments to e-mail, as well as WORD
documents or HTML files).  Either Netscape 4.04 or OutLook Express can
read POP, IMAP, HTML, you name it.  There is no excuse for anyone not
being able to read an HTML formatted file.  Wrongful use of bandwidth
perhaps.

Anyone proud of NOT using a decent mail reader has no sympathy from me
and gives rise to the veracity of their claim to be on a forward
thinking optimistic list.

What I do find most appalling is the amount of 'I won't believe that
because it's new and you can't make me-proud to be a regressive-we've
always done it this way' sentiment I've seen regarding such a silly
thing as e-mail.  Mark's reading his mailspool with vi is akin to
cutting your lawn with scissors.

What you may not realize is that many universities (and libraries that are
linked to a freenet) provide e-mail services to their students only through
terminals that are locked into running PINE.  PINE cannot read HTML, so one
gets a messages that says there is an attachment in HTML that cannot be
read.  MIME, yes.  Readable, no.  I would think there are a fair number of
students on this list who cannot afford to get an additional internet
account, so, my message to everyone: use plain text if you want everyone on
the list to read your message.

Exactly why is it monstrous for immature teenage mothers to be
encouraged to put their babies up for adoption where they can be raised
in two parent homes with more mature people? I think it is idiotic for a
teenage girl to think she is doing the best thing for her child (or
herself) by trying to raise it without a father.

Our prisons are filled with kids who come from single parent homes.
Check the statistics. To encourage single teen mothers to keep their
kids is bad social policy.

I would have considered my mother to be grossly irresponsible and
immature if she had given birth at age 16 and tried to raise me without
a father. I would also have been very angry at being deliberately denied
having a dad.

I never thought I would agree with Jerry Falwell on anything!

Sounds like a good idea to me too; I can't imagine why anyone
would think that offering young mothers this option was a bad
thing in any way.  Now I do understand why some people would
have a problem with the "pregnancy counseling clinics" set up
by fundies that only counsel what the church approves of--that
is being less than honest.  But if such an organization clearly
acknowledges its religious affiliation, more power to them.
It's not as if clinics like Planned Parenthood don't also have
a strong religious bias--though pragmatism isn't generally
recognized as the religious doctrine it is.

Actually, India really is in fairly good shape. There has been no major
starvation there for many decades (unlike Africa), and the life
expectancy has been improving dramatically along with the control of
infectious diseases. Birth rates are on a rapid decline. While there has
been some ethnic and religious violence, it is nothing like some of the
horrors that have gone on places like Somalia or Rwanda. India has the
rule of law (imperfect as it may be), a democratic system and it wisely
has kept the world's greatest language, English. Per capita GDP is low,
but improving slowly. Most people are still poor, but they are not
totally destitute and seem to be happy with their lives. More people can
afford "luxury" items these days. The socialistic policies of the
Congress Party have held the country back, but everyone except the far
left now agrees that more market liberalization is needed. Yes, you will
find many pitiful beggars in any Indian village or city, but the poverty
was far worse in the past.

If you're interested in Social Security, I just read about what could be a
really engaging web event, hosted by Americans Discuss Social Security (a
project of The Pew Charitable Trusts) that is taking place on Saturday March
21st.  They are calling this event a ten-city interactive video
teleconference.  It is being held in 10 cities, but they're also broadcasting
it on the web.  They say that people on their web site (www.adss.org) will be
able to chat with the conference moderator and participate in the conference
polling.  I haven't seen anything like this on the web before and I am really
interested in Social Security.  Apparently this organization plans to engage
citizens in a national dialogue on Social Security reform but does not take a
position on Social Security reform.  So this should be interesting.   If you
want more information, the url is adss.org.  See you there!

Your last few lines beg the question: why did you develop this attitude,

Or perhaps there was some defining event in your life that set you on a

The "balancing the books meme" a/k/a "an eye for an eye" is independent
from Christian or other mythology. That it happened to be included in the
Christian-Judeo meme complex is irrelevant, it doesn't automatically make
it a bad meme. On the contrary, it is the purest and most consequent form
of justice that is humanly possible. Most people agree (and that's duly the 
way most legal systems work) that the bigger the crime, the "heavier" the 
punishment should be. You get a ticket for speeding, go to jail for stealing
a car, go somewhat longer to jail for stealing several cars etc. Why then,
would this perfectly logical system stop at capital punishment? People
can get several life centences for murdering several persons, the logical
equivalent with capital punishment would be more and longer suffering.

Would you agree with a system where you can make a sort of last will in
which you specify that, should you get murdered, whether or not you want
capital punishment/crime-dependent c.p./or imprisonment for your murderer? 
In this way, we could all have our own kind of justice in an organized fashion.

This doesn't change the fact that people can suffer horribly in prison too, not
only psychologically (I'd rather have a caning than a year in jail btw) but also
physically (rape with aids risk, beatings and even murder are pretty common
in jails). You wouldn't be doing anyone a favour! 

There are thousands of ways to administer corporal punishment, and with the
help of modern technology it should be quite feasible to control the damage 
done (and prevent any permanent damage, if so desired).

First of all I think that revenge is a valid reason to punish too. Why not?
Also, it is only fair towards the victims and those who kill just one person 
that mass/serial murderers and especially cruel killers pay a higher price. 
Otherwise you'd be implicitely stating that you can kill for free once you've
made your first victim (what is there to lose?) and that the lives of the other
victims were somehow "irrelevant". On the other hand, knowing that every
additional evil deed will cause you more suffering might make a potential
multiple killer think twice.

No-one is asking you to do the torturing, to watch or even otherwise participate
(assuming the last will system would be adopted). The point is: would you
(try to) stop others from seeking justice in a different way?

Exactly, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen. And most violent
offenders are young healthy males anyway...

One can prepare a more properly formatted paper (or post one already prepared)
that looks a darn sight better than plain text. Sorry, from my publishing
experience, I put probably more value into the structure and appearance of a
document, as aids in being clear, readable, and organised, than someone, like,
say, a Unix hound ;). Plus the ability to put tastefully created graphics when the
need strikes (tables, 'proof' images, schematics) as well as using tables to
convey data, rather than the haphazard and usually messed up plain ascii tables so
many people unsuccessfully try. Being able to create a small email message in HTML
that is aesthetically pleasing, conveys data artfully, and acts as a front end to
more in depth information on a website that one can link to directly makes
communication far more effective than simple text.

Such is the process of natural selection on the web. Sites that don't get traffic,
don't succeed. Unfortunately, most marketing people who fund website development
have blinders on, seeing websites as just another type of print advertising, or
even worse, tv advertising. They throughly fail to see it as an integrated part of
their technical and customer support system, their sales demonstration and
sales/distribution system. Those companies which do recognise this make money.
THose that  don't, die.

Rather than gagging, look at it as a chance to study a new ecology, see what life
forms work, what forms don't work, etc.

Yes, tying your site to a closed standard is the curse of death. Unfortunately,
too many web authors prefer to go for th glitz to make quick sales (especially if
they aren't paid by the amount of traffic the site generates), and web tools are
not presently under  a standard. Entirely too many people have learned the
VHS/Betamax lesson by this point, at least on the software side. Now nobody can
agree on a standard. Makes a libertarian long for a monopoly, almost.

Which is why I use Netscape, I use animated GIFs, and complex form structures, and
CGI, as well as only java that is usable on all major browsers (ALHPABrowser, btw,

Even on my personal site, which, I admit, I don't use many alt tags on images, I
always offer a text navigation bar at the bottom of the page.

However, I will remind you that most business on the web is done in a graphical
environment. Those of you who are still stuck in ascii-land are WAY behind the
curve, sorry to say. Now, it has its place, but still, you shouldn't be driving
your Yugo on the Autobahn at 45 mph and expect me to slow down my Passat, Volvo,
SAAB, BMW, or even a Ferrari, down for you. ('Gene, what the hell are you driving
over in Russia???)

Why, because all those cobol programmers reading their email in vi, browsing with
lynx,  etc on their 3151 unix terminals, who make $100,000 plus a year and need to
shop from the computer are too stubborn to get with the technological curve?
Commerce on the net comes from selling unique products to many people. Ascii is a
horrendous sales medium.

It isn't always "stubborn intransigence" that keeps some of us from
always being the first on the block with the newest&fanciest gizmo.

Nope.  "Indians not taxed" are excluded, not counted at all.

Fine.  I'll believe it when I see it.  

The *possibility* of usefully formatted tables etc does not excuse
cluttering an otherwise plain and legible message with HTML tags
"because it's there".

There are Word and Excel viewers available on microsoft's
site that run well under wine.

http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/msword/internet/viewer/default.htm
http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/msexcel/internet/viewer/default.htm

There are both 16 and 32 bit versions, I have only run the
16 bit version, but the 32 might work with wine too.

These are nasty ugly dangerous file formats though. All
organizations should be encouraged to regard .doc and .xls
files as badware, potential trojans and virus spreaders. It's
easy to forge mail to a clueless windows user, posing as
someone he/she trusts and convince them to run your custom
macro which drops various trojans around and waits for
a domain admin who doesn't understand the PATH cruft under
NT. Shortly you will have admin access to the domain.

Eric

Mike, what is HTMLized mail really good for? You still have not given a
single pro example. 

I use Mozilla for browsing (snipping urls from pine's xterm), pine for
mailing (soon emacs' MH). Browsing web pages with the equivalent of lynx?
Brrrr.  Yes, I will archive my emails with searchable Hypermail-archive
type of stuff. Otoh I will write a perl filter to filter out all HTML from
my mail box -- this will also take care of 50% of spam.

Yeah, but he really should risk a few steps more.

In which RFC is Shockwave defined? How long has it been around?  How many
revisions has seen this standard since its invention? Will anybody be able
to read this stuff a decade from now? 

In scientific online publishing, I must provide a *.ps.gz, possibly a
.dvi, maybe a *.pdf, and certainly a *.html (canonical html, not the
latest whizbangmegablinkbupbup version either by M$ or N$). In certain
cases, plain *.txt (e.g. bibtex dbases) are entirely sufficient.  

I will be very slow to adopt new standards, for I'd like this type of
content to be accessible for decades. In fact, many scientists are highly
wary of web publishing not only because of lack of established peer review
mechanisms -- they consider the medium itself much too ephemeral. 

Shockwave, indeed.

Mike, there has been a (little-noticed) exodus of the 'forward thinkers'
to polymath@ already. Salt extropians@ with a little bit text markup, and
only the @AOL crowd will remain. 

Just my 0.00000000002 $.

So in your example above, the user is aware that you are being informed when

When you write to someone who doesn't speak german, only english, you write in

I'm not here to be on the cutting edge of everything.  I'm here to *discuss* the cutting edge of
everything. If I were to follow your logic, I would refuse to read anything not written in
lobjan, or some other "cutting edge" language.

Luckily I don't. I don't follow any logic when it comes to discussion fora such as this one, as
it strikes me as silly to allow some pointless ideal to get between me and those I wish to
discuss things with. I'm here to learn things, to discuss things, to be part of a conversation,
and it seems to me that rather than looking into "progress"-ive standards, we should support
standard standards: something *everyone* can understand, not the 3l33t few. At this point in
time, it seems that  english expressed in ascii work pretty well. Maybe that will change
eventually, but for now it strikes me as ludicrous to say to someone "I'm not interested in what
you have to say because your text isn't 'cool' enough".

I fail to see how using ascii is holding you back.  I understood perfectly well your point. How
would HTML have made it clearer?

But why? I've yet to see more than a couple of animated GIFs that are
worth downloading. Most of them take an age to download and then sit
there wasting my CPU time. I use Netscape for research while I'm 
compiling drivers, and the last thing I want is to waste 95% of my
available CPU cycles on some pointless 'ain't this cute' animated
graphic.

Except when you hit a web site which refuses to work if you don't run
Java, but gives you a 'helpful' little 'click here to download Internet
Explorer' button.

And my web-browsing is under (cough, spit, ack) Windows 95/98 over a 256k
link with a stonkingly fast 2D/3D graphics accelerator. But that doesn't
mean that I want to waste 90% of the time downloading pointless images. I
actually use the Net for finding information; and I want to find that
information as fast as possible, not sit back and watch the scenery go
by. Not to mention that I'm one of the people who do actually *buy*
things over the Web, rather than just window-shop.

No, you have the analogy completely backwards. Netscape with Java, Shockwave
and all the other cack is the Yugo; my browser with all that disabled is the
Ferrari. If I want some information I hit full throttle and blast through the
Web to it, getting annoyed when some stupid 'neat graphics, huh?' site forces 
me to slow down.

This, I think, is where Gibson's cyberpunk went hideously wrong. The future
console cowboys won't be using slow, CPU-consuming 3D VR interfaces; they'll
be reserved for the normal folks, and the hackers will be using command line
interfaces so they can stay close to the machine.

Depending on where I am, I read my mail with vi, pine, Netscape, Internet
Explorer, Privtool, Microsoft Outlook (cough, split, ack), elm, /bin/mail 
or 'more /usr/spool/mqueue/df*'. I much prefer pine because it's fast and
simple; I'm just too stubborn to waste my time with pointless fancy graphics
when I'm looking for information.

Why? I want a copy of Adobe Premiere; what do I need other than price 
and availability?

I mean, seriously, what do I gain from spending five minutes downloading
some huge animated presentation when I just want to find the cheapest
supplier and hand over my credit card number? Particularly when Netscape
will probably tell me that I don't have the right plug-in, make me waste
ten minutes downloading that, then after installing tell me that I have
to reboot my machine!

Hmm, it says:

"adding to the
 whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a
 Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
 other Persons."

so to me that's not clear at all; it could be read either way, but mine
seems the more obvious reading. I guess we'd have to see how it was
applied at the time to find the correct answer.

Get a copy of StarOffice 4.0. It's a shareware (free for noncommercial use
on Linux) MS Office clone. Won't read Orofice 97 documents (with the
embedded core dumps ;-) but it works fine on most other Micro$oft 
formats.

This problem _should_ go away if Micro$oft stick to their promise to support
XML in their next product release cycle -- if, of course, they don't 
hijack XML for their own purposes.

Um, there are some falacies creeping in here ...

There are, 'less I'm mistaken, three policies for punishment in most
societies: deterrence, revenge, and prevention. These are usually applied
in combination, rather than in isolation, and the mechanism by which 
they are applied, and severity, varies.

Firstly, deterrence. This is pretty much disproven as an approach to
preventing crime; punishment doesn't deter criminals because criminals
don't expect to be caught and punished. If they did, they wouldn't
commit crimes. The classic study of this problem was conducted in England
in the victorian period. The death penalty by hanging was carried out in
public until roughly 1860, when executions were moved indoors. A study
in the 1860's and 1870's demonstrated that something like 95% of criminals
condemned to death had, however, witnessed a public execution for the very
crime they wer to hang for. The deterrent had failed, in their cases. (We
don't know how many people _were_ deterred, of course, but there are other
studies of countries which abolished the death penalty and didn't experience
a sudden surge in the murder rate that suggest the same principle applies.)

Arguably this is due to incorrect risk evaluation on the part of the
criminally inclined; here in the UK there's a massive program of placing
CCTV cameras in public places, and it does indeed appear to have a major
impact on petty crime (vandalism, car theft, muggings) in public places
overlooked by cameras. The point being that the punishment doesn't deter
criminals; it's the certainly of capture that deters them.

Secondly, there's revenge. I am not going to try to justify revenge; I
think it's a ridiculous, obscene and unpleasant notion that degrades 
everybody involved. An argument for a judicial system based on revenge
is an argument for barbarism. (The whole point of law is to enable people
to coexist peacably without infringing each other's rights. Revenge
doesn't damp down imbalances in the observation of rights; it just
tips the balance the other way.)

Thirdly, there's prevention. Locking people who break laws up for long
periods of time may or may not be appropriate, but in some cases it may
be the most appropriate way to prevent them re-offending. It has the big
advantage (over captial punishment) that if you discover after you've
locked someone up that they were innocent, you can let them out and try
to provide some kind of compensation. But imprisonment is still an
after-the-fact approach to prevention. The best approach to crime and
punishment would be one that aims to prevent crimes being comitted in
the first place by diverting or defusing criminal impulses (and
minimising the number of spurious or victimless crimes on the statutes,
of course). And I think the best way to do this is probably some sort of
polycentric, open, surveillance society -- Neighbourhood Watch with CCTV
writ large, so that everyone participates in crime prevention (meaning
there are no authoritarian figures in a privileged position to police
society) and everyone knows that it's very difficult to commit a crime
and get away undetected.

But first, of course, we need to figure out what constitutes a crime, and
what constitutes a welfare program for police officers.

Any opinions ...?

The mark of great standards is that they can be stretched, far beyond of
their original application area, while remaining fully upwards-compatible. 

There are not many great standards out there.

Indeed. And let us not forget what a sponaneously emerged or deliberately

only the marketplace would be ruined, it would probably mean many
casualties. 
 
> Microsoft is not the Blight, cheap attacks notwithstanding, but the prospect

No attack can be ever cheap enough. M$ may be not the Blight, but a great
paver of ways for one.

But even M$ is not the foe. Widespread human ignorance is the real enemy. 
People purchase and employ things without understanding their modus
operandi nor future implications of their actions. Worse, after the damage
is done people don't understand that they are the party to blame. Instead,
a convenient bugbear idol is produced, much yelling & stone throwing is
conducted -- after that ancient ritual things apparently can go on as
before. 

This happens an all scales: whether sudden climate changes, reactor cores
gone china, or the secretaries's wedged Win95 PC. After the event, much
finger-pointing at the technical people is done, curiously intermingled
with demands to 'having it all fixed, somehow'. 

There is an easy, albeit unpopular solution appearing on the horizont. The
human race is at the threshold of splitting into many species. As the
toolbox to implement such changes is both large and incredibly complex,
the techies should be at an advantage. Will the point-haired ones, and
their secretaries also make it?

Let's hope that the great code cleansing after the release of the Mozilla

There is an interesting article on the front page of today's New York Times. 
It says that on Thursday Oct 26 2028 at 1:30 PM (EST) asteroid XF11 will pass 
less that 30,000 miles from the Earth (diameter 8000 miles) with a slight but  
hard to calculate probability that it will impact the planet. People in 
Europe may get an especially good look at it, but we'll know a lot more about 
its orbit in about 2 years.

The asteroid is thought to be about a mile across, the largest impact in 
recent history was the Tunguska event of 1908, that object was 300 feet 
across and produced a 15 megaton blast. Dr. Brian G Marsden, director of the 
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory reassures us that the asteroid that
killed the dinosaurs was about 6 miles across, so even if this one hits there 
is a good chance it will not lead to the total extinction of the human race.

It looks like H bombs may actually find something useful to do.

But was it *offered*, or was it *required*, to give up your child
if you stayed at Falwell's place?  It's not a good idea if it's
required; that's called coercion.

Could you point me to the statistics that say prisons are full of
single-parent children?  I know quite a few single-parent children
(I'm one of them) that grew up just fine.  I feel more sorry for
my mother (since she gave up *everything* for 20 years to raise me)
than I do for me.

Maybe, but there will always be *some* would-be criminals that are deterred
by strict sentencing, and every crime prevented, counts. Also, I'm quite sure
that mild punishments make criminals loathe the justice system and may thus
increase crime. Some people just need a firm hand to keep them on track.

Not only do I strongly disagree on an emotional level, but I daresay that
the need for revenge is in fact *useful* because it helps you to terminate
your enemies and therefore thrive. The need for revenge is almost universal 
in humans, which is a strong indication that it can't be too bad a trait.

Example: a lion kills a member of a group of humans. Unlike dumb herbivores
(for example) they likely won't just accept the loss and go on, but they'll
want to punish that lion, and lions in general while they're at it. A posse
is assembled and all lions in the area are hunted down and killed. The
revenge-driven group has made life a bit safer for themselves, and probably
for later generations too. 

Revenge might have played a major part in man's ascension to the no.1 
spot in the food chain. Even today revenge might be the real drive behind
justice systems and many a personal crusade against crime. "I want justice" 
really means "I want revenge". I'd be very careful with removing this emotion 
from the human meme/gene complex.

> An argument for a judicial system based on revenge is an argument for 
> barbarism. 

The need for retribution does not make someone a barbarian, just like feeling
joy or anger or any other emotion doesn't make you a barbarian. A good justice
system takes all three elements into account (protect society from the criminal,
discourage potential criminals and satisfy the victim's/society's need for revenge).
It isn't up to the justice system to be "holier than Jesus" so to speak, but to put
the punishment in proportion to the crime, and be consequent at it.

The action(s) coming from the need for revenge might restore the balance
of justice, if done in a controlled and professional way.

As a kind of compromise you could consider freezing executed criminals as
a standard practice. Once (if?) perfected suspended animation is possible
it could be used as an alternative for incarceration too. Anyway, killing or
otherwise removing criminals *works* when done properly (no parole BS)
because you elliminate these misfits from society. Not only are they 
personally removed, but also their genes from the genepool.

Full agreement here! Cameras and microphones all over as far as I'm
concerned (all public spaces like streets, parks, malls, tunnels etc.),
all with interlocking fields of view. Some highly visible, some hidden.
Also cops should have small personal cameras & listening devices
on their clothing and on their gun (to be auto- activated whenever the 
gun is drawn). Personal cams etc. should be highly recommended to
private citizens too. The images are automatically send to various
central databanks with either completely free or highly monitored
access, and local copies (near the cam/audio device itself) are kept
too (and can be downloaded into the general databanks at designated
points (or via your PC or whatever). Everything is auto-dated for later
reference. Of course all certified recordings have full power of evidence
in a court of law.

Some "certain" crimes:

-murder
-manslaugter
-theft
-physical harm
-psychological terrorizing
-slander
-rape
-damage to property
-stalking

"Non-crimes"

-using recreational (or other) drugs
-gambling
-prostitution
-abortion
-euthanasia (when voluntary)
-pornography
-killing in self-defense (including duelling)
-eating fatty foods
-blasphemy ;-)

Basically, anything goes as long as it doesn't harm others without their
consent.

One thing may be misleading about this discovery.  The fact that we get
30 years' notice is not something we can typically expect.

It's entirely possible that a dinosaur killer (which could be considerably
smaller than 1997XF11) will appear with virtually no notice.  We don't
have the ability to constantly monitor space for potential threats.

But we could have - right now SpaceWatch and similar projects are
non-funded, but given some reasonable funding it seems likely they
could map out most of the dangerous NEOs. But few people seems to take
Tunguska events seriously, so I suppose a city has to be levelled
before anybody takes notice.

[Note: Earlier parts of this peme debate -- including the "peme
rules" -- can be found at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>,
which will be periodically updated.]


In 1990, Max More, cofounder of the Extropy movement
(see <http://www.extropy.com/>), wrote the article
'DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF "THE STATE"'
-- see <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm>.

This article includes, in my opinion, some of the steps
one might take in the early stages of clearing deep
pemes from one's mind.

To me, "Deep Anarchists" are Anarchists who have cleared
all or most deep pemes from their minds.  They're always
alert to the possibility that there might be more statist
baggage at the deepest intellectual or conceptual levels
that needs to be eliminated.

In 'The Ego & Its Own' Max Stirner wrote:  "The decision
having once been made not to let oneself be imposed on any
longer by the extant and palpable, little scruple was felt
about revolting against the existing State or overturning
the existing laws; but to sin against the *idea* of the
State, not to submit to the *idea* of law, who would have
dared that?"

Stirner pointed the way to becoming a Deep Anarchist.

The notion of being "personally powerless compared
to the overwhelming power of "the state" or "the
government"" is a near-surface peme many subject
themselves to needlessly.

Also relevant here is the theme expressed by Davidson
& Rees-Mogg in their excellent 'The Sovereign Individual':
As a result of technological advance, the returns on
violence by bureaucrats diminishes, reducing their
power.  Politicians and bureaucrats apply violence to
earn returns in the forms of obedience, money ("taxes"),
etc.

In my personal case, through the application of Freedom
Technology, the returns politicians and bureaucrats get
from me are negligible.  The power they have over me is
extremely limited, largely because of my understaning of
their thinking and behavior, my ability to operate outside
their systems, the advance of technology, and because I've
cleared all the harmful pemes I've been able to find from
my mind.

However, because of deeply-entrenched pemes, inertia,
and tradition, many freedom lovers still grossly
underestimate their own power while also grossly
overestimating the power of politicians and bureaucrats.

Centuries after the so-called "Roman Empire" collapsed,
many people continued to behave as if "it" still existed
and continued to obey "it."  Because of "belief inertia"
and pemes, we can expect a similar phenomenon in our era.

If the "withdrawing group" is largely unorganized,
they maximize their power as individuals.  Most of
us need only relatively small support groups to
live free to a considerable degree.

As far as I know, there are only about a dozen Deep
Anarchists in the world.  Most of them are subscribers
to the Advanced Freedom Solutions list.  To subscribe:
<mailto:afs-request@maillist.dundee.net> with SUBSCRIBE
in the message body.  One of the best ways to increase
the number of Deep Anarchists might be to publish a
series of science-fiction books on the topic.

As "Who Is John Galt?" <johngalt@veil.net> indicated earlier,
there is a tongue-in-cheek element in my "peme rules!"

So it's not all political memes that need to be
eliminated.  It's those that satisfy the above
definitions and questions.  It's a matter of
replacing pemes harmful to you with pemes more
useful to you -- pemes that increase your personal
power, while decreasing the power of "political
systems" over you.

Pemes are not "political genes."  They are political
*memes*.  See the definitions and the two questions
above.  Another term for the combination of harmful
pemes and the peme rules is NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic
Political Illusion Complex -- see
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm>.

Deep pemes are the most fundamental political enemies
and mind parasites.  As long as freedom lovers continue
to perpetuate and spread pemes, they help to reinforce
and perpetuate "political systems" at the deepest and
most powerful level.  Hence I formulated peme rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation."

Robert Ringer, in 'Restoring the American Dream,' in
Chapter 8 -- "Keeping It All in Place" -- indicates
how "political systems" are kept in place primarily
by pemes.  He exposes many surface pemes and a few
deep pemes.  But he doesn't go all the way to Deep
Anarchy.  He still communicates according to peme
rule 19, above.  Nevertheless, he does open the door
to Deep Anarchy.  'Restoring the American Dream' --
which I highly recommend -- is available from
<http://www.reliablehost.com/self-gov/product22.html>.

In order to clear harmful pemes from your mind,
it helps not only to clear from your mind the
notion that concepts prescribe, but also the
notion that they describe.  This is related to
the illusion that "words have meanings," as
opposed to "people have meanings for words."

In themselves, concepts don't describe.  However,
people can use concepts to describe to others,
provided they have similar meanings for the same
concepts.

How much power to coerce and control would politicians
and bureaucrats have, if a few more people realized
that meanings reside in themselves, rather than in
words?

Actually, most of your personal views are reactionary and conservative. Your
dream world seem to be High-Tech-Middle Ages. You know about most new

No, unless he checks the HTML code in-depth. And draws the right
conclusions. Even "illustrative" images would be enough, but that's the
obvious way of doing it. Invisible GIF images are worse.

Not to mention what you can do with JavaScript & RadioActiveX (check out
Fred McLain's 'Exploder' and 'Runner' controls for the latter). "But you can
turn on all security options." Yeah, but a) not everyone knows that and b)
M$ and N$ have shown us that they know how to implement so-called bugs that
allow to circumvent them. Every 2 months, M$ gives us a new buffer overflow
error. AND, last but not least, according to statistics for example of my
own website, only very few people use the latest browser versions. Most
still have versions with documented bugs in them. And the others have those
with undocumented bugs.

Fuck it, HTML in e-mail is a no-no.

Or 26,000 miles from the surface.  Still just a bright dot passing through the
night sky.

It is interesting to note that small asteroids pass closer than the moon
regularly, almost once per year in recent years if I read the data from the
Harvard-Smithsonian CfA correctly.  

Perhaps this will be a good chance to test an asteroid defense vehicle, after
the rock passes. Nuclear bomb or other propulsion based, we ought to test a
system for the purpose.  Perhaps public concern over this one could be used to
pry funding from the politicians, perhaps for SDIO or NASA.

I wish people would list the relative velocity for these objects the way they
mention diameter, there is considerable variation in orbital velocity for
asteroids, yes? Impact energy would go up with the square of the velocity and
the cube of the diameter, obviously.

  IAN: I think that the words of James above 
  are beautiful! I think that they are so true 
  they reach to levels much more profoundly 
  deep that the surface upon which they rest.

  BUT, even as I except them as true, in the 
  interest of truth inquiry, I have to question 
  if what they refer to is "bad." Why should we 
  not be subsumed into a collective entity? OK, 
  I can think of some reasons, but there may also 
  be a lot of reasons on the other side, such that 
  it may not be a 100% "bad" thing, but, like most 
  things, may be a fuzzy "good/bad" thing.

  If we hold that the subsummation James posits is
  100% bad, and thus individual entities should not
  be unconsciously subsumed into larger entities,
  then we individuals would not even exist, for the 
  individual ameba and primary cells should not have
  been subsumed into the large collective entities 
  that each of us as human beings are.

  So the subsuming of individuals into a collective 
  entity cannot be more frightful or "wrong" than our 
  existence as individual entities! So why then should 
  this admittedly "good thing" not extend on and on 
  to higher levels of collective entities?

  I'm not advocating that "it should" or that "it 
  should not," I'm just asking the questions that 
  are necessary to the process of truth inquiry. 


  We might also ponder, the meanings of "being sub-
  summed." I have a very collectivist view of the 
  free market. I think that the "invisible hand" is 
  the true collective entity. That the modulation
  of commodity pricing by supply and demand is the 
  true form of socialism and what we call "socialism"
  is properly defined as "anti-socialism." The true
  collective entity is the sum of all the people,
  which is the collective sum of consumer demand,
  NOT the whim of a central planing office im-
  possed by threat of violence onto society.
  Such is the rape of the social entity!

  Free-market capitalism = real socialism 
  Central planning = pseudo-socialism

  So in that paradigm, the true collective is 
  voluntary, and the involuntary just a prison.

Actually, Spacewatch is funded, but not heavily. It appears to have primary
viewing rights
to its little Kitt Peak 36" telescope. It uses it 20 nights a month. On the
other nights, the moon
is too bright for this purpose. apparently, the only other funded continuous
effort
is NEAR, which runs 6 nights a month on a Air Force "scope in Hawaii. Total
funding
for both projects is less than $1M/year. The projects have mapped about 10% of
the
space they need to map for good coverage of earth-crossing asteriods, which make
up
about 90 percent of the threat. Not surprisingly, SpaceWatch has found most of
the
108 objects regarded as "potentially hazerdous", including 1997XF11. Spacewatch
seems to be a professor and some grad students. NEAR seems to be a professor,
an administrator, and some grad students.

Statitistically, this says to be that there are probably ten more out there that

are at least as dangerous as this one and that could be identified with just a
little bit
of funding.

Amateur astronomers contribute greatly to this effort. The Pros find the rocks
and
publish their initial position, and the amateurs then track them and refine the
orbits.
This is why Spacewatch found this puppy in decenber but the news about the
near miss didn't surface until today.

The other 10 percent of the problem are comets coming in from the outer Solar
system.
It will take a lot more observing time and/or bigger scopes to see these guys in
time
to do anythinbg about them.

Sarah Brightman -- Who wants to live forever

There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams,
Yet slips away from us.


Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever, .....?


There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us.


Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever, .....?


Now touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today.


Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever, .....?


Who waits forever anyway?

How about this also applying to whoever it is on the list using some unix text
editor that puts "=20" characters at the end of each line. That is very
annoying, and they have the gall to complain about HTML tags.

Neither do I. Granted, public venues like a mail list should have a standardized
language, and I notice that most non Angloriginal web pages present their
content in both english and the native language, (although the translation
services on search engines like Alta Vista are making that not so necessary) but
people who share a common language that is not english shouldn't in any way have
to use english for personal communications via email. One ding against the idea
of using special character/font tags for characters like umlauts is that this
will likely screw up the accuracy of auto translators that are available on the
web.

<ANTIRANT>My Libertarian views are not reactionary, at least not now,
considering that the status quo is a welfare liberal statist establishment. They
are hardly conservative. Approving of abortion? Approving of suicide and
assisted suicide? Approving of personal drug freedom? Approving of personal
choice in pornography, cryptography, etc.? Oh, I'm just a freaking nazi, I am.

Not a bad analogy, but possibly more renaissance, depending on what
characteristics of the middle ages you are referring to. If you are talking
about free enterprise, low tax, self reliant, spirit of exploration and
adventure, then I wont argue.

To a transhuman, the sum of the self extends beyond the mere flesh body. Energy
and Material tools and resources are merely extensions of the self. As property
defines ones resources, property defines the self of a transhuman. Technology
was developed in order to more easily expand the size and utility of ones
property.

> All work and no play make Mike a dull boy.

Sure, which is why I enjoy playing with my new rifle, or my new fly rod, up at
the family cabin in the North Country, driving my red Jeep Cherokee 4.0 liter
4x4 to get there, or just staying in town for the weekend and shooting a few
rounds of skeet, or going skiing. When I'm home, I like to play on my PC
equipped with an Intel P II 233 with 64MRAM, 4.8G of hard drive space, 6x CD rom
and 2x/4x CD writer, 4800dpi 24 bit color flatbed scanner, HP color printer, or
with my Casio digital camera. I can't decide, though, what to buy this summer
though, either an ultralight plane, or a share in an oil well in Louisiana....
decisions, decisions, decision.....

Don't blow it up! Capture it! It's a 1 mile strip miners dream. This way
we don't have to go get one. It came to us! Just launch some equipment
to guide it into the right orbit and mine the hell out of it. 

We really need to know its velocity in a bad way. A slow asteroid hitting

Is lobjan spoken by the 80 million people on the web today? Since most of those people use a mail
reader which is HTML capable, it is silly to hold out for the few iconoclasts.

Tell me, a skilled user of a slide rule can frequently calculate faster than a person using a hand
calculator. If this is true, then why are slide rules now museum peices? WHat do you think the Air
Force would have said to a contractor that insisted on doing all its engineering work with slide
rules? When I visit Seattle and go down to the International district, I can often see elderly asian
merchants still using abacuses, and whipping along pretty fiercely. However, I don't see them
getting much business from anyone but first generation immigrants, who still revere the aged.

Sure it works pretty well. Englascii is a fine standard for may discussion type exchanges. However,
in order to deliver more complex content, we will eventually have to move to a type of markup
standard, to allow better organisation and presentation of information. As the average individual
starts getting a hundred or more email messages a day, I can easily forsee the need for use of
graphs and tables. I can read a graph with one glance, while it takes 10-30 seconds to digest even a
well laid out table. An ascii table with more than a couple rows and columns is a major effort of
deciphering, unless you happen to have the exact same font set on your reader.

This was just a small fraction of data on near earth asteroid encounters predicted over the next 30
years.

However, If I had used HTML, I could have presented the same information is a graphical format, with
links to other graphic formats, that would all have been much easier to use than 30 pages of an
ascii text table that doesn't even align properly.

Even if its relavit velocity is less than a few hundred miles per hour, if it were
on an intercept course, the earth's gravity as it approached would accelerate it
to the point that it would be traveling at around 25,000 mph when it hit.

Being a mile wide, it will be spending too little time in the atmosphere at that
speed for it to slow down very much at all.

Don't beleive me? Ask James Rogers, or check the list archives. There was an epic
battle on the subject of using  moonrocks and asteroids as weapons in a Moon-Earth
war here a year or two ago(maybe it wason the transhuman list?). John kindly
concured on the usefullness of such large objects. That we now know that there are
at least 100 such large objects that will pass within 1/10th of an astronomical
unit, at least once each in the next 33 years indicates indicates that lunar
rebels will not need the use of  a mass launcher to threaten Earth with. There are
plenty of much bigger rocks up there already that are passing by, just ready to be
steered off course.

Where would we get the energy to nudge the asteroid into orbit?

While I'm writing, I may as well add a question I have been meaning to
ask, prompted by the UNIX mail readers' dislike of HTML mail: Does Meta
Mail such as that sent by MS Exchange also cause problems for you?

I might add that I don't use Exchange through choice, it is part of the
"Standard Desktop" where I work.

Brad.

Thats the easy part, since its alread in near earth orbit, simply put a
small mass driver or plasma thruster and some solar panels on it.  Use a
portion of its own mass as reaction mass, with solar power for driver
energy. Getting that stuff up and installed would take a couple billion
dollars, which would gain the investor several trillion dollars in metal in
LEO... its a no brainer, really.

Exchange has a setting on it that causes the lines to wrap when sent out.
Most people don't realize this, and cause messages that are a couple of feet
wide on anybody elses mail readers. This is annoying. It is entirely
fixable.

There *should* be a fourth item in the list: reparation.

Unfortunately, your failure to mention it is entirely correct.

Deterrence has been shown to be somewhat effective when an 
intelligent person would rationally expect to be caught.

Today in the US, your chances of being caught rest not on how much 
damage you do, but on how directly you violate government usurpations 
of power.

The government performing its proper function would prohibit burglary 
and mugging; commit those crimes, you probably won't get caught.

The government performing its proper function would NOT prohibit 
buying marijuana, and wouldn't be collecting a personal income tax at 
all.  Try to buy marijuana, or scrimp a bit on your income taxes, and 
your chances of getting caught are vastly higher than if you merely 
mug somebody in the street.

Some studies seem to indicate that the arrest rate (assuming they 
only arrest people they have a good chance of being able to 
successfully prosecute) is the most relevant factor, that the 
severity of the punishment is almost irrelevant to deterrence.

But being caught would be little deterrent, if no punishment 
followed.

If you know of a less medieval institution than private property, which
is better at producing a lively and robust economy, would you post the

Mind you, being a bit of a romantic (former member of the Society for
Creative Anachronism), I confess I do find "High-Tech-Middle Ages"
rather appealing.  Everyone a noble, with machines for peasants; every
noble living in a semiautonomous fief, with banner flying ...

I don't think I've seen MIME-clutter in any post that complained about
HTML-clutter.

How about people who don't clean up their quoted matter?

The question, rather, is how much its velocity (or rather its orbital
kinetic energy) can *add* to that.

I don't know what modem speed you are using. I'm on a 33.6, but usually I'm hooked up at
24.4-28.8k, and I have no problems, unless a page is just full of animation. However,
I've noticed that shockwave graphics are much faster. If you are at 256k, geez, cut your
whining. Unless its a VR presentation, if you are having speed problems, then its cause
your video card can't handle it, its not your CPU. Get a matrox card

If you look at your resource meter while you are loading pages, unless your computer is
slower than a 133 Pentium, they will take a small fraction of its resources. Win98 alone
would take up much more space....  I take it that 98 is a dog?

I dunno, gabo's corp site loads rather quickly over my 33.6 link, and runs very quickly.
If he actually used it for presenting information other than to sell his webauthroing
services, it would be awesome. If it didn't require the shockwave plugin to run, it
would be even better, but shockwave is rather widely used, so its really not that big of
a deal.

Sure, some will use commands to control the backgrounds, but the interfaces will be mind
generated interpreting simple markup commands which speak volumes when referencing
already loaded, commonly used kernels. Vinge's True Names was the most accurate, though
I doubt that one could actually suffer any damage other than an epileptic seizure from
an attack over VR.

If you've not heard anythign about it but mail list gossip, I would hope that you did a
little more research than just going to the site to buy it. Maybe you like blowing money
on things you may not use. I don't.

If you are at 256k connection, I sure hope that that is one hell of a demo if it takes
you 5 minutes to download.  Thats a 10 meg file, compressed. As much as 100 megs of
programming unpacked.--

Since there are 900 million indians in a very large country, i really
cannot beleive that you have an accurate assessment of the country by
anecdotal accounts even if you live there (and much less if you've just
visited or never placed a foot in the country).  Also, the population
being so high, statistics lend themselves naturally for this kind of
thing, and, as limited as GDP/capita, lifespan and literacy rates may be
in informing about the general well-being of a country's population, they
tend to give an approximate idea, especially if they are combined. So,
what follows is somthing i've collected over the last hour (i would like
to include more countries, but i don't have that much spare time):

>From the '96 CIA factbook:


Spanish colonies:
Country		Lifespan	Literacy	GDP/capita

Argentina	71.66		96.2%		8100
Bolivia		59.81		83.1		2530
Chile		74.49		95.2		8000
Colombia	72.81		91.3		5300
Costa Rica	75.72		94.8		5400
Cuba		75.05		95.7		1300
Dominican Rep	69.06		82.1		3400
Ecuador		71.09		90.1		4100
El Salvador	68.88		71.5		1950
Guatemala	65.24		55.6		3300
Honduras	68.42		72.7		1980
Mexico		73.67		89.6		7700
Nicaragua	65.72		65.7		1700
Panama		73.92		90.8		5100
Paraguay	73.84		92.1		3200
Peru		69.13		88.7		3600
Uruguay		74.94		97.3		7600
Venezuela	72.09		91.1		9300


English colonies:  (Michael Lorrey's list)


Bangladesh	55.86		38.1		1130
Belize		68.53		70.3		2750
Burma		56.14		83.1		1000
Egypt		61.43		51.4		2760
India		59.71		52.0		1500
Kenya		55.6		78.1		1300
Pakistan	58.46		37.8		2100
South Africa	59.47		81.8		4800
Sri Lanka	72.35		90.2		3600
(Ceylon)
Zimbabwe	41.85		85		1620
(Rhodesia)



Again, taking into account the limitations of statistics like this, the
differences are so enormous and consistent that my previous statement
would have to be revised: not only do those english colonies not do better
than the spanish colonies (haven't seen the french stats yet), they do
much, much worse.  And if india is the light of anything, then the world
is really screwed.

Since there are 900 million indians in a very large country, i really
cannot beleive that you have an accurate assessment of the country by
anecdotal accounts even if you live there (and much less if you've just
visited or never placed a foot in the country).  Also, the population
being so high, statistics lend themselves naturally for this kind of
thing, and, as limited as GDP/capita, lifespan and literacy rates may be
in informing about the general well-being of a country's population, they
tend to give an approximate idea, especially if they are combined. So,
what follows is somthing i've collected over the last hour (i would like
to include more countries, but i don't have that much spare time):

>From the '96 CIA factbook:


Spanish colonies:
Country		Lifespan	Literacy	GDP/capita

Argentina	71.66		96.2%		8100
Bolivia		59.81		83.1		2530
Chile		74.49		95.2		8000
Colombia	72.81		91.3		5300
Costa Rica	75.72		94.8		5400
Cuba		75.05		95.7		1300
Dominican Rep	69.06		82.1		3400
Ecuador		71.09		90.1		4100
El Salvador	68.88		71.5		1950
Guatemala	65.24		55.6		3300
Honduras	68.42		72.7		1980
Mexico		73.67		89.6		7700
Nicaragua	65.72		65.7		1700
Panama		73.92		90.8		5100
Paraguay	73.84		92.1		3200
Peru		69.13		88.7		3600
Uruguay		74.94		97.3		7600
Venezuela	72.09		91.1		9300


English colonies:  (Michael Lorrey's list)


Bangladesh	55.86		38.1		1130
Belize		68.53		70.3		2750
Burma		56.14		83.1		1000
Egypt		61.43		51.4		2760
India		59.71		52.0		1500
Kenya		55.6		78.1		1300
Pakistan	58.46		37.8		2100
South Africa	59.47		81.8		4800
Sri Lanka	72.35		90.2		3600
(Ceylon)
Zimbabwe	41.85		85		1620
(Rhodesia)



Again, taking into account the limitations of statistics like this, the
differences are so enormous and consistent that my previous statement
would have to be revised: not only do those english colonies not do better
than the spanish colonies (haven't seen the french stats yet), they do
much, much worse.  And if india is the light of anything, then the world
is really screwed.

It does seem an interesting phenomenon that many of the most
forward thinkers I know have romantic attachments to particular
anachronisms: Friedman was in the SCA as well.  I have a strange
fondness for bow ties (and not those clip-on monstrosities) and
dry Martinis.  AI have a friend who invests in private space
exploration stocks while driving a restored Studebaker.

I suppose for some it is just homage to the best of past while
replacing what needs to be replaced, but I think it's more than
that in most cases.  What evolutionary advantage was conferred
upon those of us who invented the concept of "classic" that made
it such a common meme?

No, if they're really intelligent they won't want to punish the lion, they'll 
want to kill it. Time wasted in causing the lion more pain before they  kill 
it could be better spent looking for food or dealing with other dangerous lions.

Not with my money! I'm amazed, I thought you were tough on crime. Another 
thing I was amazed at is when you included slander as a crime worthy of 
punishment. In the first place I don't want the government or anybody else to 
get into the truth determining business, I'd rather do that  myself, in the 
second place, if you don't like the sound I make with my mouth then make some

That sounds a lot like Science Fiction writer David Brin's fist non fiction 
book called "The  Transparent Society", I don't know it it's been published 
yet. Brin advocates a world where nobody, not the President not the lowest 
bum, could have any secrets. Cameras would be everywhere and be available to 
all at any time, also, all files and records of any sort  would be open to
anybody who wanted to read them. You would know all of my deep dark secrets 
but I would know all of yours, the police could spy on you all they want but 
you could spy on the police as well.

Mr. Brin's idea is not going to work, and I politely explained to him why, at 
that point a totally unexpected phenomena occurred, Mr. Brin went non linear.  
In the interest of fairness I should tell you that Mr. Brin is not one of my 
favorite people and when his big budget movie flopped spectacularly last
Christmas I felt a tinge of joy at his misfortune, but at least I had the 
good grace to be ashamed of myself. By the way, I never read "The Postman" or 
saw the movie and probably never will, but "the Holnists" are in it and I'd 
be interested if anybody knows what they (it?) are, I have a hunch it's 
something pretty nasty because Brin compared me to them and I'm quite sure
he wasn't trying to give me a compliment.

Anyway, as I told Mr. Brin, I personally find his idea repulsive but that's  
irrelevant because it's not going to happen. Brin's world is inherently  
unstable, so discussing its merits is like talking about if it would be fun  
to live in a world where the second law of thermodynamics worked backward.    
If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the
marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing  
about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the  
privacy meme. On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but  
everybody else has secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage 
and shrink, and so  will the transparency meme.  

Brin's  assuming that by some black magic everyone can tell if I'm using  
cryptography, but in actuality, the fact that I have a secret is a secret. 
There are ways of putting information in a form so that it's useful to me and 
nobody else, or if I prefer, I can make it useful to you and me and nobody 
else. There are ways I can prove that I have a certain piece of secret 
information without giving you the slightest clue as to what that information 
is. There are ways of using DC nets so that you not only don't know what I'm 
saying you don't even know who I'm talking to. There are ways of using 
Steganography so you not only don't know who I'm talking to, you don't even 
know I'm talking.

What about cameras, if I can see what you're typing cryptography does no good.

Well, Brin generously granted us privacy in the bedroom and bathroom (what a 
swell guy) and that's all I'd need.

OK, just for that you can't have privacy even there.

Then I'd find the camera in my bedroom, splice into the video line, and play 
back a recording of me reading the Bible, saluting the flag, marching around 
the bed in time to martial music and generally being a good little boy. Now I 
can do what I want.

But cameras can be very small nowadays, how will you find it?

I'll just go down to Big Brother's Ministry Of Truth and ask.

They'll see you splice into the line.

There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all of 
the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.

How will you know when nobody is watching?

I'll ask.

What if they make recordings?

Now that I have a little privacy I'll take my time, hack into the system and 
alter the recording. This only has to be done one time by one person because 
now I'm in a position to help my friends.

How will you know how to get around network security?

I'll ask.

What if there is a secret camera you don't know about?

Then I'm in trouble, but Big Brother is in worse trouble. Think of the 
scandal! Big Brother, the very apostle of transparency has a secret, what 
other secrets does he have? How can anybody ever trust him again?

In practice there is no such thing as "a slow asteroid hitting".  
There are only "too damn fast" and "even faster".   The MINIMUM 
impact speed we can plausibly expect is escape velocity, and this is 
assuming that the body's former orbit nearly amounted to a docking 
maneuver with Earth -- any variation from that will either *increase* 
the impact speed, or prevent a collision.

Now a slow collision with an aeroshell manufactured in orbit from 
asteroidal materials, is a completely different matter...

Another factor to consider is that there are some potential orbital 
hazards that are easy to spot because they are in only mildly 
elliptical orbits and don't get much further from the sun than the 
earth does.  And there are others that are much harder to spot 
because they are in seriously elliptical orbits and spend most of 
their time substantially further from the sun (i.e. less well lit).  
These latter bodies also have the interesting characteristic that 
they are much more likely to *not* orbit in the plane of the ecliptic 
(or anywhere near it), so they are more likely to come from a totally 
unexpected reaction.

And for the real kicker: they'll be moving a *lot* faster when they 
cross earth orbit.

A slide rule might be faster to gauge the values, vor precision work one
would want to use a calculator. It takes much more effort to learn to
handle a slide rule, and the skills are much more difficult to maintain.

I would be highly irritated, if someone insisted on clogging up my mailbox
with 30 pages of content which is of little relevance to me (above
material was not). The netiquette would seem to supply a two-line summary,
followed by an invitation/url to access the material on a web site.

This will take a while, but would be very nice for a Toutatis-type
asteroid in an orbit close to the Earth's. The problem is the quick
ones (like new comets) that might sweep through the Earth-moon system
once in a while, we have less time to do something about them after
discovery than the Toutatis NEOs and they have a much larger velocity
vector. More heroic measures may be needed, since we need a much
larger isp.

Ah, nothing like selective statistics. Since you included in the Spanish list
countries that were early colonies, and tended to exterminate the natives, you
should do the same with the English list, and include the US, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, the Falklands, etc to your calculations. Otherwise leave out most of
the Spanish list.... Please recalculate.

Subject: try this drug, write about it, and get thousands of web hits

Someone (Zev Bryant)  left a copy of nature:structural biology on my
floor. The article with the heavy reading was related to a new-to-the-west
nootropic herb called huperzia serrata; drug compound in medline as
huperzine.  (chinese/sawtooth club moss - looks like mistletoe) 

It only has 43 mentions so far on altavista, most of which have nothing to
do with pharmacology.  You can probably get it -now- in chinatown.  I hope
it is a better smart drug than ginkgo!  It has better stats (If I remember
correctly) than lucidril in its one study of 50 Alzheimers patients... 

If someone tries it, and writes about it, their essay will get zillions of
hits (like the 85K to DXM!).  GNC (the safeway of pill stores) might start
putting it in tablets in a few months.  If you essay on this please do a
rigorous test... 

Fig leaf: I'm really not into drugs; I'm just fascinated by improvements
in legal nootropics.

Effect of huperzine A, a novel acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor, on radial maze performance in rats.

Xiong ZQ, Tang XC

Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy
of Sciences.

Rats were trained to run in a spatial, radial arm maze using a procedure
to determine two memory functions, working and reference memory. The
muscarinic antagonist, not the nicotinic antagonist, impaired both working
and reference memory of rats. Scopolamine (0.125, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg, IP,
30 min before a session) significantly impaired choice accuracy in the
eight-arm maze. In contrast, mecamylamine (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) did not
affect the performance.  Huperzine A (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg, IP, 30 min
before testing) and physostigmine (0.3 mg/kg, IP, 20 min before testing)
could reverse scopolamine-induced deficits in the task. Chronic treatment
with huperzine A (0.25 mg/kg, PO, once a day) for 8 consecutive days was
as potent as acute treatment on attenuating the scopolamine-induced
amnesia. 

*** Gotta love it - helpful against nerve gas.
Huperzine A as a pretreatment candidate drug against
nerve agent toxicity.

Grunwald J, Raveh L, Doctor BP, Ashani Y

Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona.

Huperzine A (HUP) is a naturally-occurring, potent, reversible inhibitor
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that crosses the blood-brain barrier. To
examine its ability to protect against nerve agent poisoning, HUP was
administered i.p. to mice, and the s.c. LD50 of soman was determined at
various time intervals after pretreatment. Results were compared to those
obtained for animals treated with physostigmine. A protective ratio of
approximately 2 was maintained for at least 6 hr after a single injection
of HUP, without the need for any post-challenge drug therapy. By contrast,
pretreatment with physostigmine increased the LD50 of soman by 1.4- to
1.5-fold for only up to 90 min. The long-lasting antidotal efficacy
displayed by HUP correlated with the time course of the blood-AChE
inhibition. The results suggest that the protection of animals by HUP from
soman poisoning was achieved by temporarily sequestering the active site
region of the physiologically important AChE.

Efficacy of tablet huperzine-A on memory, cognition, and
behavior in Alzheimer's disease.

Xu SS, Gao ZX, Weng Z, Du ZM, Xu WA, Yang JS, Zhang ML, Tong ZH, Fang YS, Chai XS,
et al

Zhejiang Supervision and Detection Station of Drug Abuse, Zhejiang Medical
University, Hangzhou,
China.

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tablet huperzine-A (Hup) in
patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Using multicenter,
prospective, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled and randomized
method, 50 patients were administered orally 0.2 mg (4 tablets) Hup and 53
patients were given po 4 tablets of placebo bid for 8 wk. All patients
were evaluated with Wechsler memory scale, Hasegawa dementia scale,
mini-mental state examination scale, activity of daily living scale,
treatment emergency symptom scale, and measured with BP, HR, ECG, EEG,
ALT, AKP, BUN, Cr, Hb, WBC, and urine routine. RESULTS: About 58% (29/50)
of patients treated with Hup showed improvements in their memory (P <
0.01), cognitive (P < 0.01), and behavioral (P < 0.01 functions. The
efficacy of Hup was better than placebo (36%, 19/53) (P < 0.05). No severe
side effect was found. CONCLUSION: Hup is a promising drug for symptomatic
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Huperzine A ameliorates the spatial working memory
impairments induced by AF64A.

Zhi QX, Yi FH, XI CT

Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy
of Sciences,
People's Republic of China.

Huperzine A, a novel, potent, reversible, and selective
acetylcholinesterase (AChE)  inhibitor has been expected to be superior to
other AChE inhibitors now for the treatment of memory deficits in patients
with Alzheimer's disease. We have assessed the effects of huperzine A on
performance of AF64A-treated rats in the radial maze. AF64A (2 nmol per
side, i.c.v.) caused significant impairment in rats' ability to perform
the spatial working memory task. This behavioural impairment was
associated with a significant decrease in the activity of choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus. Huperzine A (0.4-0.5 mg kg-1,
i.p.) significantly ameliorated the AF64A-induced memory deficit. These
results suggest that AF64A is a useful agent for disrupting working memory
processes by altering hippocampal cholinergic function, and such
impairment can be effectively ameliorated by huperzine A.

Development of natural products as drugs acting on
central nervous system.

Zhu XZ

Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy
of Sciences.

We have recently studied several natural product constituents which have
effects on the CNS. (1)  Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) and its analogues were
isolated from Corydalis ambigua and various species of Stephania. (+)-THP
and (-)-THP possess not only analgesic activity, but also exert
sedative-tranquilizing and hypnotic actions. Results of receptor binding
assay and their pre- and post-synaptic effects on dopaminergic system
indicate that (-)-THP and (-)-stepholidine are dopamine receptor
antagonists while (+)-THP is a selective dopamine depletor. (2) 
3-Acetylaconitine (AAC) is an alkaloid isolated from Aconitum flavum. The
relative potency of analgesic action of AAC was 5.1-35.6 and 1250-3912
times that of morphine and aspirin, respectively. The analgesic effect of
AAC was not antagonized by naloxone, but was eliminated by reserpine. In
monkeys, after AAC was injected for 92 days, no abstinence syndrome was
seen after sudden AAC withdrawal or when challenged with nalorphine. (3)
Huperzine A (Hup-A)  is an alkaloid isolated from Huperzia serrata which
was found to be a selective ChE inhibitor and could improve learning and
retrieval processes. Preliminary clinical studies showed that Hup-A
improve short- and long-term memory in patients of cerebral
arteriosclerosis with memory impairment. (4)  Ranamargarin is a new
tetradecapeptide isolated from the skin of the Chinese frog Rana
margaratae.  This peptide may mainly act on NK-1 receptor. 

***Delta waves!  EEG power      eeek.
[Effects of huperzine A on electroencephalography power
spectrum in rabbits].

[Article in Chinese]

Guan LC, Chen SS, Lu WH, Tang XC

Huperzine A (Hup-A) is a new alkaloid extracted from Huperzia serata in
China. The effects of Hup-A on learning and memory are superior to those
of physostigmine (Phys). The purpose of this paper is to observe the
effects of Hup-A on EEG and EEG power spectrum in rabbits with
micro-computer analysis. Hup-A 0.1 mg/kg iv in conscious rabbits produced,
after 0.5 min, an alert EEG pattern, which showed decreases of lower
frequency components and the total EEG power in cortical area, and the
dominant frequency transferred from delta rhythm to theta rhythm in
hippocampus. The same effects were seen with Phys 0.1 mg/kg. Scopolamine
(Scop, 0.2 mg/kg iv)  reversed significantly these effects of Hup-A (10
micrograms/rabbit, icv), but Scop butylbromide (0.4 mg/kg, iv) which can
not pass the blood-brain barrier did not. Hup-A 0.2 mg/kg iv or Phys 0.3
mg/kg iv antagonized the EEG effects of Scop 0.3 mg/kg iv. The results
indicate that the effects of Hup-A are closely related to the action on
the central cholinergic system.

General Nutrition Corp. has notified the Food and Drug Administration of
its intent to market a new dietary ingredient, Huperzine A, an alkaloid
compound extracted from the herb Huperzia serrata. 

The supplement will contain Huperzine A at a level of 50 micrograms in a
tablet or capsule, with a suggestion to take once per day, the firm said
in an Aug. 25 letter, placed on the public record after the 75-day
premarket notification period required under the Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act... 



Postnote:  50mcg tablets = 1/4 the dose in the alzheimer's study.

Sorry, I tend to widen it out so that multiple message quotes don't cause so much word wrapping. It

Nice, but huperzine doesn't strike me as that wonderful really. It is
just a new acetylcholinestrase inhibitor. Of course, it opens up the
possibilities of a new spectrum of AChIs and might exist in a
convenient form, but I still think manipulating the ACh levels is a
fairly crude way of modulating memory (you temporarily increase
learning *and* forgetting, at least in my memory model). I want
something more specific, ideally active during memory
consolidation... hmm, anybody trying nootropics just before going to
bed?

[ The original article Eugene cited seems awfully close to an
advertisment for General Nutrition Corp. Its scientific content was
not very strong, the usual bunch of medline abstracts mixing animal
and Alzheimer studies with impossible-to-find articles that give
nootropics a bad name among sceptics. Sure, huperzine likely has the
effects the abstracts point at, but that doesn't make it a good
nootropic. ]

Yup -- I forgot that one. But it's not a strategy for dealing with crime; it's
one way of responding after the event. (An ideal strategy for dealing with 
crime is one that focusses on preventing crimes being committed, not on
bolting the stable door after the horse has fled.)

This was also a punishment in the UK in the early 19th century. UK law
at the time was based on something historians know as the Bloody Code.
There were no police, as we know them, but freelance commercial "thief
takers" and various ways by which people might be arrested and come up
before the justices. And if they _were_ arrested and tried, the likely
verdict was Death -- death for everything, for stealing the equivalent
of two loaves of bread. This is obviously a disproportionate response,
and so it became the practice for judges to recommend clemency; it got
to the point where only 20% of people sentenced to hang were actually
hanged, and the process was almost entirely arbitrary.

England was _extremely_ lawless in those days, by modern standards.
Interestingly, the judicial system focussed on protecting property,
not people: Attempted murder was treated as a minor misdemeanor, but
rape was a crime against property (women being chattel), and rape
in marriage was seen as a contradiction in terms. However, pick-pocketing
was enough to guarantee the law would prescribe a neck-stretching -- 
and the humans who administered it would usually prescribe clemency.

In short, having punishments that are so severe that nobody wants to
enforce them is nearly as bad as no punishment at all. As is
inconsistency. Relatively mild penalties can be enough -- if the risk
of incurring them is seen as a dead certainty by potential criminals.
("If I burgle that house with the open window I _will_ be tracked down
and go to prison for six months ... hmm, I didn't like it there last 
time.  Think I'll pass.")

As for the fairly tiny proportion of dangerous recidivists -- well, I'm
not opposed to the death penalty because it's painful or extreme; I'm
opposed to it because it's irreversible. The British judicial system 
has maintained a constant error rate of about 10-12% on murder convictions
throughout the 20th century, as indicated by original verdicts being 
struck down. In many cases in the past 20 years, people have been found
to have been wrongly convicted decades after the event. Before the death
penalty was suspended in 1965, the appeals process was abbreviated; if
you were found guilty of murder you would hang within ten weeks. In
contrast, the recidivism rate for murderers in the UK is less than 0.2%;
a life sentence here means a minimum of 14 years, a mean of 22 years,
and lifetime supervision thereafter, with the option of no release
at all for serious cases. So the death penalty in the UK resulted in the
deaths of more innocent people than mandatory life sentences for murder,
as currently enforced. 

Personally, I don't much like paying taxes that support people in
prison, but the alternatives -- letting them free, or killing them --
are worse. Maybe freezing (when proven reversible) would be an
acceptable alternative to execution; it takes dangerous ones out of
circulation permanently, but its reversible if you find there was a
mistake. Certainly I'd be willing to pay taxes towards that -- it'd be
cheaper than prison, and one way of viewing it is that the cost is
insurance against the possibility of miscarriages of justice in capital
cases.

Selective my foot.  I made it as extensive as my knowledge and time
restricted me to.  I included all the countries which i was sure were
spanish colonies, and i included all the countries you mentioned.  And in
any case your separation between early and late colonisation
is bogus since Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon and South Africa were
all colonised at approximately the same time, you are just dividing them
into countries that did well and countries that didn't.  In any case, my
main point was in showing that your statement, and i quote, "If you looked 
at a list of countries today that were once British colonies, and compared
them to the former colonies of other former great powers, you would find
that the former British colonies are today much more stable, and developed
economically, politically, and culturally, by and large."  Especially,
this last bit "by and large", since only 4 colonies have done well, and
the rest have done extremely poorly, by contrast to the extensive list of
ex-spanish colonies, of which i don't think any of them had a lower
gdp/capita, literacy rate or lifespan than india, which by your reckoning
was one of the bright stars of the third world in industry,... (can't be
bothered to find the quote).  
chau
PS:  BTW, of the spanish countries, i would say that only a couple of
countries wiped out their native population, in most of them, they are
still a majority (in the diluted mestizo form).

Personal Computers were designed as multipurpose machines, yet all
mine seems to do is run software!  Windows 95, a huge monolith of a
program, does nothing more than DOS.  It may contain libraries of code
used by the programs that it runs, but it does nothing else but run
them.  Its interface is so minimalist - a start bar, some windows -
that I would be happy saying it doesn't have one.

My operating system on the other hand (let's call it Wax OS) is truly
multipurpose.  You can take it home, install it, boot up, and write a
letter.  Or, for that matter, any number of other things without once
having to stop to buy software.  The interface is a work of art - it
dynamically represents interaction between the user and a document
(and nothing more.)  This isn't a "graphic" interface this is a
"visual" interface.  If you can load a document and you can edit it,
these two processes are now the same.  The document IS the interface,
and the interface IS the application.

The "document" can be anything from some text to Quake 2, the
interface is a bunch of components that are visually represented, and
the application is a combination of the two.

User-centric Design

Well, the nazis approved something *they* called assisted suicide. It was
called Euthanasia.

There are different conservative groups. One is the religous-right,
Republican group. You're hardly part of that group. But there's also a group
of technology freaks that argue based on ideas that were refuted a long time
ago. I call this conservative. You call it Extropy.

I don't disagree with this. I disagree, however, with the assumption that
gun ownership and protection of non-transhuman property with deadly force is
even worth discussing. I also disagree that natural selection applies to
cultural evolution.

This same inane discussion about HTML mail has taken place
on every one of the 30 or so mailing lists I'm on, and it
has failed to enlighten anyone, just as it is failing to do
anything useful here.

On the good lists, an active listowner simply makes a post
that says "here's the standard for this list; end of
discussion."  If ExI would get around to privatizing this
list as they've claimed they would for months now, they
could have done that easily as well with more authority.

  IAN: So what's your definition of

  I'd say that the evidence dictates
  that Mr. Sherwood is a "crackpot."

  IAN: Thanks Phil for sharing the poem with us!
  I should note that,  even as I might wish that
  it were so, holistic-identity theory could not
  properly be considered an "extropian concept."

  While I believe that most extropians are open 
  to the idea (as I believe intellectual tolerance
  and exploration are extropian identities) and 
  many can see the underlying truth in holism, it
  seems to me that the concept (fallacy) of "free
  entity/identity" is the prevailing identity meme
  among those who identity themselves as extropians,
  as it is in most other "ideological" categories.

  I believe that the concept of "free entity" is 
  exactly analogous to the concept of "free energy,"
  and as such both are identically fallacies. Both
  energy and identity are conserved. The energy in
  subsystem X comes from energy derived by relation 
  to energy outside the system, and no energy in the
  system comes from the system itself -- which is
  to say that subsystem X does not cause new, or 
  "free," energy to come into existence, it only 
  gains from and losses energy to not-subsystem X.

  The energy associated with subsystem X is never
  the private property of subsystem X, it is only
  "on loan" from the whole. Energy is holistic.

  So too, the identity of subsystem X is derived 
  by relation to identity outside the system, and 
  no identity attribute of subsystem X comes from 
  subsystem X -- which is to say that subsystem X
  does not cause an increase in net identity, it
  only gains from and losses identity to not-subX.
  It gains by difference and losses by similarity.

  The identity associated with subsystem X is never
  the private property of subsystem X, it is only 
  "on loan" from the whole. Identity is holistic.

  This is simply because identity is a product of 
  * difference * and the difference between a thing
  and itself is null, just as the energy created by
  a thing is null. The difference between A and A 
  equals zero; so the definition of identity "A=A" 
  is a perfect fallacy. Where A refers to the entire 
  universe, we find that indeed the sum total of all
  identity attributes equals zero, as I have proven
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm , just 
  as net universal energy equals zero. 

  I'm working away attempting to perfect the descrip-
  tion of the holism of identity and the identity 
  (defined as "same as") between holistic identity
  and everything: energy, force, velocity, gravity,
  space-time, electromagnetic charge... Once I have
  done that, perhaps people will test the idea and 
  see that free entity is the same fallacy as free 
  energy -- you cannot get something from nothing,
  everything is the product of interrelating subsets.

You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,
rather than just a right left spectrum. One axis represents relative social
freedom, and the other represents relative economic freedom. While American
conservatives occupy the high economic,low social freedom corner, and nazis and
communists occupy the low economic, low social freedom corner, libertarians
occupy the high, high corner, while the international anarchists typically are
in the high social, low economic corner.

Categorizing me in with religiouys conservatives is as insulting as puttin an
anarchist in with Stalin. Please be more discrete in your definitions.

A good way to describe the age of exploration, or of the Viking era. My own
family lived in Nova Scotia prior to Jamestown and the Mayflower, at least part
of the year.

I disagree, as the idea that the state has the right to use deadly force in
redistributing my property which they confiscate from me without due process or
proper Constitutional authority is not even worth discussing.

And what is "non-transhumanist property" anyways? Just what you define it as, or
the state? Property is property. Whether it is "non-transhumanist" or not is
merely due to whether it is in the hands of a transhumanist or not. Nobody else
has the authority to decide otherwise.

Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the idea
that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the dead
ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their
uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most
other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the
current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture in
current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)). Of
course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....

Centralism to a collective entity is like having a brain where all the
neurons are controlled by a single neuron.  Which, I guess, would be
pretty stupid.

BTW, free-market capitalism is only 'less-centralist' it's not
entirely non-centralist.

WHAT IS A "CRACKPOT" ?

The term "crackpot" is often deployed within
"scientific" oriented circles upon various 
individuals who have become targets of scorn.
As such, the term "crackpot" falls into the 
category of "personal insult" or "ad hominem."

Let's try to introduce some logic into this 
inflammatory deployment of terminology by ask-
ing the simple question: "What is a crackpot"?

Random House Webster's College Dictionary defines
"crackpot" (and the following subterms) as such:


  CRACKPOT: n. 1. a person who is eccentric, 
  fanatical, or irrational. --adj. 2. eccen-
  tric; fanatical; irrational.

   Fanatic: n. 1. a person with an extreme
   and uncritical enthusiasm or zeal...

   Eccentric: adj. 1. deviating from the acc-
   epted or customary character, practice, 
   ect.; unconventional; peculiar; odd.

   Irrational: adj. 1. lacking the facility 
   of reason; deprived of reason.


Now let's try to extract exactly the definition
of "crackpot" as it is deployed in "scientific"
circles. Albert Einstein was "eccentric," how-
ever the term "crackpot," as it occurs in scien-
tific circles, would not properly be applied to
Einstein. Einstein was also fanatical in his devo-
tion to the formation of his theories, but since
"fanatic" implies "uncritical," this defines a 
disjunction between the "fanatical" subterm of 
"crackpot" and Albert Einstein. So this leaves
us with the subterm "irrational" to define the
deployment of the term "crackpot" to various
targets in and/or by the scientific community.

The subterm "irrational" defines exactly the 
proper application of the term "crackpot" in
scientific circles (which is not to say that 
improper applications of the term may not be 
deployed), since "irrational" implies being 
"deprived of reason," and reason, defined as
"logical thinking," is a cornerstone of any
properly defined "scientific community."


CONCLUSION

When a member of a "scientific circle" (how-
ever loosely defined) calls person X "a crack-
pot," the term properly proclaims that person
X is "irrational" that they "lack the faculty 
of proper reason," and ultimately that their 
ideas are "false."

It follows therefore that a false theory could
be properly defined as a "crackpot theory."
But most properly, a "crackpot theory" should
be defined as a false theory that is promoted
even in light of the fact that it can be shown
to be false by an objective set of self-con-
sistent, or logical, standards.


CROCKPOT IDENTITY THEORY

Since the popular definition of identity is
atomist and states "A=A," which is to say 
that the identity of A is exclusive to A, 
that A is what it is due exclusively to A,
and since nobody has ever been able to show
a single example where this claim is true
-- showing A being A free from any associa-
tion to not-A -- it cannot be said to be a
true identity theory, and logic therefore 
dictates that it must be a false theory,
particularly when the identity theory, 
"A=A+~A," is never shown to be false.

Even as the set of evidence supporting A=A 
is an empty set, people go on promoting it 
without so much as a second thought; in fact,
many of its supporters fanatically attack 
anyone who dares to questions it. It there-
fore follows that "atomist-identity theory" 
is properly defined as a "crackpot theory."

Mr. Brin's idea is not going to work...

So John, what did you think of my "Truth Machines and Open Networks"
post (a prediction of how open networks could create absolute truth)? 
It suffers none of the problems you associate with Brin's idea - being
"open" has an advantage to any individual (network services, immediate
benefits felt through the network, etc.)

Anyway, what are you hiding?

I do not think that any minister can require a teen mother to give up
her child. A judge could order it, if it was determined she was "unfit"
or unable to care for it.

I will have to track down some specific sources for you. However, I do 
think it is well established that kids from single parent homes are more
likely to end up in prison. Of course, most kids from single parent
homes turn out fine, but that doesn't mean it's the optimal situation.
Didn't you ever wish you had a father? I'm sorry you didn't have the
experience. Provided he's a decent fellow, it is good for kids to have
one around.

You don't consider the rule of law in India to be generally positive?
Yes, I know they have a lot of stupid statist laws (like here), but I
don't think competing mobs with no law would be an improvement.

My observations (based on reading, movies and TV) are that Indians act
like most people who are generally happy. And there have been surveys
done where most Indians rated themselves as being moderately happy.

I don't dispute your statistics, nor do I claim that India is the light
of the world. I just wanted to point out that conditions are improving
there. Yes, there are better places to live, but India seems to be at
least be on the right track. The former Spanish colonies have adopted
better policies, so they are naturally outpacing India.

I like to use that term specifically for people who
spend most of their time arguing definitions, rather
than actual substance and content, and who seem to
think that it is an exercise of reason to do so.

        30% Creole; 8% 'other'; no white or European entry.

So: of the top 5 countries 3 are mostly white, one is rich in oil, and one has
a fair bit of oil and is right next to the US.  Of the next three one has the
Panama Canal, one is mostly white, and one has oil.

Cuba's weird, with the 2nd highest life expectancy and 3rd highest literary,
but bottom GDP.  It used to be close to the US economy but has been Communist
for 3 decades, without Nicaragua's civil war.

The richest country is South Africa, which also has the most Europeans (13%).
It's GDP compares favorably to similar Spanish colonies.  It was also an old
Dutch colony before Britain took it over, and thus arguably doesn't belong on
the English table at all.  That would leave them looking pretty poor (although
Ceylon's interesting.)  But with the possible exception of Belize the others
have no European population to speak of.  They were also all colonized in the
18th-19th century, I belive, as opposed to the 16th-17th.

Much worse than the colonies where the natives were nearly totally replaced by
Europeans, yes.  One could say the English sin was to exploit their subjects
instead of killing or displacing them.

India also has the distinction of being very large, possibly larger than all
the other mentioned ex-colonies put together.  (I'm not doing that math.)
The English brought low infant mortality; the Spanish brought smallpox.

Wasn't S. Africa colonized by the Dutch earlier?

A better comparison would use Asian or African colonies, particulary those
from the 19th century.  Michael's in my killfile and I can't find his last
post, but he may have been thinking of English vs. French, German, and Belgian
colonies of the 19th century.  India does compare favorably in this case.
Of course, almost anything out of Africa compares well.  Of African countries
South Africa and Egypt are at the top -- both British.  There's at least one
other country which quietly does fairly well; it'll be interesting to try to
dig that one up.

It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who's responsible for most African 
colonies: check the official language.

Well, I'm not a medical, but is it possible to use something like
ultrasonic  waves to perform abortion ??? Laser, it is almost obvious...
And else: another day, I was having a digestive endoscopy (high...hehehe)
and had such thoughts:  did anybody already see how simply they collect the

If  it works, it seems to be a good idea...

Two points: 

1. If a serious scientific  work is done comparing the equivalent relative
doses of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine etc, with the correspondant colateral
effects, and counter-indications, do not know why not a light "high-fly"
sometimes...hehehe... (sorry...)

Both are ex-British islands; the Seychelles are dependent on tourism, though.
Bermuda's very rich, and 61% black, but it's still dependent territory and
lives on tourism.  Considering as well the US/Canada (isolated), Australias,
NZ, and _Hong Kong_, I'd say that the British were quite good at colonizing

	I think this is a correlation/causation question.  I also come from a
single parent home(although I'm not truly single-parented, does that make a
difference?), and know many others, and all of us I would say are *less*
likely to commit a crime.  Being the only man of the house(or woman)
requires added responsibilities... such a situation can make one grow up
fast (in the positive sense)    My guess is that single-parent homes are
not the cause of a child's tendency towards criminal behaviour, but instead
they are a side-effect of the real cause.  For example, I would like to
know how many single parent homes there are in lower income families, or in
lower income neighborhoods.  I would also be interested to know if the
details of the child ending up with only one parent are significant...
possibly a child with a parent that has died has a different tendency
towards criminal behaviour than a child whose parents divorced?  Anyway, my
point is: I think it is ridiculous to say that single-parent homes
influence criminal behaviour without much more evidence than "there are
lots of single-parent kids in jail."

>From the White House press office--Al Gore's latest attempt to cast
himself as a futurist, by proposing a feel-good, wasteful diversion
from other exploration projects. (Not to mention the retrograde 
symbolism of gazing nonstop on the Earth after a year in which humans 
achieved their deepest sightings into the far reaches of the galaxy, 
with Hubble and Deep Field.)


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Friday March 13, 1998

VICE PRESIDENT GORE CHALLENGES NASA TO BUILD A NEW SATELLITE TO 
PROVIDE LIVE IMAGES OF EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE

Vice President Gore proposed today that NASA scientists and engineers 
design, build and operate a satellite that will make available a live 
image of earth 24 hours a day on the Internet.

In a speech at the National Innovation Summit at MIT, the Vice 
President proposed that NASA launch a new micro satellite that will 
provide live images of the earth from space by the year 2000.  This 
satellite will depict the motions of changing clouds, the advance of 
hurricanes, large-scale fires in oil fields or forests and other 
phenomena at the precise moment they occur.

'This new satellite, called Triana, will allow people around the 
globe to gaze at our planet as it travels in its orbit around the sun 
for the first time in history' Vice President Gore said.  'With the 
next millenium just around the corner, developing this High 
Definition TV quality image of the full disk of the continuously lit 
Earth and making it available 24 hours a day on the Internet will 
awaken a new generation to the environment and educate millions of 
children around the globe.'

'This new space craft will be carred into low earth orbit where a

"My socialist buddies in China"? I don't know anyone there except one fellow

description 'socialist' hardly fits here, though. It's a capitalist
dictatorship with a red flag.

Freedom, freedom, freedom. I always hear freedom. As free decision is a
myth, who is free? The perfect slave thinks he's free. Maybe the loan
slavery in capitalist countries is just much more subtle to seize, together
with the great media propaganda telling us how free we are compared to those
poor, oppressed North Koreans, Chinese, Cubans, Vietnamese (the propaganda
has, however, declined since 1991 and focused on other important issues like
the evilness of Saddam Hussain and the Serbian atrocities.)

The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.
Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to
advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".

You see, I have really lost the feeling for how people may react to certain
sentences. I see parallels between Extropians and religous conservatives. As
you say, they are mostly on the economic level. But decisions on this level
determine the outlook of a society.

There are clues that the Phoenicians have reached America. The Romans
circumvented Africa. They built better ships, had generally higher
technology (besides the steam engine, electricity and their consequences,
there's little they didn't have) , more social and economic freedom and a
much higher standard of living than the Middle (AKA Dark)  Ages could ever
attain. On the other hand, the welfare of the empire was guaranteed by the
emperors. If the money concentration got too big, they probably tried to
redistribute it. Too bad they couldn't prevent it.

The Christians murdered millions, buried the knowledge of the Romans and
maintained power (and stagnation) for nearly one millenium. The Dark Ages
were the worst time this planet has ever gone through.

Because you don't consider yourself as a part of the human community, but as
an isolated being which has, for some strange reasons, the right to
accumulate scarce goods and the currency necessary to acquire them.
Accumulation of information, external sensors and memory, the transhuman
'properties' you described, is OK. But in today's world, the resources must
be distributed equally in order to allow everyone to participate in the
great game of life.

I said "non-transhuman property". By my definition, a transhuman is a being
which has already transcended, and such a being does, according to my
knowledge, not exist on this planet. We're still unconnected carbon bags
filled with water. As such, we are all dependant on this planet's resources.
Private property of goods and currency must not exist in an environment
where goods are not reproducable.

That's the failure, you know. The Americans didn't become a superpower
because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World
Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already
after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because the
politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the
US.

History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had
decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state
secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the Germans
to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.
Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.

Unfortunately, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC.
Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.
Unfortunately, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.
Unfortunately, Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated two days later.
Unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.
Unfortunately, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.

I wouldn't call this kind of selection natural.

Human history is a long row of bad coincidences, backstabbings and battles
for power.

Evolution is the survival of the lifeform which fits itself best into the
environment. In cultural evolution, the environment is information,
memetics, an ever-changing flux. Neither the better one nor the more
unscrupulous one will win in the end -- the end is open. Makes things a
little more exciting, doesn't it?

Erm, just curious: where do you get this idea of the renaissance from? Specifically,
which part of renaissance europe could you find these values embodied?

I'm not sure I understand this.  Why do you feel that property defines resources?
Isn't there more to resources than mere property? I would have thought that property
is, in fact, becoming a smaller and smaller part of what we could term "resources"

But I thought that you were trying to say that you don't need the "return
receipt" or whatever it is bit set in mail because you have HTML-based tools
which can do the job?  I'm all confused now.

My point is that you convert your thoughts into an appropriate format. I was
taught when I was learning german that if you can't use umlauts it is perfectly
acceptable to use a following 'e', in other words you convert what you *want* to
say into what you are *able* to say. There are workarounds for problems which
allow people to still read your mail. The workaround in this instance is ASCII
as opposed to HTML.

Are we referring to the internet or to the web?

This mailing list isn't on the web. Personal email isn't on the web. Newsgroups aren't on the web. Just
because hypertext is a nifty replacement for a library doesn't mean it will also do to replace the post
office and the telephone system

This entire argument is stupid. You have already been told that people have filters to strip out HTML
mail before they see it. Other people have said they will hit delete and not read HTML mail.

Do you have so little regard for your own ideas that you will prevent people from seeing your email
simply to make a point? You have yet to explain how you can express yourself more convincingly in HTML
mail, all you have done is rant about being "progressive", but who really cares about how progressive
YOU think you are? What matters is how progressive WE think you are, and if we can't read your writing,
we're not going to have an opinion of you at all, let alone one way or another.

Fine. Send HTML mail. ignore your readers. They'll do a much better job of ignoring you. Which is
shame. But at least you can sit there and feel smug about yourself while the rest of us do something
useful, namely communicate effectively.

What does this mean? we are talking about -communicating-

You haven't given an example of how HTML is a better way to communicate than plain ascii as far as
dialogue goes. You have been told that people aren't seeing HTML mail. Doesn't this tell you something?
Do you care?  And I thought *I* was conceited. Sheesh.
I personally could care less who reads your mail. I use netscape to read mail at the moment, although
I'll move back to elm when I get my linux box up and running.  It just disturbs me that someone who
*subscribed* to a mailing list, i.e. actually exerted some effort to join a discussion group, is not
only not concerned when he is told that people don't read mail in his chosen format, but then continues
to argue the point.  Why are you here? Isn't it to engage fellow travellers? Or do you just enjoy the
thrill of watching your modem's "send" light blinking on and off. Empty vessels etc.

True. I notice you said "standard". At this point in time, as far as mailing lists goes, the standard is
ascii to allow the widest possible distribution of text. Eventually this will change, and I will
appreciate it, but for the moment ascii is what is most commonly used. I can send and receive HTML mail.
I -prefer- to receive HTML mail. But I *very much prefer* to discuss things with the widest possible
selection of people.

I get well over 200 emails a day. I easily read all of them. Very very very few of them are in HTML
format., and most of those are just web pages which have been forwarded to me.  I really don't see how
HTML will help in volume reduction.  Filters will help in volume reduction. HTML won't, in fact it will
make it a lot worse, as there will be more data to transmit.

This is true. How many tables of either type go through this last per month? How many messages which are
simply plain text go through this list per month?

And how many such messages do you write to the extropians list?

Do you see my point?

I really don't think that the ability to very very rarely present tables accurately is worth tossing
several (at least!) subscribers to this list into the wastebasket.  Feel free to convince me otherwise.

I already agree that HTML is a better way to transmit complex tables and graphs etc.  But it is not a
better way to communicate the vast majority of the messages to this list, and communication is the
entire point, is it not?

This of course is why the SCA is in no way representative of an authentic

I had always thought "bound" meant indentured and other voluntary agreements,
such as commissioned officers, etc.

I just found an excellent webpage covering logical fallacies: 

 http://www.assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/index.htm 

I could not recommend more strongly that everyone who disagrees 
with my ideas go to this webpage and study it very carefully. ;^)

I had been planning some time back to build such a page myself, 
but this one is even better than the fallacy web page I had in 
mind -- amazing!  I guess this saves me the trouble.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

As I've shown many times, the definition of identity 
"A=A" is the crackpot fallacy of Circular Definition:

http://www.assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/define/circle.htm 

>Circular Definition
>
>Definition 
>
>The definition includes the term being defined as a part of the definition.

>(A circular definition is a special case of a Failure to Elucidate.)


IAN: I cannot think of a more perfect example of 
the crackpot fallacy of Circular Definition than the
crackpot definition of identity A=A. What the crackpot 
definition of identity fails to elucidate is that id-
entity is not "same as," in fact, to the absolute 
contrary, identity is "different than."

If the definition of identity is "same as," as one
finds in all dictionaries (even of philosophy and 
logic), then since the Elephant Man (cannot recall
his proper name) was NOT the "same as" anyone, he
must have no identity, since identity is "same as."
Well, we can see why the A=A definition of identity 
as "same as" is the "crackpot definition of identity,"
because it is irrational, illogcal, and clearly false.

Here's the Goddard non-crackpot identity defitnion:

  IDENTITY: X possesses an identity and
  can therefore be said to exist where
  X stands out as different from some 
  state or quantity defined as not-X.

  NOT-IDENTITY: X posses no identity and 
  cannot be said to exist where X is the 
  same as not-X, for there is then nothing
  that is not-X, and thus no difference.

  In short: Identity = difference

  IDENTITY RULE: X gains identity by 
  difference and looses it by similarity.

Why?

Or rather: what the heck does "helping to advance evolution" mean?

The knowledge of the Romans was generally borrowed from the Greeks; Rome
was a conqueror, not an inventor.

It might be interesting to go back in time and prevent the rise of
Christianity, but I doubt that would have saved the Empire from
collapsing of its own tax structure.

"some strange reasons" indeed.   Individualism bad, collectivism good,
Capitalism bad, plunder good ...

Everyone participates, even if we cannot all participate equally.  I'd
like to participate equally with Martin Cradick or Donald Knuth, but I
haven't got the talent; who will correct that maldistribution?

On the contrary, private property must inevitably exist where goods are
not infinite.

See, I can make naked assertions too.

Agree in part - but, you know, it wasn't by mere chance that Americans
won the wars.  Why didn't Brazil (for example), which had similar
advantages of size and isolation, win them?

I like to think it's not *only* military power that makes Americana
fashionable around the world ...

I wouldn't call it relevant, either, unless you can show how these

Well, I *could* widen this out so that your hundred-byte lines (one of
them is 104; would be 106 quoted) don't wrap in *my* window -- but that
does nothing for *other* people trying to read it, who'd have to widen

Egocentrism is a virtue but it can be taken too far.

Here's a wacky idea:
Suppose we've already got a couple of dozen asteroids captured, orbiting
Earth somewhere outside geosynch.  If the motors that put them there
haven't been dismantled, could one of these rocks be shifted into the
path of a killer comet, to deflect it and/or break it up?

What is a crackpot?  A crackpot might be one who misunderstands a
generally-accepted theory and, by virtue of that misunderstanding,
claims to find a fatal flaw in it.

Because it is vacuous.  If it makes you happy to trumpet it as a
revelation, well, I'm glad you have the freedom to enjoy it.

"A=A" is *useful*.  "A = the whole universe" may be interesting in some
contexts but where does it get us?!

It is not for you to *define* another's theory.  (I don't go around
defining Marxism; that's what Marxists are for.)  You may *describe* it
as "crackpot" if you like.

Some lawyers recently pointed out that since the death penalty was
revived twenty-odd years ago Illinois has carried out 8 death sentences
-- and 9 convicts on death row have been cleared by new evidence.

In Virginia a few years ago, a man died (still protesting his innocence)
because his lawyer was a day late filing some paper or other.

Larry Niven's novel _A World Out of Time_ has a brief depiction of a
zero-time prison: a big temporal stasis box that amounts to a waiting
room - since time only passes while a convict is coming in (or going
out, but that's obviously more rare), there's no need even for beds!

See, if you refuse to concede the truth of a "Left" tenet, you're being
close-minded; but if the "Left" refuses to even consider discussion of a
contrary idea, that's Progress.

If I remember right, the Holnists are a gang of militarist uebermenschen

Ha ha.  For those who don't know, that is precisely the premise of
Brin's novel _The Practice Effect_, an early work which was fished out
of the trunk and published after _Startide Rising_ made him a star.

  IAN: So that's your definition of "crackpot."
  Well, you just fulfilled it. Now how about 
  putting some substance where you "mouth" is.

  You allege without evidence that there exists 
  somewhere a shortfall between "arguments pre-
  sented" (although you have not indicated which
  ones these are) and "actual substance and con-
  tent." So where, pray tell, is the "actual 
  substance and content" of your argument?

There is none, as you correctly point out, nor did I
claim there was any.  My post was as vacuous as the
one it replied to, to make an emotional impression
with no substance.  I never said such activity was
wrong--just that I tend to label as "crackpots"
those who do nothing else.

Definitions are the groundwork from where argument
begins: to call a definition "argument" is like
calling a dish washer a chef--sure, you can't enjoy
the food without clean dishes, but that's not where
the real meat is.

Of course, in that last paragraph, I am referring to
the substantive difference between definitions and
arguments, which you are welcome to use different
words for if you prefer.

ROFL!!!!

You'd be doing good if you could get the average Usenet and email 
poster to be able to reliably string together two coherent logical 
paragraphs in a row on the same subject.

If they can't do that, HTML won't help.

If they can, they don't need much help.

  IAN: OK, but can that claim be supported?

  I would say that if the allocation of

  supply, and if such is defined as FMC,
  then FMC approaches 100% decentralized.

  There may be capitalist enterprises,

  However, those enterprises are sub-

Sounds like a fun idea. The trick would be to get them into a
collision course; changing orbit would be rather slow, so you still
need plenty of warning to change the inclination and phase to get a
hit. The precision required is very high, on the order of hundreds of
meters, but in principle it could be done (caveat: comets are a bit
wobbly due to their irregular gas eruptions).

If a "tame" almost stationary (in the Earth frame) asteroid split a
killer comet, we would likely still get plenty of debris swishing
around our ears (and satelites!). A better solution would be
deflection, which requires it to move fairly quickly. Sounds like we
want very powerful engines on those tame asteroids.

(This system also has an unfortunate weapons potential: just
neutralize the momentum of the asteroid, and it will drop on the
continent of your choice. Ouch!)

Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in a consequent
manner.

Punishments can be fully "customized" and monitored so that no-one
is hurt worse than intended. A year in jail ain't too good for a 82 year
old (or anyone else) either. Geriatric grandmothers are not exactly common
violent offenders, and last but mot least, once agian, if you can't take the
heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! No-one is forced to become a violent
offender (and those who really can't control themselves should be removed
from society anyway).

So there are no *rational* arguments against it, just emotional ones. O.k.
This makes it a neutral matter of personal preference then, not something
"inherently evil" like some people would like us to believe.

Just killing the lion (and some others) will be enough to satisfy most people's
urge for vengence. The point is that the feelings of resentment initiated the
hunt, and (sometimes) the consequent extermination of a dangerous
predator. Primitive man pesumably acted even more on impulse than we
do, and feelings of hate and revenge might have helped him on his way to
the top. If this is the case (and it seems likely), then there is at least *some*
good in these emotions. Intelligence without passion (be it "good" or "bad")
leads to nothing.

You are already paying your bit for all the people in jail whether you like
it or not. Cryonic internment is hugely cheaper than keeping someone
locked up, even without taking into account the drop in costs if large, 
automated, cost-efficient cryo prisons were built for mass storage.
It's not only cheaper, but also much more humane. I may be "tough on
(real) crime" like you say, but unlike most other people I *am* interested 
in real justice, which means that the legal system is balanced, consequent
and doesn't cause someone more suffering than the law prescribes.

In reality this means things like a fair, quick, discrete trial (no media
circus) where only hard (forensic/video/audio etc.) evidence is 
admissible and everything is as automated as possible (electronic
justice -- no juries and judges with very limited power), full legal 
assistance but only limited appeal possibilities, good food and comfortable 
cellspace while awaiting sentence, and if fould guilty of a capital 
offence (murder) a fully monitored execution according to the
severity of the crime, followed by cryonic storage. No more, no less.

In that case, you just don't want a government alltogether. That's fine with me,
but we're discussing judicial systems for society here, not anarchy.

Vicious slander can ruin someone's reputation for life, and can lead to loss of
job(s), family problems, severe mental damage (sometimes suicide) due to
rejection by the community/society etc. People don't really care about the
truth, they want dirt, juicy details provided by tabloids etc. No amount of oral
or other defense can fully reverse the effects of slander, the damage has been
done. Therefore, anyone who willfully spreads damaging lies about another
person deserves to be punished.

So is our present world. I don't think a transparent society would be any
more dangerous than one based on secrecy, but of course there's only
one way to find out. Until that time, it would be very bold indeed to 
dismiss the idea alltogether. Anyway, I don't advocate _total_ transparency,
just "perfect" monitoring of public areas, not homes, offices etc. (that's up
to every individual) for increased safety "on the steets" and justice
based on hard evidence, not flawed human witnesses. It seems that 
more and more people agee (the surveillance systems are
popping up all over the world like crazy -- and are helping to take a
bite out of crime), so as surveillance technology gets cheaper, smaller
and better the "(semi-)transparent society" seems almost inevitable, 
whether we like it or not.

It's a classical "spears vs. shields" scenario: everybody will be spying, and at
the same time trying to conceal their secrets. A Darwinian arena, hardly
something new, and hardly the end of the world. And if you've had enough,
well, there's the vast privacy of outer space.

That would be almost irrelevant.  The kind of people who follow Falwell
don't think for themselves.  A teen mother who is told that her child
will be taken away (for the good of both of them, of course) probably
won't argue.  She's already way too stressed, young, impressionable,
and willing to bow to authority.

In my particular case, he was out of the scene before I was born, so I've
never met him, never will, and never missed him.  I've never wished I'd
had a father, although intellectually I wonder what it would have been
like, or how things may have been different.  For example, I may have
developed self-confidence sooner than I did, but now I'm none the worse
for wear.

Indeed.  I would not be surprised if prisons had *slightly* more single-
parent kids than not, but the original message made it sound like it was
a vast majority.  I won't believe that without proof.  And as you
point out, it probably depends precisely on the circumstances.  A messy
divorce may screw up a child alot more than a child (like me) who's never
had any experience with a second parent.

  IAN: Ooops. I included the term defined
  in the definition. No matter, it does
  not mark an error of essence, since
  the same definition can be stated
  more properly sans term:


IDENTITY: that which is possessed by X 
which makes X different than not-X, 
allowing it to be said that X exists.

NOT-IDENTITY: that which makes X the 
same as not-X, which nullifies that 
which allows X to be said to exit.


 Any other definitional suggestions?
 I like the "process" definitions above
 more, even though they include the term.

 A perfect example of the "not-identity"
 of "same as," and of the second "not"
 definition above, is an item X that 
 appears one second -- and as such stands
 as different than not-X -- then disappears
 the next second, "poof"... in so doing it 
 has become the same as not-X, and thus X
 ceases to exist. The prevailing definition 
 of identity is "same as," and yet as we can 
 see, that definition is most clearly false. 

 Another example is identical, or "same as," 
 twins: seeing only one at a time, you cannot
 be sure which of the two your seeing, since
 each looses identity to the degree that the
 two are the "same as" each other. So we can
 clearly see that "same as" = "ANTI-identity."

 IDENTITY RULE: X gains identity by 
 difference and looses it by similarity.

Hmm.  Close but not quite.  I'd venture that any of the more 
serious thinkers on this list have, at some point, misunderstood
a generally-accepted theory and thus "found" a fatal flaw.  The
only ways to avoid that are a) don't think about generally-accepted
theory or b) never make mistakes.

The difference between a crackpot and a non-crackpot making an 
error is that the non-crackpot realizes the #1 reason for the
"fatal flaw" is that they've misunderstood the theory.  A non-
crackpot checks the literature and talks to people knowledgeable
about the theory, trying to see if this has already been addressed
somehow.  A crackpot goes straight to the public.

When I was a teen, I figured out a paradox involving colliding
time bombs which I thought invalidated special relativity.  I 
never made a big deal of it.  A few years back, I figured out
why my idea *doesn't* work - and I tell you, it left me very 
impressed with both relativity and Einstein.

Seems to me it has exactly the same problems as Brin's. You could never 
obtain absolute truth from your One True Open Network (OTON) because if the 
entire world's operation is based on it's information then people would have 
enormous incentive to shape that information and change "the truth" to their 
liking. Since everything is open I know exactly how OTON works and all about 
its security, I can hack in and alter records and make history be anything I 
want. It does no good to make an exception to the total openness policy for 
OTON itself because that's by far the most important thing in the world and 
if that's not open nothing is, besides, although you might reduce the risk 
from hackers you'd vastly increase the meddling of the truth from world 
leaders, that is, from the network administrators.
                    

        >encryption and fast machine-based organisation doesn't mix) 
                    

That's not true at all. A good one key encryption algorithm, the sort you'd 
use to store information on a hard disk, slows things down by very little. 
Public key encryption is a little slower but still not bad and machines are 
getting so fast you'll soon never notice the slowdown. Ever though it's fast 
it offers excellent security, because to break it you'd need to factor the
public key number and that would take a HUGE amount of cleverness or a COSMIC 
amount of patience. 

Today most keys are about a thousand bits long and no computer is close to 
being able break it. Some people are really paranoid and make their key 4 or 
5 thousand bits long, you will not be  able to find enough silicon in the 
observable universe to make enough chips for a computer to factor such a 
number before the heat death of the cosmos. Unless a new factoring algorithm 
is found that's a LOT faster than anything we know about today (if it only 
speeded things up a trillion times it would be useless) then such a key will 
never be broken. Until of course somebody makes a Quantum Computer.

This is interesting, my Netscape mailer is set to send messages at 72 chars per line. I am wondering why
either it isn't doing this, or that your reader isn't reading it right. Hmmm.

Comets have random jettings of gas, which causes their courses to be rather
erratic. A large lumbering asteroid being driven by a small mass driver would
not have the capability. However, if we captured some comets, and kept the
comets sheilded in earth orbit, then we could use the comets mass (the ices
being much more volatile than rock) for much more rapid maneuvering.

'Government' is defined by the people - even the most totalitarian of
governments was and is defined by the people.  Free-market Capitalism
is 'dynamic centralism' - although the point(s) of control may change
far more quickly than other centralist systems, they still exist.  If
you were to take a single moment in time of an FMC system, you would
clearly see the consumer majority gathered around the supplier
minority.  Currently we can't feel the collective benefit of our
actions, so we've created capitalism.  With money you can immediately
feel the benefit of anything you do.  However, the 'benefit' is
centralist because it must be defined.

A decentralised economy would be a network, which allowed the
collective benefit of any action to be felt in real-time, with no
centralised entity defining that benefit.  Soon information will be
transmitted through an open network with enough speed to not require
the need of a capitalist system to relay the benefits.  Physical
things may take a while to catch up, but eventually we could have a
100% decentralised economy.

The above list -- "identity, time, space, money, cause & effect,
logic, etc." -- does not contain any pemes -- neither shallow pemes
nor deep pemes.  They're not specifically *political* memes.  They
are very basic ontological/epistemological *memes* without which
it would be difficult to function as human beings.  So, the use of
these memes increases the power of all human beings.  They don't
fall within the scope of my definitions:

I personally knew Hubbard.  As far as I know, he may
have cleared a few surface pemes from his mind, but
he never became aware of any deep pemes as such.  Most
scientologists I've met are not politically freedom
oriented -- Hubbard certainly wasn't.  I don't know of
any scientologist who has cleared even one deep peme
from his or her mind.  It's extremely unlikely that
there's any process in "official Scientology" for
eradicating pemes.

Below, I illustrate the "basic peme creation mechanism."
Many cult-like organizations use the same mechanism to
gain control over their members.  Not having had any
contact with "official Scientology" for more than 20
years, I don't know whether they use this mechanism
or not.

Many scientologists have broken away from "official
Scientology" and operate in what some of them call
the "free zone."  They call themselves "free zoners."
See <http://fza.org/> and <http://www.freezone.org/>.

One of my next steps will be to present the peme
material to some free zoners.  Maybe we'll even
develop some kind of "self-auditing process" to help
people eliminate their deep pemes.  People need to
be able to run this process on themselves without
necessarily needing outside assistance.

"Protecting the children" is a surface peme more
or less at the same level as "mandate from the
people."  Most libertarians, anarchists, egoists,
etc. have no problem recognizing surface pemes.

Some peme rules:

"6. Surface pemes shall induce mild soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

7. Deep pemes shall induce severe soporific,
stupefying, and debilitating effects in human
brains.

8. Some humans shall attack and even expose
certain surface pemes -- such as "national
security," "public interest," "gun control,"
etc. -- while others shall justify and defend
these surface pemes.

9. Under no circumstances shall any human be
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep
pemes."


The Basic Peme Creation Mechanism -- 'Two Tribes' Example
---------------------------------------------------------

Consider two different isolated tribes somewhere in the jungles of South
America.  Call them Tribe 1 and Tribe 2.  Each has its unique language
with its own structure.  The language of Tribe 1 (Language 1) tends to be
very literal.  A man who fishes, for example, is called "man-who-fishes."
The same man, while sleeping, is called "man-who-sleeps"; while talking,
"man-who-talks"; while running, "man-who-runs"; while eating,
man-who-eats"; while writing, "man-who-writes"; while making a chair,
"man-who-makes-chair"; while giving orders, "man-who-gives-orders"; etc.
In Language 1, distinctions are made between different kinds of words:
"Thing-words," "Do-words," "How-words," "Story-words," "Funny-words,"
"Order-words," "Panic-words," "What-words," "Who-words," "Why-words,"
"When-words," "Where-words," etc.  High-level abstractions are rare in
language 1.  To the people of Tribe 1, any word that doesn't refer to
something physically perceivable, is highly suspect.  Their test for
reality is *physical*.

The language of Tribe 2 (Language 2) is very different.  A man who obtains
his wherewithal mostly by fishing, is called "fisherman."  (This system of
nomenclature would seem absurd to the people of Tribe 1 -- how can you
call someone a "fisherman" when he is not fishing, but sleeping?)
Language 2 contains many high-level abstractions -- like "happiness."
People from Tribe 2 can talk for hours about "happiness."  (To someone
from Tribe 1, this would be incomprehensible -- they only talk about
"woman-who-is-happy" while she is happy, and "woman-who-is-sad" while
she is sad.  The notion that you could separate "happiness" from a real
person being happy, and talk about "happiness" as if it existed by itself,
would be completely unthinkable to someone from Tribe 1.)

To the people from Tribe 2, any word being used is automatically assumed
to be part of existence, otherwise people wouldn't use it.  (To someone
from Tribe 1, the word "existence" would be a meaningless absurdity,
because in their mentality only particular objects exist.)  In Tribe 2,
the test for reality is *agreement*.  If other people agree with a word
and the way it seems to be used, then that word is automatically accepted
as valid and useful.

One day a strange man arrives at the place where the people of Tribe 1
live.  They ask him: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name King?"
He: "No; my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"  He: "I
special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different but not special;
who God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: "Where God?; How create
world?"  He: "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "How we see God?"
He: "Can't see God."  They: "You speak crazy."  He: "No; I special; I show
you."  Whereupon the stranger performs various tricks like apparently
making objects appear and disappear.  They: "You clever man-who-tricks."
He: "I special; I King."  They: "You speak funny; you clever John-who-tricks."
He: "I King; my word law."  They: "What law? -- special word?"  He: "Yes;
my word law -- you must obey."  They: "Ah!  You mean order-word!"  He:
"Yes; I King; I make law."  They: "No; you speak order-word?"  He: "Yes;
I special."  They: "What special? -- Anybody speak order-word?"  He:
"You not understand."  They: "No."

Eventually John-the-stranger gives up trying to convince the people of
Tribe 1 that he has a "special status" and that his words are different
from the words of anyone else -- so he leaves, to search for more gullible
and impressionable victims elsewhere...

For many days and nights he trudges through the jungle before discovering
the people of Tribe 2.  They: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name
King?"  He: "No, my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"
He: "I special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different; what
God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: Where God?; How create world?"
He "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "Show special?"  Whereupon
the stranger performs various tricks like apparently making objects appear
and disappear.  They: "You King, agent of God."  He: "Yes, my word law."
They: "What law?"  He: "Law special word of God through me; you must
obey."  Whereupon the people of Tribe 2 bow down and kiss the feet of John
-- they do not habitually test abstractions against reality, so they
readily accept John-the-stranger as their "King" and his word as "law."
Thereafter all he has to do to subjugate, control, and dominate them, is
open his mouth...

"Language creates spooks that get into our heads and hypnotize us."

-- Robert Anton Wilson , Introduction to 'The Tree of Lies'
(by Christopher S. Hyatt. Ph.D.)

The people from Tribe 1 reject the pemes of John the would-be-tyrant --
making them impossible to subjugate, control, and dominate.  To them the
would-be-tyrant is merely a clever liar and trickster.

The Tribe 2 people accept John's word "King" to describe himself.  They
believe that "King" John has special powers because of the tricks he
performs and because of his supposed connection to "God."  By accepting
John's pemes they automatically place him in a superior position and
themselves in inferior positions.  Just by accepting, believing, and
using the peme "King," they yield their power to the tyrant -- they
subjugate themselves.

It's worth emphasizing that just by accepting the pemes of the would-be
tyrant, you place yourself at a huge disadvantage.  By doing so, you
relinquish your power, enabling the would-be tyrant to become an actual
tyrant.  Instead of laughing at his silly notions, you'll probably end
up begging him to "change the law" so you can be free.  And guess who
has the last laugh!

This brings us back to pemes and Deep Anarchy.
The Deep Anarchist seeks to remove from his
mind *everything* that might put him at a
disadvantage, everything that might contribute
to others having coercive power over him.

And, because, at bottom, the power of certain
coercive people depends on the mind-content
of a multitude of victims, the Deep Anarchist
seeks to find others interested in cleansing
their minds and offers to assist them in doing
so.

So it isn't free enterprise, right? Its an oligopoly. They claim to be
socialists as a general matter of propaganda, but so did the communists...
Nothing is really different with the minor exception that they don't shoot
foreign reporters as spies anymore.

IMHO, only a moron takes a loan for anything that they can't get a higher rate
of return on than the loan interest rate. I pay cash for anything I need.
Freedom, in the words of a former US President, is "The right to choose between
working and starving." Additionally, as Steve Biko has said, "the most potent
weapon of the slavemaster is the mind of the slave."

Take Cuba for example. Its economy is now open to most of Europe and Canada, and
all the rest of the world who doesn't necessarily cowtow to US policies. Yet it
is still a shithole. The claims of high life expectancy are totally false, as
the government continues to repress and mismanage the economy which is now
dollar driven, not peso driven, and malnutirtion is still rampant, as the
pathetic agricultural sector has all but collapsed (with absolutely no help or
hindrance from the US), for it is still centrally driven by a bureaucracy that
still thinks along the lines of producing the maximum amount of sugar for export
to a now non-existent Soviet Union.

Evolution of what? And how? You cannot create change without force and the use
of power. Human nature is wired against change, for the most part.

ROTFL to you. Having 30% of the population in slavery is NOT 'more social and
economic freedom' (although to an avowed socialist, I can see why one might
think so). The Roman ships were decidedly NOT better built than the Caravels and
Galleons of the Middle ages, or of even the Viking ships. A Roman boat was
barely able to navigate the Mediterranean, and piracy was a scourge throughout
the empire that little was done to suppress, as pirates provided the main slave
supply.

In the empire, 'bread and cicuses' were the only thing that kept the plebes in
check from revolting against the government. By 300 AD, 95% of the Roman legions
were not Citizens of Rome, but Barbarian conscripts. Members of the 'Senator'
class, the patricians, were legally forbidden to 'engage in commerce', could not
marry outside their class, and were more likely to cut deals with barbarian
hordes than to engage in battle, in the rare event that you actually got sons fo
patricians to follow the early Roman command to,"come home with your sheild or
on it". (Sounds kinda like the US Congress...)

On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge of
the Romans.  While the Empire was stagnant, the middle ages was not caused by
the church, but by the pillaging and destruction of the Mongol Hordes, the
Viking incursions, and the general migratory habits of the various tribes of
'barbarians' such as the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Angles, the Franks, etc.

And who is gonna do that distributing, you? Sorry, in order for the transhuman
to become reality, it is gonna take individuals who amass sufficient wealth to
pay for the research for themselves, for the operations on themselves.
Redistributing hard earned wealth to people who didnt earn it is driving us down
the same 'bread and cicuses' path that the Roman Empire took.

Oh, so you are a spiritualist. Sorry, wrong list for you. A Transhuman is an
individual who decides to and undertakes the individual work necessary to move
beyond the common human state. There are already such transhumans around, and
most don't know that the label applies to them. People like Hawking, Freidman,
Dyson, Feynman, etc.

There is no fixed 'goalpost' to define a human vs. transhuman state. The human
race 100 years from now will consist mostly of people who we would today regard
as 'transhumans', but they  would merely regard as 'human'. We would be seen as
barbarians. It is analogous to the experience of an individual falling into a
singularity. As the individual approaches what they thought was the 'event
horizon', that 'horizon' recedes further away. A singularity is perceived to
shrink as an observer gets closer to it, as the perceived event horizon shifts.

Which, you must admit, is a far far different thing than winning a war, n'est
pas? When ever in human history has a victor so completely rebuilt a former
enemy (nay, three former enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan) so that they become
less than 40 years after the war, economic rivals once again? This is the genius
of the generosity and magnanimity of what you call 'selfish, greedy, capitalist
Amerika'. Winning a mere war was not the trick. Winning the peace was.

All that would have meant would be that the US would have come into the war
earlier on the side of Britain, and when we won, we would have also been able to
get the damn Soviet Union out of the way then rather than 50 years later.

So you admit that cultural evolution is "a long row of bad coincidences,
backstabbings, and battle for power"? If this is so, why do you say that "power
structures need to end" for human evolution to occur?

<excerpt>Human life after 100=20



Copyright =A9 1998 Nando.net

Copyright =A9 1998 Scripps Howard=20



(March 13, 1998 02:12 a.m. EST http://www.nando.net) -- Bir Chaudhari,
reputedly the world's oldest man, likes to take it easy these days. At
141, he's entitled to rest his 4-foot frame as he reminisces about the
Queen -- Victoria, of course -- and talks about how he hopes to be 150
someday.


But how did Chaudhari make it to such an age, and how do he and the
growing army of other post-centenarians manage to avoid the degenerative
and killer diseases?


Chaudhari, who has left his Nepalese village only twice, is at the
extreme edge of an evolutionary trend. Centenarians were once a rarity,
but now almost every nursing home has one and, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, about 59,000 Americans were 100 or older as of April
1997.


The lifespan of man has always been increasing, but the biggest changes
have occurred in the last century, with improvements in both social
conditions and medicine.


"Expectation of life at birth has roughly doubled since the mid 19th
century, from around 40 years to nearly 80 years. In the U.K., the
fraction of the population aged over 65 has increased from one in 20 at
the start of the century to one in six now," says Dr. Tom Kirkwood,
professor of biological gerontology at Manchester University.


As our lifespan has increased, the causes of death have changed. People
used to die from acute illnesses, childbirth or industrial accidents, but
today we die of chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, and
degenerative conditions like Alzheimer's.


People like Chaudhari offer a beacon of hope for a longer lifespan. But
there is no secret to longevity, although the genes we inherit can be
helped with a better lifestyle, as research with twins who went separate
ways at birth has shown. It's unlikely that one gene is responsible for
aging. It's more likely that many genes are programmed to close down at
certain times as part of a kind of built-in obsolescence.


There is, however, no doubt that some kind of genetic input is involved
and that longevity in some families is the norm. But, given that genes
cannot yet be changed for longer-lasting ones, other life-extenders have
to be explored, including lifestyle, diet and personality. People who are
independent, stubborn and opinionated tend to live longer, according to
one study. Social skills are also important -- people who have good
networking skills are likely to be more content and live longer while
stress and anxiety can reduce life expectancy.


Lifestyle and diet are important, too. One Harvard study found the secret
of longevity among a rural Greek population was in their diet --
principally vegetables, fruit, cereals and olive oil. People who kept to
the Mediterranean diet had a 32 percent increase in long-term survival.


And elderly people who exercise regularly develop disability at a quarter
of the rate of those who don't.


As the millennium approaches, all the indications are that the average
lifespan will continue to rise.


Ian Pearson, a futurologist at British Telephone, says that "young people
now will have a longer life span. Eventually it could go to 140."


But, increasingly, extended lifespans will become divided into two parts:
active and dependent. Only one in 12 octogenarians are now considered to
be fully self-sufficient, a rate that drops even lower to 0.5 percent in
centenarians.


In a report on the future trends of aging, Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, says that
extending lifespan will throw up ethical problems: "As medicine becomes
better at rescuing imperiled lives and extending mortally threatened
ones, the strain on resources will increase. Plain old human misery will
also rise, as more and more of us make it to past our seventies only to
meet arthritis, strokes, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's."


One thing seems clear. If our lifespans are to increase, so too must the
quality of that extra life, or it may simply not be worth having.

Ah, so you are referring to a central banking system as the point of
central 'control'. This is an accurate assessment.

However, it is not apparent that this is a 'bad' thing, at least not
currently. As the 1920's demonstrated, failing to impose any form of
negative feedback on a system will cause that system to quickly cycle out
of control as any competent engineer can tell you (like oversteer on a
truck steering system). Currently, there are no large scale natural forms
of negative fedback that can effectively counteract the hysterical/panic
tendencies of individuals engaging in trade in a commodity level market.
This was why the SEC, the Reserve System, and other controls were imposed
back then in the wake of the Crash, and why there are currently controls
on computerized trading. You might ask how a computer can get hysterical?
If it is programmed to reproduce the same trading behaviors that a
hysterical trader would take, it can act 'hysterical' at least in a
trading sense..

One natural form with the potential to act as negative feedback is open
information. As Robin Hansen has discussed previously, two trading agents
both operating with perfect knowledge of  all elements in a trade
invariably come to an accurate valuation and price for the item of trade.
When there is imperfect information, the agents will attempt to operate
as such Bayesian traders, but the less accurate the information available
is, the extrapolations and expectations of the respective traders will
tend to diverge, leading to a speculative market. The more speculative a
market is, the more likely it is to succumb to the sort of buying
hysterias and selling panics that can be seen in many markets that
protect the secrecy of information that is relevant to a trade.

This situation is analogous to the sort of circumstances which lead to
armed conflict. Military historians generally agree that wars occur when
two potential adversaries with a point of conflict cannot agree on who
holds the superior military position/numbers.

Back to the money system though. Alan Greenspan, a noted Randite
currently running the Federal Reserve Board, has stated that he can
forsee circumstances in which entities like the Federal Reserve will no
longer be necessary. We can assume that this will involve the
availability of computing capabilities which enable one trader to develop
an extremely accurate estimate of the opposing traders information based
on only a small sampling of information.  When this occurs, secrecy in
financial transactions between parties, and fraud as a result, will
become extremely difficult to perpetrate. This sort of technology will
also be usable as information 'veradicators' which can assess the
accuracy of any given point of information, to determine whether that
information is truthful or merely disinformation.

This sort of technology will also apply to your proposals for "One True
Open Network", in that you will not need to keep constant surveillance of
everyone. The small discrepancies will give away the lie. While we as
humans today might not catch the contradictions inherent in such minor
information, given time, such information veradication systems will act
as our spies, without violating anothers privacy. How? Say you go into a
closed room. Such information veradication systems will be able to
accurately estimate what you were doing in that room based on your
actions prior to entry and  following your exit from the room. They would
not necessarily need to know exactly what you did there, but based on
what the system does know about you, it can come to a rather accurate
conclusion as to what you were doing there, and conduct tests to
determine its accuracy.

OK, why not keep a bunch of caputred, paired asteroids? each pair
will be coupled by cable and spun about their common center of mass.
you can spin the pair up using mass drivers or ion engines. When a
comet is detected, simply pick an asteroid and cut the cable at the
proper point. This will launch an asteroid on a trajectory to intercapt
the comet. (Please be careful to compute the trajectory of the other
member of the pair!)

Recall the statistics: about 90 percent of the danger is from NEO asteroids.
the remaining 10 percent is from comets. We have the technology to
find and deflect NEO asteroids already, because they come from a
fairly near and bounded space that can be completely searched, and because
we will generally have years or decades to take corrective action.

Comet detection is a lot harder, and deflection is harder still. Detection is
harder because the space in unbounded, and detection must occur on the
incoming impact trajetory. By contrast, NEO detection may occur on
any previous orbit. deflection is harder because the response must be
immediate (unually less thatn one year), and because you have to
intercept. It's not feasible to macth orbits and use the comet's mass.

So, a $10M/year program would probably let us find essentially all
dangerous NEO asteroids in about 3 years, and a $1M/year continuing
prpgram would probably keep the NEO census current. This should
fund a few small (1 meter) 'scopes.

By contrast, I speculate (NO data!) that we will need a $100M/year
continuing program to look for comets. Basically , you need lots of
big scopes to maintain a full comet sky survey.

Bottom line: I think we should immediately fund the NEO survey using
exiting technology. This has a very high return on investment.
I think we need to figure out a cheaper way to do a comet
survey rather than attempting to use current technology immediately.

It has been mentioned in several books and newspaper articles, which
unfortunately I don't have here to give the titles of.  Possibly a 
search of newspaper articles on a library database would give more 
details.  As I recall, however, this gentleman had a great deal of 
trouble calculating his true age, as records in his town were not 
kept well back then.  But by projecting it based on the details of 
his childhood, this is the number they came up with.

I also don't know about that 140 estimate--I'm seeing 120 batted 
around as our potential lifespan, barring serious disease or injury.

John, you're being at least as dogmatic and simplistic as you accuse Brin of

How, when people and watchdog programs are watching you or at least the
records and each other, redundantly?  Earlier you talked about splicing into
the network "they can't be watching me all the time".  But they can watch the
network cables.  For that matter, the cables themselves might be 'smart'.
"Help!  I'm broken!  Come look at me!"

You've also said it's unstable, because if everyone's being open but you you
have an advantage.  But the projected openness isn't based on voluntary
transparency, like altruism; it's based on snooping technology being better
than secrecy technology.  How will you use this secret?  Insider trading would
be hard to detect, but the extended obtaining of that information would be
high risk.  Conversely a new invention could be stored in your brain but would
be hard to implement secretly.

The transparent society (at least one version) isn't fron unanimous surrender
of secrecy; it's the result of extensive and more widespread snooping and
spying.  Thirty years ago we caught Nixon's burglaries by accident, and found
out more about him because of his own fetish for recordings; today we argue
over whether Clinton had an affair inside the White House and some police cars
are equipped with cameras.  This is stable.

Whereas a world of total encryption might well be vulnerable to a new
algorithm or a quantum computer.  _That_ sort of secret would be exploitable
-- to the detriment of everyone else.  Call that stable?  Hah.

And quantum cryptography isn't a cure-all yet, with its dependence on direct
fiber links, not for the Internet as a whole.

And then there's the TEMPEST arms race.

More than one network, and they're watchable.


This will be mostly driven by the technology, and a few social decisions.
(Whether private street cameras are illegal, or whether everyone can tap in,
and watch the police station as well.  Whether people actually have secrecy at
home, or simply seclusion -- you can be watched at home, but not disturbed,
and perhaps use of that information is restricted somehow.)  The result is
unlikely to be all of one or the other, and likely to change over time.  RSA
gets cracked; people use overlapping quantum crypto networks; teeny cameras
and TEMPEST see everything your computer does anyway; teeny camera-hunters and
counter-TEMPEST measures strike back; etc.

A brief popular exposition of the contrary view, based largely on Murrray
Rothbard's _America's_Great_Depression_ appears in _Insight_, "Federal
Meddling Made History", Stephen Goode, (16 February 1998), pp. 18-19.  Here
are some excerpts:

	In the past, depressions had lasted "a year or two", Rothbard notes...
	Government in the 1920s proved inflationary in a number of ways.  The
	Federal Reserve System, which had been created in 1913, was a major
	culprit...[I]t insisted on on an enforce the very low and very
	inflationary rate on acceptances...[Fed governor] Strong and the New
	York Federal Reserve bank were the main generators of inflation and
	and cheap credit, but not the only ones.  The Treasury Department was
	another source....

I've read elsewhere that Milton Friedman's _Monetary_History_of_the_United_
_States_[?] gives good evidence that the Fed disastrously shrank the money
supply _after_ the Depression started, which helped ensure the downturn's
depth and longevity.

For a start, you put them in different planes!  Say, ten or thirty of
'em in ten planes with icosahedral symmetry.

Given the engines likely to be used for herding the asteroids, how long
could it take to shift one into a suitable orbit?  (Remember there's a
wide variety of such orbits.)  Weeks?

First of all, I'm sure you realize that personal anecdotes can't settle
this issue. I have no doubt that you and your friends are model
citizens. But you may be unusual. I, unfortunately, cannot cite specific
statistical studies at this time. (I know there are a lot of them,
however, and I will try to look them up when I have more time.) However,
if my memory is correct, there  is a strong correlation between
criminality and coming from a single parent home, even if the parent is
not poor. If anyone on the list can help me out with these statistics, I
would appreciate it. I would be flabbergasted if, as you suggest, kids
from two parent families are more likely to commit crimes. However, if
you can prove it,  knock me over! If your argument is correct, then it
would be a good thing for kids if all fathers dropped dead immediately
after insemination. Surely that must strike you as a bit bizarre and
counterintuitive, even without any statistical analysis.

Upon closer examination, we find that in previous years (prior to the 
formation of the Federal Reserve system), the economy did *not* cycle 
quickly out of control; in fact there is some evidence that the 
federal government *tried* to make it do so, but was thwarted by J. 
P. Morgan's impromptu assembly of a consortium of major banks which 
collectively provided deposit insurance to bank customers (including 
the customers of banks which weren't part of the consortium, with 
only a very few exceptions specifically stated).

And that in the 1920s, there WAS a central bank functioning as a 
point of central control in the United States -- and that it served 
quite well as a source of POSITIVE FEEDBACK.  Whatever the economy 
appeared to be doing, it would push for even more of.  This of course 
soon put the economy in an unstable situation, so beginning in 
late 1928 or early 1929 the economy tried to contract and throw off 
some non-viable debris (bad investments) -- and the Federal Reserve 
continued to provide positive feedback, demanding even more and 
faster contraction.

Eliminating the Federal Reserve is the economic equivalent of 
disarming a large explosive device.  A large explosive device can be 
very useful, or very destructive, depending on exactly where and 
when it blows up.  This particular one happens to wander around on 
its own and can't be trusted.

If you could prove that then I'd have no objection to corporal punishment,

My point is that people should not be punished differently for the trivial 
reason of having different physiques, and that nobody should receive the 
equivalent of a death sentence for committing a very minor  crime.

Certainly, but so what? My genes have their agenda and I have mine, besides, 
I'm a lot smarter than my genes, even they know that, that's why they gave me

Evolution is brutal and stupid, it has no foresight and can't design worth a

If your skin is that thin then never say anything controversial, be just like 
everybody else, make sure  you don't do anything  creative, don't be too good 
at your job and don't make a lot of money, such people are so dull the 
tabloids would never dream of slandering them. Nobody is forcing you to 
aspire to more and if you can't  take the heat then *stay out of the kitchen*! 

A word about reputation, my reputation is an opinion on the value of my past 
actions that's useful in determining the probability that my future actions 
will be of value too, but my reputation is not set by me nor is it used by me, 
it is used and set by others. This is fortunate because if I could set my
reputation there is no reason I would do so accurately, I would inflate it. 
On the other hand it's to your advantage (unless you're a  competitor) to set 
my reputation at what it's really worth, set it too high and you'll pay more 
for  my services than they're worth, set it too low and you won't hire me 
even though I could be of value to you. It's true that a competitor would
want to  set my reputation to a lower value than I should have, but everybody 
knows that and takes it into account when he bad mouths me. Nothing is perfect 
when you deal with fallible venal human beings, but most people have the 
reputation they deserve most of the time, and Big Brother getting into the 
act with slander trials is not the reason why.
                   

        >People don't really care about the truth, they want dirt 


Then these people are fools, and I don't care much if a fool thinks I'm a 
fool. If you feel differently and their opinion is that easy to sway then 
just sway them back.

Especially if the "slander" is true. If there were an all powerful oracle

The overwhelming cause of remarkable age in humans is faulty 
reporting.  The ages of very old people get stretched with
time - somebody did a study demonstrating that the age claimed
for people over 85 goes up 17 years every decade. The age
calculation for this man obviously is very unreliable.

Because of the reporting problems, the agency that assigns
the "oldest human" title has become quite anal about verification.
The best claim for breaking Calment's record to my knowledge
is a woman in Brazil who is supposedly about 128.  Actually
she does have some documentation, but not as much as that
agency now demands.

Potential lifespans aren't absolute; the chance of death never goes
to 1.  With humans the chance of death seems to max out at about
40% per year or so.  With enough people, or enough luck, you could
probably get any age you wanted; it's just that the number of people
or amount of luck required goes up fast and exponentially.  At
40% deaths per year, if you get a maximum of 122 with 5 billion
people, you would expect 132 with 1 trillion. So if economic
or logistical constraints limit the size of your lifespan studies
the maximum lifespan will be fairly constant - strain effects
will far outweigh these statistical variatons.  Some guys did a 1 
million medfly mortality study recently - and blew away the 
previous species maximum lifespan, which had been based on studies 
of thousands of flies.

It wouldn't necesarily be a good thing, but it wouldn't necessarily
increase the crime rate, either.  In fact, the crime rate would probably
drop as a result of the lower incidence of domestic violence!

Not in the slightest.  There is a large body or evidence (sorry, like you,
no reference at the moment) that single-parenting and divorces have a
tendency of speeding up the maturation process, including accelerated
puberty, etc...    I think with some minimal amount of support this would
on average create a more mature kid less prone to criminal
behaviour.(especially if that child was taking on the responsibilities of
the other parent... just look at older siblings in single parent homes,
they have a tendency to become instant-parents)  Of course, going through
puberty years before your peers with no adequate support could definitely
increase the incidence of criminal behaviour... I have no doubt of that. 
So, even if you can provide evidence that this phenomenon is not linked to
income, I would still be skeptical of a causal relationship between
single-parenting and criminal behaviour, since parental support is
definitely not a function of income (or at least the connection is tenous) 
Thing is, how could you possibly put a value on parental support?  I think
it may be difficult to show anything with statistics on this matter, or
possibly I am making this issue more complicated than it really is?

Geoff.

I think you all are aware of recent hints towards potentially minable
polar water resources on the Moon. I'd like to discuss with you a couple
of the more speculative development scenarios. 

Obviously, due to enormous transportation costs the bootstrapping must
require minimal effort -- hence it must be done by autonomous and
semiautonomous (telepresence) systems. Due to relativistic delays and
human iterative-control motorics telepresence will be of very, very low
productivty and/or to be not very accurate. Automata must do the bulk of
the job.

The water content in lunar regolith (up to 2 m layer) is afair estimated
to be 1-3%, which may already cause clumping. Nevertheless this is not
solid bedrock, and should be relatively easy to excavate. The automata
must operate in a very dark, cold environment. While there should be
enough power on the supposedly constantly illuminated mountaintop to
operate a largish PV array (either position tracking, or a cylindrical PV
tower) and microwave (due to excellent vacuum, the magnetrons & Co are
reduced to a few exposed metal/isolator parts) the juice to the relay
station on the twin peak facing Earth (later on, a LLO fleet of satellites
could both supply power and uninterrupted communication), there won't be
very much left. Of course we might contemplate a cache of hydrogen/oxygen
electrolyzed from mined water to power the automata fuel cells, but
isotopic batteries and a small (hey, water vapour turbines!) reactor would
seem to make significantly more sense. However, a release of isotopes must
be contained (free path are virtually infinite, can gravity capture part
of radioisotopes of a core gone china?), the potential contamination of
precious surface volatiles considered. Folks, there will be a Lunar
ecology, after all. 

Semicontinuous operation by cryotrapping microwaved regolith exhalations
is pretty trivial. The water will be dirty, probably contaminated by H_2S
and NH_3. This can be later metabolized by bacteria -- nitrate is very
important for hydroponics (other minerals can be autoclave-leached from
regolith). Water means reaction mass: liquid oxygen and hydrogen. Water
deliveries to nonpolar locations will be obviously first done by rockets. 
Ballistic delivery (damn sturdy containers) by EM drivers might be
contemplated later on. (The age of lunatic truckdrivers has not come yet
;). Water means we can do wet metallurgy (leaching, electrolysis, etc.),
and hydrogen reduction. NASA has already done research on hydrogen
reduction and sintering of lunar soil blocks. Magnetic separation of
reduced Fe/Ni will enrichen the Al/Si/Ti oxide fraction. The need to
devise new technologies from scratch (which microgravity and bone-dry (?)
conditions of most FeNi and silicate asteroids would seem to imply) is
unneccesary. 

Since we are talking <<1 closure of autoreplication, the devices must be
reliable/redundant. The more obvious bottlenecks are rocket fuel,
structure elements (bricks, glass fiber and sheet, aluminum/silicon/steel) 
and photovoltaics arrays. Melting can be done with a solar oven (parabolic
mirror contamination by sublimates), resistance, microwave and Ebeam
heating. Aluminum/silicon-sputtered glazed surface of a mineral powder can
make usable improvised reflectors ready to be picked off the ground, or PV
arrays. Wafer-grade silicon will be difficult to make. Otoh well worth it,
for beam lithography is trivial there. Another aspect of the lunar
ecology: you would like to keep the vacuum clean and hard for certain
processes. 

Essentially, design creativity is a bottleneck. Harnessing the potential
of many people working on (virtual and real) lunar simulators and
teleoperated laboratories will result in a flurry of much more efficient
designs, probably soon resulting in first full-closure autoreplicators.
Lunar water would seem the excellent candy to lure venture capitalists and
general public investments. Monkeys in vacuum suits the public can parse,
the idea of space-based industry of autoreplicating automata would be much
more difficult to sell. After the venture will start making profits, it
won't matter anymore. 

If we are to establish a subselenous (thermoinsulation, radiation
shielding) semiautark ecosystem, PV-fed microwave-pumped sulfur vapour
light sources would seem to be best. Bootstrapping a more-or-less stable
ecosystem will be difficult, starting with extremophile pioneers first
would seem a good idea. Much experimenting must be done first, and I do
not mean Biosystem II 'work'. 

Can humans work productively outdoors? First, humans are unlikely to be
present at the early bootstrap stage, the necessary transportation
expenses considered.  If we have a stable polar ecosystem going, humans
will have to work under a constant radiation load (and nuclear reactor
proximity) and darkness, under cryogenic conditions.  Current spacesuits
are heavy (inertia), difficult to don, don't allow long-term untethered
operation (while urination is easy to take care of, defecation is not) and
vastly limit dexterity. And let's don't forget the risks, for lunar
surface is no English countryside. Rapidly dockable, fuelcell-powered
rubber onion-skin vacuum suits in electrically heated lead-lined
tear-proof overalls (puncture kit in the pockets) might be tried out yet.
Especially radiation shielding becomes very difficult here, though.

I have not covered half of what I wanted to outline, but I'd rather end
here. I'd like to get a constructive discussion on such speculative
bootstrapping scenarios going, for the topic is obviously both rich and
fascinating. Please comment. 

ciao,
'gene

The issue of how fertilized human eggs should be treated was raised
recently on this list. There is an interesting paragraph about this topic
in a book review at the  HMS Beagle web site. Below is the relevant
excerpt. Of course, there is still room for disagreement with the viewpoint
presented. 

http://biomednet.com/hmsbeagle/member/1998/26/booksoft/review.htm

Remaking Eden Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World
by Lee M. Silver
Avon Books, 1997

Begin excerpt from book review

By combining some underappreciated biology with common sense, he also
analyzes the assumptions underlying the claim that a fertilized human egg
deserves special status based on its potential for developing into a human
being. For example, the assertion that a unique genetic identity is created
at conception is undermined by the fact that the maternal and paternal
pronuclei don't fuse until the two-cell stage of development. Moreover, for
about two weeks after fertilization, each of the individual cells of the
embryo has the potential to give rise to a complete and distinct developing
embryo. Despite the acknowledged potency of each of these cells, their lost
potential is not mourned when one of them is plucked off from an early
embryo in order to carry out prenatal genetic diagnosis. Finally, since
cloning by nuclear transfer allows for the creation of a new embryo from
any somatic cell in the absence of conception, the act of conferring
respect or elevated status on biological potential is not supported, Silver
argues, by the modern facts of human reproduction.

Throughout historic times and until just a few years ago the secret keeper

Yes, the underlining reason for this is indeed simple and it's one of the few

In general, if I increase the complexity of my  encryption algorithm so that 
it takes me twice as long to encrypt, I have made it not twice, but billions 
of times more difficult for an attacker to  break. The government has access 
to more powerful computers than I do, but not that much more powerful. 
A child's 50$ video game has enough computing  power to encode messages that 
would stump the governments largest  super computers for centuries. 
For the first time in  human history 2 people on opposite sides of the planet

enforceable contracts without anybody else knowing about it, and without one 
even knowing the physical location of the other.

I know, that's why it won't work.

I'd probably start by adding 5 or 6 zeros to the balance of my bank account,  
then I'll make people I don't like look like they've committed some very  
serious crimes, then I'll give myself a new identity with full documentation,  
then reveal to the everybody what I've done (except for the name of my new

I don't worry about Tempest because unlike wiretapping it's expensive, easy  
to jam, must be done at close range and is not well suited for mass 
surveillance. All I need to do is ask when the Tempest truck will be in my  
driveway, or just look out the window.

[SNIP of a bunch of really good technical ideas by 'gene]

This looks very promising. It appears to me that we need to examine
the bootstrap first. Will this be a NASA/acedemic effort, a private
effort, of some combo?

I'm not sure we need "monkeys in spacesuits" to capture the
public imagination, even assuming we need to . The public
was very enthusiastic about Sojurner. Given that, what would
minimal first step be? One possibility would be a Sojurner-type
mission to a polar crator. Obviously the details are massively
differernt, especially power and landing. The same smaler-faster-cheaper
technology that lands a probe in two or three years could land a
more versitile robot three years later.

Free enterprise in the way you define it cannot exist. When liberating an
economy, existing economic power structures will try to manifestate their
powers in other forms of government or the same form as before, because they
need a tool to exploit the majority of the population. One of the other
forms of government is a dictatorship like that in China.

>Freedom, in the words of a former US President, is "The right to choose

>working and starving."

Not even this very castrated form of freedom always exists in a "free
market". Take a look at Germany, about 5 million people, if you believe the
government statistics, are without work. If you don't believe them and do
more precise calculations which implement temporary government work
measures, you get about 7 millions. The US employment statistics often work
with the number of jobs, not the number of employees. You got a poverty rate
of 15 %, and 20 % for youths. Your president cuts new holes into the social
"net" each year in order to assure that freedom is really only the freedom
to choose between working and living badly and starving. Sometimes, you
should take look at the real world, besides your great leisure activities
and high income.

Cuba, besides Chile, is still one of the healthiest nations in Latin
America. I have posted statistics on this before, but you have rejected them
because they were obviously from too "liberal" sources (United Nations and
such). By saying that something is "totally false", however, and thereby
making yourself the source for your claims, you don't do much to refute my
statements. Actually, you, John Clark and others have not posted a single
source, a single document to support your claims. True believers, as John
said (referring to me).

Evolution of humanity. Through progress. By spreading information.

Your main problem is that you don't have much fantasy. Your worldview is
much too limited. I have said it about 283475 times: You can only advance
evolution if you bring the necessary information to those who are "in
command" or will be someday. It's absolutely irrelevant whether these people
are economic or political leaders, it's just important that they have the
power to change things and the intelligence to understand what you tell
them.

>ROTFL to you. Having 30% of the population in slavery is NOT 'more social

You're talking about the time of the Republic. This time was, in some ways,
as bad as the Dark Ages. But there was much slavery in the Middle Ages, too.

And in the Empire, conditions for slaves got much better. Tiberius made
slave participation in arena battles with wild animals dependant on
permision by the authorities. Claudius equated the killing of weak or sick
slaves to murder. Domitian disallowed to castrate slaves in order to sell
them as eunuchs. Hadrian prohibited selling slaves to brothels. Diocletia
put the abandonment of slave children under punishment. [1] It was not even
allowed to take slaves from within the empire.

It was still slavery, but the Middle Ages were much worse. When you were a
slave of a land-owner there, you didn't have any rights. Life or death
didn't matter to the slightest degree. If you're a slave to a major bank
today, your situation is not much better either. Or you work in a privatized
prison. Possibly for taking drugs -- I know that you would like to remove
such legislation, but as a matter of fact, it exists.

This is utter nonsense.

Pirates: Not in the Empire. Caesar and Pompeiius eliminated them completely.

Ships: One of the largest Roman wheat cargo ships, the "ISIS", had a tonnage
of 1200 tons. The largest known Middle Ages ship had a tonnage of 150 tons.
The big Roman harbours had restrictions that disallowed the entry of ships
under a tonnage of 150 tons. That means that the largest MA ship wasn't even
big enough to dock at a major Roman harbour. Actually, you managed to build
in more than one mistake into each sentence. Great effort!

The numbers above are from memory. We (meaning an expert on the subject and
myself) will put up a temporary page about the Roman ships on my homepage.
There's already a Rome page at http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/rome, it deals
mainly with Roman harnessing, which was, contrary to claims by famous MA
researchers, not inferior to the MA, but actually superior.

>In the empire, 'bread and cicuses' were the only thing that kept the plebes

Utter nonsense, too. This started only with the decline of the Empire.
"Bread and circuses" were, in the beginning, more a recruitment mass media
for the legion. Later, the population was held under control with
religion -- that's why the Jesus story was created. Indeed, the tax
structure led to the impoverishment of the majority of the population. These
taxes were not really used for investments by the state -- it was just like
today: A small minority exploited the majority.

>On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge
of
>the Romans.

99 % of all books and important information from the Empire were destroyed
later. Of the aquaeducts, they built houses and bridges. Of the chalk
remains in them, they built altars. The Roman water tanks were more
impressive than any MA cathedral. If we would get another decline like this
today, that would mean building habitats out of cars, altars of computers.
Really clever guys, your MA "buddies".

etc.


Without the money concentration that occurred in the empire, they would have
had no problems in assimilating these tribes. They have managed to defeat
stronger enemies than these. The Middle Ages were caused by the hierarchical
religous mysticism that followed the Roman Empire. Millions of pagans were
murdered after the downfall of Rome. Millions were killed in the crusades,
too. Because they didn't manage the logicistics, they even had to eat their
enemies on the way. And because of the same failure, the crusader state was
lost. Stupidity is not a good prerequisite for a war.

>And who is gonna do that distributing, you?

Some intelligent, educated individuals who have the power to do so. Doesn't
matter if it's me or you. It just has to be done, that's all. As long as the
Roman emperors did some kind of correct redistribution through just tax
systems, everything worked fine. But then, the minority had to pay less and
less, the majority more and more, and everything collapsed. Pyramid systems
don't hold very long.

You and your definitions. Here you say that a transhuman is not reality yet.
In the next paragraph:

>Oh, so you are a spiritualist. Sorry, wrong list for you. A Transhuman is
an
>individual who decides to and undertakes the individual work necessary to
move
>beyond the common human state. There are already such transhumans around,
and
>most don't know that the label applies to them. People like Hawking,
Freidman,
>Dyson, Feynman, etc.

Ah, so transhumans already exist.

You see, there was a reason why we decided to call "Homo Excelsior" "The
Transhumanist's Magazine". A transhumanist is someone who strives to become
transhuman. A transhuman is someone who has managed to transcend human
conditions. A posthuman is someone whose conditions are so entirely
different from that of a biological human or transhuman that it cannot
really be called human anymore. Are these definitions OK for you?

But for the content of the first paragraph: It doesn't really matter who
pays for it. If you have an economy based on money, you need people who have
wealth, right, but this wealth doesn't need to be accumulated. It can be
pooled by people with the same interests -- this doesn't contradict with
equal distribution of wealth. Redistributing the "hard earned" (you? earning
your money hard? hardly.) money to people who didn't "earn" it avoids
driving us down the money concentration path the Roman Empire took.

>There is no fixed 'goalpost' to define a human vs. transhuman state.

Ah, first, they don't exist. Then they do. Then, nobody can say. You're a
bit moody, wouldn't you say?

You aren't employed by the NSA propaganda section, are you? You should write
reports about the gulf war, too.

Of course, it was the same selfish attitude that made the Americans fund the
biggest losers of the war that made them also fund the two wars themselves.
Any credits given by the US to Japan and Germany could not be paid back in
hard currency, because these countries were practically ruined. That's why
they were paid in naturals. Buildings, companies, the whole infrastructure.
But what's this worth if the country is ruined? But if it gets big again, it
can earn you lots of money. Which was why it happened. Another crackpot
theory? Sure.

No, there would have been no war. *If* there would have been a war in
Europe, it would not have lasted long. (Germany and the Soviet Union
combined, without the stupidity of Hitler and his followers -- good night).
Actually, the power would probably be much more distributed: Still a British
empire, a powerful Soviet Union, a rising Germany and an increasingly less
relevant America.

as simple as possible in order to avoid stumbling over contradictions in

Dear Extropians,

Berrie Staring and myself are plannig to visit the US in September and
travel from New York to L.A. in three weeks starting september 4th. We are
very much looking forward to meeting as many of you as possible. The only
fixed points in our route so far are the NY-city, Phoenix and L.A. I'd like
to ask anyone who would like to meet us and can make time in that period to
send me E-mail so we can plan a traveling schedule. Don't let your
'off-route' location be a reason not to mail, we're not planning to travel
in a anything resembling a straight line anyway ;-)

Greetings,
Arjen

I am very interested the exploitation of resources in the
near solar system.  The topic of water on the moon has come
up at recent dinner parties and I have found that some
others agree with me:  potential water on Mars is much more
interesting than actual water on the Moon.

Mars is closer than the Moon in terms of the energy required
to get there.  From LEO to the Moon, the delta-V is 6.0km/s whereas
to get to Mars it's only 4.5 km/s!  The trans-mars injection is only
a little more expensive than the Moon but the huge savings comes from
the fact that Mars has an atmosphere you can use to slow down.  The
Moon requires you to haul a bunch of fuel with which to stop yourself
once you're there.

If you count the fact that fuel can be manufactured easily on the
surface of Mars using the C and O in the atmosphere with
only seed H and some simple apparatus brought from Earth,
Mars becomes even more attractive.

Now consider if a local source of H (water for instance) were
known to be in a relatively accessable form near the surface of Mars,
very little seed H would need to be shipped.  The place could bootstrap
itself and make all the fuel it needed.  Not only that, but a whole
host of well understood industrial chemical processes become possible.
The regolith is nutrient and mineral rich.

The Moon is a boring hunk of rock compared to Mars.  Processing Moon
rocks for minerals will be expensive and extremely difficult to justify
financially.  On the other hand, any raw material more valueable than
silver would be worth shipping back to Earth from Mars.  There are 
plenty of possible minerals which would fit the bill if found.

There are many other reasons why Mars is more suitable as a near-term
destination than the Moon.  Tele-presence systems and autonomous
robot technology are a long way off from being able to establish
whole industrial sites.  Any serious industrial endeavor will require
the most autonomous, smartest, most versitle and powerful machines
around, namely human beings.  Mars is a far more hospitable environment
for humans than the Moon.  For this reason and the reasons above,
I would be interested in discussing the bootstrapping of Martian colonies.

For more information on the above, begin by reading: The Case for Mars
by Robert Zubrin.  He does an immense service in debunking a number of
the myths regarding the difficulty and expense of mars missions.  He has
mostly come around to the pro-private enterprise approach but I think he
still (at the time of writing) over-estimated costs.  A 100% private
venture run by seat-of-the-pants entreprenuers and pioneers could bring
costs down even more.  With $/lb to LEO slipping through the $1000 mark
quickly, the next 5 years should see a lot more action on these fronts.

Is anyone here going to the Mars Society conference in Boulder this
summer?  Also does anyone know of any mailing lists more specifically
attuned to these topics?

-Steve

The rule as cited says nothing about the size of individual ships; it's
just a tax break for big business.

Yes, although the age estimate goes with the logarithm of the sample

sample size is decent.

I haven't seen any estimates; it's quite a leap from a cellular-level
aging theory to whole-organism lifespan estimates.  Programmed cell
death would probably predict that there is a true wall out there
somewhere.  However, even quite old people seem to have a fair number
of divisions left in their fibroblasts, so we'd probably not be that
close to the wall.

The effect he's talking about is not medical, merely statistical.
The larger the population, the greater the chance for a > 0
measurement at the far right of the bell curve.  While one might
be able to calculate an expected maximum age of a particular
population, it wouldn't really be a meaningful piece of information
because it would be based on the empirical properties of the
curve we have now, and there's no reason to suspect that those
would hold for a different population.

This is a very important question.  Before I attempt
to address it, I want to examine some examples of how
tyrants plant pemes in the minds of the oppressed and
then effectively "use" these minds as weapons.


The "Society" Peme

After observation and introspection you may realize
that you've never interacted with any so-called
"society."  You have interacted with *individual*
human beings (and their computers).

"Society" is a moderately deep peme.

Murray Rothbard:
"..."[S]ociety," which is an abstraction that does not
actually exist."
"...[O]ne of the prime errors in social theory is to
treat "society" as if it were an actually existing
entity.  "Society" is sometimes treated as a superior
or quasi-divine figure with overriding "rights" of its
own; at other times as an existing evil which can be
blamed for all the ills of the world.  The individualist
holds that only individuals exist, think, feel, choose,
and act..."  ('For a New Liberty')

Harry Browne:
"The gigantic myth called "society" that rules so many
lives doesn't even exist."  ('How I Found Freedom...')

Was the "society" peme planted in your brain?  Did
you buy it?  Have you been helping to perpetuate
and spread it in accordance with peme rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation?"

Tyrants use the "society" peme in various ways: "It's
in the best interest of society"; "It's a crime against
society"; "The will of society"; "Society is the cause
of his criminality"; "Society has a right to define what
marriage is and what it is not"; etc.

By perpetuating and spreading the "society" peme, does
your mind serve as a weapon for tyrants?

What I'm trying to sell you on is clearing
deep pemes from your mind, and assisting
others to do the same.

Thanks, I did and I found under "Things that I
like," item #1: "Anything New & Different."  Well,
I hope you find some of the peme material new and/or
different.  Please don't be offended as a result
of what follows.

Your analytical thinking can certainly expose a
surface peme such as "caring for children."  But
have you also been communicating in accordance
with peme rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation?"

Do you really believe that a certain clever,
lying trickster is "president" (so-called)?
You even spell it with a capital "P" in one
place!

I agree with you that at a surface level the
politicians have failed to fool you.  Are you
willing to consider the possibility that at
a deeper level they may have succeeded in
fooling you in some respects?

Was the "president" deep peme perhaps planted
in your brain?  Did you buy it?  Have you been
perpetuating and spreading it?  In this respect,
has your mind been serving as a weapon for the
tyrants?

"Man in the street": "The Emperor is wonderful!"
Violent anarchist:   "Kill the Emperor!"
Typical libertarian: "The Emperor has no clothes!"
Deep anarchist:      "Why do you hallucinate
                     an ordinary naked man as
                     "Emperor" (so-called)?"

Did you read the story of the "Two Tribes"
in the previous peme post?

"How long would pemes survive, if political
speeches were followed up by real analysis?"
Are you willing to consider the possibility
that, if followed by your past level of
"real analysis," deep pemes will survive
forever?


The Other's Mind as a Weapon
----------------------------

There are several ways to "utilize" the minds of
others as weapons to expand freedom.  The first
is simply to persuade others to clear deep pemes
from their minds.

In the previous peme post, Joseph <AnarcoCap1@aol.com>
demonstrated that he has cleared all or most deep
pemes from his mind.  He will never again think of
"political systems" in the same way, as he did before
clearing out his deep pemes.  In some cases, he will
*act* more effectively in relation to "political
systems."  Most likely, he will also communicate
differently -- he will only use deep pemes if he
thinks it's necessary and appropriate (depends on
the nature of his audience, in specific cases).
Most likely, whenever appropriate, he will question
and challenge deep pemes.  This may encourage others
to also start clearing deep pemes from their minds.
Thus Joseph will be using his mind to expand freedom
in a way that could snowball.  He could activate
the minds of others into becoming more potent
freedom weapons.

Similarly, "David G. McDivitt" <mcdivitt@IAMERICA.NET>
and "Cynthia Allingham" <allingham@ioc.net> could
make their minds more potent freedom weapons if they
were to clear out their deep pemes -- the political
"wheels in their heads" (as Max Stirner said).

The second way to "utilize" the minds of others
as potent weapons to expand freedom is to help
spread the meme "terrocrat."  A "terrocrat" is a
coercive political agent or terrorist bureaucrat.
The word should always be used to refer to an
individual human being -- or several individuals
in its plural form "terrocrats."

"Terrocrat" is a powerful meme that has started to
spread and migrate.  Do a search of the WWW, using
HotBot, for the word "terrocrat" to see how it's
spreading to websites besides Buildfreedom.com.

For a greater appreciation of what can be achieved
with memes, see 'Virus of the Mind: The New Science
of the Meme' by Richard Brodie <richard@brodietech.com>
-- <http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie>.

Imagine the day a politician or bureaucrat writes
an article: "Why I'm not a Terrocrat!"  The terrocrat
would be helping us spread the "terrocrat" meme.
To that extent we would be using his mind as a
potent weapon in our cause.

The word "peme" could also become a powerful meme.
A third way to "utilize" the minds of others is to
spread the "peme" meme.  Ask a friend if she knows
what a "peme" is.  If she doesn't, explain to her.
Refer her to <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>.

Any further suggestions for "utilizing" the minds
of others as potent weapons to expand freedom will
be appreciated.

But don't forget the delta V required to get back off of mars.  From the moon,
products such including metals, H2, and O2 can be launched into trans-earth
trajectories using just about anything - mechanical slinger, light gas gun,
mass driver, etc.  Also, the moon is a fine place for a beanstalk or skyhook,
requiring much less of a taper ratio or strength in the cable than on Mars or
Earth.

Obviously it depends on where you want to build.  If you prefer being stuck at
the bottom of a gravity well, Mars is a good one.  If you want to build a
self-supporting colony in the near term (pre advanced nanotech), don't you
think it's good to be within the earth-moon system, and to trade products more
quickly with less impulse?

I spent years working for a private space venture that spent $20-30 million,
but have become very skeptical of the likelihood of massive private space
investment as of yet.  Where massive profits have already been made, the
investors come out of hiding.  Until then, the barrier is too high to jump. 
$1000/Lb to LEO will help.

Net is a wild, crazy ever-changing, anarchistic baby that seems to be
living in the days of the Wild West!  There are no rules, because
technology keeps changing the playing field.

So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of the Net?

Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and
you are not a large company, just what can you do?

Email.

Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.
Wrong!!!

A landmark decision in the State of Washington recently determined that
bulk email advertising is absolutely legal and proper.  No state or
federal court has ruled otherwise.

So, by using responsible email, you can reach that huge market at a
fraction of the cost of traditional bulk mail.  Less than 1/10th of a
cent per address...

We will send 100,000 pieces of email for just $99 with up to one full
page of text. The only other limitation is that it cannot be a chain letter,
pornography or hate mail.

Drop us a line at <A HREF="">goforit20@hotmail.com</A>, or fax 561-835-0690, or call
561-835-4077 and we will send complete details.

Thanks for your time.

  IAN: "A" is the identity. Would a dictionary

  IAN: The statement A=A tells us nothing.
  It is meaningless, it is no more meaning-
  ful than saying "A." The philosopher Ludwig 
  Josef Johann Wittgenstein was absolutely right 
  to observe that "to say of one thing that it is 
  identical with itself is to say nothing at all." 

  The statement "A=A" is purported to tell us about 
  the nature of identity, and yet it fails by 100%.

  IAN: A defintion of A tells us what
  A is, and a theory of identity 
  tells us what identity is.

  The statement "A=A" does not 
  tell us what identity is.

Because that ordinary naked man is surrounded by goons, he is different
from you and me.

The words "president" and "emperor" are job-titles for leaders of
particular types of gangs.  If I say so-and-so is a Grand Dragon of the
Ku Klux Klan, does that mean I buy into the Klan's racist memes?

When the FBI - excuse me, a certain set of terrocrats who call
themselves "FBI" - gave a certain other terrorist the title "Unabomber",
what did that imply about their memes?

If a certain "clever, lying trickster" has power to interfere with my
life in ways that other "clever, lying tricksters" cannot, it seems to
me that's sufficient reason to give him a distinctive label.

(As if "trickster" isn't itself a special label!)

I skipped over it on the assumption that it's the same meaningless piece
of drivel that has been posted before.

No, identity is the *relation* between A and itself.
If "A" were the identity, then all things which are equal to themselves
would be equal to each other.  Is that why you preach that A = the
universe?

If a definition is fallacious for including a paraphrase of the word
defined, then *all* definitions are fallacious.  And yet they're still
useful.

  IAN: According to Webster's, an
  expressed observation is "a remark
  or statement based on what one has 
  observed." A claim is "to assert or 
  maintain as fact." Assuming that we
  assert that our observation is a 
  fact, there is no difference.

I was going to just ignore our friend Erik The Red because I've learned that 
logic no longer plays a part in his world view so there is little to say, 
but my name was mentioned and for the benefit of others I have to say a few  
things. Eric, we talked about all this in private mail months ago, the reason  
nobody takes your statistics seriously, impressive though they look with all 
those decimal places, is that 92.3876256211% of the statistics  coming out of 
a police state are wrong.

The only figures I would believe coming out of Cuba would be things like  
imports and exports and immigration and emigration, things that can be  
confirmed by third parties, otherwise it's just so much verbiage. Castro 
tells his subjects to think only happy thoughts, thoughts that make him look 
good, so can you conceive of one reason why his statistics would have the
slightest relationship to reality? If infant mortality was terrible he would 
say it was good, if it was good he'd say it was great, if it was great he'd 
say no child has ever died in Cuba since he took power.    
 
So let's look at how people vote with their feet, it's exclusively one way,  
all out of Cuba. A strange thing to happen in a wealthy happy land.  
Since Castro took power millions of people, close to 25% of the population,  
have abandoned Cuba,  and the didn't go to the USSR, they went to a  
capitalistic country. Think about it, they abandoned everything they had and 
made a very risky voyage across the open sea in a flimsy raft to a country 
with different customs and a different language. They wouldn't do that unless 
they were desperate, they wouldn't do that unless they hated Castro with an 
intensity I can hardly imagine.

What about the only other economic statistic Castro can't control, trade?  
Well, there isn't much of it. If Cuba had something that the rest of the 
world wanted there would be lots of trade and the US government would not be 
able to stop it, but all it has to offer is cigars and a little sugar.  
For more than 20 years the USSR bought all of Cuba's sugar at a price 40% 
greater than the world market price to help prop up Castro. It wasn't enough.

Today Castro is crying that few companies want to invest in his country, but 
there are very good reasons why a sane company would think long and hard   
before it made a large investment in Cuba. When Castro came to power he  
nationalized all foreign operations, he stole every bit of it and paid  
absolutely nothing to anyone for it. If he did it once he can do it again. 
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.
  
By the way, Cuba may be destitute now but it wasn't always that way. Castro  
did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third highest standard of  
living in the western hemisphere, only the USA and Canada were higher. The 
fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race closer to 
the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten thousand years does not 
increase my admiration of him.

Anarcho-socialists, is that anything like jumbo shrimp?  "We want no  
government and we want the government to take your money so it can 
distribute it fairly, we want no government but we want the government to 
decide what is  fair and what is not."

I'm not interested in natural Evolution except as a historic relic that 
explains how we got here, it's much too slow and stupid for my taste. 
Evolution had its shot at making intelligence, now it's our turn.

This is not true. There are many things the Romans invented.
Sure, they borrowed a lot.  All cultures do.  But to say that
rome was not an inventor is a fallacy.  The arch is a good
start.  As was an effective civil service, factory production
lines, codified laws, etc. Greek civilisation was moribund and
stagnant by the times the Romans marched in.  Rome is still an
example to the world.  The fact that an empire so large was ruled
effectively for so long (the imperial period was the longest
continous peaceful period in Europe's history, by something like
a factor of 5) with such an incredibly slow communicatiosn system
suggests that they *did* invent something magnificent: how to
govern such a widespread, diverse and numerous body of people.

This is true, rome had an economic structure based on continual
expansion.  This is what killed it more so than tax structure,
that and environmental change.  It is interesting to look at the
current economic ideology and it's reliance on continuous growth,
and consider the fate of the Romans.

Of course not.  They waited for the moment to jump in and attain

What on earth makes you think "americana" is *fashionable*??

I find it amusing in the extreme that a collection of people who
declare themselves anti-statist are defending the US so
vigorously...

Well, gee, this leaves, um, Benin and Uzbekistan.

You and I both know that the rest of the world DOES kowtow to US

I have heard that an awful lot of effort is put in by the US to
try to either destroy the Cuban agricultural system or to
destabilise the govt.  If the US were so wonderful, why don't
they trade with Cuba? Why force cuba to trade with nations far
away, and to punish companies who DO trade with Cuba?

Well, aside from the almost-irrelevant example of naval

This is also not true. The Romans used barbarian auxiliaries in
certain roles, but the legions were, on the whole, Roman. Or are
you referring to the empire outside of the City of Rome as
"barbarian"?

The Church preserved -some- knowledge of it. But they vigorously
suppressed any memes they disagreed with. I refer you to the
Albigensian Crusade as an example. Most of the knowledge was
preserved by the Arabs, actually, and filtered back into europe
from the middle east.

Sigh. Look, if you're ignorant of history, don't parade it.
The mongols never made it past Vienna. In fact I don't think they
made it *to* Vienna. The Vikings never went much further than up
rivers, unless they came to settle, and even then they did not
penetrate very far inland. The "barbarians" you refer to were
responsible for the destruction of Rome, and the chaos of what is
referred to as the "Dark Ages". By the mediaeval period these
barbarian hordes had happily settled down and become good little
europeans, and were known as the English, the French etc.

Well, this is your description, at any rate.  i'd simply say it
is someone who has progressed beyond being merely human, and
leave it at that. What if someone rocks up who has become a
"transhuman" via military research?  Are they not transhuman

Ah. Um. generosity and magnanimity. right. If this was the case,
then we wouldn't see examples of american bastardry against other
states would we? But we do. It was, as we all know, an entirely
selfish exercise to contain the soviet threat in eastern Europe,
in much the same manner as the unnecessary nuking of Japan was a
warning to the soviets.

Why would the US have come in earlier? Because it would have lost
the Soviet weapons market?

Because without this scrabbling for power we'd have evolved a lot
further than we have to date.  Look at how long it took Europe to
climb back up after the fall of Rome.

Well, from the outside, the way I (and i assume most of the rest of the world) see
it, the US did not "win" world war II or the post-war period, it did what it has
done most of this century, which is wait for the combatants to wear each other out
and then to step in.

The US entered world war I in 1917 (!), and would undoubtedly have entered world war
2 later on in the piece if the Japanese hadn't seen the writing on the wall and
tried to get in first. The US is more competitive than the French. Sure. the french
have also fought three major wars on their own territory in 100 years, whereas the
US has merely exported such.  This attitude you have is akin to someone stepping in
at the late part of a fight, kicking the victor in the head several times while they
are trying to get off the floor, and then telling everyone how tough they are. No
one believes it. Sure, the US has nukes. The US developed it's nukes with the help
of the rest of the allies, and then used it's undamaged economic base, maintained on
a war footing throughout the 50s to run about and bully the rest of the world.
While I have a lot of friends in the US, and on the whole most of the americans I
have come across are very nice people, this bullshit manifest destiny attitude is
incredibly annoying, and I remind you of what happened to Rome when the empire fell,
and consider the gunboat diplomacy the US has been practising for most of this
century, and the widespread resentment it has engendered.  if the US way of life was
so incredibly superior, why is it that no-one else feels this way? I don't see the
american way of doing things taking over the world. Democracy is not an american
invention, neither is capitalism. What purely american systems have been
successfully exported overseas?

Not meaningless, but it is a trivial truth.  Have you ever tried to
prove a mathematical theorem?  A proof often amounts to fiddling with
both sides of an equation, replacing terms with equivalent expressions,
until you're left with something like "u + ax = u + ax" - something
which is utterly boring in itself, but which implies the truth of the
proposition.

Deny the value of such trivial truths, and you deny the foundation of
all logical proof.

Not exactly.  We may define _star_ as "one of those shiny things in the
night sky," and this definition is sufficient to distinguish stars from
non-stars; but this does not tell us much about what a star is.  Every
human language has a word for _star_, and everyone with good eyesight
agrees on the definition of the word (with an exception that I'll come
to later); but until recently there was no agreement on a theory as to
what stars are.

A definition of a mathematical or logical construct, on the other hand,
"tells us what A is" because such a construct - an integral, for example
- has no existence apart from its (manmade) definition, unlike a star.

> and a theory of identity
>   tells us what identity is.

But that's circular.  Since identity is a symbolic construct - you can't
go out and dig up rocks and find an "identity" - identity can only be
what it is defined to be; a theory follows from the definitions.

You've decided that the conventional definition of identity is boring,
and you've invented another definition (which appears to be "identity =
description").  That's okay; science does this from time to time.  The
Greeks did not regard zero and one as numbers, so their theorems
sometimes needed to treat zero and one as special cases; later
mathematicians found it more convenient to redefine "number" to include
1 and 0 and -1 and -4+i.  The ancients thought of Mars, but not the Sun,
as a star; we have adopted a more useful definition of _star_ that
excludes Mars and includes the Sun.  And we've removed the Sun from the
classical list of "planets", and added the Earth.

These changes in the uses of words do not require us to reject all
writings of the Greeks that made special cases of zero and one, or old
astronomical records that call Mars a star.  Nor does your new construct
which you call "identity" entitle you to say that everything that uses
the conventional definition of "identity" is wrong.

>   The statement "A=A" does not
>   tell us what identity is.

Identity is defined as the relation which each entity has with itself
and with no other entity.  Maybe that's our problem: I see identity as a
relation, you see it as a property.

Nope.  "A=A" distinguishes A from that which is not A.  "A=A+~A" does
not: since A+~A is the whole universe, A+~A = B+~B for any B, thus A=B
for any A,B; any two things are equal to each other.  Thus, as you say,
this relation can never be false.

I hope you'll give this new kind of "identity" a new name.  It does have
a slight similarity to conventional identity: both are equivalence
relations (reflexive, transitive and symmetric).

Let me know when you have a theorem more interesting than
"everything=everything".

Islands in the Clickstream:
			Sneaking up on Ourselves

It's pretty tricky, sneaking around a corner which is really the surface of
a sphere until we are looking at the backs of our eyeballs with our own
eyes. That's what happens, though, when we see ourselves seeing ourselves.

That's a metaphor, of course, and metaphors are horses we can ride only to
the limits of our thinking. Then they dissolve into thin air, and we ride
on horseless like cartoon characters soaring off cliffs. 
 
That may sound philosophical or even religious, but we really have to think
like this at the dawn of genetic engineering. The practical applications
are immense. We are beginning to engineer our very selves, to see our
subjective ways of framing reality and being in the world as modular
objects to be manufactured and enhanced.  In the next century, it's going
to be bootstrapping big time for the human species as we see ourselves as
an image in our own collective mind, an image to be designed and executed.
Not exactly a computer program, but something very like.

Subjectivity is hardwired into our brains. That's a way of saying that
reality is an illusion, that even thinking we can slip outside the
limitations of our minds - an experience that Zen adepts call enlightenment
- and see what we are and what we are not, that is, see ourselves from a
point of view outside ourselves - maybe that's an illusion, too.

But think about this. A patient with a brain disorder was being probed with
electric needles. Doctors were hoping to locate areas of the brain that
were the source of her seizures. When the tip of the needle touched a
particular area, the patient began laughing, laughing not at the needle or
in response to it, but laughing enthusiastically and spontaneously because
... well, because they were all so funny.

Funny?  asked the doctor. What's funny?

Well, she laughed, looking at them with sparkling eyes  the way you're all
just ... standing around ... is ... so funny!

I remembered a friend experimenting with hallucinogens. The drug induced a
chemical change that enabled him to see clearly that everything in the
world was ... show business! He couldn't stop laughing at the spectacle of
role-playing human beings acting as if their social masks were real.
Whatever anybody said, he cried out, "That's show business!" and dissolved
into laughter once again.

Another time he saw the earth as a marble, like the photograph of our
planet from the moon or the world seen as a walnut in the hand of her Lord
by Julian of Norwich in her anchorite's cell.  He saw the earth as a sphere
from the center of which a million lines radiated to the surface, at the
end of which walked tiny ant-like humans crying, "Mine! It's mine!"  Again,
he laughed hysterically. And who can blame him? Humans, part of creation,
acting as if they owned abstractions like "land" ... acting as if their
consensual hallucinations were reality instead of a game they agreed to play.

Stephen Hawking gave a lecture last week at the White House. Through the
"wonders of modern technology," a RealAudio/Video feed played on my desktop
as I worked late into the night. His electronic voice said that, unlike
Star Trek or Star Wars, in which contemporary humans are projected pretty
much as we are into the distant future, he believed we would recreate
ourselves through genetic engineering in ways we can not even imagine.
People think of obvious things - greater strength, longer lives, faster
reactions - extensions of how we are today that make us more and better,
but not significantly different.  The real differences will be created and
discovered as we learn how laughter and sadness happen, how we construct
reality, how we use mood-altering experiences like religion, therapy,
entertainment, other kinds of cultural play, how we mean and be. 

Some religious sentiments - like wonder and awe - have been linked to
particular genes, just as parts of the brain, altered by the use of
spiritual tools, ingestion of chemicals, or electric probes, spontaneously
generate visions that are ... so funny! Visions of human beings acting as
if we are gods on a planet from the oceans and mud of which we have only
recently crawled.  This civilization is a phase, not a conclusion, and this
earth is just one of the millions of planets teeming with life that will
teach us how we have evolved and maybe even why.

Zen masters disdain the use of chemicals or electricity to induce
enlightenment. They prefer traditions handed down for generations.  That
perspective may soon seem quaint and archaic. Genetic engineering will
enable us to say at a particular level of description - a level appropriate
to biochemistry and biomechanics - what happens when we experience that
which emerges in our subjectivity as awesome, wonderful, or funny. We will
create emotional states of being that do not yet have names. The beings
that feel, think, experience those states - our intentional progeny - will
embody that unimaginable next step for the species of which Hawking was
speaking.

Ethical reflection never anticipates the breakthroughs that make us sit up
straight, nor do legal niceties. What will we do when our mistakes exhibit
behaviors we don't want? Put them in reservations or safari parks, use
insect-like cameras to scuttle among them, amusing ourselves with their
wacky antics? 

Will they vote? Will anyone? And will it matter?

Self-transcendence is an emergent behavior, perhaps the beginning of a
rising spiral of possibilities: The ability to see ourselves from a
meta-perspective, sneaking up behind ourselves and watching ourselves think
thoughts like these. The ability to experience the disappearance of what we
call our "minds" as we realize that "no-mind" simply describes what's so.

If you are referring to the telomere mediated mechanism of cell death then
there appears to be disagreement in the scientific community. Below are
two relevant excerpts from the New York Times: 

January 20, 1998
Cell Rejuvenation May Yield Medical Advances
by Nicholas Wade

begin excerpt:

Third, the aging of cells in the test tube is not necessarily the same as
the aging of tissues in the body. Do people in fact die because their cells
run out of telomeres? 

"If it is true that our life span is dictated by telomere shortening, then
you would imagine that some humans die because their critical cells run out
of telomeres, and there is no evidence for that at all," said Dr. Robert
Weinberg, of the Whitehead Institute, in Boston. "It is plausible that the
telomeres are long enough to allow all of us to live to 200." 

end excerpt

January 18, 1998
Longevity's New Lease on Life
by Nicholas Wade

begin excerpt

Turning on telomerase permanently would sabotage a vital defense against
cancer cells. But perhaps the gene could be flicked on just long enough to
rebuild telomeres. Would this postpone aging? 

No one knows for sure. Cells in a test tube and people may age differently.
And the body is composed of two main classes of cells, those that never
divide after the fetus matures and those that divide a lot. The dividing
cells are those of tissues and fluids that get a lot of wear and tear, like
the skin, blood and stomach lining. 

Scientists are divided on whether these wear-and-tear tissues give out for
lack of long telomeres. If they do, then rejuvenation might help. 

But many other cells don't divide at all during adult life, including the
neurons of the brain. No one knows what governs the aging of these cells.
Turning on telomerase "is not going to take care of your Alzheimer's,
skeleton atrophy and cataracts, so it can't address all aspects of aging,"
said Dr. George M. Martin, an expert on aging at the University of
Washington in Seattle.

I would rather call that an objective of justice. My definition tells you how to
do it in a civilized and functional way, which fits better the official definition
of justice.
 
[justice --1. just conduct; fairness; exercise of authority in maintenance of
right 2. judicial proceedings] From: _The Concise Oxford Dictionary_

It is a known fact that practiced executioners know precisely how to inflict
anything from a slight discomfort that leaves no marks to a horrible lingering
death. Especially the Chinese were (are?) true masters of torture. Add to
that modern (medical) science & technology, and a system where the
executioner is severely punished when killing the convict/otherwise overdoing 
the punishment *and* full audio/video monitoring and you'll have a pretty 
good system. Not 100% foolproof of course (but what is?), but certainly a
lot better than today's prison systems. And that's what counts.

After all, imprisonment has a different effect on different people just like
corporal punishment, but unlike the latter it is very hard to customize
(how do you measure psychological damage?) Surely you don't think
that a year in jail is equally hard on your grandmother as it is on a 
tough streetfighter?

My point exactly, that's why I think we need better (safer, healthier, 
automated) jails (later: cryoprisons) and customized corporal 
punishments for violent offences. Right now jail time sometimes means 
mutilation/rape/death, even in western countries. Even worse, the least 
guilty suffer most.

Yes, but unfortunately we *are* those creatures, and I don't think we understand
ourselves well enough to start throwing out traits we don't like, especially basic
ones like agression (it is extremely stupid to get rid of agression unless you're
100% sure that you're the only one in the universe, and by definition you can
never be sure. A being without agression is a/k/a a sitting duck).

Obviously a world as you dicribe would suck badly. That's why we need law to
make sure that you can do your stuff in relative safety without fearing that some
opportunistic moron will do damage to you or your property. Creativity is
something that has to be protected and stimulated. Anti-slander laws can help.

And someone can thoroughly wreck it so that others will judge you by lies
rather than your true qualities, with all the consequences. IMHO people
will think twice about slandering you when they know they will be punished
by "a large band of thugs" a/k/a government.

We live in a world filled with fools of every discription, so even if you don't
care what they think their actions will interfere with your life. Slander can
lead to mobs with pitchforks and torches outside your door (burn that
child molester -- or whatever), or to not being able to get a decent job and
a lot more nastiness. That's the way the world works.

It's not that easy, certainly when a powerful enemy (like a company
or some sect) has targeted you.

A slander trial forces the attackers to produce some hard evidence, something
you could hardly do on your own. No evidence means that it was indeed slander
which meens fines/jail etc. are in order.

I don't think this is due to just hating castro, but more to do with the
fact that the (perceived, at least) standard of living of the US is much
better than Cuba's, or any other place in latinamerica.  The fact that
they go to the US is because the US let them, and so would 25% of the rest
of latinamerica go if they would let them.  Open the border to mexico and
see how many move north.  Even when this is quite a dangerous and heavily
guarded border, millions go through.  In other words, if they would be
going because they hate Castro, they could just go in a much safer way to
a country where they speak the same language, but very few do.  They go
instead, to a country which doesn't give them entry VISA's so that the
only way left to go is sneak in in small boats or rafts.

I never really understood the problem in there.  Didn't (or doesn't) the
US have nuclear weapons pointed at Cuba? (my question is real, even though
i'm guessing an answer)

Not a government but an entity which is designated by some method by the
voluntary members of the group or commune which the entity is going to
direct.  This is a very broad definition, and this is due to the fact that
anarchism in general is very ambiguous and broad.  Anarcho-capitalism is
just a special case of this by setting group is equal to each indivual.
In the common case, the commune is a group of people that choose to live
together, and the entity that directs them are the people themselves, and
usually they don't do any enforcing since there is nothing to enforce cos
most private property is abolished.  (Usually means in most of the cases
i've read of village setups during the spanish revolution)

Americana: Disney Japan is the most successful theme park on earth. The US movie
industry generates more revinues overseas than it does domestically, and
outnumbers foreign domestic movie production by multiples in almost every country.
There are very few nations left in the world that don't have at least on McDonalds
or Burger King. Of the top ten grossing/attended/participated sports in the world,
at least three were invented in the US. Picabo Street is the most popular femaile
ski racer among Europeans. Oh, yeah, we are just totally unfashionable.....

The reason why the most rabid anti-statist here in the US would defend the US
system so vigorously is that a) the US has been, if anything, anti-statist in
general, at the very least to a greater extent than any other nation to date, b)
we have repeatedly shied away from world leadership, until the circumstances of
WWII demonstrated that nobody else seemed to be at all competent to do the job, c)
though we could have used the post WWII situation to expand in an imperialist
manner, the fact that we did not do so is rather indicative of the US's general
demeanor, as opposed to the prior behavior of any other great power in history. As
much as anybody else in the world thinks, most Americans, no matter how they feel
about our government, know down to their bones that the rest of the international
club has demonstrated a distinct incompetence for the job, and typically have
demonstrated an incompetence in handling their own populace.

Which is the main reason why most Americans are suspicious of the UN, since it
puts everybody else on an equal footing with us vote wise, while we have been
expected to foot the majority of the bill (as always).

No, big business does not necessarily mean big ships. But there's more:

1 medimnos (Greek) = 46 l
1 modius (Roman) = 8.7 l

Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 3.44.2-3:

"...merchant ships of a capacity up to 3000 enter at the mouth
of the river and arrive at Rome under oar or tow."
[larger unload in habour to river barges]

3000 modius = 26 tonnes -> 3000 medimnos = 138 tonnes. He was obviously
talking about medimnos, because he a) was a Greek and b) the other number
would not have made any sense.

There's more to come. I have another source that states that there were
about 60 to 80 ships of the Isis type (1200 tonnage, 2900 brutto register
tons). Have we now made it clear enough that the Roman ships were far
superior to MA and Viking ones?

Whoa.  Let me get this straight.  So you believe that if we eliminated
all punishments (i.e., costs imposed) on all law-breaking, including theft, 
rape, assault, etc., (including costs like having to take time to defend 
yourself in court) and we prevented private attempts to impose compensating
costs (such as via shunning, vigilantism, or better locks), that we would
NOT see an increase in crime rates?  People could walk into a bank and walk
out with bags of cash, suffer nothing worse for this than a possibly guilty 
conscious, and bank theft wouldn't be any worse than it is now?!

What about capture deters them if not for the fear of being punished?

I find myself drawn to enter a discussion thread I am sure has left it's
pertinence to this list behind. The politics of cultural arguments are
IMHO not resolvable. I have visited Cuba twice so on my observations
Cuba is desperatly poor but uniformly poor, as opposed to before the
revolution when there was rich, middle class and poor. The people I
spoke with do not hate Castro per se, but then much of their opinions
are heavily inluenced by official news. The ones I spoke with blame the
US embargo for their economic woes but other than tourists and rock
lobster the US has little they need from Cuba and Cuba trades with the
rest of the world. As to nuclear weapons targeted on Cuba, this was my
trigger to respond, take a breath and think. What would the US target
and how would they explain the fallout to the powerful independant
territory of the Conk (Florida Keys) or Jamaica, Caymans, etc.?

 IAN: I believe that the misunderstanding 
 is all yours, for you have clearly failed 
 to evidence such on my part.  Here are two 
 examples of definitions of "identity," which 
 restrict what "identity" is to "same as" (I
 have yet to find a popular definition con-
 trary to this standard):


  IDENTITY a statement that two mathematical states 
  are euqal for all values of their variables. [1]

  IDENTITY 1. exactly the same, as in same houses; a 
  relation of complete and absolute sameness or resem-
  blance between two things... 2. ...a meaning relation 
  that remains the same in our application of it... 3. 
  neither 1. nor 2., but a relation of sameness... [2]

 ___________________________________________
 [1] Penguin Dictionary of Mathematics.
 [2] Harper Collins Dictionary of Philosophy.

 If "identity" is "same as," then if I am different
 than everything, I have no identity. The definition
 of "identity" as "same as" is a total confusion as
 to the nature of what identity IS. To the absolute
 contrary, "identity" is "different than."  Minus
 difference is minus identity,  and therefore to
 define identity based upon the similarity of a
 thing with itself is an error and irrational.

 The difference between A and A is null, is zero,
 and thus the statement "A=A" is a null statement.
 Identity is 100% holistic and 0% atomistic, and
 thus, a 100% atomistic definition is 100% false.

  IAN: Well I don't know what definitions 
  your reading, but even the Three Laws of 
  Thought -- (1) A is A (2) A is not both A
  and not-A (3) A is A or not-A -- could not
  more clearly define the "identity" of A as 
  being 100% exclusive to A, which is false.

  IAN: In short, a "relation of sameness" is a fallacy,
  for only different things can be related.  "Same as"
  is "non-identity." We can relate two things that are
  similar only to the extent that they are different,
  for example that they occupy two different spaces.

  The perfect "same as relation" would be a relation of a 
  thing to itself, but such a relation is a null relation.
  Therefore the prevailing atomist definition of identity
  is false, irrational, an clearly contrary to reality.

  Identity is difference, and difference is holistic.

Of course yes: Equality is also named, in mathematics, the Holliest of
Sacred Sciences {   :-)  },  "identity relation", the simplest example of
equivalence relations. Related to it, there is the transformation  I ,
where I(x)=x ; I is named "identity transformation".

The wonders of hyperlinking and massive abstraction make that
impossible, every bit of information is tide to every other bit of
information.  Change one piece of history and you've got to change it
all.  Besides, this is an autonomous meta network, everything you do
creates additional data.

Well you can't hack in because it has nothing to hack into (it's open,
remember?).  You can't change history for the reasons above.  You
could try and destroy the data but it's completely distributed, which
makes things very hard to find.  You could try to orgainise somekind
of anti-openess conspiracy, but the majority of people have more to
gain from openess than from privacy (i.e. losers.)

There's are no network administrators, it's completely distributed
autonomous anarchy.

But the data must be machine-readable.

For the sake of argument, let's say you managed secret communication. 
Who would you send communicate with?  What would you say?  Do you
think you can organise people against the network?  What are you going
to stop?  What can you steal from an open society?  How can you bribe
an open society?  What have you got that they haven't?

The problem is that absolutely no concern is for the mother, their
only purpose is to get their hands on the baby. the prospective
adoptive parents are well-to-do contributers to the church.

Unethical,explotative, and IMMHO monstrous.

As I've already pointed out, the refusal of so called pro-life
groups to support birth control points clearly at their primary
goal.

'Out of control' isn't always such a 'bad' thing.  BTW, roads are also
centralist.

The system I was 'proposing' (yet another open network) doesn't really
have "negative feedback" only positive feedback.  I don't see how this
can go 'out of control', since it has no specific place to go in the
first place.

I wouldn't call it "surveillance" because the information is recorded

No its not. Possibly the most stable major system in the world. However, I
still curdle when I hear Mr Greenspan make some off the cuff remark and
the market reels in one direction or another in response. That is a bit
much authority, no matter how well he has demonstrated his competence to
weild it. Of course, most of this authority is merely intangible
psychological power, sort of a cult of personality that has developed as a
result of his good stewardship.

Currently, for the most part. In many states there are currently
privatization proposals for the major highways. I recall that one was
afoot a few years ago in Washington State. Recall that the original roads
in America were, in fact, private concerns.

Thats my point. Any system with only positive feedback will tend to cycle
out of control. "out of control" being economic cycles that, over time,
occilate into things like huge Boom and Bust cycles. Contrary to the
statements of Mr. Tal'se'hedrin, the boom of the 1920's and the Great
Depression were not caused by the Reserve system, as that system was not
in place until the Depression was well underway, though it is
understandable that with the pathetic economic knowledge of the time that
the Reserve systems initial steps to fix things only served to make things
worse. Since up to that point, economists were only familiar with measures
that induced positive feedback, it is natural that their first steps to
fix things made them worse, much like primitive western medicine. The
1920-1940 boom/bust cycle was the culmination of economic policies that
had been feeding on one another since the end of the civil war. Also
contrary to a previous poster's claims, the booms and busts of pre Reserve
decades, while shorter, were much more severe. The busts of the 1880's and
90's frequently put the majority of banks in existence out of business
permanently. With the non-existence of requirements for corporate
reporting, the stock market was frequently nothing but a great con game.
One of the scandals that fed the nervousness that caused the 1929 Crash
was the discovery of a large number of corporations which were nothing but
paper shells, in the style of the recent BRE-X scandal that hit the
Vancouver Exchange.

I don't think velocity belongs to this list of related concepts.  If you
leave off time from 'space-time' and put aside 'electromagnetic charge' and
'gravity' as subconcepts of energy-force-space then you can accomplish
this.  What you will have accomplished was accomplished by Parmenides many
moons ago, when he posited the One.  Your axiom is simply 'the One'.  Now
you need to proceed to Democritus and incorporate 'the Many' with 'the
One'.  Things do have a beginning and an end, there are indivisible things,
these are related to 'the Many' to matter or bits of substance, to discrete
time.

<...just as net universal energy equals zero.>

Or should that be net universal energy equals One?

<...you cannot get something from nothing...>

Tell that to the Big Bang crackpots.  You cannot get energy from itself,
nor can you get identity from itself, nor can you get an axiom from itself.
 More is involved than holism.

Richard Thieme's piece was forwarded to the E-list 3/16/98: <We are
beginning to engineer our very selves, to see our subjective ways of
framing reality and being in the world as modular objects to be
manufactured and enhanced.>

Up to now, this has been called formation of character, expanding our
faculties.  Nothing new.  As long as it's our own selves we are
engineering, freedom is necessary.  When it comes to engineering other
selves, a willingness to submit to political restraint is necessary.

<In the next century, it's going to be bootstrapping big time for the human
species as we see ourselves as an image in our own collective mind, an
image to be designed and executed.>

And the image makers, the creators of culture, will provide the ideals and
standards of our new faculties and physiognomies.  They will lead, the rest
will follow in a hazy made-to-order liberty.

<Ethical reflection never anticipates the breakthroughs that make us sit up
straight, nor do legal niceties.>

Nonsense.  If ethical reflection was useless, no one would do it.  It isn't
useless, it is vital to all formation of culture.

Well... I disagree completely... Why to self-limiting ?  The "living being"
comes evoluting, on Earth, since the monocellular, to marine "worms",
fishes, reptiles, {mammalians { monkeys}}, until the actual monocerebrate,
with low vision/audio/smell etc senses, and of course, poor locomotive
capabilities homo "sapiens" ... This hominide, for his turn, has already
created other evolutive capabilities in the world around, like cars,
aeroplanes, computers, nanorobots etc., and since some centuries ago,
begins to perceive that he can add  such evolution to his own being... Like
an Icarus well-succeeded... And I am not talking just about hardware, but,
mainly, about software... Our minds are, truly speaking, ridiculously
simple in comparison to its own imagination... or to its
creation/realization capability... There is no real barrier to our infinite
evolution, except ignorance, fear, shiness, wrong traditions, religions and
cultural influences wich we must trash out... (note: do not thash out
fraternity, charity etc... but use more mature kinds of them..) We will
simply have unlimited  self-transformative possibilities... The complete
understanding of our whole being, not just the mind, will simply make
possible the complete self-redesign of our own existence on any aspects one
can think, and at any instant one can desire... and of the whole universe...

And...: Do not believe in all the populars say around... Or so you do not
respect those who are in the high top of knowledge creation/development...

One of which is "gunpowder green" tea, a very highly concentrated
caffeine source.  They also use the technologies of candles and
incense while disdaining technology.

Don't get me wrong--I practice Zazen myself, and have a great
respect for the likes of Bankei and Dogen Zenji, but don't make
the mistake of believing that Zen is more immume to hypocrisy
than any other religious practice.

In almost everything you write.  You spend pages and pages
on defining "Identity" and claim that this is an exercise
of reason in itself.  You can have your definition if you
like--it's no skin off my nose.  But the old definition--
even if it's "wrong" in some sense--manages to feed me,
build houses, move me around, and generally make my life
interesting.  If you want us to accept your definition,
show us how using your definition /accomplishes/ something
tangible and real in my life.

I must admit that the recent post by John Clark is not the one I must have
expected from the extropian list, but sometimes the people who live in the
Empire of the World have such a point of view that is different to
understand for people that doesnt live in a country that invaded dozens of
countries because they were suposed to have the right to do so.
Cuba does not have the kind of goverment that I like. That is obvious. I
love freedom. But part of freedom is to let cubans have the kind of system
that they want. Mr. John Clark talks of a police state. Who invaded Granada
in the 80? and Vietnam in the 60? and Guatemala in the 50's and put all
the worst kind of fascist dictatorship in every country in Latin America?
Who supports the medieval government of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and a long
list of countries organized in a way that are shameful for the humankind. 
Maybe all of us live in a police state, but United States police loves
traveling, and if you will talk of trade  you should know that your free
market country prohibits to exchange trade with Cuba. 
"Castro  did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third highest
standard of living in the western hemisphere, only the USA and Canada were
higher. The fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race
closer to the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten thousand
years does not 
increase my admiration of him".
You are supposed to defend the previous goverment, a worst dictatorship than
this, saying that Cuba was the third country by quality of life in 1959.
That is at least inexact. You say "25% of the population,  
have abandoned Cuba and the didn't go to the USSR, they went to a  
capitalistic country". That is very obvious, they fled because they were
capitalistic people and they are the very rich latins of the United States.
And the last thing is really astonishing. The bad Castro put us all closer
to the brink of extinction? But who threw the atomic bombs? Who has the
nuclear power to destroy us all?  United States and its satelite Israel, and
probably Russia.
Its not Cuba, nor Granada.
"The sad thing is that you not only oppose a free market in money and goods 
but also ideas." 
I hope you dont also accuse me to be opposed to a free market of ideas, but
is your police country that does. 
I do know that people in my country that need the best medical help must go
to Cuba, and I know that blocking the economy of a little island is not the
way to fight against a system that I do not agree.
If I love Internet is because it goes beyond any blockade, even if it is
from the brain.
Sorry for my english, my first lenguage is spanish, and sorry for not being
too much polite.

in this particular discussion...: Even Einstein used the same
"Identity"definition...)

Sure, but as a general axiom, most issues are either a matter of social freedom or
economic freedom, or a combination thereof, or can be framed within that system. It also
delineates between merely 'conservative' and 'liberal' labels which are often  painted
with rather broad brushes, so much so that in many cases, parties are insulted to be
under the same roof as another given the same label. An American Libertarian is about
the furthest you can get from a Nazi, yet both are labeled as 'right wing'. Populists
have more in common with Nazis than Libertarians do, yet Populists are frequenly given
the liberal label (except in the case of Pat Buchanan, who proved the similarity between
the two messages).

It is said that what caused the US superiority after the war was the nazi policy towards
Jews. The dozen most brilliant men in Europe fled to the US as a result. Thus, the Nazis
helped us to gain post war superiority far more than any of our allies. The British
could have done the same using Canada as a base if they had the capability, but they did
not. The French had the earliest start in the race with Madame Curie's work, but
preferred to collaborate with the Nazis. Stalin initially looked on nuclear physics as
mere jewish quackery that violated socialist principles, and was therefore suppressed
until spies in the Manhattan Project indicated its use.

If the US way of life is so inferior, why is it that everyone wants our lifestyle and
standard of living?

While most other democratic governments utilize a parliamentary system of government,
these have proven to be rather unstable and prone to rapid populist influence (bread and
circuses), the US uses a republican system with, as you must know, three equally
powerful branches that are capable of checking the other. This system provides a measure
of negative feedback that helps hold in check the most contagious of populist fads and
foolishness.

In a century where europeans and asians heralded the end of the age of the individual,
and the advent of the collective, only to be proven in the 1980-1990 period to be
hopelessly wrong by the US, the US has stood out as a lone beacon of continued
individualism, self reliance. We have successfully purged the welfare state from our
federal system, and most of our state governments. Other nations that have followed suit
now enjoy stronger economies than their stagnant socialist neighbors.

The main groups objecting to the 'US way' are the east asian tyrannies and dictators in
China, Indonesia, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam, etc.. They have claimed for the past eight
years that their Cunfucian culture is superior and can successfully be melded to an open
market, yet as recent asian markets indicate, this does not seem to be so. While asian
markets continue to hit new lows, the US market has rebounded nicely and is now setting
new highs. The 'Asian Flu' seems to be more systemic of asian systems than western style
economies.

Likewise, the French have similarly been rather stubborn about keeping their welfare
state intact, leading even to widespread rioting and violence, yet the conservative
government policies of the last several years can be credited with the recent slow
easing of inflation and unemployment there, though this past weeks elections would seem
to indicate this will end and France will fall further down the tubes, and possibly out
of the EU common money system for the time being. Those European nations that have
mirrored the US economic policies are sitting in the best positions for leadership in
the new economy there.

I think that the US has shown enough times that they don't give a fuck
about what a bunch of centroamericans think.  What would they have said to
western europe had they bombed the east?
My main point is, do you positively know that Cuba wasn't targeted, or are
you just guessing like me?

There was a little "article" in the section at the back of the New
Scientist (i can't remember what it's called now) a while ago about the
fact that the countries that the US invaded lately were really a coded
message to the world, and that the first letter of each of those countries
are an anagram for "KING ELVIS", but they had forgotten about a couple of
countries (eg Panama).  Of course, right now i can't remember what the
countries were.

Well, if you include Panama, then you are merely creating a combo of his two
nicknames: KING, and PELVIS. Of course, this is ignoring Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia, and Saudi Arabia (the S is, I imagine, for Somalia), as well as Haiti.

This sort of crap is the same sort of junk as the claim that BILL GATES III in
ascii equals 666. It doesn't, since the "III" is not three ones, but three "I"'s,
and just the sort of illogical off topic sniping liberals start spouting when
they know they are full of it, and realize that everyone else knows they are full
of it.

Since the  Soviet missiles were taken out, there is very little left to target
that is of military value. They have a total of 8 Mig-29 fighters left, some
coastal patrol boats, and a few deisel submarines that are in dock and short
of parts. At this point, Cuba is purposely starving itself merely from latin
pride, trying to make a last point, and doing it badly. While dollars rule the
economy, even legally, the gov'ts 100+% tax policies have forced any
meaningful economy underground, just as in many parts of the old Soviet Union.

Cuba is so desperate for international PR points that they manufactured an
agricultural blight to try to accuse the US of 'biological warfare'.

Its good to see that the Pope still has enough kick to tell Castro he's full
of it in public. He's probably the last western person the Cuban people will
beleive other than el Commadante.

I don't think it's meant to be a serious statement (that is, neither i nor
anyone else beleives that what the US is trying to do is send a secret
message), just a fun and concise way of showing the large number of
countries that the US invaded/s, and trying to back up Eduardo's point.

That is very probably so, but it really wouldn't be very hard to beleive
its true considering the US proven past record of trying to get rid of
Castro through any means possible (were they 7 or 8 assasination
attempts?)

No one ever does anything useless?  Hah!

Even if true, the only plausible form of that is "no one does anything useless
to them".  So ethical reflection may be fun, or impress one's philospher
peers, or let one get away with a lifestyle with no heavy lifting.  These
would be useful to the reflector without providing any use to society's
progress.

Just as extropian or Usenet yakking about technology has little to do with
creating new technology and a fair bit with expressing ourselves and feeling
communal.

  IAN: A skillful answer, but not an accurate 
  answer. Yes, suppliers are fewer than consumers,
  however, the paradigm you  posit of a "consumer 
  majority gathered around the supplier minority" 
  avoids the fact I highlighted, that consumer de-
  mand  controls  who those suppliers are and what
  it is they are doing. Therefore, while "central"
  implies "control of the many by the few,"
  consumer-demand implies exactly the opposite,
  which is control of the few (suppliers) by the
  many (consumers). So your paradigm collapses.

  Free-market capitalism is true decentralization.

Mathematically it is trivial.

Physically it is equally trivial.

But politically... 

A law that requires you to treat people 
differently on the basis of race is racist if it tilts in one 
direction, but anti-racist if it tilts in another?

Seems like "A=A" is not yet understood in the political arena.

Exactly; people did say that, and they were entirely correct.  So
Al used his theory to make specific, measurable predictions about
real things--and those predictions came true, and the rest is
history.  He didn't just say "Newton is wrong" and expect people
to buy his flawless logic--even though it was flawless.  He said
"look, if I'm right, you'll see these stars out of place when they
go near the sun by this amount..." and they were.  He predicted
that matter would form dense super-atoms at a certain pressure,
and now, decades after his death, we've done exactly that.  Even
if Einstein had been "right" in some philosophical sense, if he
had never made measurable predictions about the physical world,
all his brilliant logic would be no more than masturbation.

To discuss  central banks and "other" components of free-market 
systems is nonsensical, because a central bank IS NOT a component of 
a free-market system.  

A central bank may happen to exist in a market which is 
otherwise mostly free; but then an absolute dictator might choose to 
allow freedom of religion, and nobody would say that the dictator was 
then a component of a free country.

  IAN: Right, well-stated. To define crackpot
  as such puts everyone to some degree and at 
  some time into that category. I think that the
  dictionary definition of "crackpot" I cited is 
  good enough. Beyond that I'd define a crackpot
  as someone who keeps promoting a theory and/
  or claim to truth even though there is either
  no evidence for such or overwhelming evidence 
  against such. This puts those who believe in 
  a Biblically defined God and those who believe
  in a flat Earth into the "crackpot" category.
  In sum: belief sans or contrary to evidence.

  A crackpot is one who would be perpetrating 
  a fraud by promoting a claim except that they 
  are doing so due to some psychological fixa-
  tion, such that they actually believe that 
  which they promote. People try to stuff the 
  TWA-800-missile theory into the "crackpot"
  category because the Govt has rejected the
  theory. However, if dozens of people saw a
  streak of light rise up from the surface and 
  take the plane down, and if the directions 
  that these people point to when indicating
  the "launch site" is the same spot, even as
  these witness are spread across many miles,
  that alone is sufficient evidence to prevent
  the TWA800-missile theory from being defined
  as a "crackpot" theory, not to mention that
  it's heavily supported by physical evidence.

  IAN: The problem I see with that definition 
  is that if X has an idea or theory and in-
  stantly declares "Eureka" and goes public, 
  that fact alone does not mean the idea is 
  a false idea, and being false is a primary 
  prerequisite of "crackpotdom." 

  Also, defining a "crackpot" as someone who
  runs out to proclaim a new idea prior to 
  getting all the facts is problematic to the
  extent that nobody has all the facts, so if
  that's the definition of "crackpot," then 
  everyone falls into the definition, more or
  less, and that makes the term rather null.

  Also, the idea that going public is bad
  (in the age of the Internet) but going to
  those with expertise first is good, is 
  problematic because going public on the 
  Internet may be the fastest way to reach 
  the largest numbers of experts, and there-
  fore your definition leads to a contradic-
  tion. The style of presenting an idea as 
  "this must be true," is also simply a bold 
  way of provoking counter argumentation --
  such as "Oh ya..." -- which is, once again,
  a means of seeking feedback from others.

  I think that a "crackpot" is simply one
  who promotes X where X is without and/or
  contradicted by physical evidence, and 
  specifically who promotes it after such 
  evidentury problems have been made known.
  And by that definition I proclaim that the
  atomist theory of identity is "crackpot."

I live in Miami Florida and I've talked to Cubans every day of my life for  
years, not thousands but MILLIONS of Cubans live here. Out of all those  
millions there must be one that doesn't hate Castro, but I've yet to find him. 
Without a single exception in my experience, they hate Castro with an  
intensity I can't fully relate to. I've not had as difficult a life as these  
poor people and I don't hate anyone or anything as strongly as they hate  
Castro.

The problem was global extinction. The USSR withdrew its nuclear missiles 
from Cuba over the strong objection of Castro. Neither side can find much to 
brag about in their nuclear policy but the fact remains, if the USSR had done 
what Castro was urging them to do there would have been a nuclear war, and
we wouldn't be having this pleasant conversation today, not just because 
there wouldn't be an Internet, but because there wouldn't be a you and there 
wouldn't be a me.                  

During the crisis most of the president's advisers, including all the 
military ones, were urging the President not to wait and to take action 
immediately. For example, Chief of the U.S Air Force, General Curtis LeMay 
(a VERY scary man) and the head of the Strategic Air Command, Thomas Powers 
(even LeMay called him a sadist) told the president that if we didn't order 
the missile sites in Cuba bombed within the hour it would be a blot on the 
honor of the U.S.A. Kennedy asked LeMay what he thought the Soviets would do 
if he did that. LeMay said he understood how the soviets think and because 
such an attack would be bound to kill lots of Russians manning the site they 
couldn't let it pass, he said they would probably retaliate by bombing our
medium range nuclear missiles in Turkey. Kennedy asked what we should do then, 
LeMay said such an attack would kill American solders and that would have to 
be avenged by bombing nuclear missile sites in the USSR itself. Kennedy asked 
what the Soviets would do then, LeMay said he hoped at that point cooler 
heads would prevail.

Actually it was even worse than that. We now know from recently declassified 
USSR archives that the nuclear missiles in Cuba were fully operational in 
October 1962 and that the Russian field commanders were authorized to fire 
them on their own authority if it looked like the missiles were about to be
destroyed or captured. The field commanders had the launch codes! Castro
knew this, Kennedy did not.
           
The USA thought incorrectly that the missiles were not yet operational and 
they never dreamed they could be fired without a direct order from Moscow. 
We also know that the USA was absolutely determined to get rid of the missiles 
one way or another, if they were not removed by diplomacy in a matter of days 
they would send an air strike to destroy them. As I said, the human race 
never came closer to extinction.

I don't often say nice things about Communist dictators but I will now,   
Khrushchev had the intelligence to see the insanity in the situation and had   
the guts to back down. Castro was absolutely furious at Khrushchev's decision   
to remove the missiles and never forgave him for it. Khrushchev often made
bloodthirsty speeches but he really didn't want to be a mass murderer on such  
a vast scale, but Castro would rather destroy the world than be embarrassed.   
If Castro was the dictator of the USSR and not Cuba, you and I and everyone   
we know would be dead.                            
        

        >Didn't (or doesn't) the US have nuclear weapons pointed at Cuba? 


I don't know, it's top secret, but I doubt it, there's nothing important in  
Cuba anymore, not militarily or economically or scientifically or 
artistically or...

A government is an organization that claims a monopoly on the legal use of 
force and has the power to enforce its claim most of the time. In  
Anarcho-capitalism no group has rights an individual does not have. So what 
the hell are Anarcho-socialists?

Fine, you have a perfect right to do that and I have not the slightest  
objection. I presume everyone on this list believes in the Scientific Method, 
so let's put it to the test, start your socialist commune today, I'll stick 
with business, and we'll see which one turns out to be freer and more 
prosperous. I have no desire to stop you, and anyway I have a pretty good 
idea which one of us will win the contest, but by all means, try to prove me 
wrong. If you do then you will have beaten me fair and square in the free 
market of ideas.

I get the impression that our positions are not symmetric however, that you  
do have a strong desire to stop me. If I'm wrong about that then I apologize 
and we have no disagreement over morality, only over the technical points of  
economics, and there is no need to worry about that, nature will let us know 
which one of us is correct, no doubt about it.

Well of course you're completely correct. Communism can't make poor people

that's a virtue.
            

        >The people I spoke with do not hate Castro per se, 


If I was a Cuban in Cuba and a foreigner asked me what I thought of Castro

dummies.    


        >The ones I spoke with blame the US embargo 
            

The US embargo is certainly part of Cuba's problem, another part is that 
Castro was not smart enough to figure that out. Going out of your way to  
antagonize you main customer, the largest economic power in the world and 
only 90 miles away, is not the ticket to prosperity, unfortunately for the 
Cuban people Castro's IQ is only room temperature so all this came as a big
surprise to him.

On the other hand, the US embargo (which I oppose) performs an invaluable 
service for Castro, every dictator needs a scapegoat to explain failure,  
Hitler had the Jews and Castro has the embargo.

Of course it's a silly example.  But *why* is it a silly example, i.e.

Every state is evil, but ours is - or was - among the least evil.
I'm not as big a fan as Mike Lorrey, though.  I think it was he who
pointed out that the USA did not take advantage of WW2 to pursue
territorial expansion; that may be because the courts might make the
government treat its new subjects like citizens -- much more convenient
to occupy them as "military advisors" and/or rule through puppets.

You may be thinking of the Turks, who besieged Vienna in 1529 and 1683.
The Mongols (coming through Poland) reached central Germany, if memory
serves; they turned back in 1241 because their leader died.

Gee, call me naive, but I'd have sworn the fall of Rome amounted to the
end of a power structure.

I think Charlie means (and I agree) that increasing the severity of
punishments, as our posturing politicians like to do, is pointless so
long as the robber is confident that punishment is unlikely.  (And
remember that crooks tend to underestimate the likelihood of getting
caught, anyway).  Rather than jacking up the (nominal) length of
sentences and building more prisons for the minority who get caught,
we'd be better off devoting those resources to catching more of the
crooks.

It is interesting to observe changing orthodoxies. Yesterday, I quoted an
article with the claim: "But many other cells don't divide at all during
adult life, including the neurons of the brain." Today, we have the
following article:
http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/national/sci-growing-brain.html

Studies Find Brain Grows New Cells
by Gina Kolata in the New York Times

begin excerpt

For years, neurobiologists clung to a fundamental truth: once animals, or
people, reach adulthood, they may lose brain cells but they can never grow
new ones. There were a couple of exceptions -- in birds and rats -- but
the thought was that these were peculiarities of nature and not evidence
of a general principle.

But now, in experiments that experts call amazing, that dogma has been
overturned. Scientists have found that monkeys are constantly making new
brain cells in the hippocampus, an area of the brain used for forming
long-term memories. Moreover, they report, the production of new cells is
squelched when the animals are under extreme stress.

Experts say they fully expect that humans are no different and that they,
too, make new brain cells in adult life. That raises the glimmer of a
possibility of eventually treating degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's
or Parkinson's disease and injuries, like those resulting from stroke or
trauma, by prompting the brain to grow replacement cells, researchers
said.

It also means that neurobiologists must re-think their notions of how the
brain changes with learning or life experiences. The new study was by Dr. 
Elizabeth Gould of Princeton University, Dr. Bruce S. McEwen of
Rockefeller University in New York and their colleagues. "It means that
there is a new mechanism for changing the organization of the adult
brain," said Dr. William Greenough, a psychologist at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who studies learning and memory in rats. Dr.
Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, said the
implications were "fabulously interesting."

Eduardo, you misunderstand me, the last thing I'd want to do is defend any of

the U.S. government is brilliant.

I know and I strongly disagree with it, it's far from the only criticism I 
have of the U.S. government

Both sides of arms race did lots of stuff worthy of contempt. Castro is bad, 
but that wasn't my point in this case, it was that Castro is stupid and he 
nearly got us all killed.

hmm...interesting.  But it doesn't convince me that they wouldn't have
gone if Castro wasn't there.  Why do the approximately 1 million
Mexicans/year that sneak into the US do so?

perceived by them, i meant.  That is, standard of living is an extremely
subjective scale, and obviously there would be heaps of people that would
disagree with that "fact" above.

Really?  It would have to be a pretty shitty encyclopedia which claims to
have an absolute on a "standard of living" scale.  Did you mean that they
had the 3rd highest GDP/capita in America?  I wouldn't disagree with that
(even though i doubt it, it would be easy enough to look up), but i would
have to see quite a bit more stats (eg lifespan, literacy, average
wealth, %top 20/ %bottom 20, work hours per week) to assert that
they had the 3rd highest "standard of living", and since you already seem
to have found it, it would save me a whole heap of trouble if you would
point me to the relevant sources.

Thank you for that account, now in the case that the US had nuclear
weapons targeted at Cuba, as i'm assuming they had  (it's pretty funny
that we have details of the decisions and state of weaponry of "closed
dictatorships", but not about an "open democracy"), how is Castro any more
responsible about this escallation than Kennedy?  Why is Kennedy praised
for being the hard man while Castro is satanised?  From your above
account, the only guy who didn't seem to be a complete psycho was
Khrushchev.

I thought you were asking, and i was giving you a definition, but you
don't seem to like that.  No, in the kind of anarcho-socialism i had in
mind, voluntary means more along the lines of "Do you care to join us?", i
think it would work better than the option you gave.  Entity is just that,
an entity.  It is purposefully left ambiguous to accomodate to the
group/commune.  Same thing with designated.

The same as anarcho-capitalists, substituting the group/comune mentioned
above for the individual.  That is inside the commune, the rules/laws are
up to the commune/group, outside, the commune's relations to other
commune's are simmilar to inter-individual relations in an
anarcho-capitalist society (or whatever you feel like calling it).

I don't have any desire to stop you at all.  In fact, i would say that
anarcho-capitalist and anarcho-socialist societies could live rather
peacefully alongside each other, but i'm no more able to setup an
anarchosocialist commune than you are of setting up an anarchocapitalist
one since any kind of current power structure wouldn't let either of them
exist. I also have a pretty good idea of which one would be freer.

Sorry.  Must have been half-asleep.

Still, Erik's previous claim, that the biggest medieval ship (about 200
tons, was it?) would not be allowed in a Roman harbor, is invalidated.

Again: you're confusing identity with description.  You have in the past
given examples such as "the shortest man in the world", and rightly
pointed out that the man is so described only because there are other
people.  But this is description, not identity.  The man would still be
identical to himself if he were the only man in the universe; his
identity would remain, only his description would change.

And yet that is how "identity" is defined, according to the very
dictionaries you cited.  The word was coined (in the 14C, ac.to OED)
from the Latin word _idem_ `the same'.  Please make a note of that:
_idem_ does not mean `different'.

It is a null statement, yes, in that it provides no new information. 
But if A and B (not previously known to be identical) are equated (A=B),
that is new information: the amount of difference between A and B is
measured and found to be zero.

Perhaps we need to distinguish between mathematical identity - identity
as applied to abstract constructs, which can be indefinitely copied
without creating a distinction between the copies - and the identity of
a tangible object (with itself).  The tune of "Greensleeves" and that of
"What Child Is This" are identical, but two copies of the sheet-music
for "Greensleeves" are not.

>  Identity is 100% holistic and 0% atomistic, and

You seem to be defining identity as "description by relation to
something else".  That's an interesting concept, and no doubt there's
room for plenty of discussion about it; but it's *not* identity.

I don't know what you mean by "association" here, but these Laws clearly
do *not* deny all relation between A and not-A: they have the relation
of inequality or non-identity.  (Duh.)

If I say "there is no relation between A and B," I do *not* mean that A
and B are never equal; I mean that no statement about their equality is
consistently true -- they're sometimes equal, sometimes not, without any
causal linkage.  If on the other hand "A and B are never equal", there
*is* a relation between them (the Pauli exclusion principle is an
example).

Or different times.  If a cat walks into my room tonight, I will assume
it's the same cat I saw this morning (unless its coloring is visibly
different).  I mentally relate (compare) two perceptions and judge them
to be of the same entity; this is vernacular identity.  I can never be
certain that the cat hasn't been replaced with a similar cat while I
wasn't looking, but as an operationalist I generally rely on the
assumption that if I can't perceive a difference I can safely assume
it's the same cat.

I suppose you would say: "You make your judgement of the cat by
measuring her difference from your shoes, the neighbor's dog, and other
things that are not Fluffy."  That's partly true and partly false.  I
know by experience that most of the things in the world do not look like
Fluffy; but I do *not* examine anything else.  If I were in a black void
and the only thing illuminated were a cat, I would say, without looking
about for another comparand, "That's Fluffy" (or not, as the case may
be).

And then there's binocular vision: two perceptions of the same thing at
the same place and time, yet slightly different.

Sounds like it might become quite popular. Unfortunately, it might
become rather useless: the postmodern eclecticism ("let's mix
everything, it is just cultural constructs anyway") goes well with the
a-rational aspects of zen, and the drugs and techno will of course
make it a hit with the ravers.

Before trying to come up with a modern form of zen, we might ponder
what we want to achieve instead.

I think the old systems for mental training have a lot going for
them. Unfortunately they are filled with plenty of junk
(i.e. ideas/settings that are unsupported, but passed down as great
revelation or dogma since nobody has dared question them) and
non-scientific thinking. Science is the organized search for
knowledge, many of these systems actually try to reach knowledge
through fairly formalized structures, but they lack the interest in
making the results accessible, replicable and useful. A modern mental
system ought to include that.

As for myself, I have begun thinking a bit on "The Way of Science", in
analogy to budo ("The Way of the Warrior"; what would the TWoS become
in japanese?). Nothing solid yet, but I think it is a worthwhile
exercise.

I thought we were trying to transcend all of this dualist
nonsense? People find it incredibly easy to separate reality into
"us" and "them", "good" and "bad" etc.  This doesn't make it
accurate, merely convenient.

My impression of this list is that it is populated by a majority
of people who either consider themselves superior to the common
herd, or are trying to attain a position of superiority (I make
no moral arguments for or against the word "superior", it's just
a label), so the fact that most people do something doesn't
really do a lot to convince me that this is the way to operate in
general. Quite the opposite, in fact.

I understand what you are saying, it just strikes me as
sophistry, isall.

Yeah. Sure. Go ahead and convince yourself that this is the case.
You can tell yourself that this is the way it operated as much as
you like, but I have yet to see a posting from someone outside
the US who agrees with you. What does this suggest?

Oh? So why exactly does the rest of the world still live in the
rest of the world, then?
I would agree that the rest of the world does want your standard
of living. Yes.  Not your way of life, certainly not your
international relations, but I will grant you that the rest of
the world would like the opportunity to be as rich as the united
states. But this is simply a measure of wealth, it in no way
validates the american way of life.

I live in Australia. We have one of the highest standards of
living in the world. I can't honestly think of a single person I
know who in any way envies life in the United States. [thinks
hard]  Nup.

Oh. Okay. You are of course referring to something other than the
Westminster System which as far as I know is quite a robust
parliamentary system.

Two words: Ronald Reagan.

You are of course joking. The President of the United States has
as much power as the other two branches of government. This has
always struck me as dangerously absurd, but given that it was
created in the wake of a monarchy, understandable.

you really do have it bad, don't you? Do you really believe this
propaganda? I'm not sure that anyone outside your country does,
and I wonder what the rest of this list from the US thinks. I'd
have thought this list would be discussing solutions and
strategies for the post-statist reality, instead I find myself
sucked into a foolish argument about the "superiority" of the
american way of life, laced so far with very little real
evidence, and an awful lot of opinion.

Well, I'd rather live in a poor but free country than a rich one
where huge proportions of the population is locked up. Waa hoo
free enterprise, where you are free to work hard but do little
else. No thanks, I'd rather stay in my happy little socialist
nation where we don't lock people up -quite- as much.

Western money prompted the huge development projects, and the
withdrawal of western money created the collapse, and now western
money is buying the place up at bargain basement prices.  the
coming century will be an unlucky time to be white, I feel, when
the rest of the world gets its shit together and realises what
the west has done over the last couple of hundred years, and is
continuing to do.

Bah, I'm over this thread.

No, I most assuredly am not.
All of my history texts are in boxes while I look for somewhere
to live, but acvcording to the national geographic behind me,
(February 1997) the mongols reached the outskirts of Vienna in
1241 but turned bakc when news reached them that Ogodei the Great
Khan had died.

Probably because like most subject nations Brazil was seen as a
source of raw materials, and thus took quite some time to develop
an industrial base, whereas the US overthrew colonial power early
on in the piece and was forced to develop a native industrial
base.  I'd say population has something to do with it, too,
although I'm totally clueless when it comes to the comparative
population, so I may be talking out of my hat on this one.

It's easy to compete internationally when you have already
recouped development costs and turned a profit from domestic
sales alone. And I would say there is more to a way of life than
coke and baywatch.

Even more convenient to do away with the overheads of occupation
and rule and extract just as much money from unfair trade as you
could have via tribute.

I think this is by far the cleverest thing the US has done:
instead of maintaining huge standing armies and colonial
administration, with the associated costs, simply ensure that
your domestic companies are the dominant players in the market
and suck money out that way. bingo, all the benefits of an empire
and none of the disadvantages.

This of course depends on how you define 'poor' and 'rich'.

No: I'm _not_ saying that we should eliminate punishment. What I'm saying
is that the severity of punishment -- be it a week in prison or a year,
or ten years, or a hanging -- is not the factor that deters people from
criminal behaviour; it's the _certainty_ of punishment. Therefore, given
finite resources, we would achieve a better deterrent effect by putting
resources into catching criminals and clearing up crime reports,  rather 
than locking them up for long (and expensive) prison sentences. 

A burglar is more likely to be deterred by a 1 year prison sentence, and
an 80-90% probability of capture and conviction, than by a 10 year
sentence but a mere 10% probability of apprehension. (This is one reason
why some parts of europe have low crime rates _and_ light prison
sentences -- but very efficient police forces who catch most criminal
very rapidly.) Of course, it's a lot easier for a grandstanding
politician to pass a law mandating twenty year prison sentences for
burglars than it is for them to up the police crime clear-up statistics,
so we get stupid laws, draconian punishments, and an effectively zero
probability of arrest -- exactly the conditions that bring the law into
disrepute and disregard!

Michael, where do you find your informations? In what kind of "reader's
digest"-like  tabloid ? By "rioting" do you mean the traditional use of
strike (which is part of worker's rights in any democratic country)?  By
"violence" do you mean the few burned cars (without any corporal
violence) which occured last year (under the precedent, right winged
government, by the way). If those events were rioting and violence how
do you call the riots of Los Angeles a few years ago ? Nuclear war?
Apocaplyptic grey goo ???

unemployment grow steadily during the conservative governments, which,
btw increased the taxes (you, libertarian ? or are there "good taxes" ,
conservative ones which affect middle class people, and "bad ones",
liberal ones, which concerns big fortunes and big enterprises ?).
Inflation was stopped by the socialist government before 1993,but this
was perhaps, according to some economists,  a cause for unemployment
(but being not an economist, and not having the arrogance to rant
constantly about topics I know nothing about, I have no idea on this).
Unemployment has been slowing down for the four last monthes now, and
economy is getting better. (this has been noticed by independant
organizations, generally unkind with the government: they are not "cuban
statistics"). Frankly, I doubt the present governement can be the cause
of this(I repeat: I'm not an economist), but, sure, at least it didn't
kill this new slow renewal by persecuting the middle class, which is
precisely the one which consumes goods.(a thing that even a
non-economist like me can understand, but seems completely new to a
french conservative, too busy to flatter his rich clients)

Two monthes ago, europeans financial institutions confirmed that France
had succesfully reduced its deficit toward the goal of 3 1/2 %(a thing
the precedent  conservative governement, was totally unable to do) and
will be able to be among the first group of nations for the 1999
rendez-vous of Euro.
I heard Tony Blair saying in an interview that England (which mirrored
the most US policies) was for the moment unable to do it . I don't know
if it's true, but at least I quote my sources.

Ah, I promised myself to stay away from this noisy discussion. Too
late...

In the interest of moving the disscusion along, if one 95% agrees with a
responding post does one let it go? If not, John I made an observation
of my trips, I said that the peoples views are directly relational to
the official news media and that there used to be a strata of economic
levels but that now there is just desperate poverty. I will now add that
in my opinion that is macro economically bad.  I find it difficult to
sumarize large complex sweeping issues as you do, honest your's was a
good and interesting post, it is just me.  I am uncomfortable in
discussing in depth my experiances because I do respect the fact that
Cuba is a police state and I would not want to put at risk people I
spoke with other than to say they were, I believe, frank with me. I did
not agree with much of there views, personally, but understand their
position. Equally while I am not a US citizen I spend much time there
and while perfectly in my right to do business with Cuba it is not in my
interest to directly disrespect US laws, even if I personally disagree
with them.  I will finish by by adding that the result of my due
diligence on Cuba is that I suggested that we pass on putting funds in
now. In my opinion  Castro has bought time for HIS government by his
policies and using the US as the excuse for all their woes, but  have
only postponed and magnified the economic dislocations to come when he
is gone.  The primary reason, of many, as reported to me, was that those
that left who were the former middle class or rich  have the resources
to  "buy" Cuba many times over and those who are still there know it,
resent it bitterly, and are powerless to do any thing about it. I
believe all will work out, painfully, but I do not want to be at risk
during the process.

I still stand by my "feeling" on the pertinence of this thread but admit
it sure has got more interesting of late.

I don't see how that would work.  Just adding more junk DNA will not
reduce the number of mutations in the coding DNA.  The mutation rate is
presumably constant per base.  Adding N times as many bases will make
sure that N/(N+1) of the mutations occur in the junk region, but there
will still be the same number occuring in the coding part.

Hello, fellow extropians. I enjoy bouncing biological ideas on all of
you, I usually get great responses! I am working on a new idea (at
least, I have not been able to find anything like it in the literature)
on non-coding DNA. I have enclosed a copy of my abstract.

I am hoping those of you interested in junk DNA would be so kind to
reply to me with comments.

Thanks!

The Mutation Buffer Hypothesis and The Selective Advantage of Non-Coding
DNA

Thomas Quinn
Evolutionary Theory Research Group 
P.O. Box 510373 
New Berlin, WI 53151

quinn@evolutionary.org
swo@execpc.com

                                Abstract

All eukaryote cells posses extremely large amount of non-coding DNA,
which does not appear to be directly or indirectly involved in
transcription. A number of models (i.e. junk DNA, selfish DNA, skeletal
DNA, and nucleotypic DNA) have been proposed to explain the existence of
these non-informational sequences. Genomes are complex entities and it
should be noted that the division between coding and non-coding
sequences is an artificial simplification of the real-world situation.
It is likely that the various kinds of non-coding sequences such as
introns, pseudogenes, transpons, and teleomeres all have different
evolutionary histories. Since there is a great diversity of non-coding
sequences, the above hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
I would like to offer a new model that might explain the maintenance of
non-coding sequences in the genome. The mutation buffer hypothesis
suggests that non-informational DNA has a passive functionality and can
confer a selective advantage to an organism. This model proposes that
the non-coding sequences act as a huge buffer in order to absorb the
majority of mutations to the genome. Since most of the mutations within
coding sequences would be deleterious and potentially lethal to progeny,
the existence of "buffer DNA" could prevent decreases in fitness. With a
large buffer, many mutations would not have any negative effects on the
next generation because they would not alter coding sequences. Although
the mutation rate would remain constant, the number of mutations that
actually influenced the fitness of offspring would be reduced in
proportion to the non-coding:coding ratio. The mutation buffer
hypothesis makes the following assumptions:
        1) Point mutations are random events that can happen anywhere
           within the genome. 
        2) The probability of one nucleotide being altered from "X" to
           "Y" via mutation is identical for coding and non-coding
           regions. The bases A, T, C, and G can be substituted for any
           X or Y where X is not the same base as Y.
        3) If we compare two genomes with identical loci, the one with
           the higher percentage of non-coding sequences will also act,
           on average, as a stronger mutation buffer. 
If the mutation buffer hypothesis can explain the C-value paradox, it
would be expected that K-selected species would have more non-coding DNA
(and a larger buffer) than r-selected species. This is the general
trend. Prokaryote species possess very little, if any, non-coding
sequences while multicellular eukaryotes have extremely high levels of
non-coding sequences. The high cost of replicating, maintaining, and
storing huge genomes would regulate the upper limit of genome size and
the amount of buffer DNA.

                 Burning the Cosmic Commons: 
    Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar Colonization

                     by Robin Hanson

Abstract:

Consider an expanding wave of interstellar colonization, where 
"seeds" grow "colonies" at the "oases" surrounding stars, and 
then launch a new generation of seeds toward more distant oases.  
Without enforceable property rights in virgin oases, frontier 
colonization behavior should eventually be given by a selection 
effect: only leading edge colonists whose strategies implemented 
the maximum sustainable average speed would tend to stay near 
the leading edge. 
 
Even with such maximal strategies, however, random factors would 
cause some seeds to fall behind the leading edge.  Since 
eventually most of the colonized universe would be far behind
the leading edge, the strategies and values of such fallen-behind 
colonists are of interest.

We assume that oases are uniformly-distributed, that risk-neutral 
colonists with identical values and constant technology travel 
much farther than the oasis spacing, and that seeds receive noisy 
signals about which oases ahead are already occupied.  We then 
treat colonization as a game played out along a traveling wave of 
colonization, and consider how colonists choices change as they 
fall further behind.  

At the very leading edge, great growth at oases is matched by 
great death between them, and an incredible premium is placed on 
seed hardness.  As congestion increases behind the leading edge, 
colonists stay longer at oases, grow more slowly there, launch and 
deliver more slower-traveling seeds, land at a wider range of 
oasis types, and spend more to see which oases are occupied.  

There are limits, however, to how slow seeds fly, to how slow 
colonies grow, and to the fraction of good oases that get 
colonized.  And any colonists left behind after a seed launching 
try to leave as soon as possible.  Thus this model allows for lone 
oases like ours among large almost lifeless regions, though it 
also predicts large numbers of used-up oases and crashed seeds 
nearby.

Of course the US did this mostly out of self-interest but at least they did
something, which is more than can be said for the European governements. In
the role of butt-kicking policeman they are still needed to cleanup messes
like Bosnia that European politicians, to their great shame, allowed to
exist for several years on in their backyard.

At this point in History the US is the only nation in the world that
combines sufficient military power and the kind of centralisation required
to be able to react to a thing like Bosnia or the Gulf. Europe could of
course, technically speaking, but lacks organisation and guts (mostly the
latter).

This irritates the hell out of me.

You won't find religious fanatics blocking woman's clinics in europe, it is
only in the US that groups of people are allowed to try to violate such
individual rights.

Did you know that the US is one of the few 1st world countries in the world
were parkinson's disease is significantly lower among blacks and other
minority groups? Regrettably this is not because blacks in the US don't get
parkinson, it is because often they don't get treated and thus do not show
up in the statistics. Quite a feat for the most powerful mation in the
world today.

We have been over this before but maybe it did not register or something,
the above sentence is abosulute and total B.S. (tough but that's what it is).
European countries with the most extensive welfare systems like Germany and
the Netherlands are the strongest economies on the continent. And our
currency is a hell of a lot more stable than the US $.

Instead of believing that a welfaresystem necessarily leads to economic
collapse or something why don't you prove it? And don't just use France or
some former East-block nations as an example. The fact that a welfare
system is impossible to implement in the US without all kinds of bad
side-effects only tells us something about US-society. The _fact_ that
there are countries in this world that have the combination of a very
healty economy and a extensive welfare system shows that it is possible,
given competent leadership, organisation and a sense mutual responsibility.

There are more ways to Rome and we happen to like this one.

The point is that the US has been good at technical innovation and
containment of aggressors. But that does not mean that US policy makers
can't learn from other countries. US drug policy is still very stupid and
outdated and _many_ US citizens are suffering because of this. Instead of
just saying that America is doing so great maybe it would be smart to
listen to others and learn from their succes stories.

Well, that is one possibility. The scientific process does not say
anything special about how you come up with your hypothesises, you
could make them up using Tarot or automatic writing if you want, since
the important part is checking them with reality. I think Project Mind
advocates the use of kabbalah and meditation to get scientific
insights to be checked, for example. Different ways of inventing ideas
are most likely differently good at coming up with something useful
(you will have to spend a very long time permuting scrabble letters
before you end up with something interesting), so they can be compared
objectively.

But what I was after was something deeper. The various mental systems
aim for more things than knowledge. Some seek control over the mind or
body. Some seek improvements in our behavior. Many (most?) are
directed towards creating a feeling of meaningfulness and
connectedness with society/the universe/other good things. These are
obviously desirable goals, and I think they are well worth integrating
minus the junk into a transhuman lifestyle.

This may be a bad presumption.  I have seen many assume that mutation rate
is constant per base, but I have never seen a validation of that
assumption.  If mutagens are in any way significant in causing mutation,
mutation rate will not be constant per base, as the amount of most mutation
is not directly related to the number of base pairs. (eg. UV radiation)  I
would assume that for these mutagens, number of mutations has a greater
relation to the amount of mutagen than the number of base pairs.

Still, I'm not sure if I totally agree with junk DNA being a buffer... why
would you want to lower the rate of mutations?  Populations are genetically
stagnant enough already, and mutation is pretty low with or without
introns.  Also, why do frogs have many introns (even though they are mostly
protected from UV by water), while birds have very few (even though they
are flying through lots of radiation)?

 I am personally delighted to see so many responses to the list
from outside the U.S in the last 24 hours. While I don't
necessarily agree with everything that's being said, it is good,
and I would argue vital to get fresh input from a more global
perspective.

 I would like to recommend to everyone on the list a book I've just
started reading, "Gaviotas, a village to reinvent the world." by
Alan Weisman. It is about an intentional community created in the
eastern savannas of Columbia. It is newly published, I got an
advance readers copy from the folks at REALGOODS.

Heres an interesting quote:

 "When we import solutions from the United States or Europe we also 
  import their problems."   Paolo Lugari

Keep up the good work. Welcome all....

I would.  And a country is a component of a free world.  And a world
is a component of a free galaxy.  And a galaxy is a component of a
free universe.  Just because some guys shouting off about the size of
his super gun is no reason to think you're no longer free.

Maybe a FMC system wouldn't have a *central* bank, but it would have
several central systems for deciding currency.  And even if it is
smaller, and there are more of them, and you can choose which one you
want to use - it's still centralist.  And if each and every person
decides the value of his or her own currency - it's still centralist.

Slapping the word "private" on to something doesn't make it any less
centralist (that's what *they* would like you to believe :-), the
concept of the 'road' is a very centralist notion.  Planning in
general is centralist.

I'm not entirely sure what a 'boom' or 'bust' would look like in a
non-monetary system that had no specific goal (i.e. the systems goal
is a result of the goals of the individuals involved.)  Would progress
stop?  What is 'progress' anyway? The aim of a decentralised system is
that the whole system cannot crash unless every component crashes -
something that would be very hard to do.

I'm not too familiar with the history behind this, but I wonder whom
they were fixing it for.  When something goes "out of control" that's
generally another way of saying "makes life harder."  And when a
system gets a little chaotic (for better or worse) someone's their to
step in to control it (for better or worse.)

I haven't read it, but as I understand it, he used some kind of

Consumer/citizen/subject feedback is also 'many to few.'  Central does
not have to mean "control of many by the few" it can be any 'many to
few' relationship (i.e. control of few by the many.)  If you disagree
with this then you own paradigm collapses, as a government cannot
exist unless it responds to the demand of the people (even if that
response means tear gas.)  By your definition a government is "true
decentralisation" so the term "centralised" has no meaning.  You now
have two choices - stop using the term or change you definition of it.

Free-market capitalism is not true decentralisation.

Touche, and correctly so. However, we don't have legalized confiscation to the
same level as most european govts either, and most people here don't see such
confiscation as a social responsibility, more as a crime.

Actually, in asking my mother, who is a Quality Improvement Coordinator at a
hosipital here, she says that the reason it is lower in other minority groups is
that whites get the most health care, which causes them in old age to have the
most concurrent medical prescriptions. Conflicts between medications is the

access to health care that they would be less likely to have medication

Stability is fine, however totally sacrificing growth in pursuit of stability and

The proof is in the recent behavior of most of these countries, as well as
Canada. All of them have had in the last 5 years skyrocketing deficit
projections, which they responded to by cutting back on social services and
entitlements. The Canadian system has been cut back rather drastically, and at
least 30% of the urban hospitals in that country have been shut down or are in
the process of being shut down.

A few years ago, Sweden, which US liberals love to tout as 'the most civilized
country' or 'the most advanced country' with its total cradle to grave system
that paid twice as much to unemployed persons as they could make in the private
sector, went through a rather serious fiscal crisis. Perhaps Anders might know
more detail on this.

First off, I won't say that we are absolutely fabulous. Many of you here have
seen what I have had to say in the past on many domestic issues here. However, I
think that among major 1st world nations, and uniquely compared to previous
contenders for the term 'superpower' in the past, the US has done IMHO, the best
job of it so far. I also think that the US system has the most potential to
change in the sort of directions amenable to extropy/transhumanism. The US isn't
the be all and end all. That is agreed.

The biggest Scandinavian ship was, according to "Aspects of Maritime
Scandinavia" (1991) 155 tons in cargo size.  The biggest Venecian ships, of
the 14th to 15th century (end of MA, beginning Renaissance) was 200 to 300
tons in cargo size [1].

My memory was a bit wrong, the biggest ships that were allowed to enter the
harbour were 134 tons in size (not 150 as I stated). See my post on this:

Subject: Re: Evolution and stuff (was: Re: HTML: woes)

Cargo ships of more than 1200 net tonnage (the size of the Roman ISIS, of
which type at least 60 to 80 ships existed, because of the high wheat
requirements of the empire, however, it was probably much more) were only
built again in 1800 (!) in larger series [2].

Nelson's "Victory" had 3000 brutto register tons, the ISIS had 2900 BRT.

Conclusion: The biggest Scandinavian ships would barely have been allowed to
enter the Roman harbour, and the *biggest* late MA / early Renaissance
Venecian ships were still under the *average* Roman size.

Ah yes, there is great truth in the saying that "the people

Those chauvinistic rhetorics are flyin' again (red socialist eurobastards vs 
crazy fascist yanks etc.), but from a transhuman point of view it should
be so clear: _both_ systems suck, and pretty bad too. F**k them,
they're so far off the mark that they're not worth defending IMHO. Any
country where you can't do what you like as long as you don't hurt
anyone else is *unreasonably unfree*. By this simple definition we all live in 
pretty unfree countries, and the only reason why they still look reasonably 
"good" is because the rest of the world is even worse (hell on earth in some 
cases). Peace brothers... ;-)

And how does one parameter, the gross tonnage of the average vessel, apply to
naval technology? Not at all. For example: in WWII, the largest Japanese vessels
were the Yamato Class battleships, at around 75,000 tons, and a little known
large aircraft carrier program that was never finished that had a vessel size of
100,000 tons. THe most advanced US vessels were the Essex class carriers
(~50,000 tons) and the Missouri class battleships (~65,000 tons).  The Japanese
carrier was to carry over 150 aircraft, while the US Essex was to carry less
than 100. The Yamato battleship had 18 inch main guns, while the USS Missouri
had only 16 inch main guns, as well as half the total number of guns as the
Yamato. Yet the US vessels were technologically several years advanced ahead of
the Japanese vessels. They had radar and gun ballistics computers, for starters.

As for Roman vessels, the Isis class vessel, was, as I recall, mostly a
glorified self propelled grain barge. Hardly a feat of naval engineering, and
more a matter of economics than engineering. Its not surprising that such
vessels were not needed during the middle ages, as population was less, trade
was less, and what was left of Rome couldn't afford fine Libyan wheat (which was
the point of the Isis, to ship wheat from North Africa to feed Rome (the 'bread'
part of the 'bread and circuses')). I also would doubt highly that the Isis
could do more than 6-8 knots or survive more than 6-8 foot seas. The smaller
middle ages vessels were more seaworthy, built for the North Atlantic, not the
calm Mediterranean.

Twice as many base pairs means twice as many UV hits at a given flux.  There's
just not enough DNA, even in animals, to screen an appreciable amount of UV.

The idea you have would have two main requirements:

1) The exposure of the cell to the mutagen cannot depend on the amount of 
DNA in the cell.  Direct radiation is out, although free radicals from 
radiation would be OK.

2) The mutagen must be largely eliminated by mutating DNA. If the mutagen
is largely cleared by any other process, increasing DNA will just increase
the proportion "cleared" by affecting DNA.  Also, if the mutagen is 
not destroyed or inactivated by mutating DNA, then obviously extra DNA
doesn't help.

The only mutagen I know of that would meet qualification 2 is other DNA.
The idea that "junk" DNA provides a distraction for all those transposons
hopping around has been suggested, although I don't know where.

I would think lower wavelength EM radiation would be screened by the
massive clumps of DNA that exist in a eukaryotic cell, especially
non-coding sequences which(interestingly enough) tend to clump up to a very
high degree in a bundle of nucleotides and histones.  Maybe the low
wavelength I'm talking about it not very common (cosmic/gamma rays, maybe?)

Along with free radicals from metabolic processes, free radicals from the
environment, and other chemical mutagens.

Try most carcinogens.  Most carcinogens work by binding to areas of DNA
during cell division.  The replication process has to skip this part of the
DNA, causing a massive deletion.  Obviously, if such a mutagen is bound, it
will only mutate that particularly area, and no others.  Thus, it is
"cleared" in this sense.

hmmm... I think I may have something there, what do you think?

Also a good explanation.  A good way to test this hypothesis would be to
look for transposon binding/recombination sequences in junk DNA.

I wasn't trying to accuse anybody on this list of wanting to kill people,
and in fact Alejandro proved in a later post to be an intelligent reasonable
man, just wrong about socialism. The important point is not what some member
of the list thinks, but what governments think, all governments, no
exceptions; they will just not take no for an answer. If a government tells
somebody to do something they usually will and the violence is only implicit,
but if they refuse to obey the violence will become explicit, mild at first
but escalating without limit until they make an offer that can't be refused.
It makes no difference if it started over some trivial matter, unless there
is obedience somewhere down the line confrontation with the government can
end only one way, a bullet in the brain.

Some truth in that, rich and poor are relative concepts not absolute.
For example, in Stalin's day the USSR imported very few American movies 
but one they did was the classic "The Grapes Of Wrath", it's a tragedy 
about the suffering of a very poor farm family in Oklahoma who are forced by 
drought to give up their farm, load up everything they own on their old truck, 
and move to California. The Soviets thought it would be good propaganda to 
show a poor American family, but it didn't work as expected and was soon
withdrawn from Russian circulation. To American audiences the people in the  
movie seemed horribly poor, the Russian people on the other hand figured the 
characters must be aristocrats, these people actually owned their own truck.

Having said that however I still thing there are more enlightened approaches
to world poverty than the socialistic one, make everybody equally poor.
I think the Capitalistic method is more fun, create more wealth.

More and more companies are downsizing.

More and more people are working for themselves, and many are [or want
to] work out of their homes.

There are something like 80,000,000 users of the Internet today, and the

Net is a wild, crazy ever-changing, anarchistic baby that seems to be
living in the days of the Wild West!  There are no rules, because
technology keeps changing the playing field.

So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of the Net?

Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and

you are not a large company, just what can you do?

Email.

Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.
Wrong!!!

A landmark decision in the State of Washington recently determined that
bulk email advertising is absolutely legal and proper.  No state or
federal court has ruled otherwise.

So, by using responsible email, you can reach that huge market at a
fraction of the cost of traditional bulk mail.  Less than 1/10th of a
cent per address...

We will send 100,000 pieces of email for just $99 with up to one full
page of text.  The only other limitation is that it cannot be a chain
letter,
pornography or hate mail.

Drop us a line at dave_1005@hotmail.com, or fax 561-835-0690, or call
561-835-4077 and we will send complete details.

Thanks for your time.

[Note: Earlier parts of the debate -- including the "peme rules"
-- can be found at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>,
which will be periodically updated.]


Is "Society" a deep peme?
-------------------------

In writing my previous peme post, I vacillated between
calling "society" a near-surface peme and calling it a
moderately deep peme.

My experience is that most libertarians relatively easily
see the fraudulent ways in which "society" is used by
political "masters" against their "subjects."  For this
reason I should call it a near-surface peme.

However, I thought a few people might not see it so
easily, so I decided on "moderately deep peme."

It now seems that for some people it's a surface peme;
for some, near-surface; for some, moderately deep; for
some, deep; and maybe for a few, extremely deep.

A thought process that will help some to recognize and
clear pemes from their minds is to make a distinction
between the *word* and the *reality* (or non-reality)
the word is usually used to represent.  Next focus
on the word and all the ways it's habitually used
by political "masters."  Then consider the likely
consequences typically produced in the minds of most
"subjects" by such use of the word.

"When *I* use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone,
"it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."

"The question is," said Alice, "whether you *can* make words mean so
many different things."

"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "***which is to be master --
that's all***."  [***emphasis added]

-- Lewis Carroll, 'Through the Looking-Glass'

If the word in question does indeed represent some reality,
then it might be better to use some other word.  For example,
you could use "terrocrat" instead of "government official."
(Terrocrat = terrorist bureaucrat or coercive political agent.)
"The question is, which is to be master -- that's all."

A correspondent privately wrote to me that for certain
purposes it's necessary to look at a higher level than
that of individual.  For example, we can predict fairly
accurately that out of a million people x% will die from
cancer; whereas we can't predict with much accuracy how
a specific individual will die.

In clearing the "society" peme from your mind, nothing
prevents -- nor is there any suggestion stopping --
you from considering higher levels, such as "people
in general..."

It will help to make a distinction between the peme as a
*word* as separate from any *reality* (or non-reality) the
word is supposed to represent.

In a sense, when the *word* is viewed "as is" ("as it is"),
together with all the ways in which it is habitually used,
as well as the consequences produced by such use, then the
validity of the word is obliterated -- leaving the *reality*
(or non-reality), the word is supposed to represent, unchanged.

Check out what "L. Reichard White" <rick.rabbit@elmos.com>
suggested concerning the possible evolution of pemes through
trial and error at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>.
No "malicious conspiracy" has been suggested.

The Renaissance had been underway for quite a while in Venice by
the 15 century.

But do all subjects of a given government deserve the same?  That's
weird; they have nothing else in common (except perhaps language - in
very small island nations like Iceland).

Since people are different in every respect, I assume they "deserve"
different governments.  And even if a government happens to be better
than the majority deserve[*], there's still a minority who deserve
better still; why not pity them?

[* I agree with certain economists that the perverse incentives of
voting tend to give most of us worse than we deserve.]

Centralism, as I understand and use the term, means a regime where a
single decision in the name of the group - whether made by decree or by
universal vote - takes precedence over the decisions of individuals or
smaller groups.

Admittedly the term is not meaningful without a context, namely the
scale in question.  All voluntary actions of my body-parts are
controlled by a single entity, so I am "centralist" on a small scale
(bigger than I'd prefer, sigh).  Similarly all the actions of the firm
where I work (sixty-odd people) are coordinated by a few partners, so
the firm as seen from inside is centralist.  But outside, both I and the
firm interact with many others as peers; this web of activity has no
center.

On the other hand, Washington also helped bring on the massacres with a
one-sided arms embargo - one-sided because the Serbs were armed by the
Jugoslav government.  (I don't ask Washington to arm the victims, but I
do ask that it refrain from disarming them in my name.)

"an x/y coordinate system" implies a *continuum*, not a dichotomy.
Reducing the number of dimensions to two does not make it "dualism".

I don't think anyone here disagrees with your point that the true number
of political dimensions may be very large.  The territory represented by
my map of San Francisco has at least three dimensions (what are the
physicists saying these days, ten dimensions?), and yet two is still the
most convenient number.

Well, I know a few Australians who live in California by choice.
(Our government, of course, "protects" us from many others who would
make that choice.)

Robust because plurality elections produce a two-party system and thus
usually give one party a majority which it would not have in a more
representative system.  Thus the ruling party can weild sweeping power
without provoking constitutional crises; I'm not convinced that's
entirely a good thing. ;)

(I advocate proportional representation with a separately-elected
executive - and high standards for the use of power.)

Four words: Longest peacetime economic expansion.  I'm not a fan of his,
but what's your point?  Maybe it's self-evident to you, but I don't read
the same papers you read.

Has Tony Blair less power?

We are taught in elementary school that none of our three branches can
do much of anything without at least tacit consent of the other two (the
"checks and balances").  In practice, the "balances" have long since
gone out of whack and the "checks" function more the other way, to put
each branch in the pocket of the others - in particular, the judiciary
is the creature of the very people against whom it is supposed to
protect us.

(If I were at Philadelphia in 1787, I'd have argued against creating a
separate federal judiciary.)

Even an x-ray barrels through 4 gigabases of DNA like it's not there 99.999%
of the time.  The only wavelengths DNA picks up well are some of the UV,
and even there DNA absorption is negligeable compared to protein absorption.

Only relevant for a carcinogen that spends an inordinately large proportion
of its time bound to DNA.  For a carcinogen that preferentially binds to DNA
as opposed to other cell constituents, yes, junk DNA would shield.

>hmmm... I think I may have something there, what do you think?


I should think you could find a carcinogen with a strong preference for
binding to DNA.  That would indicate the junk has value in at least some 
situations.  To show that it's evolutionarily significant, you'd need
to show that a reasonably large proportion of evolutionarily significant
carcinogens had this property of preferentially binding DNA.  That would
be hard, because, AFAIK, there's no good grip on which carcinogens are
evolutionarily significant.

Not necessary.  Junk DNA doesn't have to attract things better than useful
DNA, just equally well.  In the case of transposons that's no problem.
However, junk DNA often does attract transposons as transposons often
need DNA repeats or inverted repeats to do their thing.  Repeats are
relatively uncommon in coding DNA.  Watch out for your causation, though;
a big reason for all those repeats in junk DNA is that transposons (
which have lots of repeats) blew their exits and got stuck.

Very true, but this does in no way excuse the behaviour of European
countries, especially since they supported this embargo wholeheartedly. The
combination of selective disarmament and non-intervention was very stupid.
While diplomats were negotiating in Geneva concentrationcamps were erected
not a thousand Km's away (deja-vu? - yes very much!). Same thing with
Saddam, everybody, and I mean everybody - US, Holland, Russia -, sold him
weapons during the eighties but when the shit hit the fan the US had to do
the heavy lifting.

OK, this is harldy Extropian so I'll shut up now and keep my frustrations
to myself ;-)

Apparently he doesn't. additionally: End of the Soviet Union, as credited by the KGB itself.

If I were in Philly, I would have created them separate, and with separate capitals. Putting all
the rats in one town to collude together is the problem. Possibly have them separately elected,
though I don't really have that much faith in elected judges.

"Democracy" is certainly an important peme used
extensively by politicians to increase their power.

Many people have strong emotions attached to their
deepest pemes, notably the "patriotic" ones.

You've started the process of clearing pemes from
your mind.  I hope you'll continue it.

In my own case, it was also after reading Spooner's
'No Treason' that I got going

You're right that more extreme measures are required.
For starters, you can clear the "constitution" peme
from your mind.  You need to attack the very *notion*
of a so-called "constitution."

Some 70+ "fleecing fathers" (James Hazel's term
-- see '#TL070: THE "CONSTITUTIONAL" DELUSION'
at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl070.htm>)
got together in secrecy and called themselves
"We The People..."  The entire proceedings were
a fraudulent hoax.  And what they produced -- the
pretended or falsely-called "constitution" was and
is no less a fraudulent document, a hoax, a sham.

How much power would terrocrats (coercive political
agents or terrorist bureaucrats) have in the absence
of the word/peme "constitution" or any equivalent?

The word/peme "constitution" is a lie in itself.
Read '#TL07: The Constitution of No Authority'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07.htm> and
'#TL070: THE "CONSTITUTIONAL" DELUSION'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl070.htm>.

What Lysander Spooner and others have essentially
indicated is that *the entire political system* is
a hoax, a fraud, a sham.  Spooner also indicated
that all the pretended "presidents," "ambassadors,"
etc. were then and are now liars and imposters --
"a secret band of robbers and murderers."

The hucksters call themselves "president," etc.
and the suckers believe them.

This is a profound observation.  In the tradition
of Stirner, Nietzsche, and Gurdjieff, the Complete
Egoist has developed the ability to *question
and challenge everything*.  The "clothes" of the
falsely-called "Emperor" are his pemes -- literally
(his "uniform") and figuratively (the words used
to dupe his "subjects" into thinking that he's
"special").  The egoist strips off the "clothes."]]

Maybe he *appears* different, primarily because of
the pemes in your head, the pemes in the heads of
the "masses," and the pemes in the heads of the
goons; and secondarily because of the guns they
carry.

In the absence of the pemes, how many guns could
he command?

They are commonly used very differently from job-
titles -- among other things to imply superiority
and inferiority: "master" and "subject."

If you're a member of the KKKK and you call another
member "Grand Dragon," you position yourself as
inferior to him: "subject" and "master."

If you call yourself "citizen" and you call someone
"president," then you position yourself as a "subject"
in relation to a "master."

Maybe many humans have a psychological need for an
"emperor" in the same way that lesser baboons need
an alpha-male to guide and protect them.  Maybe we
should call it the "Emperor Norton Syndrome" -- see

The problem with these discussions is that there is a major
philosophical split on this list between those of us who think it is
immoral for  the state to redistribute income by force and those who
think it is moral. You can trot out all the arguments in the book (and I
think I've heard them all) and you are not going to convince me to
support welfare statism any more than you are going to change my mind
about rape, murder and slavery.

We have all heard the libertarian and anti-libertarian arguments and
rehashing them really is a waste of time.

If better technology caused faster economic growth, optimism about new 
technologies suggests accelerating economic growth rates, perhaps even
becoming so fast as to constitute a "singularity."

The following analysis suggests, however, that if growth rates are limited
by the average return on investment (ROI), growth rates may be relatively
insensitive to technology, and hence long remain near historical levels. 

The basic argument is this: Interest rates are determined by the supply
and demand for investment resources.  The supply curve seems to be 
basically flat at historical rates of 1-3%, and for good evolutionary 
reasons.  The demand curve rises with technology, but since there are 
effectively no property rights in investment projects, all the demand
curve above the level where supply and demand meet is burned up in a race 
to be first.  So ROI should remain near historical rates until some new 
technology is so good that, even with most world income being saved 
and invested in related projects, the expected ROI for even the least
attractive projects becomes much higher than historical interest rates.

A more detailed argument is at: http://hanson.berkeley.edu/slowgrow.html

Just increasing the rate of repair is not enough.  These bacteria, and may
others, including some lower eukaryotes, have an enzyme photolyase which
splits UV-induced photodimers.  I don't know why the enzyme isn't present
in human skin... someone entrepreneurial out there should put photolyase in
sunscreen.

So are you in agreement with my previous statement?  "Universal vote"
is a good example of "control of few by the many" just as "market
direction" could be (vote with your money?).

But what about your firms interaction with individuals (i.e.
customers)?   Do you consider that a centralist relationship?  Your
customers control (vote by money) the company which takes precedence
over the decisions of individual customers or smaller groups of
customers.  Individual customers don't set their own prices, decide on
which products you make, etc.

Or better yet, a retrovirus engineered to insert a gene for making it
into the skin cells.  Although after a while, your market would be
limited to newborns...I suppose the guys who manufacture DPT vaccines
and such still make a decent living.

  Robin, I'm not sure I follow your argument. The "explosive growth" argument
is that certain technological improvements will increase the productivity of
technologists. even if the real investment rate in innovation is flat, the
rate of  technological improvement will increase because of the productivity
improvement. If technology increases the productivity of technological
innovators relative to other workers (unsupported assumption), then the ROI
for technical innovation will rise relative to other investments. This effect
would push innovation even faster, even with a flat perentage investment.

If productivity can improve very quickly even while the rate of return on 
investment (ROI) stays low, then my argument for low ROI does not imply slow 
growth in productivity.

8. ON QUANTUM THEORY WITHOUT OBSERVERS
One of the fundamental questions of physics is whether pure
states (i.e., states undisturbed by avoidable noise) are states
such that the outcome of every measurement can be exactly
predicted. Classical physics is based on the proposition that the
answer to the question is yes. Orthodox quantum mechanics is a
theory based on the proposition that the answer is no, and that
we can only make precise quantitative statements about probab-
ilities, the limitation due to an essential interaction between
the observer and that which is being measured.
.. ... S. Goldstein (Rutgers University New Brunswick, US), in
the first of a two-part review, discusses the idea of quantum
theory without observers, and suggests that despite the claims of
most of the originators of quantum theory, the appeal at a fund-
amental level to observers and measurement, which is so prominent
in orthodox quantum theory, is not needed to account for quantum
phenomena. Referring to the classical Bohr-Einstein debate,
Goldstein says the debate has already been resolved in favor of
Einstein. What Einstein desired and Bohr held impossible -- an
observer-free formulation of quantum mechanics in which the
process of measurement can be analyzed in terms of more fund-
amental concepts, does in fact exist, and there are many such
formulations, several of which have the potential to become a
serious program for the construction of a quantum theory without
observers. QY: Sheldon Goldstein, Rutgers University New
Brunswick 908-932-8789 (Physics Today March 1998)

I found this paper on the web at:

Just reading it now, but it does look interesting -

The Mongols (coming through Poland) reached central France; there are

It doesn't make any sense to speak about a time "before" the Big Bang.
The Big Bang marks the beginning of time as well as space.

Just as a thought, perhaps phobocrat would be a better term than
terrocrat.  When I first read that term, I had assumed that it was used in
reference to UN leaders or other self-proclaimed governors of the earth.
(That is, a terracrat.)  Phobocrat is somewhat clearer as the meaning of
the greek stem "phobos" is fairly well known to many english speakers.

I'd only need to do that if I wanted to make the network consistent and

It creates contradictory data and a huge amount of it. All that crap must be
examined with software tools, tools vulnerable to tampering.
                   

        >you can't hack in because it has nothing to hack into (it's open,

I remember, that's why It would be easy as pie to make the network useless.


        >You can't change history for the reasons above.  
           
You look in one part of the network and find ironclad evidence that I
committed a murder on Thursday, then you look in another part of the network
and find ironclad evidence that I did not commit a murder on Thursday.
Did I murder anybody on Thursday?
                   

        >You could try and destroy the data but it's completely distributed, 
           
Far from  trying to destroy the data I would make thousands or millions
of copies of it, all suitably mutated of course, and leave you the job of
determining the truth.


        >which makes things very hard to find.  
           
If it's hard for me to find stuff on the network it's hard for everybody,
so what's the point of the network?

        >the majority of people have more to gain from openess than from
        >privacy (i.e. losers.)
           
That's probably untrue and certainly irrelevant. The perfect world would be
one where everybody and everything was open, except for me.


        >There's are no network administrators, it's completely distributed
        >autonomous anarchy.


If it can do that then it's no longer an autonomous network, it's an
autonomous AI and all bets are off in predicting what it will decide to do
with a fifth wheel like the human race.
                   

        >But the data must be machine-readable.


I don't see your point, cryptographic data is almost always machine-readable.

Don't know, don't care.


        >What are you going to stop?


Stop the trust people have in the network by making it hopelessly unreliable.

Money and power, and because of that it won't be open for long.

>...identity is the *relation* between A and itself.

  IAN: A "relation between A and A" expresses
  a misunderstanding of both identity and relation.
  Relation occures between things that differ. The
  "relation between A and A" and null because the 
  difference between A and A is null.


>If "A" were the identity, then all things which are equal to themselves
>would be equal to each other. 

   IAN: So if identity is "same as" then I have 
   no identity, since I'm the same as nothing.
   If I have an identity because I am the same 
   as myself, then all my attributes of identity
   would exist minus the rest of the universe.
   I'd be 6 feet tall if "the foot" did not exist.
   I'd be an "Earthling" if the Earth did not 
   exist. In sum, your identity analysis is wrong
   and reflects a lack of careful analysis.

  IAN: That there is, a tangible world is a result 
  of the fact that identity is holistic. If atomism
  was somehow true, there would be no tangible world.
  Every thing is what it is only due to relations.
  So holistic identity gives you a tangible world.

  For me, a quest into the nature of truth seems much
  more interesting and important than faster cars and 
  better mouse traps. To me it seems that seeing such 
  things as the end-all measure of value is trivial
  and shallow, but that's what makes me a weirdo.

  IAN: That's exactly what I'm saying with
  respect to identity: there is no identity
  external to context. Everything that exists
  exists in context, and context is holistic.

  When we say what an elephant is (a member 
  of X family of animals that live in Y set
  of locations), we put it in context, yet 
  when we say what A is, "A=A," we remove 
  it from context. When I define identity 
  as "A is A relative to ~A,"  I put it 
  in context, as it exists in reality.

  Nobody has ever shown me an example of 
  a thing, A, being A free from relation,
  and yet all those who cannot show that
  such is true, continue to claim that 
  it is. That defines crackpotism.

  IAN: Your effort is to equate Hitler responding
  to Jews with deadly gas to suppliers responding
  to consumers with better washing machines. It's
  a shell game. The difference that your analysis
  obscures is that one set of responses are acts
  of aggression and the other are acts of service.

  The response by Hitler is an effort to suppress
  control by the many, the response of suppliers 
  to consumers accepts control by the many. Your
  trying to make "the different" "the same as."


>Free-market capitalism is not true decentralisation.

  IAN: Free-market capitalism is true decentralisation.

  IAN: The utility of "A=A" is to denote that "="
  means "same as." This is NOT an analysis of what
  identity is. The notion "=" is only meaningful
  to the extent that expressions on either side 
  of it appear DIFFERENT, such as "2+3 = 5."

  So once again, two things are meaningfully 
  related only to the degree that they DIFFER.
  "2+3" and "5" are different expressions of 
  the same thing. This tells us absolutely 
  nothing about what identity is.

  IAN: Identity is what a thing is; wether rock, 
  symbol, or idea, all things have an identity.
  Simply saying that A is the same as A tells 
  us nothing about what identity is.

  IAN: So (A=A) = (B=B), thus A=B.

This is not true. Can you provide references for this?

Are you saying a bundle of mongols -emigrated- to central France?
They certainly didn't invade.

The furthest the mongols made into europe was Vienna in the south
and poland in the north.  they never went anywhere near France.

Which is *also* poppycock.  If all of the players in a market
are exactly equal, what they are doing is not competition, 
but gambling.

And since the only way to out-compete someone (rather 
than force them) is to provide some combination of a 
better product and a better price, how is this a bad thing?

If this is the case, why is dumping outlawed?

There is short term benefit and long-term benefit....

Oh, that one's easy to answer...because our legislators
are idiots, and will listen to the whining of someone
being undercut (and who makes a nice contribution).
There is no legitimate reason to outlaw many business
practices that are now illegal: dumping, tying, insider
trading...it's just business.  But in a democracy--as
opposed to a free society--the losers can use state
guns to make up for their incompetence in the market.

We have all heard the libertarian and anti-libertarian arguments and
>rehashing them really is a waste of time.

I disagree.   While I have also heard these arguments many times before, this is
the first time I have seen them discussed in depth by extropians.  When I joined
this list I was already convinced of the tech/trans humanist side of
extropianism but from lurking and occasionally contributing I have found that
even some of my political views have changed because of the well thought out
arguments presented here.

Not that I had far to go anyway, I've got a pre-existing strong crypto-anarchist
tendency, but a good example is the issue of gun control.  Many would remember
that this featured for a while on this list.
I do not live in the USA, my country has only a small fraction of the crime and
violence, so I've always though that gun control is the best way of keeping our
country from following the USA down these roads.  As a result I have always
opposed wide scale  ownership of high-powered firearms.

I don't know if I'm a better extropian for it, but Michael Lorrey has convinced
me to buy a gun and stockpile other defensive measures.  I'm still against
widespread ownership of guns, but only for *everyone else*, not for *me*.

Bytes are cheap and easily recycled.  Let them chatter about welfare states a
bit more,  I've got some other long held beliefs that I think are in need of an
update.

They already have working prototypes with full color VGA resolution at

Given the recent list discussion involving Cuba some may be interested in
a current short article in Forbes magazine. Of course, Forbes calls itself
the Capitalist Tool and so, no doubt, some readers will feel that the
objectivity of the magazine is compromised by an activist agenda. In any
case, the chart depicting changing per capita GDP is interesting and if it
is accurate it is rather pathetic.

The cost of Castro 

By Peter Brimelow

begin excerpt

WHAT IS THE COST of Castro? Communist economies are notoriously tricky to
estimate, but it appears that Cuba's inflation-adjusted per capita income
has actually fallen since Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959. In dramatic
contrast, Florida, just 90 miles to the north, has boomedas have other
Sunbelt states like Texas and Arizona. Their revolution was
air-conditioning. And it worked. 

To estimate the cost of Castro, we assume that Cuba's current per capita
output should be about the same proportion of Florida's output as it was in
1959. This gives us a current figure ($4,169), more than three times higher
than Cuba's actual output ($1,300), modestly placed between that of Jamaica
($3,200) and of Mexico ($7,700). 

In fact, Cuba would probably have done considerably better than this. A
1956 U.S. Department of Commerce guide for businessmen flatly said that
"Cuba is not an underdeveloped country in the sense usually associated with
that term," citing its infrastructure, industrial development and large
middle class. Its living standards were reported to be among the highest in
Latin Americathen. 

A hint of what might have been: Even troubled Mexico's per capita GDP has
closed in on the U.S. quite considerably over the last four decadesfrom
less than an eighth in 1959 to about a third recently. Still, our modest
estimate suggests that the shortfall in Cuban GDP as a result of Castro was
a hefty $31.5 billion in 1995. 

In the language of takeover artists, Cuba is an underperforming asset. Not
all of this value could be realized immediately, of coursebut enough to
suggest it would be well worthwhile to offer Fidel a very golden handshake
(say $5 billion) to retire to Spain. 

Or maybe one of his middle managers may try an LROleveraged rubout?

The analysis doesn't have to take the 'act' into count, at no time
have we appended "with agression" to the definition of "centralised."

Many acts of "acceptance" and "supression" would be commited by either
a Nazi dictator or a supplier.  I'm sure the average CEO takes many
decisions that could be considered to "supress control of the many"
and I'm sure Hitler made many changes to his plans due to the will of
the people.

We should all strive to be in the centre.

Okay, so I've got 2 Million bits of data inherently linked to each
other, and a system that works by following links and comparing data. 
I'm afraid your new data wouldn't stand much of a chance if it weren't
correctly linked.  It'd either never be discovered in the first place
or be ignored because it was orphaned from all the other data.

Contradictory!  Bits of data that say you just created these bits of
data.  Even if you changed the name of the person who created them,
who cares? They're not properly linked, can't be found by software
agents, and have no effect on the network.

Actually, open systems make it near impossible to do anything that is
damaging.  As soon as you stop trying to keep people out you have to
look at the situation from an entirely different perspective.  If
anyone can get into the system, then you don't want to let anyone do
damage.  This calls for low-level security - building a system where
you *can't* do those things (not that doesn't let you.)

Finding *that* piece of data you want to destroy is hard, the data is
entangled in many different locations and many other pieces of data.

Admin-less networks are being created now, and they don't use any AI. 
They just don't have administrators.

You want weapons?  The plans are on the network, and the location of

So you're waving your wads of encrypted dollar bills with your face

This could turn out to be a great suggestion!
"Phobocrat" has the advantage that we don't have
to explain it.  It has a pleasant ring to it too!
Please send me your feedback.  Do you think
"phobocrat" has the potential to catch on and
become a powerful meme?  

In any case, I suggest we add "phobocrat" to the
Freespeak lexicon and start using it.  We can use
both "terrocrat" and "phobocrat" and see which
becomes the more powerful meme.

"it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."

Consider a world in which people routinely use

sticks always win; those with the small sticks
always lose.  How would you like to have a big
stick?

Now consider a world in which people routinely
use words as weapons to hurt others.  Certain
bullies have powerful words that put their victims
in a weak position and make it easy for the bullies
to run all over the victims.

Have you ever heard of a phobocrat "judge"

victim getting hurt as a result?

Some freedom lovers say that "freedom is indivisible,"
meaning that for any one of us to be free, everyone has
to be free.  The logical extreme is that if there's just
one unfree person on earth, then everyone else is also
unfree.  Suppose everyone were free.  If I then locked
up just one person, suddently everyone else on earth
would be unfree.

But, what if I'm really free and sovereign *by nature,*
irrespective of the freedom and sovereignty of others?

What if I can discover that I'm free and sovereign by
nature -- and then, develop my knowledge, wits, and
resources to the point that, for most practical purposes,
I can live as a free sovereign -- irrespective of the
"unfree" masses around me (who haven't yet discovered
they're free and sovereign)?

A consequence of being subjected to the "freedom is
indivisible" peme can be that I waste much of my life
and resources trying to "change the system" -- see
Harry Browne's 'How I Found Freedom,' available from
<http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html>.
See also <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm>.

On the other hand, individuals are different and
unique and live in different circumstances.  For some,
the most appropriate things to do are "educating others,"
"changing the system," etc.  Division of labor.  For
many of these people, it may be appropriate to operate
according to the "freedom is indivisible" peme.  As
free as am, I certainly would enjoy even more freedom
at less risk, were it not for "the political system."

But for those of us for whom it's more appropriate to
free ourselves, would the "freedom is indivisible" peme
be an example of using our own words to hurt ourselves?

Could it be that if enough of us were to sufficiently
free ourselves so we become, for practical purposes,
"uncoerceable" by the phobocrats, their bogus
"politcal systems" would be widely seen for what
they are and will collapse?


The "Construction of Systematic Thought"

According to Robert Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance': "But to tear down a factory
or to revolt against a government or to avoid repairs
of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack
effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack
is upon effects only, no change is possible.  The true
system, the real system, is our present *construction
of systematic thought* itself, *rationality* itself.
And if a factory is torn down but the rationality which
produced it is left standing, then that rationality will
simply produce another factory.  If a revolution destroys
a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of
thought that produced that government are left intact,
then those patterns will repeat themselves in the
succeeding government..."  [emphasis added]

What if the basic "construction of systematic thought,"
the basic "rationality," consists of deep pemes?  If
so, then in order to induce people to change the most
fundamental beliefs that really count, might it not be
necessary that we persuade them to dump some of their
deep pemes?

It's unlikely that any significant number of people
in the former "Soviet Union" (so-called) dumped any
of their deep pemes.  So, with minor differences,
they just recreated their "political systems" as
suggested by Robert Pirsig.

What do you think of the "Phobocrat Series?"  We probably

There have been several recent references on the E-list to David Brin's
utopian call for the end of privacy through social engineering a
"Transparent Society."  Such an idea works very well within a common moral
consensual polity, indeed the idea is ancient.  It is at base a renaming of
"Holy Watchfulness" as practiced in monasteries around the world and in
early Puritan villages in colonial America.  It is a monkish ideal.

There are no visible surface problems with it in this monkish context, the
benefits within the polity are substantial.  However, there are serious,
even intractable problems with it when it is proposed to be extended across
polities that have conflicting ideals and worldviews at their core.  In
particular, you cannot extend "Holy Watchfulness" across the boundary
between extropic and entropic worldviews, i.e., between the culture of life
and the culture of death.

John Stuart Mills wrote in "On Liberty" (1859): "Society can and does issue
its own mandates:  and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any
mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a
social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression,
since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer
means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and
enslaving the soul itself."

The Transparent Society certainly penetrates deeply into "the details of
life," and can easily be seen as a "social tyranny" worse than "political
oppression."  When democratic society imposes the wrong mandates of the
culture of death (taxpayer-supported murder of unborn children and the sick
and elderly) on those who are opposed to it, how does it escape "enslaving
the soul" by coercively making us party to such brutality?  If your
neighbors want to strengthen the culture of death, then they must be
stopped by political action, action which must begin with secret plotting. 
With transparency, you wouldn't be able to meet and plot about political
agendas in any sphere of institutional life, your enemies would see your
opening moves in advance, a recipe for tyranny.  The advantage goes to
those who see the formulation of the first move prior to implementation,
not to those who see the responses.

As I have written in "Extropy", "irreducible first-person subjectivity,
with its private inner life and moral autonomy, is central to the concept
of an individual."  The fundamental mechanism in nature is to close off the
flow of information outward.  We must reach out on our *own* terms.  The
Transparent Society would have us surrender this private subjectivity to
complete visibility and the potential scientifically-sanctioned
manipulation of our conceptual environment.

Not only must we have control of what information flows outward, but
growing up and maturing is learning to select which patterns our attention
should be focused on by progressively blocking out more and more of our
environment.  The Transparent Society sends us back to infancy, a cacophony
of environmental input.  As you mature, you want your door locked, you want
isolation, you want time and space to formulate and test unique thoughts,
then control of which thoughts are released into the open.  The Transparent
Society is immature.  It appears as though it could develop into something
akin to the unreflective oral society, all surface and immediacy, the
stagnant 'soaking up existence' of primitivism, not deep and long-term
thought characteristic of the literate, ascending society.  Private thought
itself, i.e., the idea of thinking privately, as opposed to rhetorical
discourse in the public square, developed in monasteries *protected* from
being transparent to the outside world as they preserved literate culture,
and in private libraries after Gutenberg's invention.  It is difficult to
see how private thought, which leads to cultural diversity, is fostered
when we're never alone and never protected from our enemies within the
culture of death.

The Transparent Society can only foster a monoculture as it spreads across
the world.  Isaiah Berlin, in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" (1990),
writes of the intractable conflict between one world universalism of
rational tolerance, and the promotion of true individual liberty, true
freedom which can only arise from within a "culture" or moral consensual
polity:

"If free creation, spontaneous development along one's own native lines,
not inhibited or suppressed by the dogmatic pronouncements of an lite of
self-appointed arbiters, insensitive to history, is to be accorded supreme
value; if authenticity and variety are not to be sacrificed to authority,
organization, centralization, which inexorably tend to uniformity and the
destruction of what men hold dearest - their language, their institutions,
their habits, their form of life, all that has made them what they are -
then the establishment of one world, organized on universally accepted
rational principles - the ideal society - is not acceptable."

This one world ideal is opposed by the formulation of freedom by Johann
Gottfried Herder: "'the will to live one's own regional, local life, to
develop one's own eigentmlich values, to sing one's own songs, to be
governed by one's own laws in one's own home, not to be assimilated to a
form of life that belongs to all and therefore to no one.'  Freedom, Hegel
once observed, is bey sich selbst seyn - to be at home, not to be impinged
upon by what is not one's own, by alien obstacles to self-realization
whether on the part of individuals or civilizations."

This formulation of freedom within a consensual moral polity would work
wonderfully in the Transparent Society, but not at all *between* different
polities.  This difficulty is insoluble short of establishing a worldwide
monoculture.  The culture of life is inherently polycentric, the culture of
death is the default monoculture.

Samuel Huntington in "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World
Order" (1996) has written: "At the end of the twentieth century the concept
of a universal civilization helps justify Western cultural dominance of
other societies and the need for those societies to ape Western practices
and institutions.  The non-Wests see as Western what the West sees as
universal.  What Westerners herald as benign global integration, such as
the proliferation of worldwide media, non-Westerners denounce as nefarious
Western imperialism.  To the extent that non-Westerners see the world as
one, they see it as a threat.  In 1913  international trade was at record
highs and in the next few years nations slaughtered each other in
unprecedented numbers.  If international commerce at that level could not
prevent war, when can it?  The evidence simply does not support the
liberal, internationalist assumption that commerce promotes peace....  In
Muslim eyes Western secularism, irreligiosity, and hence immorality are
worse evils than the Western Christianity that produced them.  Why
Americans believe that conflict is good within their own society and yet
bad between societies is a fascinating question which, to the best of my
knowledge, no one has seriously studied."

Non-Western civilizations do not want to be transparent to the West in any
way, shape or form.  Criticism of sacred Islamic or Hindu texts which give
meaning and direction to life is destructive.  Those cultures properly
recognize it as such and resist it strenuously.  Efforts to persuade them
to open themselves to the Transparent Society will result in world
conflict.

The argument for extending "Holy Watchfulness" across disparate moral
polities is actually no argument at all, but rather a simple displacement
of whatever used to be on the altar, in favor of  "criticism" which will
lead us all to the mystical end of "accountability."

Why should accountability be the end of this utopian social engineering? 
Barbara Tuchman in "The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam" wrote:
"Persistence in error is the problem.  Practitioners of government continue
down the wrong road as if in thrall to some Merlin with magic power to
direct their steps.  Yet to recognize error, to cut losses, to alter
course, is the most repugnant option in government."  Her answer to this
fact of history was not the end of the Transparent Society, accountability,
rather the moral society:  "Aware of the controlling power of ambition,
corruption and emotion, it may be that in the search for wiser government
we should look for the test of character first.  And the test should be
moral courage."  The moral society is, in fact, the only possible answer,
for where does the will to hold accountable come from?

The moral society must aim at peace, not accountability, if it is to secure
liberty.  Santayana wrote in "Dominations and Powers" (1951): "Liberty
requires peace.  War would impose the most terrible slavery, and you would
never be free if you were always compelled to fight for your freedom.  This
circumstance is ominous:  by it the whole sky of liberty is at once clouded
over.  We are drawn away violently from irresponsible play to a painful
study of facts and to the endless labor of coping with probable enemies."

So peace is the fundamental ingredient on which liberty thrives, not
accountability.  And how will the Transparent Society protect us from our
very real and menacing external probable enemies, when they can peer into
our private lives with unbelievable levels of detail?  This is a gaping
hole in utopia, that international agreements, global trade and creeping
world governance will do nothing to help.  Accountability never is a
permanent guarantee of minority rights nor is it a protection against
"frog-in-a-pot" style tyranny.  Individual freedom, that is, guaranteed
minority rights and protection from tyranny, depends on the right to secede
from polities gone bad, that have sunk into the culture of death.

The end of the Transparent Society is bogus and so is the means to that
end, criticism to reduce error.  Criticism erodes the will, lowers risk
taking, leads to conformity.  Criticism to reduce error is a small subset
compared to criticism to change direction, to break down cultural
worldviews.  Certainty of direction in a leader is infectious to the whole
society, it overrides the utility of criticism.  The critical society is
not vital absent certainty of leadership.  Also, the passion of abolition,
which is never absent amongst a large enough population, is criticism for
destruction's sake.  Criticism blunts intimacy and trust.  Self-selected
criticism is all the rage, shallow credentialism begets smugness begets a
high-walled ego.  People who think they can take criticism generally are
ignoring it, the will is sapped if it reaches the heart.  It's not
blunders, but direction that counts.  It's the difference between
efficiency and effectiveness.  Criticism doesn't breed affection, it
destroys friendship.  From an evolutionarily adaptive standpoint, asking
for criticism is simply finding out who your friends are.  Scientific
criticism these days has devolved to swiping dwindling grant money and
fleeting fame from each other.

There is another fatal flaw in the ability to make a transition to the
Transparent Society.  The flaw involves the idea that the masters of the
world will altruistically roll over and play dead for the benefit of the
masses.

James Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg offer this master-rich
scenario in "The Sovereign Individual" (1997):  "The good news about
individual liberation and autonomy will seem to be bad news to many who are
not among the cognitive elite....  Many of the assurances of equality that
Western people have grown to take for granted in the twentieth century are
destined to die with it....  Markets always place the greatest pressures on
the weakest holders.  Indeed, that is part of their virtue.  They promote
efficiency by removing assets from weak hands....  Increasing amounts of
wealth will find their way into the hands of the ablest entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists worldwide.  Globalization, along with other
characteristics of the information economy, will tend to increase the
income earned by the most talented individuals in each field.  The
Sovereign Individuals of the information economy will not be warlords but
masters of specialized skills, including entrepreneurship and investment. 
Yet the feudal hundred-to-one ratio [of peasants to knights] seems set to
return....  Business relations will gravitate toward reliance upon 'circles
of trust.'  Due to encryption, which gives individuals an ability to steal
undetected, honesty will be a more highly valued characteristic of business
associates."

"Protection will become increasingly technological rather than juridical. 
The lower classes will be walled out.  The move to gated communities is all
but inevitable.  Walling out troublemakers is an effective as well as
traditional way of minimizing criminal violence in times of weak central
authority....  New survival strategies for persons of lower intelligence
will evolve, involving greater concentration on development of leisure
skills, sports abilities, and crime, as well as service to the growing
numbers of Sovereign Individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions
rises....  We expect increasing numbers of low-income persons in Western
countries who previously would have depended upon transfer payments from
the state to affiliate with wealthy households as retainers....  In the
next century we shall witness the creation of a world superclass, perhaps
of 500 million very rich people, with 100 million being rich enough to
emerge as Sovereign Individuals [out of 7 billion - 70 to 1 ratio of
servants to masters]."

Such a scenario, based almost entirely on the acknowledged need for strong
encryption of financial transactions, makes one question the possible
acquiescence of the master-rich to the proposed Transparent Society, which
would allow their servant-poor to observe them in total detail.  Such a
prospect seems ludicrous on the face of it.

Thomas Aquinas wrote: "For those among them who excel by their intellect
naturally dominate the others; as to those who do not shine by their
intellect, but whose body is robust, they seem to be destined by nature to
servitude."  This is an eternal verity, and cannot be changed by the
Transparent Society or any form of organization whatsoever.  In our
technologically oriented society, the highest intellects able to manipulate
matter to whatever ends they desire will dominate all, no matter what.  It
is foolish, self-delusional and dangerously destructive to presume
otherwise.  The utopian nature of the Transparent Society is clearly on
display here.

Lastly, the greatest flaw in any lasting achievements the Transparent
Society might produce if it were possible to be successfully installed
worldwide, has to do with human nature, with the destructiveness of
self-love.  The flaw is not a visible surface flaw but a deep flaw, not
easily seen.

In "The New Criterion" June 1996, an article by Joseph Epstein about La
Rochefoucauld takes the position that only a true gentleman can live in the
Transparent Society.  "This tre vrai, or true being or genuine person, is
someone who attains as much lucidity about his own motives and those of
people he deals with as possible - no easy achievement when everything in
society encourages the perpetuation of falsehoods, the exchange of lies,
and the proliferation of illusions.  L'tre vrai combines in La
Rochefoucauld with l'honnte homme, the true gentlemen, who lives without
pretension.  Such a man has no need of pretension.  'It is a sign of true
goodness to be willing to live always in the sight of good' - just as 'the
truly honest man is without conceit' and 'lives in public as he does in
private.'"

But, and this is crucial to the success of the Transparent Society, "Still,
make no mistake, to live with such lucidity and in such harmony is all but
impossible.  What with the maelstrom of self-love and self-interest in
which we live, the added force of the passions that addle our minds, the
banging about that the winds of fortune subject us to... nothing is more
difficult, in La Rochefoucauld's view, than correct judgment."

This self-love, or amour-propre, which torpedoes correct judgment, is the
Transparent Society's greatest difficulty, even given a common moral
polity.

"'Amour-propre,' as La Rochefoucauld notes, is like 'the eye that can see
everything but itself.'  In the first of his supplementary maxims, La
Rochefoucauld describes it, in part, thus:  'Amour-propre  is the love of
oneself and of all other things for one's own sake; it makes men idolize
themselves and would cause them to tyrannize over their neighbors had they
the opportunity....  Nothing equals the impetuosity of its desires, the
depths of its schemes, or the ingenuity of its methods....  It is
impossible to fathom the depths or pierce the gloom the abyss in which it
dwells....  There it conceives, breeds, and rears, unknowingly, a vast
number of appetites and dislikes - some of so monstrous a shape that it
fails to recognize them when exposed to the light of day, or cannot bring
itself to own them.  Out of the night that covers it are born the absurd
ideas it entertains of itself; thence come its errors, its ignorance, its
clumsiness, and its fatuous beliefs about itself - its notion that its
feelings are dead when they are but asleep, that it has lost its activity
when once it is at rest, and that it has got rid of the appetites it has
for the moment appeased.'  To be human is to have amour-propre; to have
amour-propre is to be imprisoned by it; yet to understand that one is in
fact imprisoned does not ever quite set one free."

Even in the Transparent Society, as on the E-list, we will fail to see our
monstrous appetites and desires, or fail to own them.  Our Puritan villages
and monasteries with their "Holy Watchfulness" will break up and give way
to privacy once again.  It is human nature that individuals do not bear
scrutiny.  The Transparent Society, like all utopias, is an immature revolt
against nature.

Yes, I for example, was slightly anti-abortion when I came to the transhuman list 3
years ago. However, the libertarian discussions here and there, especially in the
defining the differences between the concepts of rights by natural law and rights by
force, I came to realize the erroneous basis for my beleif at the time.
While many long time subscribers to this list may tire of discussing subjects that
have been rehashed several, sometimes many, times before on the list, remember that
we are not a static body. Not only do new subscribers come to the list all the time,
but as new information is discovered by science, we can sometimes change or modify
our most cherished ideas and beleifs. Many new subscribers come to the list full of
memes supporting many statist and anti-tech, anti-freedom positions, and we are not
helping them increase extropy in their lives if what they hear is a huge stream of
"been there, done that already, bored to death" from people on a topic that may be
entirely fresh to them, or on a topic for which the typical extropic position is
completely new to them.

Viewing the list as a personal clique is not very extropic. Viewing the list as a
cooperative school of extropy is extropic.

Wow. You mean somebody actually listens to what I say?

Here in the Lorrey household, the family gun population went up by 5 just this
month.

For anybody in the New England area that is into or would like to try their hand at
Skeet, my club up here in NH is running skeet, open to the public every Sunday,
10-3, until the regular season starts, and more shooting days will then be
available.

Good attitude.

Essentially, any anarchist of any flavor who beleives that all political power comes
from the individual (and if you don't, I think you may have your definition messed
up), must beleive that there is no system or contract in the world that any one
individual is obligated to without recourse. This includes the 'social contract'
concept. The individual, from whome all power flows, should be able to critically
examine every possible obligation and choose yea or nay on it. No individual should
be compelled by external force to surrender any power involuntarily. This is the
essential problem with democracy.

Rule of the majority is as much a tyranny to the dissenting individual  as the
harshest dictatorship. This is why so few democracies in history have remained in a
stable balance between dictatorship and communist tyranny for very long, and why
individual rights tend to erode over time in such democracies. The majority of the
moment will always find somebody elses rights that need to be infringed upon for the
'common good', the 'general welfare', or for any greater measure of security.
Eventually, nobody is free any longer, except government is free to do what it
wills, as it then becomes omnipotent.

The solution is hyperdemocracy and total voluntary association. The internet is an
excellent example of these two practices.

For those of you who may not know what hyperdemocracy is, it is essentially
different from standard democracy in that while democracy is 'one man, one vote',
hyperdemocracy is 'one man, one veto'. It is a consensual system, where unless all
agree, then nothing can be done as a whole. Only those who agree can form action for
their own interests. Those who don't are not obligated, and cannot become obligated
or violated by the decisions of those that do.

There have been small hyperdemocratic proposals here in the US. There have been
proposals for the tax system where an individual can declare in their income tax
what programs they want to fund with their taxes, and those they don't want funded
(of course, they have avoided the idea that one should be able to decide how MUCH to
fund). These are good first steps, and should be encouraged.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm interested in growth of the corpus of technical
knowledge and its rate of increase. Your argument appears to apply to growth
of the measured economic value of the technology, and may be very valid.
Leading edge technical products los value very quickly. This is also true of a lot
of leading edge intellectual property. This may mean that your slow (economic)
growth and my explosive (technical) growth occuring concurrently.

I'm sure you are aware of the recent reports of a fear of deflation, and I'm sure
you understand them better than I. However, technical areas the technological
deflation is far greater than the economic deflation. As I understand it, one major

reason tht deflation is "bad" is that consumers will defer pruchases to wait for
the
price to come down, but for PCS and other hi-tech items, the price is coming down
anyway and always has been.

Yes, as factors like Moore's Law constrict over time, and the present 18 month doubling
rate for digital power becomes shorter, patents on technology for the present cutting
edge are really worthless, since the typical patent takes at least two years to get
awarded. By that time, the technology is already worth less than half what it was worth
when the patent was issued.

How can this be fixed? Other than scrapping the patent system altogether (Mr Crocker
jumps up and down in joy), technology developers will either need to practice much more
secrecy, or establish a much faster patent approval system. Create a huge common
database, and create a Certification for any competent engineer to become a Certified
Patent Examiner, where the Examiner is an independent person that will process and
examine patent applications for a flat fee. The examiner would get paid whether or not
the applicant has legitimate patent claims, much like how architects, mining engineers,
civil engineers are always paid, whether or not the prospect works out for the
developer, so there would be little incentive for unethical behavior.

Yes, the reason for this is that with the shortening of the depreciation turnover
period, peoples internal discount rates are going up. Since earning power is becoming
more and more related to the competitors present state of technological
competetiveness, making investments in technology now is seen as having a greater NPV
than holding off 6-12 months. There are some areas, though, where that doesn't seem to
matter. In the company I'm currently working with, they do large volumes of mailstream
processing, on an IMB mainframe that is over 20 years old. We are slowly moving some
processing over to a dual Pentium NT server, but there is currently a lack of interest
in further automation, as further automation will mean cutting back on jobs here (and
the boys in charge don't like the idea of becomeing a mom and pop shop. They are
Dartmouth guys, after all). As it is, we offer the lowest cost data conversion and
processing services around, so there really isn't any point in fixing what doesn't seem
to be broke.

The following is from
<http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie/meme.htm#faq>:

"Memes are the basic building blocks of our
minds and culture, in the same way that genes
are the basic building blocks of biological life."

"The breakthrough in memetics is in extending
Darwinian evolution to culture. There are several
exciting conclusions from doing that, one of which
is the ability to predict that ideas will spread
not because they are "good ideas," but because they
contain "good memes" such as danger, food and sex
that push our evolutionary buttons and force us to
pay attention to them."

We are probably born with many memes relating to
survival and propagation.

Surface pemes like "I must obey the 'authorities'"
are relatively weak, relatively easy to spot, and
relatively easy to invalidate and dislodge.  The
"man in the street" clings to surface pemes.  Most
Egoists, Libertarians, Extropians, Objectivists,
Anarchists, etc. have little difficulty dislodging
surcace pemes.

Deep pemes are vastly more powerful.  For most
people, they are vastly more difficult to spot,
invalidate, and dislodge -- virtually impossible.
For most Egoists, Libertarians, Extropians,
Objectivists, Anarchists, etc., deep pemes are
extremely difficult to spot, invalidate, and
dislodge.  From the time that I identified my first
deep peme in 1977, it took seven years to clear out
all the deep pemes I've found so far.  I haven't
found any new ones since 1984.  For an example of
someone who almost instantly cleared out all his deep
pemes, see <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm>.

No!  Most people, including practically all Egoists,
Libertarians, Extropians, Objectivists, Anarchists,
etc., will run a mile if you confront them with any
one deep peme.

They need to be presented very carefully, one at a
time.  Remember the Peme Rules:

"9. Under no circumstances shall any human be
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep
pemes.

10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves
into believing that they've cleared all pemes
from their brains and that they're "politically
enlightened."

11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep
pemes from their brains shall experience a
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"

12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans."

A good analogy!  In my opinion, deep pemes are
vastly more powerful in apparently "controlling"
people than "threats of force, violence, and
ultimately, pain."

In a way, most people, much of the time,
unknowingly "control" themselves through their
deep pemes in ways harmful to themselves and

pemes -- they shall make a special effort to

The above reflects how a libertrian might go about
helping "the man in the street" clear out some
surface pemes.  No deep pemes are addressed above.
Actually, deep pemes "hide in plain sight," but
most are blind to them and the consequences of
using them.

I'm still waiting for a response from Yak Wax
<yakwax@yahoo.com>.  It's, off course, possible
that he's a deep anarchist and that this entire
debate is for him such a bore that it's not worth
spending any more time on.  (A deep anarchist has
cleared out all or most of his or her deep pemes
and is not subject to the Peme Rules.)

If the "typical" Egoist, Libertarian, Extropian,
Objectivist, Anarchist, etc. is asked to make a
list of items that satisfies the above, he or
she will probably come up with a number of surface
pemes, but not one single deep peme.

A deep anarchist needs a special process for
helping someone shed his or her deep pemes.
There's a little obstacle to overcome: Peme
Rule 9: "Under no circumstances shall any human
be allowed to question, attack, or expose any
deep pemes."

Around 1981 I had dinner with a close "near-libertarian"
friend in the Atomium restaurant in Brussels.  I tried
an experiment.  Every time he used a deep peme, I
relentlessly challenged it: "What do you mean by
[deep peme]?"; "What are you talking about when you
say [deep peme]?"  After about 20 minutes he became
quite ill, had to go to the bathroom, and puked his
guts out.  He returned to the table after about five
minutes, but couldn't continue his gourmet meal.
Our friendship ceased that night and I haven't seen
him since.

Deep pemes need to be carefully and gingerly presented
one at a time.

The answer to 'why is [x] outlawed', is always,
"because it was to a politician's benefit to
propose such a law'.  There are two cases,
public land, and private land, and in the case
of the latter, such is tresspassing, not 'illegal
dumping' (or should be, rather).  In the case of
the former, the economic reason for both the
desire of people to dump trash there and the
desire for the law is that the land is not owned
by a private party.  Were this the case, no such
laws would be required. :)

>There is short term benefit and long-term benefit....

But both will be reflected in a free market price
for nearly anything.

Oh, nothing so simple.  The autopsy report says he died Thursday.  
Another copy of the same autopsy report says he died Wednesday.  His 
body was found either Tuesday or Friday.  There's a video clip of him 
at the local convenience store Saturday.  Another of you shooting him 
on Monday -- when it can be proven (eyewitnesses, not just 
surveillance) that you were in another state.  And another of the 
local head prosecutor shooting him on Wednesday (when it can be 
proven via eyewitness testimony that *he* was in another state).  And 
ample evidence that both the prosecutor's secretary and his chief 
political opponent's secretary were tampering with the surveillance 
records, even though neither has the technical expertise to do so.

Watch for a study by Stephen G. Bronars (University of Texas, 
economics) and John R. Lott (University of Chicago, law) that should 
be coming out soon.  Quite a few US states have in the past decade 
passed laws saying that anyone who meets certain objective criteria 
is entitled to a concealed-carry permit -- which lets them actually 
carry a gun on their person, concealed, in most circumstances (the 
big exceptions being court facilities and places with liquor 
licenses, in most states.

They examine crime data in these states as compared to states that 
have no such laws in effect, factoring national trends and 
demographic issues.  Their conclusion is that ready availability of 
concealed-carry permits causes substantial DECREASES in the rates of 
most crimes (pretty much everything except larceny).  I don't claim 
to have all the details, but one number cited in this article is a 
20.4% decrease in murder.

At the same time, they conclude that a state NEXT TO a state with one 
of these laws, if it doesn't have or pass a similar law of its own, 
will experience an UPSWING in crime; the comparable number is a 9.4% 
increase in murder.

Hm... 20.4% decrease here versus a 9.4% increase there... looks like 
a win to me.  Of course, if the "there" state decides to let people 
be prepared to defend themselves, that would be even better.

As someone who has actually read Brin's manuscript, let me summarize the
thesis of the Transparent Society.  (1) Exhortations to be good have been tried
for thousands of years by all major and most minor religions, and have had
rather limited success in changing human nature.  (2) Mutual accountability,
openness, and criticism have given us the low corruption of liberal
democracies (30 years ago we had a Watergate; today we worry about the Vice
President making fundraising calls from his office), relative safety from
crime and terrorism, and scientific progress.  (3) Snooping technology will
outstrip secrecy technology; encryption is no good if I can watch your
keyboard, or read your computer.  And a world of secrecy, if that secrecy is
not ironclad, is less stable than a networked society where everyone watches
each other.  A transparent society is coming, the big decision is (4) whether
we try passing privacy laws which the rich, the gov't, and criminals will
ignore or bypass or whether we try to make everyone open.

Also: criticism is the great antidote to error, but it is also one of the
things people hate to get.  The danger of leaders is that they need it more
than anyone, but can do the most to suppress it.  The fact that Western
societies are nice places to live has a lot to do with our having forced our
leaders to swallow more and more criticism.  And this has nothing to do with
altruism.  John says the ideal world is one where everyone else is obedient
and open.  Right; everyone feels that way, which is where transparency comes
from: everyone picking at everyone else.  Mutual Assured Surveillance.

And Brin would be happy if the masses could somehow retain privacy while
subjecting the powerful to scrutiny; he just doesn't believe it.  And between
general secrecy and general openness he thinks the evidence shows that open
societies are ones people would prefer to live in.

Thus Brin; now on to criticize.

No, the fundamental mechanism of life is to maintain a material boundary
between you and everything else, and to try to make more things into 'you'.
As for information, humans love sharing it.  Privacy is a modern taste and
luxury; most societies couldn't afford it.  And America has more of it than
anyone, partly because we have so much space to have it in.  Our opinions are
not absolute.

The TS hardly sends us back to infancy.  It allows us to look where we please;
it forces no one to look.  As for creative isolation, that is related more to
seclusion -- the freedom from distraction -- than to secrecy, which is needed
for trade secrets, which patents are a replacement for.

It's happening now: the monoculture of diversity, of cosmopolitanism.  Each
great city is becoming culturally more alike: a place where you can find
anything you want, be anyone you want to be.  The transhumanist endpoint of 
this process is a single species -- of shapechangers.  Who will not allow each
other to kill or abuse other members of the society.  Non-members are up for
grabs.

The basic conflict is that Western culture doesn't see itself as a culture.
It sees itself as a bunch of individuals interacting according to minimal
rules.  It doesn't impose itself on other cultures; it's just that its
individuals are so much richer, and individuals from other cultures keep on
defecting.

Who needs persuasion?  We're launching commerical spy satellites and living
high off of scrutinized networks; they're being shot and robbed by their
leaders.

The moral society has been tried, and failed.  I know of no reliable test for
moral courage.  And the will to hold others accountable is inherent to a
gossiping species.  A far stronger argument against transparency is not that
it will not work, but that it will work too well, as in in village and small
towns... and small towns in America are wonderful occasional sources of
scandalous behavior performed by the town leaders behind their closed doors.
By those who have avoided being an equal part of their transparent society.

This is the thinking that wanted in the 1950s to make the US into a police
state: "We must become like the USSR to defeat it."  It was Edward Teller who
pointed out that openness was our strength, not our weakness; that the free
exchange of information supported science, the markets, and responsible
government; and that the benefits thereof would far outweigh any losses due
to the KGB being able to wander around at will.

In Popperian terms: he was not proved wrong.

Individuals have lived with scrutiny for a long, long, long time.  Not being

Wrong.  There is no DESCRIPTION without context and contrast.
Identity - "every thing is equal to itself" - needs neither.

My sentence quoted above was in a discussion of the value of
"centralism" as a DESCRIPTIVE term.

So what?  "A=A" is not an attempt at description, hence it needs no
context.

And you wrench the word _identity_ away from how it has been defined and
used for centuries, because you are too lazy to coin a more accurate
term for what you're defining - and/or too much in love with the idea of
yourself as Great Philosopher to adopt words that other people have used
for what you call "identity", words like _description_ and
_characteristics_ and _qualities_.

Or illustrates your bullheaded refusal to understand common language.

Check out what "L. Reichard White" <rick.rabbit@elmos.com>
suggested concerning the possible evolution of pemes through
trial and error at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>.
No "malicious conspiracy" has been suggested.

James Responds:


Contrary to the above, there is no conflict or even necessary
distinction beween trial and error evolution and conscious conspiracy.
Like any thing else political/economic power conspiracies or power
organisms proceed by trying out various conscious and sub-
consciously conceived power strategies of the then current "leaders".

A major peme is the the widespread tendency to recoil from the
idea of conspiracy......

This is the review that appeared in _Full Context_ three months ago, with 
a couple of small corrections. I'm given back the rights to the review
after this period.

BOOK REVIEW
by Frank Forman

George Reisman, Capitalism: A Treatise on
Economics (Ottawa, IL: Jameson Books, 1996,
1045 pp., $95). Available from the publisher,
Box 738, Ottawa, IL 61350, at a current
discount of $69.95, plus $5 domestic postage
or $10 international postage. Fax: (815) 434-
7907. Excerpts from all chapters and the
entire first chapter can be viewed at
www.capitalism.net.

"Hire your pastor to read the first volume
for you. But don't miss the second." Thus
ends H.L. Mencken's celebrated review of
Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy. The
words apply to George Reisman's defence of
laissez-faire capitalism, Capitalism: A
Treatise on Economics, except that far more
than the equivalent of one out of two volumes
is superfluous to the book's real
contribution, a new vision of the economy as
a whole, with the producer put back into the
central place, which led him to develop a new
system of national income accounting. It is
the stuff of a revolution in economics and a
Nobel Prize for whoever carries it off. I
recommend the huge double-columned book,
however, only to someone who already knows a
good deal of economics and who is ambitious
about carrying forward Reisman's ideas.

The book is in three major parts. The first
part, "The Foundations of Economics," lays
the ground work. Reisman defines economics as
"the science that studies the production of
wealth under a system of division of labor"
(p. 15) and wealth as "material goods made by
man" (p. 39) and discusses the nature of
capitalism and freedom and the protection of
rights by governments. This part further lays
down basic ideas on the division of labor and
the need for wealth and concludes with a
discussion of the ecology movement.

The second part, "The Division of Labor and
Capitalism," discusses why an extensive
division of labor is necessary for economic
progress and why capitalism is the necessary
institutional framework for having an
extensive division of labor in the first
place. He shows how a free-market economy
solves the economic coordination problem and
how socialism is impossible. The part goes
into great detail how price controls
backfire, with particular reference to the
energy "crisis" of 1973. And it also argues
why the alleged threat of private monopoly
power is bogus.

The third part, "The Process of Economic
Progress," is the most original part and
looks at the economy as a whole, with
particular reference to the supply of money
and the importance of having a precious-metal
standard of money. Most of this part consists
of refuting fallacies of other schools of
economic thought, seemingly leaving laissez-
faire capitalism as the remaining
alternative, but a great deal of the part is
given over to expounding the author's
positive conception of the workings of the
economy.

The book concludes with an Epilogue,
outlining a long-term strategy toward
achieving laissez-faire society. First comes
efforts to educate the public, only later
will it become possible to eliminate
regulation and, more slowly, subsidies and
government jobs. Reisman envisions a
government that spends about a tenth of what
it does today.

Capitalism and Objectivism

Capitalism is being touted as an integration
of economics and Ayn Rand's Objectivism. Had
the book done this, it would have been an
even greater achievement than the revolution
the author has begun in putting the producer
into central place in economics (about which
more anon). To be sure, her ideas are
discussed repeatedly in the book, but it does
not deal with her most tantalizing idea
having to do with economics, namely that of
"philosophically objective value," as opposed
to the market-determined "socially objective
value, i.e., the sum of the individual
judgments of all the men involved in trade at
a given time."^ She notes that if a
stenographer "spends all her money on
cosmetics and has none left to pay for the
use of a microscope (for a visit to the
doctor) when she needs it, she learns a
better method of budgeting her income; the
free market serves as her teacher.... The
only thing that a capitalist system requires
of her is the thing that nature requires:
rationality, i.e., that she live and act to
the best of her own judgment." Ayn Rand
speaks of the free market, "which teaches
every participant to look for the objective
best within the category of his own
competence, and penalizes those who act on
irrational considerations."
   ^["What Is the Capitalism?", reprinted in
Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]

Reisman does speak of "imaginary goods," such
as rabbit's feet and tarot cards, but all he
says is that "the economic principles that
apply to such goods, such as the laws of
price determination, are the same as that
apply to genuine goods" (p. 41). So if it is
true that rabbit's feet do not lead to
satisfaction of objective (in some sense)
desires, then the demand for such feet will
fall and so, very likely, their price.

There has always been a tension in economics
over the range of applicability of its
supposed principles. On the one hand,
economics presupposes conditions of peace and
the absence of force and fraud. On the other
hand, economists, including Reisman,
regularly analyze the economic consequences
of government intervention using the various
principles that presuppose their absence. A
second reading of Ludwig von Mises' Human
Action left me overwhelmed with the sleights
of hand he performed in this regard: for
example, businessmen, through a mysterious
process called "understanding" (Verstehen),
can readily calculate the effects of
technology-induced changes in the money
supply but are totally miffed by government-
induced inflation! Reisman, much to his
credit, does not engage in this bit of
hermeneutic, phenomenological metaphysics of
Verstehen; still, an axiomatic treatment
could bring out the precise range of economic
principles.

Now if this ambiguity of the range of
economics is problematic, much more so will
be the distinguishing of Ayn Rand's
"philosophically objective value" from her
market-determined "socially objective value."
The philosophically objective value of an
action is not something that can be directly
read off; rather, its discovery requires
rational thought and investigation, just as
in the discovery of an improved production
process. Both require effort, sometimes
considerable. Whether this effort constitutes
a kind of "cost," I am not prepared to say
and am not sure how Reisman would treat this
matter either, but clearly an integration of
economics and Objectivism would require
consideration of the notion of objectivity in
consumption as well as production. By
contrast, neo-classical economics by and
large presupposes consumer rationality and
has no concern at all with rationality of
ends, except to dismiss it as forever beyond
its purview.

There is a large literature in economics
about the costs of technological innovation,
mostly consisting of trite statements about
optimizing this or that; I suppose one could
generate any number of trite, mathematics-
filled papers on rationality in consumption.
(It's hard, at times, to blame Reisman and
other Austrians for their disdain for
mathematics, but they vastly overdo it.) The
larger problem of just what rational desires
are would remain after all these papers were
generated, and I am afraid that Objectivists
have not gone beyond stating that all
desires, if they are rational, need to
conform to human nature and need to promote
virtue and character development. (This
second need has been articulated only poorly
so far.) It may be high foolishness to
suppose that Objectivism ought to be more
than a well-organized body of abstract
principles and produce algorithms to enable
one to make specific consumption strategies
or career choices. Still, I would not
arbitrarily demarcate philosophy from the
rest of human inquiry as an excuse for
intellectual laziness.

Let me urge any scholar willing to tackle the
problem of objective ends to read David
Schmidtz's Rational Choice and Moral Agency
(Princeton University Press, 1995). Schmidtz
argues that we choose not just means to ends
but what he calls "maieutic" ends, which are
ends to find final ends (ends in themselves)
to live for as well. Thus, I want a career
and a wife to devote myself to. The important
thing is not to dally too long in picking the
best career and the best wife but to get on
with it and let these ends grow from being
means to the satisfaction of my desires to
being ends in themselves around which my
desires are organized. This echoes Francisco
d'Anconia's statement that the worst man was
one without a purpose.

These larger questions about final ends are
general ones for Objectivists, whereas
Reisman says, "I define economics as the
science that studies the production of wealth
under a system of division of labor" (p. 15).
But the issues of career choice and
rationality of consumption ends are relevant
to economics proper. Will a rational consumer
merely purchase what strikes his fancy, or
will his purchases partake of purposefulness
every bit as much as his career?
Unfortunately, I have never seen Ayn Rand's
article on why she collected stamps and
therefore in what sense she found her
collecting to be rationally purposeful. I
urge that the article be made widely
available.

David Hume, characterized by Miss Rand as
"the Bertrand Russell of his day" (in
contrast to the heavyweight Immanuel Kant),
was nevertheless wise when he spoke of man's
need for work, rest, and relaxation. Recall
that the residents of Galt's Gulch did a
certain amount of high-minded relaxing (going
to concerts and ballets, listening to
lectures), but it did not take the form of
goofing off. I suggest that the "science of
the production of wealth" will discover that
purposeful relaxation redounds to this
production of wealth, while goofing off to
some extent may reduce it.

Reisman's Signal Achievement

Enough complaints about what the book did not
do and on to its achievements. What is
revolutionary in his actual accomplishment is
his way of keeping his focus on all the
activity of the economy rather than just upon
the consumer goods that come out at the end
of the process. Sales between businesses for
raw and intermediate products are several
times the size of the end products, and
consideration of the whole keeps the producer
in central place rather than at the margins,
whereas too many economists take production
as a given, to be distributed by "society"
(political pressure groups or "the
aristocracy of pull").

Reisman develops a new method of national
income accounting on, as he calls it, "an
Aristotelian base" as opposed to the
"Platonic-Heraclitean" view implicitly held
by other economists. Paraphrasing one of Ayn
Rand's favorite sayings (which goes back only
to the Middle Ages, not to Aristotle, by the
way), he tells us that "the demand for A is
the demand for A," whence it is improper to
lump flour, wheat, and labor services into
the final product (bread) and count the last
only when measuring the Gross National
Product. Instead, he adds sales of these
intermediate and final products up, adds in
wages, and calls the sum Gross National
Revenue. He takes the reader through a great
many exercises to show how his new accounting
methods work. His accounts somewhat resemble
the input-output tables of Wassily Leontief
(Nobel Prize, 1973) and the earlier Tableau
conomique (1st ed., 1758) of the French
Physiocrat Franois Quesnay, but Reisman
shares not at all their itch to engage in
social planning. Reisman is, of course, a
laissez-faire capitalist.

The upshot of his analysis is several
remarkable and counterintuitive conclusions
(though not as counterintuitive as those of
Keynes' "multiplier"!). Three of the most
important are that all this spending in the
Gross National Revenue accounts depends on
how much money there is, not upon how
productive the economic system is. And
profits, as well as interest rates, are
determined, not by productivity, but by the
proportion of investment to consumption,
which is ultimately tied to the (time)
preference for present goods to future goods.
Time horizons broaden as men are more
rational and property is secure. In such a
case, the rate of profit and interest is low,
under three percent per year during large
stretches of the nineteenth century. Third,
he puts to rest the Marxist notion that
profits necessarily decline over time. This
last is so at variance with the facts that
its continued propagation is a real puzzle,
but it has been supported by (I learned from
Reisman) a very large number of bad but
influential arguments.

Reisman's Other Achievements

Much of the book--too much--is given over to
refuting bad arguments rather than
constructing something positive. But the
refutation of Marx's still highly-
influential theory of exploitation by
capitalists is original. To show this,
Reisman goes back to fundamental concepts,
something that Ayn Rand endlessly encouraged:
profits are just revenues minus the costs^ of
the things produced, and wages are monies
paid in exchange for the performance of labor
not for the products of labor. A businessman
is, therefore, not a wage earner, even if
some economists "impute" a wage to him that
he supposedly pays himself. This means that
farmers, artisans, and everyone who did
productive work were all businessmen and
earned profits (selling their products for
more than they paid for the raw materials),
until the first capitalist employed a laborer
for hire. (Strikingly and long before
Reisman, the great German sociologist, Max
Weber, demarcated capitalism by the free
mobility of labor--that is, by how the
capital was used--not by trade or the free
mobility of money itself, both of which are
quite old.) The upshot is that there is no
"exploitation" here but instead the
benevolent (one of Reisman's favorite words
and more apt than "beneficial") offering of
opportunities to sell one's labor rather than
its products.
   ^[Costs are just outlays here, not so-
called opportunity costs, a notion Reisman
makes mince meat of. This is another side
accomplishment of his book.]

There are other refutations aplenty, from
Keynesianism (focuses almost entirely on the
consumer), alleged free-market monopoly (even
so, buyers would shift to long-term
contracts), wage and price controls (not even
politicians believe in this anymore), the oil
"crisis" (also a dead issue), and
environmentalism (at least the zanier
aspects), to various ideas held by earlier
economists, esp. those of Smith, Ricardo, and
Mill, from which Reisman extracts the best
and makes it his own.

Indeed, some of his criticisms of other
economists, whole schools of them even, are
so strong that I am not sure what is left
standing. Neo-classical economics (what I had
in graduate school) comes in for especial
criticism, but I did not learn from
Capitalism whether there is any merit to
those handy supply-and-demand diagrams and
less-handy indifference curves, and, if so,
how they can be deployed legitimately. Just
what are the fundamental concepts and
assumptions of neo-classical economics
anyhow? I've seen certain mathematical
treatments, but these are never connected to
the world via semantic assumptions
(correspondence rules) in any rigorous
fashion, as Mario Bunge insists in his
monumental Treatise on Basic Philosophy that
they should be.

Some Criticisms

I can get a little suspicious about some of
Reisman's own conclusions, too, for his own
lack of rigor. The numerical examples he
takes the readers through may work only
because he has unintendedly built in
assumptions that make them work. (He often
gives algebraic formulae, but they are not
placed in an axiomatic format and hence need
to be rigorously checked. Hint to future
scholars: back-calculate the underlying
production functions.) Economics, after all,
is an empirical science, and any science must
connect up to the world at multiple places
and not just to contrived examples and to the
broad historical generalizations Reisman
offers. A genuine science must also lay out
its assumptions in the best possible fashion
using the axiomatic method, and a genuine
scientist must keep up to date with the
literature. (See, esp., Mario Bunge, "The
Axiomatic Format" and "Examples and
Advantages of Axiomatics," chapters 7 and 8
in Mario Bunge, Philosophy of Physics
(Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1973). These
chapters deal with science generally, not
just physics.)

Furthermore, the economic realm is
continuous, while our concepts are discrete.
So it is not good enough to just decree what
gets counted in the money supply and what is
merely "near money," as Reisman does on page
540. But on pages 995-6, he recognizes that
different definitions of money can differ in
explanatory power. Yet he rather often speaks
disparagingly of "so-called empirical
research" that might test for just this
explanatory power and seems wholly unaware
that there are several formulae for
constructing weighted averages, the merits of
which make up a large sub-literature in
economics journals.

Ayn Rand's notion of a true definition
(foreshadowed by the great Charles Peirce) as
capturing those characteristics of the thing
defined that maximize (scientific)
explanatory power is well-recognized by
Reisman. But just to proffer definitions is
not enough: one must demonstrate that the
purported definition indeed has this property
of maximizing explanatory power. As it
happens, concept refinement is every bit as
important to science as the usual
undertakings of induction and deduction.
Forming concepts takes hard work and whenever
a purported definition departs from the true
one even slightly, our sciences stray farther
and farther away from reality at a geometric
rate as we merrily proceed link by link down
long deductive chains.

Who Should Read the Book?

Again, a reviewer should not complain too
much about a book's omissions. (I peppered my
copy of the book with enough critical remarks
to give anyone seeing them a severe to fatal
sneezing fit.) In the end, it's the
achievements that count. The refutations are
generally very fine, but far more important
is the book's tremendous potential, a Nobel
Prize even, for a scholar who wants to
develop the positive ideas on revamping the
national income accounts and, effectively,
redoing macro-economics from the ground up.
As for integrating economics and Objectivism,
it's Objectivism that needs to be better
developed, especially in the realm of
psychology.

I recommend the book urgently to any
Objectivist pursuing a career as an academic
economist or considering it and who is
willing to sweat through the book (not just
read it as I did), willing to dig out the
essential arguments and put them on a firm
mathematical and axiomatic basis, and above
all willing to argue, argue, and argue with
his peers in the economics profession. He'll
have to keep up to date and fill in on all
the developments in the field since Reisman
completed his dissertation in 1963,
developments in the economic analysis of
politics (Public Choice theory), the economic
analysis of law, and new learning about how
businessmen counteract the effects of
regulation (Rational Expectations).^ Above
all, he who would develop Reisman's ideas
cannot be like Reisman himself, who would say
that Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki "are
advocates of socialism, while I, of course,
am an advocate of laissez-faire capitalism.
Because of this I could never conceive of
cooperating with them in any manner, and thus
I never attempted to contact Mrs. Robinson"
(p. 803). Alas such dismissiveness only
becomes exaggerated in those who associate
themselves with the Ayn Rand Institute, as
Reisman himself once did.
   ^[Regards Rational Expectations, see J.W.
Henry Watson and Ida Walters, "The New
Economics and the Death of Central Banking,"
Liberty 10.6 (1997 July): 19-26, for a fine
summary.]

For any other reader, I cannot so strongly
recommend the book. This is not for what it
does accomplish, nor for what it refutes, nor
for the picture it gives of how the economy
works, nor for the wit that pops up
frequently, but because it is too long and
reading it comes at the "cost" of not reading
a dozen shorter books. Mencken, Dreiser's
greatest defender, in his generally laudatory
review, nevertheless called Dreiser's novel
"this present shapeless and forbidding
monster--a heaping carload of raw materials
for a novel, with rubbish of all sorts
intermixed--a vast, sloppy, chaotic thing of
385,000 words--at least 250,000 of them
unnecessary," but in the context of overall
high praise. I am compelled to say something
not entirely dissimilar of George Reisman's
Capitalism: it is the stuff of a revolution,
but.... Alas, a very great deal of it is
written at the level of high school students
(as is so much of the material put out by the
Ayn Rand Institute), yet other parts
presuppose an advanced knowledge of the
history of economics thought and the
technicalities of both micro- and
macroeconomics as taught in graduate schools.
Indeed, it is hard to discern the target
audience for the book, since the doctrines of
the neoclassical orthodoxy are only referred
to and not spelt out the way a less than
advanced reader would need. I cannot help but
think that Reisman might have carried out his
own revolution had he not wasted so many
years being involved in said Institute, which
in the end did him no good, since he was
purged himself.

It would be better for most prospective
readers to first read a dozen other books on
economics and before tackling Reisman's
mammoth work. I am not the best to recommend
current books to learn economics, since I
have actually read very few of those now in
print and sold, say, by Laissez Faire Books.
Go through a text in price theory and
actually do the homework. Beyond that, aim
for as broad an understanding of the
economist's way of thinking as you can.
Economics is not all that intuitive, since
our hunting past seems to have instilled in
us the general perspective of command
economies--not so far from the truth when
getting on with the work by following orders
was not much better or worse than innovating
from a very small knowledge base. (I hasten
to add that command economies became
obsolete, surely by the time of agriculture,
if not already by the time that hunting bands
coalesced into tribes.) Thinking like an
economist, in other words, requires
disciplined study.

The first book I ever read on economics,
Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson,
remains an excellent first choice. I can
commend any book by Gordon Tullock and urge
you later on to read Richard Posner's
Economic Analysis of Law, not to further
enlighten you but to show you how disciplined
thinking can lead to "educated incapacity":
to me, this book is a bad caricature of the
economist's mind-set! Definitely include
James M. Buchanan's What Should Economists
Do? In my own specialty within economics,
Public Choice theory (the application of
economics to group decisions), I'd include
the first two classics, Anthony Downs, An
Economic Theory of Democracy, and Buchanan
and Tullock's The Calculus of Consent. Follow
them with Buchanan's magnum opus, The Limits
of Liberty. Try some books that inspire, such
as Burton W. Folsom, Jr., The Myth of the
Robber Barons (in print) and John
Chamberlain, The Enterprising Americans (out
of print). I do not have to recommend Ayn
Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, to the
readers here. Finally, you should probably
have the classics of Smith, Ricardo, and Mill
under your belt before you tackle Reisman.

I am sorry to render the verdict that readers
not start their study of economics with
Reisman's book, but if the right reader
already knowledgeable of the field can be
found, the enormous effort put into
Capitalism by the author will have been more
than rewarded. And so will the economics
profession and the world. Mencken on Dreiser
again: "It takes a kind of skill that is
surely not common. Good writing is far
easier." Original thinking in economics is
also far easier than good writing. Reisman's
book contains a great many original thoughts
but is badly overwritten in most places and
underwritten where it matters most. It takes
someone with a fair amount of knowledge to
grasp what may or may not be original and
merits further development. Get the knowledge
needed to fully profit from Reisman's book
first; then, if you are ambitious, get
Reisman.

   An "isolated system" is an "isolated system" relative

	I have to disagree on this point.  My personal perception of
Pinker's "How the Mind Works" was that it contained very little writing of
interest and Pinker too infrequently degraded the conversation into a
discussion of his own personal politics.  The amount of actual factual
information and even useful speculation and theory contained within could
have fit into a text 1/8th the size of "How the Mind Works", and in order
to sift this text out of the book you have to sit through endless
pages of useless writing all the while searching for the small bits of
gold.  This is unfortunate, as his book "The Language Instinct" was very
good.  I am disappointed that he could not have maintained his quality
with this recent work.

discussion of his own personal politics.  The amount of actual factual
information and even useful speculation and theory contained within could
have fit into a text 1/8th the size of "How the Mind Works", and in order
to sift this text out of the book you have to sit through endless
pages of useless writing all the while searching for the small bits of
gold.  This is unfortunate, as his book "The Language Instinct" was very
good.  I am disappointed that he could not have maintained his quality
with this recent work.

I have complained about this before, but nobody seems to do anything about
it.  The duplicate addresses and CC:'s are being added by the List software
itself.  I don't think it is efficient to try to get everybody who posts to
this list to try to remember to remove the duplicate addresses.  If we
believe in Intelligent Technology, then why are we running brain-dead
software?  Why are we asking the humans to readdress mail to override the
List Software?

More to the poing, why do we have to run the list under two names
(extropy.org and extropy.com)?  Can't we just choose one name and use it?
If we must use both names, why can't the List Software be fixed to append
the proper "Reply-To:" field matching the List name being used?  It is when
the To: field uses one name for this list and the List Software adds a
different name to the Reply-To: field that causes us to end up with two
different names.  Or put another way, when someone posts a message to the
"Extropy.Org" List, the List software appends an instruction to CC: the
"Extropy.Com" list as well.  This is causing the duplicate postings.

Asking every List subscriber to readdress the postings properly to fix the
bad addressing of the List Software is very inefficient.  Sometimes humans
forget.

The alternative to the academic publishing establishment is self publishing, via xerox,
ditributed print on demand, HTML, etc.  Easy to use desktop publishing software is the
threat to the academic publishing houses, not a dearth of publishable material. They just
can't compete as they are structured now. If they wished to get with the program, they'd
evolve themselves into internet content providers of scientific papers online, in HTML,
PDF, PS and other formats, providing a commons for peer review online, using backlinking.
Those that don't will have steadily narrowing business.

Yes, however I think he was more interested in the Earned Income Tax Credit. If
you have one or more dependents and make less than I beleive $23,000 a year
(correct me if I'm wrong), then there is a sliding scale to figure out your tax
return, which in many cases gives you back more than you paid in over the year.
My little brother, for instance, a learning disabled individual (severe
dyslexia) who works as a chef, makes between $10,000-$15,000 a year, and got
$2650 back in his tax return (he has one son) which is at the very least several
hundred dollars more than the total amount withheld from his pay for the year.

So not only does this provide additional income redistribution, but it also
helps poor people save money which they may use to help them better their
situation. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. While my brother bought a
pickup truck (the return came in just as the chassis on his old one broke
turning his old pickup into a wallet), many people I have heard of getting this
return will typically spend it on durgs or booze, or vacations.

While I'm not one to advocate government dictating people's personal lives,
considering its my taxes that is being paid into these people's pockets, I think
that they should only be able to spend the money on either education or personal
transportation.

Several publishers seems to be doing this right now, at least putting
up the full text part for paying subscribers. I know at least one
journal that uses on-line peer review (although not in a forum form),
Behavioral & Brain Sciences. 

One group who is having great trouble with the cost of the journals is
the libraries; while we scientists continue to publish at a frantic
pace, the library budgets are fairly constant or even decrease. (see
"Reforming Scholarly Publishing in the Sciences: A Librarian
Perspective" by J.J. Branin and M. Case, Notices of the AMS April
1998, http://www.ams.org/notices/199804/branin.pdf for those who can
access it)

These seems to be useful.

But from a military standpoint, a wounded enemy is worth two dead
enemies since he or she requires others to help and has a demoralizing
effect; "nonlethal" weapons are useful in this respect.

Maybe average amount of information available in a given time?

  IAN: Silly argument. The relation is meaningful
  only because the relation exists between two 
  DIFFERENT times. You just tried to find an 
  example of meaningful self-relation and did 
  so only by including exactly that which you
  purported need not be a part of relation! 
  Also, the cat is always relatied to not-cat.

  IAN: Fluffy is being related to the black void!
  Fluffy is DIFFERENT than the black void. How more
  obvious could it be? How more transparent can the 
  infection by the "same as" crackpot meme be? It's
  causing you to make the most absurd arguments,
  arguments that defeat themselves by 100%!

   IAN: "Slightly different" is still different.
   Good grief. All your cases against holistic
   identity are actually cases for it!

   Still wafting for an example of 
   a nonholistic identity.

  IAN: No they don't. They don't know what

  "Same as" simply defines the "=" symbol.
  Is that useful? Yes; but it does not 
  tell us what identity actually is.

You realize that your suggestion, while functional, would break other
e-mail situations, and corrects a problem that only this List has?  Yes I
do have my mail set to reply to all participants.  If I get mail "From:
Person A", "To: Person B", "CC: Person C", and "Reply-To: Person D", I
really do want my comments to go back to all of them.  If I start excluding
specific headers from getting a reply, then I will start dropping
participants in other multi-person e-mail conversations.  Therefore, my
default setting is as you describe, and I do my best to remember to
manually edit my replies to this list to remove the "bad" address and keep
only the "good" address.

I purposefully let the default headers from the List go uncorrected in this
case, so that anybody who checked the headers would see that my description
of the List process was correct.  I sent my e-mail to one address only.
The List itself added the second address.  Depending on your software
settings, you might have duplicated your response to me.  My method of
posting is valid and nonduplicating.  My method of replying is valid and
nonduplicating.  It is only when these two methods are also combined with
the List's added headers and duplicate naming, that we will see duplicate
posts.  Although we can break this chain of events on the sending side or
the receiving side, as network engineer I would  blame the List Software
itself as being the root cause of the problem.

If there is no good reason to run this List under two different alias
names, the problem can be easily solved once and for all.  My question is
"Who configures this List?", and "Why is it set up to do this?"  Is there
really a good reason that the List sends out headers with two different
names for itself?  If we edited everything down to use just one and only
one name, wouldn't that be more straightforward and work better?

The 'Political Food Chain'
--------------------------

1. Deep pemes                          Originators/
   ("constitution," "president,"       Deep Anarchists
   "authority," "emperor," etc.)
   Political Concepts

2. Surface pemes                       Propagators/
   ("the public interest," etc.)       Phobocrats
   Political Beliefs

3. Toxic memes                         Followers
   ("he made me angry," etc.)          Rebels
   Personal Self-Defeating Beliefs


I find it interesting that your experiences
accord with the Peme Rules -- they are of
course slightly overstated (but not for
some Followers and Rebels!)

My list of Originators:
1. William of Ockham
2. Voltaire
3. Jonathan Swift
4. Lysander Spooner
5. Max Stirner
6. Friedrich Nietzsche
7. Hans Vaihinger
8. George Gurdjieff
9. Aleister Crowley
10. Ron Hubbard
11. Timothy Leary
12. Robert Anton Wilson
13. Hakim Bey
14. Max More

Who else should I add to my list?

The primary characteristic of Originators is
their *ability and willingness to question
everything*.  I suspect all the above had or
have this quality.

I don't think any of my Originators have
cleared out all their deep pemes.  They
could be regared as Proto-Deep Anarchists.
(As a result of my identification of the
Peme Conflict Principle, I discovered that
I also have more deep pemes to tackle.)

Originators are extremely dangerous to the
status quo -- provided they can get people
to listen to them.  (There are, and probably
have been, many more unknown Originators
who failed at getting people to listen to
them.)

I don't "attack authority."  I attack the
very *idea* or *notion* of "authority"
(so-called).  The notion of "authority"
in the political sense is a deep peme.
(To regard Einstein as an authority on
relativity is valid.)  All so-called
"political authority" is bogus -- hucksters
who call themselves "president," "emperor,"
etc. and suckers who believe them.

I certainly am not "anti-authority"
because from my perspective there isn't
any so-called "authority" to be against.
There are only pretended "authorities"
-- and Followers who believe and obey
them, and Rebels who believe and fight
them.

Hubbard was a master at helping people
remove some of their toxic memes, then
installing his own toxic memes to create
Loyal Followers.  As far as I know, Hubbard
never addressed what I consider deep pemes.

I think that someone with deep pemes can
both help others remove deep pemes and
install new deep pemes.

By "anarchist" I mean someone who has no
ruler and doesn't rule others.  I would
agree with you that an anarchist operating
at the Rebel level ("anti-authority") is
infected -- he hasn't shed the *idea* of
"authority" (so-called).  He doesn't realize
that the hucksters masquerading as "emperor,"
"president," etc. are imposters and liars.

You say, "...[T]rue decentralisation can
only occur when all entities populate the
top of the 'political food chain'."  You're
right.  Coercive politics is about those
higher on the 'chain' "eating out the
substance" of those lower on the 'chain.'
To prevent having your "substance eaten
out," you have to raise yourself to the
top of the 'polical food chain.'

Deep Anarchists of the world, escape from
the 'political food chain' hierarchies and
disperse at the top!

Can someone tell me whether this is bogus interview?

Obviously, it has all the makings of a hoax, but even if these are not
Stroustrup's words, I think some of the points raised are valid(having
wondered about the merits of C++ myself), and they are very important in
determining whether the software industry may be burdened by entropic
languages.

I know there are lots of programmers on this list-- what do you think of
the idea of a language putting a burden on expression? (maybe this question
is also a linguistic/philsophical one... if everyone switched to Esperanto,
would this increase the efficiency of communication?)

->Stroustrup Confesses about C++
->
->On the 1st of January, 1998, Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview to
the
->IEEE's 'Computer' magazine.
->
->Naturally, the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective view
->of seven years of object-oriented design, using the language he
created.
->
->By the end of the interview, the interviewer got more than he had
->bargained for and, subsequently, the editor decided to suppress its
->contents, 'for the good of the industry' but, as with many of these
->things, there was a leak.
->
->Here is a complete transcript of what was said, unedited, and
->unrehearsed, so it isn't as neat as planned interviews.
->
->You will find it interesting...
->__________________________________________________________________
->
->Interviewer:   Well, it's been a few years since you changed the
->               world of software design.  How does it feel,
->               looking back?
->
->Stroustrup:    Actually, I was thinking about those days, just
->               before you arrived.  Do you remember?  Everyone
->               was writing 'C' and, the trouble was, they were
->               pretty damn good at it.  Universities got pretty
->               good at teaching it, too.  They were turning out
->               competent - I stress the word 'competent' -
->               graduates at a phenomenal rate.  That's what
->               caused the problem.
->
->Interviewer:   Problem?
->
->Stroustrup:    Yes, problem.  Remember when everyone wrote
->               COBOL?
->
->Interviewer:   Of course, I did, too.
->
->Stroustrup:    Well, in the beginning, these guys were like
->               demi-gods.  Their salaries were high, and they
->               were treated like royalty.
->
->Interviewer:   Those were the days, eh?
->
->Stroustrup:    Right.  So what happened?  IBM got sick of it,
->               and invested millions in training programmers,
->               till they were a dime a dozen.
->
->Interviewer:   That's why I got out.  Salaries dropped within a
->               year, to the point where being a journalist
->               actually paid better.
->
->Stroustrup:    Exactly.  Well, the same happened with 'C'
->               programmers.
->
->Interviewer:   I see, but what's the point?
->
->Stroustrup:    Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I
->               thought of this little scheme, which would
->               redress the balance a little.  I thought 'I
->               wonder what would happen, if there were a
->               language so complicated, so difficult to learn,
->               that nobody would ever be able to swamp the
->               market with programmers?
->
->               Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you
->               know, X windows.  That was such a bitch of a
->               graphics system, that it only just ran on those
->               Sun 3/60 things.  They had all the ingredients
->               for what I wanted.  A really ridiculously complex
->               syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO
->               structure.  Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows
->               code.  Motif is the only way to go if you want to
->               retain your sanity.
->
->Interviewer:   You're kidding...?
->
->Stroustrup:    Not a bit of it.  In fact, there was another
->               problem.  Unix was written in 'C', which meant
->               that any 'C' programmer could very easily become
->               a systems programmer.  Remember what a mainframe
->               systems programmer used to earn?
->
->Interviewer:   You bet I do, that's what I used to do.
->
->Stroustrup:    OK, so this new language had to divorce itself
->               from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that
->               bound the two together so nicely.  This would
->               enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a
->               decent living too.
->
->Interviewer:   I don't believe you said that...
->
->Stroustrup:    Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe
->               most people have figured out for themselves that
->               C++ is a waste of time but, I must say, it's
->               taken them a lot longer than I thought it would.
->
->Interviewer:   So how exactly did you do it?
->
->Stroustrup:    It was only supposed to be a joke, I never
->               thought people would take the book seriously.
->               Anyone with half a brain can see that
->               object-oriented programming is counter-intuitive,
->               illogical and inefficient.
->
->Interviewer:   What?
->
->Stroustrup:    And as for 're-useable code' --- when did you
->               ever hear of a company re-using its code?
->
->Interviewer:   Well, never, actually, but...
->
->Stroustrup:    There you are then.  Mind you, a few tried, in the
->               early days.  There was this Oregon company ---
->               Mentor Graphics, I think they were called --- really
->               caught a cold trying to rewrite everything in C++
->               in about '90 or '91.  I felt sorry for them
->               really, but I thought people would learn from
->               their mistakes.
->
->Interviewer:   Obviously, they didn't?
->
->Stroustrup:    Not in the slightest.  Trouble is, most companies
->               hush-up all their major blunders, and explaining
->               a $30 million loss to the shareholders would have
->               been difficult.  Give them their due, though,
->               they made it work in the end.
->
->Interviewer:   They did?  Well, there you are then, it proves
->               O-O works.
->
->Stroustrup:    Well, almost.  The executable was so huge, it
->               took five minutes to load, on an HP workstation,
->               with 128MB of RAM.  Then it ran like molasses.
->               Actually, I thought this would be a major
->               stumbling-block, and I'd get found out within a
->               week, but nobody cared.  Sun and HP were only too
->               glad to sell enormously powerful boxes, with huge
->               resources just to run trivial programs.  You know,
->               when we had our first C++ compiler, at AT&T, I
->               compiled 'Hello World', and couldn't believe the

->

->
->Stroustrup:    They have?  Try it on the latest version of C++ -

->

->               in C++.
->
->Interviewer:   Oh my God.  What did he say?
->
->Stroustrup:    Well, luckily, he has a good sense of humor.  I

->
->Interviewer:   Were you?
->
->Stroustrup:    Actually, I did write DOS in C++, I'll give you a
->               demo when we're through.  I have it running on a
->               Sparc 20 in the computer room.  Goes like a

->
->Interviewer:   What's it like on a PC?

->
->Interviewer:   Last I heard, a really top guy is worth $70 - $80
->               an hour.
->
->Stroustrup:    See?  And I bet he earns it.  Keeping track of
->               all the gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job.
->               And, as I said before, every C++ programmer feels

For what it's worth (perhaps not much), here's a mass-market newspaper
review I published some months ago of Pinker's book and another by Per Bak.
 Bottom line: I endorse Greg's view, not Roderick's.

===========================

HOW NATURE WORKS
The Science of Self-Organized Criticality
by Per Bak
Oxford University Press, 212pp.
HOW THE MIND WORKS
by Steven Pinker
Allen Lane, 660pp

In the 1980s, `chaos' was science's sexy topic, although people kept
misunderstanding it.  Chaos dynamics found that the world's rich and
unpredictable confusion hid simple rules.  By the early 1990s, the buzz
word became `complexity'.  Interesting things (life especially) exist
mostly on a boundary between frozen order and hissing chaos.  Now there's a
new spin: the spontaneous emergence of those complicated and lovely things
is due to `self-organised criticality'.  

Criticality occurs when all the parts of a system impact on each other
holistically.  Its emblem is a pile of rice.  Trickle long-grain rice
steadily onto a flat surface and it builds into a cone, shedding as many
specks as it gains - but in jolts and avalanches, small and large.

Despite Per Bak's enthusiasm, his beguiling book should be titled `Some of
the Ways Nature Works Some of the Time'.  Still, in its brief account, he
offers a startling new unified picture of many wildly different phenomena:
word use frequencies, the size and number of earthquakes, the surprising
computer program called the `Game of Life', dinosaur and other extinctions,
the limits of planned economies, and why we will never get rid of traffic
jams.  Oh yes, and he thinks he's learned how the brain works.

It's all due to those avalanches.  For Bak, a frequent visitor to the Sante
Fe Institute, home of complexity studies, the secret of life is a
mathematical peculiarity called 1/f (`one-over-f') noise.  Unlike chaos,
which has a boring `white noise' signal, this key regime creates a weirdly
universal pattern.  Mapping it, you get a tall spike on one side, tailing
off quickly as the curve moves to the right.  Consider urban scales: for
every megalopolis of ten million inhabitants, there are roughly 10 cities
with a million, 100 with 100,000, and a thousand towns with only 10,000.  

It's the same with earthquakes, as measured by the Gutenberg-Richter law.
Most are barely detectable.  Some shake villages.  Very few are dangerous
monsters.  Snow avalanches follow much the same pattern.  Graph such
frequencies on a logarithmic chart and you get a straight line,
representing a neat equation.  This is Bak's key to how nature works, and
you'll need to read his little book with some attention to see why he might
be at least partly right.

Does it matter if he is?  Indeed it does.  Systems poised at
self-organising criticality (SOC) are neither too hot nor too cold,
bubbling with novelty.  Every now and then, an awful avalanche is triggered
by some tiny event that can't be identified in advance.  It doesn't take a
killer asteroid from space, Bak claims, to wipe out the dinosaurs.  SOC
gives us eco-catastrophe for free, the downside of complexity.  Sante Fe's
Stuart Kauffman says of such ideas: `I have a feeling that all this shit
links together in some wonderful way.'  Couldn't put it better myself.

Or does it link together just because the human mind is a gadget designed
by natural selection to extract (and impose) patterns or features on the
confusion of the world?  Yes and no, according to Steven Pinker's superb
new book.  Three times as stout as Bak's, a paperback well worth its thirty
dollars, Pinker's romp through cognitive science's current portrait of the
mind covers an immense amount of territory.  It's terrifyingly up to date -
900-odd apposite references take up 37 pages.  Luckily Pinker wears his
learning lightly and with appealing whimsy.

"I want to convince you," he says at the outset, "that our minds are not
animated by some godly vapour or single wonder principle."  Rather, mind is
a complex package of small dedicated specialists, "and thus is packed with
high-tech systems each contrived to overcome its own obstacles".  The mind,
Pinker argues, is what the brain does.  Even if complexity theorists like
Bak are right, even if mind emerges only in certain self-organising regimes
of criticality, the way it arises is heavily influenced by the solutions
history has imposed on its evolving development.  We are each parliaments
or coalitions of small neural experts.

The ancients suggested that inside each human was a homunculus, a `little
man' who watched, as it were, from behind the eyes.  That idea hindered
science and philosophy for ages, and was eventually hustled out of both
biology and literary theory.  Now the homunculus has returned, although in
a new guise.  The brain is built of numerous agents, some of them
genetically hardwired, each with limited but focussed powers, compiled
together into characteristic modes of sensing, feeling and reasoning - into
faculties, another discarded term making a comeback.

Forcing this reappraisal are many quite recent experiments, using
astounding new technologies to peer inside the working parts of humans and
less complex animals.  Pinker leads his charmed reader through a series of
exemplary case histories in `reverse-engineering'.  We know what vision
does, for example, and what parts of the brain and optic tract are involved
- but to understand the entire impossible process it's necessary to probe
backwards, using evolutionary insights as a guide.

A central chapter picks apart what's going on when you gaze at one of those
weird computer-generated pictures made up of squiggly lines.  Let your eyes
defocus, and an elephant or T. Rex pops out in three dimensions.  As it
happens I don't have the neural machinery to perform this useful trick,
because my brain wasn't wired up correctly in infancy.  Hence, like a few
percent of the population, both stereograms and reality are quite flat to
me (although luckily I can use other cues to stop myself running into the
back of the car ahead).  Pinker's story takes some small effort to follow,
but I recommend the trip, because it's a delightful exploration of... well,
of how minds work.  Angry minds, family minds, coarse, subtle and
artificial minds.  Plus, in the final chapter, the meaning of life.

On the other hand, don't expect more than is reasonable.  Pinker states
candidly at the start: "we don't understand how the mind works - not nearly
as well as we understand how the body works".  Even so, "dozens of
mysteries of the mind, from mental images to romantic love, have recently
been upgraded to problems" rather than impenetrable mysteries.  But what
about the teachings and verities of the past?  "Our old ideas," he observes
stingingly, "were too vapid to be wrong."

Pinker's enjoyable treasure-trove, perhaps even better than his excellent
The Language Instinct, meets the goal he set: "to get you to step outside
your own mind for a moment and see your thoughts and feelings as
magnificent contrivances of the natural world".  If you're looking for a
summer book to expand and explain your mind at the same time, this is it.

Food, housing, education and 1st-class medical care available for all
citizens. I call that a _very_ positive (but non-economic) side effect.

The primary reason I posted was to correct the (IMO), false, statement that
welfare systems cause weak economies (look at various European economies
and you'll see it's  bit more complex than that). My knowledge of economy
is inadequate to 'prove' that welfare systems are economically sound, I
just feel that the material cost of welfare to me is well worth the
increased quality of life for others and from what I see around me on this
continent about 300 million people seem to agree more or less (libertarian
parties are even more insignificant here that in the US).

I do not (any longer ;-) expect to convince many people on this list about
such things so y'all just do some state-bashing if you want but stick to
the facts (Fact: It is possible to have a healty, growing, high-tech,
efficient, knowledge & services-based economy and an extensive
social-security system).

Greetings,
Arjen

I've been thinking a _lot_ about this since I joined this list last august
and I'll try to explain my viewpoint as it is now. Philosophically speaking
I can't justify forced income redistribution by a state (even a democratic
one). But:

If the state can't redistribute income, the state can't exist, it needs
resources to provide the kind of high-level services single individuals
can't buy and most companies can't provide (see my example below).
Redistributing income is much more than welfare, tax-funded security
(police) is also a kind of income-redistribution, the rich paying for the
security of the poor to some extend. So, if I'm not mistaken, you're saying
that you want no governement whatsoever.

OK.
To this I can only say that AFAIKT absence of some kind of governing body
leads to a very unconstructive chaos that makes it very hard for people to
actually do what they're good at. Instead they are kept busy with personal
security and ensuring all kinds of other basics that we can take for granted.

I'll be the first to aknowledge that states themselves have done some
pretty bad things throughout history but I can also give some examples
where people seem to be reasonably happy with their state. Democratic
representation and a 'trias politica' seem to be the lesser evil (IMHO). I
know of no example where stateless situations have lead to stable,
high-tech, prosperous communities (but am willing to listen to interesting
examples). 

Of course it can be argued that untill now the conditions have always been
wrong for an anarcho-capitalistic society to succed but this is pretty much
the same arguments that hard-line communists use when they defend their
system: "No, no, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot weren't true communists, but when
we take power things will be different." We've had a whole bunch of
large-scale social experiments this century and almost everyone some form
og genocide occured.

Structural changes to a complex system as society should be done gently and
_very_ carefully. A system-crash can (and has) cost millions of lives.

I'll try to give an example of problem I think only a state-like
organisation can solve (it's a bit nationalistic but bear with me ;-).

In 1953 a large part of Holland was flooded when a combination of
high-tides and storm occured. The dike system protecting
lower-than-sea-level land was breached and about 2000 people drowned. I
response to this the Dutch governement implemented the Delta-plan. Over a
perion of 33 years over a $10^12 was invested in upgrading all dike-systems
so that an occurrance like the '53 flood could never occur again. The final
construction was finished last year, two giant doors that can close a
canal's opening into the sea.

I've been trying to think how a commercial organisation could have achieved
such a thing. Who would invest in such a project? Who would 'buy' the end
product?
I believe that only a state has the means and the organisation to pull
something like that off. Can anyone think of a scenario where companies
would have made something like the Internet? (a free-to-use-for-all utility).

I don't like the fact that a state is needed so that people can live
together but for now I firmly believe it is the lesser evil.

Greetings,
Arjen

I'll agree that the effectiveness of foreign aid may leave something to be
desired (understatement), but saying that you should be in the place where
you make the most money is (IMHO) a simplification. The amount of revenue
generated primarily tells you something about how value is perceived by
people who already have a very high standard of living and control over
many resources.

My customer may be willing to pay an enourmous amount for an advice that is
sometimes simply common sense (IMO), while getting finance for low-tech
improvements that can save several lives per year in a small community can
be very hard. By reducing the problem to a purely economic one you are
saying that $10.000 spent on preventing some manager looking foolish in
front of his peers is somehow better than half that ammount spent on basic
medicine simply because the manager is in a position to pay and most
Africans are not.

I always was thought that judgements as to what is 'better' were way beyond
the reach of economics.

Or it may be a very educational experience of a type 1st-world universities
don't offer. Down in the mud you learn a lot about organizing projects and
effecient usage of (very limited) resources. But most of all you can learn
to keep yourself and others going under difficult circumstances.

Most '1st-world kids' don't do the actual hammer wielding of course but
contribute their western knowledge or academic skills (that is, if they are
serious about their aid). The people living in third-world countries are
perfectly capable of digging a canal, designing a integrated irrigation
system however may be beyond their capabilities (not suprising since many
of them never had the opportunity to master reading and writing).

I won't argue that the kid will become a better programmer through these
kind of experiences but there's more to life than pumping C++ code. A
change in environment, broadening her/his horizon might make for a
stronger, self-sufficient and more balanced person. The effectiveness of an
employee in the function of programmer is only partly due to his/her
programming abilities, being able to teamwork and function under stress are
just as important.

The software industry is burdened by many entropic practices. See below for
glaring generalizations.

Most people who write code (at least, in my experience over 20 years, here
in Silicon Valley and in Minneapolis) do not truly treat the process as an
engineering discipline. "Real" engineers are taught to keep notebooks, and
some do. Software "engineers" mostly aren't, and mostly don't--and regular
people who develop software, say dink around with databases or
spreadsheets,  certainly mostly don't. Where's the payoff? I have _results_
to obtain! Etc.

Professional programmers are rewarded for heroics; many tend to have a
strong maverick or maestro streak (which has good and bad points); and they
don't have any idea of what their "batting average" (ex.: coding error rate
per KLOC) is--to name a few shortcomings.

This is not meant as finger pointing; when I made my living programming, I
was the same way. Still am, to too great a degree. Discipline is hard, and
if it isn't emphasized it goes away.

To my mind, the things mentioned in "Bjarne's" interview are emblematic of
a general "out of focus" problem; blaming the language is an easy out.
"Bjarne" is really finding fault with bandwagons and fads du jour and the
resultant lock-in and job-security b.s.

And he's right about that. Hype is not conducive to good design. Good
design is hard. Following fads is easy. And giving the boss what he expects
is "smart".

Similar groupthink and yesmanism have led to failure even in supposedly
"zero defects" environments: vide NASA and Challenger. C++ was not a
factor, but the substrate issues were. But returning to your question...

Languages that _don't_ put a burden on expression get a bad rap, too. But
some of them are the best languages in the world for quickly writing
bug-free software, as frequent embedded system use supports. Go figure.

  IAN: A definition is useful IF it puts 
  the defined in context, IF it defines 
  the relations of the defined to things 
  that are different than it. The "A=A" 
  definition of A does not do that, it 
  seeks to remove A from context, and thus 
  seeks to nullify its identity to the ex-
  tent its identity is derived from differ-
  ential relation, which it is by 100%.


  We can go around and around about identity,
  but the shortcut is to simply show me the 
  proof, show me A that is A free from not-A.
  That's all you need to do. You don't need
  to call me names or get mad, just prove it.
  I've tired to and having failed to do so, 
  accepted that the identity of A is not the 
  "same as" A, but rather, A is the difference 
  between A and not-A, and I didn't get upset.

  You've tried to do that, and like my own 
  effort, your examples of "free identities" 
  have only evidenced examples of holistic 
  identities. If you cannot find any example
  of any identity or any attribute of any 
  identity that is not derived from differ-
  ential relation but from "same-as relation,"
  then you must admit that the "same-as"
  definition of identity is false, irra-
  tional, and thus definitionally crackpot.

  A is A not because A is the same as A,
  A is A because A is different than not-A.

  We've been through this in the past, you
  never found a single example to support the 
  atomist-identity theory you believe then and 
  you still cannot find even one example now
  and yet here you are still clinging to it.
  How is it that some people can believe in 
  that for which there is 100% no evidence?

I have an even stronger standard: that the identity
of an can be expressed as the relationship between
X and not-X is a truism that a 12-year-old could
understand with a bit of reflection, and it is "true"
in the metaphysical sense that it is impossible to
show a counterexample, but it is /not useful/ to
anyone, because It doesn't help me predict things.

The symbolic string manipulations of traditional
boolean algebra, starting with "A=A", are useful to
prove complex theorems; /they don't mean anything/,
and never have, so your rant against them is hollow.
Math and Logic aren't real; they don't have to be.
They are just models.  When we manipulate the models,
we get predictions; when those predictions succeed,
we call those models "useful".  Metaphysical truth
is a mystical concept, not a useful one.  What's
useful is anything that improves my ability to
predict the world by reducing the information
content of my world model.  The act of reason is
just data compression; the simpler my model, the
more I can predict with it in less computational
time--given the constraint that its predictions
must match my observations within the universe of
phenomena in which I am interested.

The fact that "crowness" is a relationship between
those things that are crows and those things that are
not is a true, but utterly useless, observation.  A
more useful observation is to note the asymmetry in
the system: there is a lot more information complexity
on the non-crow side than on the crow side: think of
a non-crow.  Ok, now think of a crow.  Which was
easier for you, and more productive?  That asymmetry
allows me to do useful work: if, for example, I store
the information about "crowness"--this relationship
between crows and non-crows--/as if/ it were a set of
properties belonging to crows themselves, I can store
the information about that relationship more compactly.
Crows are black, have feathers, etc.  That simple bit
of information can enable me to accomplish things
like learning not to stand around dead animals if I
don't want to be attacked by an angry bird. 

Don't tell me that holism is /true/.  I don't give a
damn.  Tell me how I can /profit/ from it.

I can't find the source of the Stroustrup interview parody
anywhere, so I don't know whom to credit for it, but it is
definitely not Stroustrup.  There are several real interviews
with him on the net, and a whole book by him on the subject,
none of which have this parody's choppy, idiomatic writing
style, or anything like its contents.

My personal opinion, as a programmer, on the impact of
language choice on engineering success is this: Yes, the
choice of language impacts what solutions are thought of
and chosen, in addition to the obvio8us effects on the
efficacy of the solution and ease of development.  I do
not think it is a primary determinant of success, though:
talented engineers will manage to find good solutions in
whatever medium of expression is at hand.

There's a great story in Douglas Hofstaedter's book
_Le Ton Beau de Marot_ about his trip to Poland.  He is
having a conversation in a coffee shop, struggling to
remember the grammar, periodically checking his Polish
phrasebook, but managing.  Soon he is joined by someone
speaking German, and discovers that the person he was
talking to also speaks German, so he switches.  This
being his third language, he is still not entirely
comfortable, but much moreso than in Polish, which he
has only studied for the trip.  Later still, he speaks
to another friend in French, his second and almost-
native language which he is quite comfortable with.
Finally, he calls home and relates the story in his
native English.

On each switch, he feels as if he is escaping a mental
straightjacket that was consuming effort and limiting
his choice of expression; in English, he felt the
thoughts coming fluidly and expressed them exactly as
he wanted with confidence.

Imagine, then, what might be the next step; what
language--if learned natively--might allow one to easily
and confidently express concepts for which English
would be a restraint?  What would it feel like to lift
that constraint and expand the possibilities of what
one can communicate?

I'm sure that Hofstaedter had wonderful insights even
in Polish--but he could accomplish much more in his
native English.  If he had learned some other language
as a child--say Lojban (you knew it was coming...)--
how different would his insights have been, and how
effectively might he have communicated them?

Hey, the mainstream software industry _thrives_ on entropic languages. The
choices are entirely irrational, as we didn't use:

- Lisp/Scheme: yeah, Real Men get scared of parentheses. TI Explorer:
   Lisp machines' Waterloo
- Forth: a very extropic (expressive/protean) language/OS -- write-only
    only for weenies
- Oberon 2: very quiche, but also very small, safe and powerful
- Smalltalk: requires no intro

but instead we got stuck with:

- Fortran: Real Men do it with arrays
- Cobol: the anti-hacker language par excellence; y2k
- PL/I: <shudder>
- Ada: Star Wars, indeed
- Basic: billge's beloved language
- C/UNIX: which only looks good if compared to the others in this list. Oh
    yes, Real Programmer's code never bombs, and is perfectly portable.
- C++: C-derived PL/I clone.
- Java: the ucsd-p of the 90's

Ok, we've got Python and Perl -- but these are not mainstream software
developer's languages.

A language puts indeed a very tight reign on expressivity. Forth, one of
the most expressive languages I am aware of, routinely modifies the
compiler (can you do it with gcc?) and language syntax -- having a very
steep abstraction gradient it lets you define an application language.

Most people can't learn second languages very well. Besides, we _have_ a
lingua franca already. While I never understood why they dropped Latin for
frogspeak -- let's stick to English, it is a simple enough language.

I'm sure my opinion should be suspect, as this image doesn't seem to include a
role for lawyers, but, with all due respect, this seems like an unworkable
nightmare.  Most factual disputes worth trying in any court are so because the
facts are debatable, even by forensic experts.  Ultimately someone has to make
decisions of such disputed fact questions and any "electronic justice" able to
make such decisions would have to evidence at least as much intelligence and
-- more importantly -- wisdom as a human judge or jury.  

While crimes committed in thoroughly "surveilled" public areas might someday
be susceptible to more "objective" fact-finding than we have today, crimes and
intentional torts would just happen in less observable locales.  Unless every
square centimeter of every possible habitat is perfectly observed, committed
murderers or frauds will simply commit their acts in the least observed zones.

I agree that improved surveillance systems will and should be used in "hot
spots" -- predictable locales for crime.  One can imagine all sorts of clever
devices that would improve on the now-ubiquitous video cameras in places like
urban convenience stores.  (Here's one -- a system in the doorway that, upon
detection of a gunshot or certain key phrases, automatically fires a small
probe to extract a DNA sample and a cloud of microscopic tracking devices from
the next n persons passing through the doorway . . .)  But, anything less than
total surveillance of all possible locales for crime will still leave a need
for "flawed human witnesses" in any justice system.

I remain deeply suspicious of the concept of a completely "transparent
society" -- primarily for reasons other than the ones discussed here.  But on
this point, I doubt seriously whether the idea is any panacea for justice.

Yes!  There's a whole range of survival memes which,
if hijecked by phobocrats for nefarious purposes,
become surface pemes.

Good point!  Phobocrats are very good at using survival
memes to "justify" their coercive actions.  To the
superficial "masses" anyone who questions phobocrat
programs can be branded a "child hater," "job
destroyer," etc.

The most powrful deep pemes depend on their survival
for the bicameral need for "external authorities"
-- see <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm>.

We could call the bicameral need for idols a
primitive human instinct.  The Follower worships
idols; the Rebel hates and tries to fight them.

Maybe at certain levels of development, human consciousness
takes the form of an interdependent network of basic
concepts, such that if any one concept is threatened,
then the threat tends to be perceived as being against
the whole of consciousness.  "If I lose this one precious
deep peme, then my entire consciousness will collapse."

For many people, this may apply for deep pemes such as
"society," "constitution," "president," "emperor," etc.

The peme program has spoken.

The fish can't be free, unless all the sharks have been
exterminated.

Poor victim ARTSCHOLBE can't be free because the big bad
ogre "state" grants privileges to the horrible exploiting
few at his expense.

Poor ARTSCHOLBE lives in a world in which there are no
privileges, except those granted by the big bad ogre
"state" and by the horrible exploiting few.

Poor ARTSCHOLBE is at constant risk of greedy, selfish
landowners revoking his permission to be on their land,
condemming him to live "out of a packing case over a
grate.  "What a shame!

Poor ARTSCHOLBE doesn't know how to grant himself even
greater privileges than those supposedly granted by the
big bad ogre "state."  What a shame!

Now imagine that you're a deep peme called "state,"
sitting on a throne in ARTSCHOLBE's brain in the form
of the top-dog mind parasite.  What attitudes would you
want to induce in your victim?  Abject helplessness?
And what would you want your victim to say?  What
messages would you want poor ARTSCHOLBE to spread?

 A better way of understanding deflation (as opposed to the decline in
prices of specific goods relative to some average) is to view it as a
rise in the price of a currency. For significant deflation, think of it
as a speculative bubble where people invest in the currency because they
extrapolate past trends to justify holding increasing proportions of their
wealth as currency.
 The main reason this is bad is that nominal interest rates can't go much
below zero, so that if deflation is -10%, real interest rates are an
abnormally high 10% or more, preventing most people from borrowing, which
cuts off a significant source of expenditures.

This is not a fault with the List serv sw! It is doing the right thing -
ie it puts a "Reply-To:" line in the header. That is SMTP* compliant. If
you're lucky, you've got a properly designed email program which has
prefs that allow you to reply to everyone listed in the header or just
the default respondee (ie the "Reply-to:" adressee if there is one, the
"From:" adressee if there is not). Under Eudora(Mac), for instance, look
under Special/Settings/Replying.

*[SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol, is the defacto method of
pushing email msgs around on the net. The protocol is fairly extensive
and has been well-honed over the last decade or two. It allows
well-designed client-side sw a lot of versatility]

You need only make the change to your prefs once. Learn to use the sw
*you* have correctly before flaming about the server. This is a
client-side issue.

There's your problem.

But Person A (really Adressee A) has requested that you reply only to
Adressese D. If you wish to overide their wishes, you can usually hold
down a modifier key while replying to overide this default behaviour
(for instance, it's the option key w/Eudora(Mac)).

The SMTP address scheme, although not perfect, is well suited to deal
with situations such as this mailing list. I find that the extropy list
is managed quite well, all things considered. 

tschau,

Actually, I wasn't saying this, as I know you understood.  To reiterate, I
find a real rational value in extending a culture of benevolence and, in most
cases (see below), that the most rational and moral way to do this is to look
for the most efficient means of achieving the end of extending benevolence.

Actually, it's impossible to segregate the two inquiries and attempts to do so
in the past have failed miserably by paying too little heed to moral questions
on the one hand or economic realities on the other.

Of course, the problem here is political.  Most third world countries are
dominated by corrupt, centralized tyrannies.  A bunch of idealistic first-
world liberal democrats really managing development projects is the last thing
such tyrants want.  On the other hand, they probably instinctively sense the
ultimate futility and ineffectiveness of isolated donations of manual labor,
and therefore are more willing to allow the occasional case of sunburn in such
instances.

Here I think you have a very valuable point.  First-worlders who gain no
experience of manual labor or poverty miss a lot: Direct personal experience
of such things gives one a lot of perspective (and a few handy skills) in
later life.  I may be prejudiced, since I spent a few years in this way when I
was younger and feel richer for it now.  Thus, I'm not contending that
spending some time pounding nails in Ecuador is a completely wasteful thing, I
just don't believe that in most instances such efforts have much real effect
on the worthwhile targets of philanthropy and benevolence involved.

So if one company has more money than the others, it should be
allowed to charge less than cost for it's product? Doesn't this
leads to a situation where, in order to compete in the short run,
other companies are forced to do the same or lose customers?
Wouldn't that just mean that the company with the most money to burn
at the start of this cycle will probably last longest? And after the
other competitors starve, the consumers are left with fewer choices
in the long run. And that sucks - monocultures are prone to atrophy
and catastrophic failure.

Most "Americans" get all bent out of shape when businesses of
another state (like Japan) try this trick on "us". Why should we
allow it within our own market system?

I'm not for excessive gubbamint regulation, but likewise, I wouldn't
be in favor of any completely unregulated market scheme which didn't
serve the ultimate interests of *individual humans* (ie consumers
and business people, not just the few richest businesses). I believe
that the goal of any market system should be to get the maximum
sustainable level of individual economic freedom and power for
*humans*, not corporations.

I'd love to have you describe a method for avoiding this type of
positive feedback trap without any type of regulatory intervention,
and change my mind.

tschau,
  jeff

There is historic evidence to indicate that advancing technology, 
social economies of scale, etc. have a long-term average effect of 
causing deflation in the price of goods, relative to the price of 
basic labor, at about 2% per year.  I don't know of any studies of 
whether this has increased in, say, the last century in the 
industrialized world.

If my competitor is selling at a loss, I need to maintain enough of a 
presence in the market that people don't forget about me; and I need 
to keep up my *capacity* for production.  But it's an excellent time 
to improve my *quality* and my *cost effectiveness*, because if some 
of that capacity is temporarily shut down for renovation it's no big 
problem: I *expect* my sales to temporarily drop.

When my now-weaker competitor ceases to sell at a loss, I will be 
able to sell superior product (as compared to my own previous 
product) at a lower price (as compared to my own previous price), 
while keeping a larger profit margin.  This puts me in an excellent 
position to not only regain my former market share, but to take away 
market share from the company that voluntarily weakened itself.

The only question is: do I have the reserves to survive the slow 
period -- or, failing that, can I convince bankers and venture 
capitalists to provide those reserves?  Most likely this will be a 
*lot* easier if I can convince them that my competitor is indeed 
selling at a loss.

The long run is precisely why this sort of predatory pricing doesn't 
work.

Suppose that a company manages, by selling at a loss, to become a 
monopoly (it has never happened, but let's suppose).  This is only 
beneficial if it can make up that loss through later extraordinary 
profits -- which creates a prime opportunity for some upstart to 
invade that market, breaking the monopoly.  And the "upstart" need 
only be an upstart in that particular industry -- it could be a truly 
huge pre-existing company in some other industry.

Fortunately, they don't survive without government intervention to 
prevent capitalism.

The better question is, why should we get all bent out of shape when 
another country does it?

Let's take a look at what Japan actually managed to do to the US, and 
for itself, by one of these alleged tricks.

Reportedly, Japan was selling RAM at a loss, government subsidized, 
in order to take over the semiconductor business.  And you read 
reports that Japan managed to force all US companies out of the 
commodity RAM business.

The truth is that Japan has yet to surpass the United States in terms 
of total RAM capacity produced.  IBM's US production for its own use 
has always been more by itself than any two Japanese manufacturers' 
total output.

What Japan forced a bunch of US companies to do, was to stop 
producing RAM for the wholesale market.  But those companies did not 
shut down their production facilities -- they diverted the facilities 
to more valuable processes, increasing their profitability.

Japan lost a bunch of money in this effort, and then discovered a 
few problems with their plan: (1) knowing how to make RAM chips with 
the old technology didn't help much on creating or using new 
technology; (2) the US companies hadn't been making much money on RAM 
chips anyway; (3) Korea and other countries with low labor costs 
(which Japan doesn't have any more) could make a *profit* selling RAM 
at the same price Japan was selling it at; (4) the core of the 
industry is the brains of chip design, not the fab plants; (5) new 
technology let US companies profitably re-enter the wholesale RAM 
business at Japan's sell-at-a-loss prices.

Remember that when Japan started this effort, RAM was selling at 
hundreds of dollars per megabyte, wholesale.  Today it sells at 
dollars per megabyte, retail.  

The damage done by Japan's exploitation of its monopoly is less than 
obvious...

No government whatsoever is a good idea, but in the meantime, we need to try to
make the burden of government more efficient and businesslike, heavily downsizing
a hugely swollen workforce. However, you are wrong in considering normal business
functions of government as income redistribution. If the government buys a bomber
or builds a dike, I am receiving a service for the portion of my tax that pays
for those items, therefore, it is an acceptable business exchange.

If my tax money goes into the government coffers, then straight back out as a
cash disbursement to a high school dropout with a drug habit and three kids, that
is income redistribution, as I get no service or product in return for that part
of my taxes. This might not be so bad if the government did not deny the same
benefits to me in the event that I found myself in dire financial straights,
however, I have tried this in the past when I was unemployed and the government
always found a loophole to deny any benefits to me, a single, white, straight,
sober, able bodied male with no dependents.

Since I have found no hope of ever being eligible to collect on the 'unemployment
insurance' which is paid in my wages (if I were still a full time employee,
instead of a contractor as I am now), I have gone the contractor route, and I
should have the legal right to discount from my taxes that portion which pays for
benefits for which I have no hope of ever receiving, or for theose services,
products or benefits for which I choose not to receive.

Notice I mentioned CHOICE. Of course, if I lived in a flood plain, I would
obviously have to be asessed fees for the construction and maintenance of the
flood protection system, as merely an insurance policy, but conversely, I should
get a guarrantee of reimbursement for damages in the event that the flood
protection system fails. Currently the government only does this if the state
Governor asks the President to declare a disaster area. If you are not in a
declared area, then the government system doesn't owe you anything, which stinks.

Any government program which spends citizens moneys should be proven to be a
strict common good that cannot be avoided (like flood protection in a flood
plain), rather than either 'bread and circuses' to keep large special interest
groups at bay (read: the poverty stricken barbarians), or programs which would
force someone to pay for a program for which they do not, have not, and never
will enjoy any measurable benefit. Forcing someone on a mountaintop to pay for
flood insurance is insanity.

If you think that the government is responsible for protecting your personal
security, you are severely misinformed. Police are only there to catch the bad
guy AFTER he has robbed, raped or killed you, not to prevent it from happening.

That most people get through life totally ignoring their currently existing
responsibility to protect themselves is testament to the fact that there are
enough people out there who do that criminals are increasingly weary of commiting
crimes, given that the large decrease in crimes in the US in the past couple of
years  is almost entirely found in states which have liberalized their
right-to-carry laws to the point that it is rather easy for law abiding citizens
to carry concealed weapons. New Hampshire, which has one of the highest per
capita gun populations in the entire world, has a lower crime rate than any
country its size or larger in europe.

New Hampshire, which has open borders with three other US states (one of which
has one of the highest crime rates in the US, btw) and a reasonably open one with
Canada, has one of the lowest crime rates in the US, has the second lowest tax
burden per capita of any state in the US,(the US having the lowest per capita tax
burden in the industrialized world). It also has one of the top public
universities (UNH) and private universities (Dartmouth College) in the US. With
no active duty military bases (it has a well staffed National Guard and Air
National Guard). We have among the highest scholastic acheivement rates of any
state in the Union, have always had an average SAT score in the top 5 states
(concurrently with being among the lowest 5 states in terms of per capita
education expenditures, go figure). NH is rated as having one of the best
business climates in the US. My hometown, Lebanon, was rated two years ago as
being the 2nd most livable small town in the US (in our snooty neighboring town,
Hanover, where Dartmouth is located, people were noted as saying "we always knew
you were second best" ;) )

Best of all, we also have the lowest unemployment rate in the US, at less than
2%.

Our state legislature is one of the largest in the world, and they are all
volunteers. They are only paid gas money.

large scale social experiments have proven to not work. The key is small steps to
try out, one at a time to see if it works or not, and slowly enough that most
people won't notice (many US socialists in power positions now utilize this
practice, especially in the gun control arena).

I don't imagine that the Dutch Government was the contractor that did the work,
was it? Since most of your country is in a flood plain (partly man-made), it is
obvious that your country is essentially what is known as a "planned community".
Its a rather large one, granted, such that it has attained sovereign status as an
independent nation, but it, at its heart, is a planned community, much like
smaller 'gated communities' that are springing up all over the US here. Its
obvious that for one to become or remain a resident of such a community, the
developers of the community are right in imposing asessments on residents, for
the cost of maintaining the community, as well as the historical capital costs.

There is a similar planned community not far from my home here in NH. It is
called Eastman, and covers most of Grafton township, as well as parts of Enfield,
Canaan, Sunapee, and New London. A private company bought all of the property
back in the late 60's, built roads, water and sewer lines, electric and phone
lines, built a combined alpine and nordic ski area, olympic pool, 18 hole golf
course, and plotted out all of the lots. There are over 10,000 homes in this
development. Owners are assesed annual fees by the Corporation, in which they are
stockholders, for the maintenance of their property as well as for maintenance
and operation of the community facilities. People have a choice of whether or not
they wish to live in this community.

Conversely, hardly anyone on earth has the ability to choose what country to be a
citizen of, and those who would prefer to not support the unproductive elements
of society have no developed nation to which to emigrate to. Thus there is a
distinct lack of choice in the matter of permitting a libertarian to decide what
larger community to which they wish to be a member.

> Can anyone think of a scenario where companies would have made something like
> the Internet? (a free-to-use-for-all utility).

Outside of ARPAnet, the entire internet here in the US does happen to have been
built independently by corporations. It has the largest bandwidth and redundancy
of any part of the internet in the world. It also has the largest growth and
commercial business transactions being conducted of any nation. This was not done
with government money.

Give every man and woman a pistol and the training to use it, and not only will
people live peacefully together, but they will be a lot more polite and freindly
about it. Gun use promotes the meme of self-reliance (which is of course the bane
of any socialist dogma).

Because our government does not subsidize dumping. Japan and China do.

Contrary to popular beleif, markets in which there are more than a few
suppliers of products which can be marketed at commodity levels are
easily non-regulated such that they produce the lowest possible cost to
the consumer.

Breaking up AT&T was not deregulation, it was anti trust. The cable
industry likewise is not deregulated, rather it is highly regulated.

I perfer the concepts of Vinge's _Conquest by Default_ in which Umpires
rule on antitrust actions to prevent 'bigness', typically seen in
organizations of more than 10,000 people. Pass this rule and no
government larger than a small town would survive antitrust action.

-------------------------------------------------
My experiments with the "BEAM-type" neural-cores, as described in Mark
Tilden's patent, that I did 2 years back convinced me that it was basically
a chaotic process that a human could read "order" into, and that the
"problems" it "solved" were merely solved *BY* the trying of randomly
selected interference with a circulating trigger pulse train in a loop of
RC delay circuits, and that any random process would tend to LOOK
"organized" if it periodically accidentally did the "right thing", whereas
when it did the "wrong thing", it simply didn't suffer as much failure,
since the chance of a robot with its legs bent backwards "ratcheting"
itself "backwards" in an "anti-progress" direction were less than going
"forward", so it "LOOKS LIKE" it's solving a "problem"! But it doesn't
maintain that rhythm once "learned", and it only happens upon it again when
it is similarly challenged. That might look "purposeful" to you, but any
ratcheting device, when shaken, will go in one direction only!! The overall
principle has "SOMETHING" to do with Complex Adaptive Systems, and they're
cute as hell, but that's about all the "robotics" *I* happen to think is
truly in the design!! And as for the photo-charging-triggering circuit, it
is really rather an old concept used in relaxation oscillators from tubes
to UJT's!! It's now cheap and feasible, but there's nothing truly new at
all technically! I would hate to call Mark Tilden and Brosl Hosslacher at
LANL charlatans, but they don't seem to have explained much, and certainly
seem to have snowed the hell out of the producers of "Robots Rising" on
the Discovery Channel, aired on last weekend and due to be aired again this
weekend, leading off with the insipid old analog vs digital chestnut which
everybody knows is a fairytale who knows electronics and set theory!! They
spouted some genuine nonsense about the complexity being Sagan's and
Sagan's of times more promising than "nasty old binary digital", when they
have no more idea how it works or how to program it than they did when they
popularized it, it sure seems to me!! I see nothing "smarter" or "newer"
in his 'Robotic Jurassic Park' than was seen several years ago. I am having
trouble figuring out why he gets paid at all to do this stuff, or for how
long he might go on fooling people, without showing us what the heck the
grant money and Nationally Owned Facilities he has been using have netted
us, the taxpayers!! Los Alamos National Labs seems to think there's promise
there, but for the life of me I don't know why they think so!! Looks like a
hobby or artform to me! Now "ALife" at Santa fe Institute looks FAR more
promising, and the show gave it short shrift as to content or explanation.
I think they figured it wouldn't "hold an audience" if it all "happened
inside a computer's mind", which isn't true at all if you've seen the
motile evolution simulations in three space fluids and on a gravitic
surface!! It came up with most LIVING forms of motility in a startlingly
small number of generations! I have it on videotape off yet ANOTHER
special probably off Discovery Channel, which, if a bit underinformed, at
least has NEW stuff ONCE in a great while!! They need some advisors to tell
them what is really worthy of a hard look and what is overblown!! So what
ELSE is new for a bunch of journalistic film majors!! It's all sci-fi to
them anyway!!

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Based on the non sequitur responses I got, I don't think my posting was
very clear.  Let me try again.  I know how to use my individual software so
as to not disrupt the List.  As a Network and Security Engineer, my
question is why we have configured this List so that every Netscape and
Eudora e-mail client has a button on their tool-bar that will disrupt this
List?  Do we really think the solution is warn all the List participants to
"never push this button"?

Netscape and Eudora mailers have toolbars that contain two reply buttons.
One button is a "Reply-to-All" button which replies to the list and to all
particpants (sender, receiver, cc'd persons) to make sure they get copies.
This keeps participants who are not on the mailing List from getting
dropped from future discussion.  The Other button is a "Reply-to-Single"
button that will only reply to the List only. This button drops
participants who are not on the mailing list from future discussion.  Both
of these buttons are available at all times, and the user can always hit
either one.  We cannot control which button a user hits to reply.  Some
people have suggested setting the "defaults" in the e-mail client, but
these defaults only set which function key calls which button.  Both
buttons are always available on the toolbar and the users who use the
buttons still have to remember which one to hit for this List.  There is no
way to restrict the software to only type of reply.

The Extropians List is set up so that only one of these Reply buttons will
work as expected with no side effects.  The user cannot choose what kind of
reply to use.  Only one button will produce a single posting, whereas the
other button will trigger a cascade of duplicate postings for any followups
to the message.   Control for who should be included in the reply is
restricted by the centralized List software and is not left to the user.
The centralized List software requires specific choices from the end user
if it is to function correctly.  If the end user makes the wrong choices,
the entire List will suffer the disruptions in future posts.  The reason
for this is that this List advertises itself in the headers as being two
"extropians" lists, one at "extropy.com" and one at "extropy.org".  When a
user tries to Reply-to-All, they send copies to both of these Lists, which
both go to the same destination.

Other Lists are setup in a way that either Reply button will work as
expected with no side effects.  The user can choose what kind of reply to
use.  Both buttons work, and the List always gets one and only one posting.
Control for who should be included in the reply is left to the user.  The
centralized List software does not require any specific choices for the end
user.  The reason for this is that most lists have a single name only.
They are only listed under one name in the headers, so there is one and
only one reply to the List in any case.

Do we desire to be set up so only one Reply button will work?  Is there a
reason why we don't want this List set up like other Lists so that either
button will work?  Do we want to make the user's choice not disruptive in
either case?  Or do we want to allow every List participant to have a
button on their desktop that can disrupt the List on every single message?

Do the benefits of calling this List both "extropians@extropy.com" and
"extropians@extropy.org" outweigh the annoyance of the duplicate messages?

the reason why this is happening is NOT because you are responding to all
participants, but because you have your reader set to send duplicates back to
yourself. In the case of the list, your mail reader is taking the TO: line as
you and sending it to the TO: individual, which is also the list. you need to
not send duplicates back to your self.

NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex.
NSPIC consists of pemes (political memes) plus the

"Terrorcrat" = terrorist bureaucrat or coercive political
agent -- usually written "terrocrat."  Phobocrat is used
in the same sense.

This is a great contribution to understanding why so
many freedom lovers support the terrocrats at the
most fundamental or semantic level.  Peme Rule 19:
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary
peme purveyors) communicate -- although
they may question, attack, and expose a
few surface pemes -- they shall make a
special effort to use deep pemes in their
language -- in order to maximize peme
survival and propagation."

The word "government" is one of the most pernicious deep
pemes.  The falsely-called "constitution" is a fraud, hoax,
and sham.  The hucksters who masquerade as "president,"
"congressmen," etc. are liars and imposters.  The false
notion that these terrocrats constitute "the government"
is central to NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion
Complex.  To habitually call these phobocrats "government"
(using the word as if valid) is a lie, a gross and harmful
misrepresentation of reality.

To use the word "government" as if valid, is to conceal
the fact that the entire "political system" is a hoax,
fraud, and sham.  It's a form of identifying with the
terrocrats.

The power of terrocrats depends most fundamentally on
words such as "constitution," "government," "state,"
etc. not being challenged, i.e., using them as if valid.

(Caveat: Most people operate at a level such that it's
not appropriate to challenge the terrocrat lexicon in
their presence -- they'll simply think you're crazy
and you'll lose your audience.  Great care needs to
be taken to challenge basic terrocrat words (deep
pemes) when it's appropriate to do so.)

Report '#TL50C: Bought-Into-The-System' expands on
several issues relevant to this topic.  Interestingly,
it includes a section on "Identifying with the Enemy"

>- Basic: billge's beloved language

If this was true, we should have a decent, *compiling* BASIC by now.
BASIC is very important for computers, because it allows semi-programmers to
write little programs for everyday work without having to dig into tons of
manuals. I learned BASIC at the age of 8 without any handbook or
introduction, just by looking at examples. That doesn't mean that I'm an
especially bright guy, but that BASIC is suitable for anyone, even kids can
learn it. Actually, we'd need a more simplified, natural-language-like and
object-oriented compilable version of BASIC bundled with every PC. Visual
Basic is absolute crap [TM] -- needs runtimes, is incredibly slow and you
can't even write a Breakout Clone with it.

There need to be two main program languages for any system: One for the very
beginners, but still very powerful and performant. Just a reduced
instruction set and a more human-oriented way of semantic representation.
Another one for the bigger projects, but even this language should be easy
to learn and to handle. I know of no language suitable for either purpose on
today's operating systems. The BASICs we have are ridiculous -- I can do far
more with DOS' Power Basic -- and C++ is hardly readable and hard to learn.
Anyway, BASIC certainly does not deserve it to be treated with three words.
It *is* useful, only Bill's version of it isn't.

>- Java: the ucsd-p of the 90's

Besides the P-Machine I do not see many parallels here. Java is, AFAIK, more
object-oriented, gives more possibilities to program UIs and has now decent
database support, too.

It's the most popular language, but that doesn't make it the ideal one. I
don't know enough about Esperanto to like it, but as I dig into Japanese, I
find that it offers many advantages to other languages, with the drawback of
unnecessary politeness verbs. (It is, in many aspects, more simple than
English, you don't have to worry about pronouns so much.) It would be nice
to have a language which also represents a more liberal worldview towards
things. For example, I actually see little purpose in diferring between man
and woman. Some Newspeak, anyone?

It sometimes changes the meaning the author
wishes to convey.  In the context of the
peme debate, it often indicates that the
author questions, challenges, or rejects
the validity of the word.  For example,
*so-called "constitution"* and *falsely-called
"government"* indicate that the author regards
"constitution" and "government" as bogus words.

Before I formulated the Peme Conflict Principle,
I would have said the word "property" is probably
not a deep peme.  Now I say it probably is.  It's
a dividing concept many people polarize themselves
around, particularly at the ideological extremes.
Peme Rule 4: "Pemes shall divide humans into
opposing and conflicting political and economic
factions -- such as "conservative"/"liberal,"
"capitalist"/"socialist," and "statist"/"anarchist"
-- who shall endlessly argue, fight, and even kill...
in the name of pemes."

On some lists there have been long and sometimes
acrimonious arguments over "property" -- with no
useful resolution that I know of.

A useful question might be: If "property" were a
deep peme in people's brains, what would it make
them say?

The "Scarcity" Meta-Meme
------------------------

During most of our evolutionary past, our ancestors
experienced scarcity of the wherewithal to survive.
In nature, scarcity seems to be the rule.  Many of
our ancestors starved to death.

I suspect that practically every human has a very
deep and very strong "scarcity instinct."  It's
as if we view the world through "scarcity glasses."
Wherever we look, we see "scarcity."

I call "scarcity" a meta-meme because it tends to be
so pervasive -- we tend to see *everything* as "scarce."
It's a toxic meta-meme.

Historically, the best fighters for and defenders of
resources ("property") tended to be the best survivors.
So it's highly likely that most of us have a very
strong and very deep "instinct" to fight for and over
"property."  It also tends to be pervasive -- we tend
to see the world as pieces of "property" to fight for
or over.

Fighting for/over "property" is likewise a toxic
meta-meme.

These two meta-memes probably combine with the
"property" meme to form a deep peme best called
"scarcity-property-fight."

We need to clear it from our minds.

I would classify the concept of property as a sexual/reproductive instinct.
Even animals build their nests and defend their territories. That phobocrats
use this instinct to serve their own ends with the pemes they build
indicates its power as probably a primary human instinct.

And since even animals understand the concept of property, what does it say
inside an animals brain?

I would imagine that as soon as women started using sex as a commodity and
men started using women as property, phobocrats began to take power by
manipulating this market tension.

Mr. Mann speak her against his own words: "We have to use our
minds to expand in a way that could snowballs. We could acti-
vate the minds of others into becoming more potent freedom
weapons." Why should we do this if we are really free and so-
vereign *by nature*, irrespective of the freedom and sovereig-
nty of others and if we can live as a free sovereign -- irres-
pective of the unfree masses who haven't yet discovered they're
free and sovereign?! If we can live as free sovereigns without
others -- why to hell should we activate other minds into more
potent freedom weapons?!!

And on the other hand:
Who is my freedom and sovereignity by nature if I live in a
poor country with 50% unenployment, a high inflation, no industry
and 150 $ annual salary average per inhabitant?! Who is my free-
dom and sovereignity by nature if I am very poor and hungry?!
Who to hell is my freedom and sovereignity by nature if I don't
find solvent customers for my service in a backward country?!

I didn't say that "freedom is indivisible" -- but we have to accept
that the system isn't only a spiritual phenomenon; it's a fallacy
that the system havn't no negative practical economic effects. To
free humans from 'peme' programs as the only simple way to give
everybody a chance to discover they're free and sovereign is a
midlle class dream in industrial countries. If we should activate
our freedom and sovereignity by nature irrespective of others than
we need a developt economy like the industrial nations and last but
not least a access to the internet -- and this isn't for 80% of
humans on earth a option.


Sincerely
N. MYOWNA

  IAN: You have failed to show a single

  therefore, proclaiming a separation between 
  identity and description is just a distraction.

  Until a unit of atomized identity can be shown 
  to exist, your asking us to separate belief from
  evidence, which is antithetical to the rational.

  IAN: What I say is either true or false.

  what I say with any verifiable evidence,  you

  I believe that "identity" can be loosely defined 
  as "what a thing is," and I believe that this fits 
  both my analysis of identity and the traditional use
  of the term "identity." So your effort to remove the
  term "identity" from the scope of my analysis fails.

Actually, Brazil has been in an excellent position to leap to great power
status for a long time. They have occasionally had a more powerful navy
than the Soviet Union did at the height of its power. They have an
excellent resource base, and are almost as large in area as the US (bigger
if you don't count Alaska). What has held them back is the aristocratic
plantation system that ruled for so long there (you will note that the
similar system in the Southern US likewise had a similar retardent effect
on industrial development)

Don't forget that some languages have masculine, feminine, and 
neuter.  In German, for example, a teenage girl is neuter (obviously 
invented by a father with a good imagination and not much contact 
with reality).

Scarcity means nothing more in economics than "there isn't enough of 
everything for everyone to always have all they want."

I doubt that this situation derives from our expecting it to exist.

Into your considerations here, please factor in two other pre-human, 
um, concepts:

(1) if using it will benefit me, use it

(2) don't foul your own nest.

And the low crime rate is due to... which of these parameters?  

Do NH teachers force their students to study at the point of a gun?  Do NH
workers negotiate their jobs at the point of a gun?  

Or is violent crime elsewhere perhaps correlated with other factors that
also damage education and employment rates, creating a vicious cycle?

  Holism does help us to predict things.

  predictable IF holism had been a more

  IAN: I think not, the fact that there
  is so much belief/resistance to the 
  idea that the identity of A is derived
  from the A/~A relation, not A alone
  (which you seem to agree with), is
  the measure of the fact that to argue
  against the contrary is not hollow.
  It seems to mean that people have 
  mistaken the A=A symbology for truth.

  I think it's inherently not hollow 
  to argue against a popular fallacy.

  IAN: I hear what your saying and I think 
  you've articulated it well, however, before
  we can get to profits from logical analysis 
  we have to get to truths. I think that the
  goal of inquiry is to arrive at truths, how
  ever unprofitable they may seem by them-
  selves. If I find that popular belief holds 
  to an idea about truth that, as you said, a 
  twelve-year-old child can see through, then 
  that belief should and must be challenged. 

  I believe that if profit is held as the 
  ideal of wether X is "useful" or "good,"
  we're really selling ourself short. There's
  much more to life than profits. I guess you 
  see profit as a prime directive, while I see
  "to know the truth" as a prime directive.
  I think that the two can be harmonious.

Actually, it _does_ include a role for lawyers ["full legal assistance but only 
limited appeal possibilities,"] although they would be less powerful than
they are now, just like most of the other members of the justice system. 
If one would be accused of a crime, he could hire as many people to *prove
his innocence* as he pleased/could afford. The role of the lawyer would
in fact be streamlined: he must present sufficient hard evidence to prove
that his client didn't commit the crime(s) he's been accused of. No more,
no less. Technicalities no longer influence the trial, but are settled in an 
independent one. False accusations, fabrication/destruction of evidence,  
shall be punished severely (perhaps so that the false witness [etc.] 
recieves the punishment that the falsely accused would have recieved
had he been convicted).

Human judges would still have a place in this system as controllers of the 
computers' verdict (other controllers are the defendant and his defense team 
or designated others) which is a simple summing up of the known facts
with a recommendation (xx% chance that guilty of crime xx resulting in
punishment no. xx). This system should work fairly well in all documented
cases (audio/video surveillance), which should be more numerous than
they are now due to a much more extensive surveillance network, and 
endorsement of personal cams/microphones worn on the body, in the
house, tracking devices on/in body and on property items etc.) In non-
documented cases things like (DNA) fingerprinting and other forensic
techniques can be extremely useful, and often the criminal confesses
spontaneously when faced with this kind of evidence. Furthermore there
are lie detectors that, although still not too reliable, have an intimidating
effect on all but the toughest suspects, again resulting in "spontaneous"
confessions (just confessing isn't enough of course; details of the crime
and things like the location of the body/stolen goods have to be revealed
in order to sentence someone). 

The above is basically a process of ellimination: only a small fraction of
cases* remain "unclear" after the cams, forensics and firm questioning
have had their way. Apart from ongoing investigation (if someone can't
be convicted within a reasonable amount of time [a couple of weeks or 
so] he is neither convicted nor aquitted, but simply sent home while the
investigation continues. The suspect will be fully monitored while "free",
since there is a good chance that he'll try to cover up evidence or 
otherwise incriminate himself. Threatening witnesses, bragging about 
the crime etc. also make one elegible for re-arrest and hard questioning.
This means causing physical/mental nonlethal/not permanently damaging
discomfort the suspect in order to extract a detailed confession (no
words shall be put in the suspect's mouth, and a confession alone 
can't convict; details only known to the murderer/thief etc. must be
forthcoming). The questioning is done under strict supervision of medical
and legal experts and the suspect's attorney(s) and the whole session is
taped in order to prevent fraud, and to serve as evidence in case of
a detailed confession. Should it become clear that the suspect is in
fact innocent, a reasonable financial compensation shall be forthcoming).

The whole investigation trial is conducted in secrecy (but well monitored
of course) so that the reputation of the suspect suffers minimal damage
in case he's found innocent. Breaking the code of secrecy is punishable
by fines, a large part of which goes to the victim (suspect).

*[note: crime rates would be down considerably due
to decriminalization of victimless crimes like drug abuse, gambling,
prostitution etc. so that the police and justice system could focus all their 
manpower on the real crimes]

They would be pushed back further and further (from the shop to the street, from
the street to the alley, from the alley to woods etc.) and many crimes would
become impossible (to get away with) in the process. Wherever crime moves
to, surveillance follows (be it private or state-controlled). Many crimes are
location-bound (like robbing banks and stores) or impulsive (beatings by
gangs etc.) and would be wiped out in a well-monitored environment like a
city. Old people could walk the streets again at night, and shop keepers
could focus on business once again. Sooner or later one could even let
one's wallet lie unguarded in a restaurant or leave one's door unlocked.

The places where standard cameras and microphones can't reach could
be covered with surveillance (high resolution) sattelites, personal motion
trackers, guns with auto-activated minicams (the right to keep and bear
arms would further reduce crime, especially rape etc.) You never know
who's watching, a great deterrent in itself.

Then those zones shall be covered too, until none are left. Also one could 
determine a suspect's location at the time of the crime by a process of
ellimination ("where were you then at monday the 15th at 4.30 p.m., if you 
weren't at home killing your wife?" --"I was shopping in xx" -- "O.k, we'll check 
that right away - oh, by the way: the streetcams in your neigborhood have 
registered you at at 4.37 p.m. leaving your house in an apparent hurry")

An intesting idea. Especially if several prevention/marking/detection etc. systems
are combined this should increase safety considerably.

With ever smaller and cheaper surveillance devices (almost) total coverage
could be achieved within a couple of decades or so. Even if you can't
cover it all, you can still cover _a lot_, preventing and solving a lot of
crimes in the process. If you can reduce crime in certain locations with
even as little as 10% (50% would be more likely with (95%+ a real possibility)
I'd say it's been worth the effort!

I would hate to see this kind of power in the hands of any present government.
Transparency is only desirable if the justice system is reasonable, i.e. "anything
goes as long as you don't damage others _without their consent"_. (otherwise
you'd have to outlaw things like S&M ;-) Also, society as a whole would have to
be re-educated (through the usual channels like CNN, tabloids, soaps & movies)
to condemn only really damaging behaviour instead of harmless recreation.
After all, we don't want transparency in the hands of religious fundi's: the
Inquisition
with the power of virtual omnipresence, perish the thought! :-(

I am not the person duplicating postings on this list.  I was merely
commenting upon the same duplicate postings that you commented about
earlier.  I do not have my reader set to send duplicates back to myself
or anybody else.  You are diagnosing a problem in my software that I am
not having.

But, I can see how your scenario would cause duplicate postings. 
Anybody with their mailer set up in the manner you describe would indeed
send duplicate postings to the list.  I had not thought of your
scenario, and it certainly could explain some of the duplicates.  I am
describing a second and entirely different scenario.  This second
scenario is definitely happening for some of the duplicates I have been
seeing.  There may be multiple possible causes for duplicate postings.

Selecting "Reply-To-All" to a posting sent through
"extropians@extropy.ORG" will definitely result in duplicate postings.
Selecting "Reply-To-All" to a posting sent to "extropians@extropy.COM"
will not result in duplicate postings.

Instead of questioning, here is how to test it for yourself:

To confirm duplicate postings through extropians@extropy.ORG:
1.  Send e-mail to extropians@extropy.ORG
2.  Your e-mail should have "To: extropians@extropy.ORG", just one

4.  All participants on the list will see a single posting with headers
referencing both e-mail addresses for this list
5.  Do a "Reply-to-All" on this posting, and you should reply to BOTH
addresses
6.  Your e-mailer should say "To: extropians@extropy.ORG,

7.  The list software will receive e-mail to each address
8.  The list software forwards both of these addresses to the same List
9.  All participants on the list will see two postings, one "To:

10. Flame war about duplicate postings starts

To confirm nonduplicate postings through extropians@extropy.COM:
1.  Send e-mail to extropians@extropy.COM
2.  Your e-mail should have "To: extropians@extropy.COM", just one

One case against Pinker's 'explanations' of How the
Mind Works is made in a London debate from January
between Pinker and neurobiologist Steven Rose which
is transcribed at
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker_rose/pinker_rose_p1.html

The essence of Rose's claim is: "The mistake that
evolutionary psychology makes in this reverse
engineering discussion is constantly to mistake
metaphor and analogy for homology, and draw what I
regard as both horrendous scientific and horrendous
political conclusions from it.... Human life, human
society, is much much richer than these travesties.
And I do insist that what you [Pinker] offer is a
Flintstone type travesty of life today."

Rose also refers to many of these reverse engineering
conclusions as "Just-So Stories".

I think Pinker's most useful contribution is the
"organs of computation" notion itself.  As Pinker put
it in his 9701 interview with John Brockman at
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker/pinker_p3.html

"I also believe that the mind is not made of Spam -
it has a complex, heterogeneous structure. It is
composed of mental organs that are specialized to do
different things ... That puts me in agreement with
Chomsky and against many neural network modelers, who
hope that a single kind of neural network, if
suitably trained, can accomplish every mental feat
that we do." 

While this is somewhat of a 'strawman', it's still a
useful point to keep in mind.  As Pinker puts it in
the 9801 debate with Rose: "My approach is most
definitely not reductionist in the bad sense of
trying to explain everything in terms of the smallest
units of analysis".

However, "organs of COGNITION" might be a better term
because many psychologists and biologists would
dispute that what the brain does is anything like
computation.  Pinker acknowledges this, but he still
insists that the brain creates 'representations' of
the outside world.  There is, however, MUCH dispute
about this claim. (Psyche-D archives are FULL of this
subject).

I also find that Pinker is fairly arrogant when he
declares: "I find it hard to escape the feeling that
much of Professor Rose's approach just REDESCRIBES
standard biology with new jargon: words like
'autopoiesis' and 'homeodynamics' and
'self-construction'".  This is NOT 'new' jargon. 
Maturana & Varela's  theory of autopoiesis has been
around since the 60's and grew out of the cybernetics
work from much earlier, particularly by Heinz von
Foerster at the University of Illinois Biological
Computing Lab.  As Steven Rose claims, these theories
offer "a deeper and a richer materialism than Steve
[Pinker] is in his account.  It's a materialism that
takes account of dynamism, and isn't statically
frozen in the past".

Besides the recent Rose debate, there are many other
responses to Pinker available online at
http://www.edge.org/discourse/index.cgi?OPTION=VIEW&THREAD=steven-pinker/1-15-97/talk

In the final comments there, Arnold Trehub concludes:
"Steven Pinker and Steven Quartz (together with
Terrence Sejnowski) [Radical Constructivism] have
staked their opposing claims near the extremes of the
nature-nurture continuum.... But I wonder how soundly
each of them can argue against the more credible view
that *innate domain-specific brain mechanisms* and
*learning-dependent brain structures* are *together
indespensible* for the creation of the mature human
mind."

Some may complain about the quality of much stuff
posted on the Web; but, I'm more concerned when
people want to learn about a subject outside of their
profession and just pick one or two books by a few
notable authors and base most of their conclusions on
those.  Thus, by relying on, for example, the
Extropian reading list, one could end up being
familiar with Richard Dawkins, Paul Churchland, and,
now, Steven Pinker, without being aware that these
researchers are considered to lie at extreme ends of
the spectrum by many other researchers in their
respective fields.

When will computer hardware match the human brain?
Hans Moravec
Journal of Transhumanism. 1998. Vol. 1
(Received Dec. 1997)

ABSTRACT
This paper describes how the performance of AI machines tends to
improve at the same pace that AI researchers get access to faster
hardware. The processing power and memory capacity necessary to match
general intellectual performance of the human brain are estimated.
Based on extrapolation of past trends and on examination of
technologies under development, it is predicted that the required
hardware will be available in cheap machines in the 2020s.

In my model, colonization without property rights happens at the fastest 
possible speed, so if property rights had any effect it would be to 
reduce the speed of colonization.  So if any "sooners" slipped ahead
of the colonization wave, the cost to catch them becomes roughly 
exponential in how far ahead they slipped.

You'd need to stigmatize all probes which couldn't verify their ancestry
at legit oases.  And if they stayed ahead of the wave of property folks, 
they may not care about the stigma.

This might make it easier to enforce property rights within a region,
but regions should still fear falling too far behind competing neighboring 
regions.  So a pressure for maximum speed still seems to apply.

The nice thing about the no-property-rights analysis is that
behavior and values can be predicted purely from a selection effect. 
If property rights can change behavior, behavior should be based on actor
values, that I'm not sure how to predict.

OK, I pulled the book off my shelf and figure 1.1 (p.8) shows the number of 
scientific journals doubling every 15 years since ~1730.  On p. 5, the author says:

"Now depending on what one measures and how, the crude size of science in manpower
or in publications tend to double within a period of 10 to 15 years.  The 10-year 
period emerges from those catchall measures that do not distinguish low-grade work
from high but adopt a basic minimal definition of science; the 15-year period 
resultswhen one is more selective, counting only somed more stringent definition 
of publishedscientific work and those who produce it.  If this stringency is 
increased so that onlyscientific work of very high quality is counted, then the 
doubling period is drawn out so that it approaches about 20 years."

He then lists a bunch of assorted measures and their doubling times. 

The book is: Derek J. de Solla Price, "Little Science, Big Science, and Beyond", 
published in 1966.

I have a long-term goal of biological/physical immortality.
The greatest hindrance to BI, in my opinion, comes from
*coercive political thought and behavior*.  To reduce the
risk of being killed by coercive political people, it's
in my interest to do something about it.

I'm in the process of tracking down the most basic causes
of coercive political behavior, and developing the means
to communicate about this effectively.

For me there are five elements here:
1. Discovering you're free and sovereign;
2. Developing the practical skills, etc. to live
prosperously as a free sovereign;
3. Assisting others to do 1 and 2;
4. Reducing the risk of others violating your freedom and
sovereignty.
5. Achieving BI.

In practically every poverty-stricken part of the
world some people become wealthy.  You could also
move to another part of the world.  If this seems
difficult, you could work on a ship, and "jump
ship" in some appropriate "not-so-backward" part
of the world.

Then there are all the things you can do via
computers/Internet that are not location dependent.
You can find solvent customers in other parts
of the world.  (All the above is easy for me
to say because I've done it!)

In my opinion, coercive political bahvior tends
to have devastating economic consequences for
the vast majority of people.  Nevertheless, I
believe individuals can rise above bad economic
circumstances.

Much more is necessary than clearing out peme
programs.  See Report '#TL05B: FREEDOM STEPS'

Untrue. Most of the universities that are part of the Internet were
not part of the original ARPANet project. Neither are the many thousands
of privately-owned servers that still make up a large minority of
internet sites. Corporate (ie commercial) sites have a higher
profile, but are have not been as intergral as the aforementioned
parties. Most new hosts are still placed on the Net via academia.

Although this may too often end up being the case, it is not what
law enforcement officials would claim. Real mileage may vary, but
their stated aims almost always include crime *prevention*. They
spend a lot of time (and money) talking/training/etc about it.

>New Hampshire, which has open borders with three other US states
>(one of which has one of the highest crime rates in the US, btw)

I love New Hampshire, but if New Hampshirites have a failing, it's
that they love to slam the Commonwealth, usually for the wrong
reasons. The 1995 census says that MA is ranked 15th in violent
crime. One third of the way down hardly qualifies as "one of the
highest". In fact MA's *rate* is almost exactly the National average
(685 per 100K). And MA's rate is dropping faster than NH's (which
admittedly, doesn't have as far to go).

tschau,

Don't tell me. The German expression for "girl", "Maedchen", is indeed
neuter. Just one of many examples for repression of female sexuality even in
language.

Where does the "wo" in "woman" actually come from?

Huh? If they gave me that gift in order that other people would not
be in a position to give me any gifts in the future, I guess I
would. But that's the point - a single enlightened consumer is still
at a disadvantage when dealing with disengenuous practices like this
- I may not fall for it, you may not fall for it, but if most folks
fall for the trick, it's been played on you and me as well.

How do you manage to maintain any of those things when you have no
money coming in? How do you pay rent on your facilities or pay your
engineers to design you that better, cheaper widget? If you and Mr.
Money-bags have similar factories, and they each cost $1M a month to
run, and you have $6M reserves, and he has $60M, and he dumps his
widgets on the market at a loss price that no short-term increase in
productivity can match - you will run out of money quickly. He can
sacrifice $10M so that you go out of business, and he now has the
total market and makes up his losses in a year or two. Your improved
widget that was slated for next year will never make it to market,
not because you didn't run a tight ship, or pay your workers enough,
or have a good product, but simply because your competitor dumped.
Mr. Bags will continue to sell his old-style, inefficient widget to
a mostly unknowing market.

Happens with OSes all the time.

Why? Why would they care? If he has 50% share now, but by dumping
can get 100% soon, why wouldn't some VCs and bankers just side with
him? Maybe you get some VC/bank money too, but this just prolongs
the game, it doesn't modify the strategy in any real sense. And by
the way, you don't get loans from venture capital firms - you sell
off pieces of your company. So soliciting VC money in a situation
like this just means you're choosing which shark will eat you.

History does not bear you out. Diamond industry is a good example.
South African Cos did the dumping strategy for many decades, forced
other big players out, then leveraged their overwhelming mkt share
into strong agreements with intl buyers. New players, even with
advantage of better tech and deep supply and *much* cheaper prices,
were unable to break into mkt, which now sells precious gems for
many multiples of their production cost. Russians got let in on the
scheme only after making it obvious that they would use *state*
power to get in on the gravy. Rather than have the whole house of
cards tumble, SAs let Russians in on the deal. Competitors without
benefit of world's second largest armed forces are not so
fortunate.

Untrue. If I sell at a 50% loss for a year, force competitors out,
and then simply keep the prices the same while my costs decrease,
it'll take me little time to make up my original losses - and I
don't have worry about mature competitors, excessive marketing, etc.
The consumers think they're getting a deal because the price has dropped
over time, but most won't realize that it's still higher than it could have
been, and they're stuck using version 1.0 when a faster, better, even
cheaper Mk II could have been to mkt in the meantime.

But when they fail, the catastrophe point is more profound.
Company stores were not protected by law, but rather enabled by the
lack of it's presence. When that system finally failed, it was
bloody and difficult - and involved *direct* and *physically
coercive* interference by the state. Having a system of law that
prevents abuses like that today has seemed to lead to more freedom
and security with *less* bloodshed.

Of course, a big reason that the Japanese companies eventually
backed off their dumping strategies was because of the trade
sanctions threatened/carried out by the US gvt. in retaliation. I'd
rather have rules of engagement that stopped the economic warfare
from escalating in this manner.

If you are stating this as a universal, then it's just not true. I
am aware of several major RAM production facilities in TX that were
shutdown, then sold and reconfigured to other industrial purposes
altogether. The line engineers went to work for other co's (TI - >
Analog, in one case that I am personally familiar with, to
Gillette(!) in another).

No, more like one hundred/meg, retail.  I was alive in the early 80s too.

>Today it sells at dollars per megabyte, retail.

How many years later than it would have been? And how much economic
disruption was caused therefrom? And there's far fewer small players
in this mkt now not because of high production costs, but because
it's generally accepted that you need deep pockets/govt help to
survive in this industry of dirty tricks. You haven't made the case
that this is an example of the market producing best outcomes by
"allowing" dumping.

So you're saying that we need to get rid of the idea of corporations
first? OK. I'd be up for that. How should we go about it?

As I said, outside of ARPAnet, which was an early network linking research centers
and universites that did research for the defense department, all of the rest of
the internet has been build independently of government. That state owned
universities have hooked up to this can cause an understandable confusion, however
just as many private universities have hooked up to the internet, and they cannot
be construed to be government owned. They may be non-profit, but they are still
corporations. The internet, however is not those academic sites, but the backbones
that interconnect them, and those back bones are decidedly NOT government owned or
operated. They are all privately owned, built by corporations with corporate money
to generate corporate profits. Likewise the ISPs that provide local internet
service are overwhelimingly privately owned, not government owned.

Being average has always been Massachusetts claim to fame and its major failing. It
has also been the major cause of immigration from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. I
was born in Massachusetts, something I typically try to not mention. The wealth of
the Commonwealth is just all too common for anybody who posesses extropian values.

And yes, If NH's crime rate were 1/10th of MA, it would be difficult for us to
improve as much as Massachusetts does, especially as we spend less than 1% of what
Massachusetts does on law enforcement,. Its a matter of diminishing returns as well
as how smartly we go about it. Funny how NH always spends far less money to get
better results at anything than tax and spend socialist states like Massachusetts.

Easy, simply stop treating corporations as 'persons' under the law, and end
much corporate liability protection (while at the same time reforming the tort
process to prevent humongous punitive awards like $175 million to two former
Texaco employees, or $6 million to a granny who spilled coffee on her lap.) If
the individuals in a corporation were severally liable for the actions they
take in the conduct of their business, then they might start acting a lot more
nicely. At the same time, I'd also stop taxing both the corporation AND its
stockholders and employees. Have one tax (having it at the corporate level
would of course be the easiest and cheapest to administer).

probably a combination of the high education and the high level of gun posession,
and ease of use as concealed weapons. Vermont is even more liberal on this, you
don't need any kind of permit at all there.

Not at all, however anyone who has had a chance to shoot guns can comment on what
an empowering experience it is. People who live lives afraid of everything,
especially guns, can go through a rather marked change once they have overcome
one big fear, like the fear of guns. I would say that the culture-wide use of
guns here generates a sort of common feeling of empowerment and self reliance.
People here take part in town meetings, school boards, and their kids
extracurricular activities, they don't just drop them off like at a baby sitter.

Hardly, most states and cities that have high crime rates had severe gun control
laws long before, when education and employment prospects in those areas was
still excellent. Employment goes down when crime rates push businesses to
relocate to places more conducive to a decent lifestyle for their workers.I am
using NH as an example of a state which is as close to a libertarian optimum as
one can currently find in the industrialized world, and how all stats indicating
a 'livable' environment seem to be far above that in any other industrialized
polity I am aware of. Various socialist sympathizers here have expressed
disbeleif that such a system could result in anything but chaos, as they have no
faith in the ability of the common man to desire to live peacefully. New
Hampshire's health and vitality is testament to the wrongness of their
assumptions and conclusions.

Hey, I happen to like neuter (not neutering!), so I'm feeling a little
germanly repressed myself!  Give me a break, you could equally argue that
girls are neuter because they transcend the distinction between male and
female.  I don't think a language represses certain groups, it just lowers
the efficiency of communication.

> Where does the "wo" in "woman" actually come from?

I always figured it was "womb" + "man", but no... it is from Old English
"wifmon", meaning "wife man."   That sounds very accurate... in many places
(and especially in ancient times) the line between men/women can be blurry,
but the only consistent difference is that a man can marry a "wifmon," and
of course, he cannot marry a regular "mon." (although rulings in Hawaii,
etc. have changed this)

Today, this would be appreciatable. At the time the German word for "girl"
became neuter, the idea of transcension was probably, if at all, interpreted
as a state of elevation to a place where angels and gods play nifty music.

The denial of female sexuality has long traces in human history. It can be
found in the Bible as well (along with lots of other bullshit). Even today,
there are religous groups which claim that women cannot experience orgasm.
Therefore, the explanation that the neuter form of "girl" was a repression
of female sexuality seems much more likely than that it was originated to
the meme that women will "transcend" first.

>I don't think a language represses certain groups, it just lowers
>the efficiency of communication.

If Hitler had forbidden the word Jew and proclaimed that all Jews have to be
called "swindlers", wouldn't you say this would be a repression of Jews
through language?

Girls transcend the distinction how?

I think I've read that Old English originally had another word meaning 'male
humans' and that 'man' was originally restricted to its inclusive sense, like
andros and gynos vs. anthropos in Greek.  Can anyone confirm this?  I find
that 'Man' and 'Mankind' work much better in poetry than 'human' and
'humanity', and would rather record a word for 'male human' rather than change
the species-word.  This would also save 'chairman' and the like.

 I read about 150 pages of "How the Mind Works". While it is a good
introduction for people new to the subjects it covers, I lost interest
because I found nothing new in it.
 Here's a something related that I wrote elsewhere in a discussion
of Matt Ridley's book "The Origins of Virtue", a book worth reading:

 lcorbin@netcom.com (Lee Corbin) writes:

 Condemning altruism never made much sense, due to the large number of
actions that can be justified by either selfish or altruistic arguments,
and because praising altruism seems to be evolved into human nature.
I see nothing wrong with encouraging altruism. What we need to attack
is the assumption that altruism is a reliable motivator, and it's
probably better to focus on important instances such as property rights
versus the tragedy of the commons than to argue about more abstract ideas.

I think you are taking this wrong. I see it as a girl being pretty much like a
young boy in childhood, then transcending through a 'neuter' state, to becoming
a woman. SO if you consider that the only difference between men and boys is the
size of their toys, well, then, women have already moved beyond that.....

If you are referring to nit-picky things like the gender of "girl", then
this may be a problem of translation from Hebrew.  If you are referring to
the global statements the Bible makes about the role of women, etc.., then
it's hard to disagree with you.

Maybe a religious justification for a personal inadequacy? ;-)

"If God meant you to have an orgasm you would."

Who cares about why it was created?(even asking this question implies some
sort of creator, which seems unlikely to me, unles you think your language
was engineered)  What is important is how it is used.  Do people really
consider girls genderless simply because their noun is neuter?

No.  Does calling a homosexual "gay" make you think all homosexuals are
happy?  Hitler has simply changed the word for Jewish, the only repression
he has done affects everybody: no one can say "Jewish."    A similar
situation has happened with native indians:
Indian->native->aboriginal->First Nations.  None of these name changes
repression in the slightest.  Did you feel differently towards natives when
the politically correct(which has a similar sway to Hitler) word changed
from aboriginal to First Nations?  I should hope not, the only thing I
thought was how ridiculous people are for thinking replacing one word with
another will change it's meaning.  I should also hope that changing the
name for Jewish to "swindler" will not turn non-racist into a racist. Maybe
you think that's a bad assumption, but if you do, give me a
counter-example.

I think Damien wrote this:

Ancient Greek possessed three genders:  masculine, feminine and
neuter. When the resulting Latin grammer was superimposed over the
Germanic roots of early English a few centuries ago, these three
genders passed into English but not to the extent that other
languages utilize them.  English is actually one of the more
gender-neutral languages, and is highly flexible in accomodating
non-gendered discourse.  The word that you are trying to remember
probably came from a Germanic or Icelandic language, because Old
English vocabulary bore a closer resemblance to the root languages,
both in form and pronunciation, and most of our 'household words'
(words that refer to practical objects) entered the language through
repeated invasion by Germanic and Icelandic tribes.  But 'man' as a
word did not enter the English language until the Middle English
period, and I can find no evidence that it was restricted to the
inclusive 'human'.  It actually had four or five meanings, many of 
which you will find in Shakespeare.

I myself prefer to utilize the word 'human', as it precisely shows
what stage of evolutionary development I am talking about:  Human,
transhuman, posthuman.

Prove  his innocence? In the USA about 40,000 murders are committed each year,

Yes they are intimidating, to the innocent as well as the guilty. I would  
agree to have a lie detector test only if I was guilty and about to be 
convicted.  I've read a little about them and I think I'd have a better than 
50% chance of beating the machine, unless of course the operator didn't like

You say you didn't murder anybody but I suspect you may have, so like a good  
policeman I bring you in for some hard questioning. After I pull your third 
fingernail off by the roots with a pair of pliers your demeanor changes and  
you insist that I was absolutely correct in every respect and that you did 
indeed commit the crime in question, however information about the deed that 
only the murderer would know is not forthcoming.  After I pull off all ten of 
your fingernails your claims of being a killer of the vilest sort are even 
more vigorous, but despite my insistence that you do so you still tell me no 
details of the crime not generally known.  

What should a reasonable policeman such as myself do at this point?

1) Conclude that the reason you don't tell me the details is that you don't 
   know them, give you an apology for any inconvenience and a discount coupon  
   to the nearest nail cloning salon, thank you for being a good sport about 
   this little misunderstanding and send you home, OR

2) Conclude that you're just being stubborn and get to work on your toenails.

Since none of the more qualified linguists here have pointed
this out, I'd like to remind everyone that "das Maedchen"
(the German word for "girl", which is neuter) is not as odd
as it seems: gender belongs to the /word/, not its referent.
If the young girl were married, she would be both "die Frau"
[fem] and "das Maedchen" [neu] without contradiction, just
as in Spanish one might call the same pen "la pluma" [fem]
and "el boligrafo" [mas] without implying that the pen had
undergone a sex change.  Certain words have gender based on
their form alone: German words ending in "keit" and Spanish
words ending in "cion" are all feminine (e.g. the Spanish
"la ereccion" [fem] -- the erection).

Of course, such languages do tend to use masculine and
feminine nouns for male- and female-related concepts
respectively, so there probably is some long-forgotten
cultural reason for das Maedchen.

Unfortunately, pronouns are a problem with every major
modern language.  Traditional Chinese was one of the few
major languages in which one could write a long story
without ever revealing the gender of any character, but
the language was, alas, "modernized" in the 60s by giving
it the same gender bias as western languages.

ObLojbanPlug: Lojban, of course, has no gender-specific
pronouns at all; in fact, it has no human-specific ones
either.  One would say "ta barda" whether the large thing
you were pointing to was a man, woman, dog, or truck.

Proving your innocence is done by, for example, demonstrating that you weren't
at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder (or whatever). Only one
(or a couple in extreme cases) of all those thousands of murders is relevant
to the case -- the one that has somehow been linked to you. The rest has
nothing to do with your case, so you don't have to prove anything.

AI has nothing to do with it, these justice computers could be just a couple
of simple PCs. Justice *should* be a matter of "adding up the facts", not
"the whim of the day" of some judge. In a fair justice system one can
count on an equal treatment of all cases. The best way to do this is to
minimize the power of the human judges so that they truly speak on
behalf of the _law_, and not themselves. The central justice computer
simply presents all the facts of a particular case in a comprehensive
matter. If the points of the prosecution haven't been refuted, then the
conclusion is simple: guilty. It's basically the same system we use
today, only streamlined and with curbed human judges to prevent 
arbitrary sentencing "because he didn't like his face or whatever".
Juries are elliminated alltogether for the same reason. It's the _facts_
that count, not people's whimsical opinions.

The lie detector would only be used as a tool to add some pressure to the
questioning, and could only serve as supporting evidence, not primary evidence
that can lead to a conviction. It works because only the guilty know the
details of the crime in question (it is not allowed to give details to the media),
and only a guilty person would be nervous if the police brought him in for
questioning (because, believe it or not, this would be a pretty fair judicial
system, with *very* little chance of false convictions due to the many
safeties (monitoring of all legal personel and facilities - tough punishments for 
"bad cops" etc.) and hard evidence-based convictions (when in doubt - don't 
convict). If you can beat the lie detector that doesn't mean you can go home,
although it can be used as minor supporting evidence to your innocence.

This is a *very* cheap shot, obviously your prejudice has prevented you from
thoroughly reading the text above: "This means causing physical/mental 
NONlethal/NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGING discomfort the suspect in order 
to extract a confession". No (permanent) physical damage. So where did those 
pliers come from? The cop who did that would be immediately removed from his job
and be paying damages to the victim.

[substitute pulling fingernails for something else, like dripping water on
forehead -- doesn't leave a mark and is extremely effective. Tickling the
soles of the feet, funny as it may sound, apparently works pretty well too.]

If after a predetermined amount of time (the docters must see to it that the
questioning isn't overdone) no details are forthcoming the prisoner might
either be set free (and secretly monitored in case he incriminates himself
by re-burying bodies or bragging to friends etc.) or remain in custody for
later questioning. This depends on his physical/mental fitness, seriousness
of the crime etc. There is a clear limit to this process (say a week or two).
If there still are no results the suspect is released (and monitored) while
the police re-evaluate the case.

I've made my case against slander earlier, so it should suffice to say that
the slanderer should _prove beyond reasonable doubt_ in a court of law
that the accusations (slander) are true, and not meant to damage another's
reputation for personal gain or out of pure malice. Is this so unreasonable????
Words _can_ hurt people directly, and by leading to actions that hurt them
both mentally and phisically.

A sturdy fine will do the trick too, methinks...

Well, don't all (western) justice systems work like that: the prosecution
builds a case with evidence etc, and it's up to the lawyers to prove that
this is crap and that in fact you're innocent. I really see no difference.
The "presumed innocent until proven quilty" thing may sound o.k, but
it's nonsense of course. If the servants of justice really thought you were
innocent they wouldn't have arrested you in the first place, now would
they? They don't call them "suspects" for nothing.

No, that's the mainland European system. The Anglo-Saxon legal systems
(e.g. UK and America) at least nominally require the prosecution to prove
that you committed the crime beyond all reasonable doubt, not for individuals 
to prove their innocence.

I would like to approach this discussion from the direction of
facilitating the brain to re-establish a more homeostatic state using
EEG biofeedback (neurofeedback).  To the extent that drugs or trauma
have induced a pattern of persistent dysregulation, I regularly see the
re-regulation of brain activity, remediation of pathology - both psycho
and neuro, and a sometimes dramatic increase in cognitive functioning
superior to premorbid levels using neurofeedback.  

	In this "treatment" the client's EEG is displayed to the client in the
form of a computer game in real time.  Certain "signatures" of
pathology, obtainable in QEEG, usually show a distribution of excess
fast or slow wave activity in various regions.  EEG sensors are placed
over these areas and the client is asked to either upregulate the slow
activity or downregulate the fast activity using a clinical
neurofeedback system and protocols now well established.  Results are
often rapid (5-20 sessions) and dramatic.  In the 3 1/2 years of doing
this work I take a Darwinian view of the progress I see.  Once the brain
sees itself working, is in a loop with itself, it merely "drops out"
anything that is in the way of its augmented function.  That includes
things like depression, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder, traumatic brain injury, post-stroke syndrome,
and other enduring problems for which allopathic approaches have readily
observable limits. 

	The continuum of effect stretches from pathology remediation, to
greater balance, flexibility and placticity in the nervous system, to
elicitation of peak performance zones (astronauts, athletes, and
performers do EEG work), to profound transpersonal/kundalini
experiences.  This is all through inner work.  Nothing is induced
through the sensors, though some systems work with visually pulsed light
to entrain certain effects.  However, like other exogenous methods, it
can show you the territory but it can't get you there.  The
straightforward EEG work, however does get people to improved
functioning which, in most cases appears to persist after treatment. 

	I would recommend this as a non-invasive approach to the problem of
HPPD, and as an interesting self-regulation technique in the
armamentarium of propelling onself forward in ways that this particular
vehicle is uniquely tuned to experience.  Further information can be had
at the sites: www.eegspectrum.com and www.ssnr.com.

I think you underestimate the power a prosecutor wields in bringing
accusations.  Placing the burden of proof on the state (or whatever person or
agency brings what amounts to criminal accusation) has proven to be one fairly
effective curb on that power.  Consider that literally every single expert
observer of legal processes who is guided by fundamental values of liberty has
come to the conclusion that placing the burden of proof on the accuser is the
best starting point for any system of justice.  Then read one of the classics
of legal writing, Kafka's "The Trial".  Then, guilty or innocent, be accused
of a crime.  Then come back and tell me that you want the accused to have to
bear the burden of proof.

If prosecutors were morally perfect people, the burden of proof wouldn't
matter.  But they aren't, and it does.

Any proposition of fact that could be judged by a "simple PC" would be so
laden with judgment already that the PC would be little more than the word
processor on which the result is written.  I wish we were at a stage where a
PC could really "add up facts"; in fact, today's PCs still do very little more
than perform arithmetical calculations on simple strings of symbols.  (I know
-- that's all a Turing machine ever does . . .)  Most of the intelligence
still lies in the user's interpretation of the output of those calculations.

I don't doubt that we will have synthetic, non-human entities that will be
both the subject and object of a justice system, but when we do, we'll just
have invited such entities to share in the age-old conundrums of justice.
They might well do better than natural, unaltered humans for being able to
think more quickly and clearly, but they will still have to weigh facts and
conflicting evidence.

I wonder whether some of your ideas may grow out of familiarity only with what
we in the Anglo-American word call "the Continental system" or "Code system"
of justice, in which judges take a much more active role in the juridical
process than in the common law system.  The Anglo-American system (no offense
to the Australians and New Zealanders -- I'm sure they call it the Anglo-
Australian system, etc.) has been characterized by a steady process of
curtailing the role of judges.  In this system, on a case-by-case basis, rules
develop to systematize the legal matrix that is laid over the factual material
brought forward by advocates for the parties to particular cases.  In cases
dealing with familiar questions (murder who-dunnits, for instance), the
discretion of the judge is highly constrained on a fine-grained issue-by-issue
basis.  For example, each specific piece of evidence offered is considered
within a specific set of rules for admissibility and weight crafted through
the precedential system to fit the peculiar problems presented by evidence of
that KIND.

In a case presenting no truly novel issues, the rules developed by the common
law system isolate final fact questions quite well so that, at the end of a
trial very little is left to discretion.  What IS left to discretion is almost
always just the sort of judgment call that can't be reduced to mechanical
rules.

In this regard, the common law system of case precedent can be seen as a very
slow AI system itself.  Whether any particular line of trial and appellate
judges actually does follow the law developed by this system is another
question -- a political one.  It seems though that any "artificial" system
able to fully comprehend and apply the entire corpus of such laws would be at
least as complex as a human judge or lawyer.

The age-old question: Who watches the watchers?  It seems that you have a
human in the loop; in a sense, the old "homunculus" of epistemology.  As Nick
Szabo has written, many legal processes can be automated.  I agree with him,
within the regimes he proposes (contracts that have quantifiable subjects).
But as I have had the pleasure of seeing, Nick has come to the independent
conclusion that the long process of case-by-case rule development of the
common law can't really be improved upon.  I commend the material you'll find
at his web site

         http://www.digicash.com/~nick/

 as an example of someone not infected by the legal-education system, who has
brought both some fresh insight to the subject AND has independently verified
the validity of many of the systemic values of the common law.

 I hope my criticism didn't convince you that debating fundamental ideas
is futile. Many attempts use futile approaches, such as rephrasing ideas
their opponents have already rejected. If you want to alter your opponents
beliefs (rather than promote solidarity within your side of the debate, as
many arguments seem designed for), you need to understand why they reach
different conclusions than you, which requires a genuine interest in how
they think.

 My moral beliefs are ultimately based on utilitarian arguments (e.g.
comparisons such as the U.S. vs. the Soviet Union have shown that the
rule "if in doubt, avoid coercion" produces results that almost all
humans prefer). I see no sign that disagreements about things like
whether torture is nice explain much of the political disputes we see
(I think Robin Hanson has a paper on his web site arguing this better
than I can).
 I would be curious to hear whether you have a justification for a
religious-style attitude towards moral rules, or whether your "coercion
is immoral" rule is merely shorthand for something like "I've studied
enough history to know that all coercion that has been tried in societies
like ours has been unneccesary and has produced undesired results, and
we should avoid coercion until we hear a fundamentally new argument for it".

Sure, that's easy. Go read the Canterbury Tales. In Chaucerian England,
it is obvious from context that "man" simply met any person, male or
female - as did "fellow".

This works, but it is not clear that it is useful. The waveforms are
likely more of a symptom than the cause of the problem, so fixing them
might be just "cosmetic" (of course, this depends a lot on what
problems we are talking about; there are likely a few dynamical
problems we could really use it for - hmm, what about ECG for
self-defibrillation?). Overall, it is very hard to say how a healthy
EEG should look like (epileptic spikes and such things shouldn't be
in there, but the rest?).

It is quite easy to train oneself to produce alpha waves, but that
doesn't necessarily make you more relaxed (even if thinking it does
will, of course, be quite helpful).

Sentences like this really makes my bullshit detector chime. There are
some biofeedback treatments that have beneficial effects, but this
seems to be utter hyperbole. So this form of treatment does not have
any observable limits? Maybe it can treat brain death? ;-(

This is pretty much what an "incorporated" individual is, so you

It'll all go away if your first point is carried out. The only protection
 corps offer is the fact that as an "individual" they shield their execs 
from liability - you can't find against one person for another 
"person's" crime. And now many states have started to include the
idea of the "thinly-veiled" corporation - one which does not shield it's
shareholders from liability at all.

Why bother with this? I never understood why people get all upset 
over settlements like this. Who gives a fig if some older woman 
(her lawyers actually) make a big play? $6M is probably a single 
day's coffee profits for an org the size of MickeyD's. If the jury thought

mandatory sentences and term limits - attempts to micromanage the
entire process of government from the legislative chamber.

Huh? If you get rid of the "corporation", there won't be an entity at that 
level to tax. 

Fuzzy.

You've overstated the number by a factor of 2. It's only about 20K actually

If you can't prove that you weren't present for over 10K violent deaths, you
are definitely up to something. Helloooo, Dr. Kevorkian!

Only in countries with the Napoleonic Code or similar. In England, America,
and
the other Common Law nations, we hold to the "innocent until proven guilty"
standard. Although the system may be abused and stressed at times, that
standard is consistently applied. Note that "prove" means different things in
the US depending on whether the act in question is a felony or not. The
standard
of proof that the prosecution has to meet is much higher for felony cases.

I'm sorry to hear that the US governement still has not outgrown
distributing support on the basis of race, family-status,
chemical-addictions or sexual orentation. This is a _US_ problem however,
don't use this as an argument against governemental systems elsewhere that
don't suffer from these faults.

More _US_ policy problems, not a general case. I suggest you get yourself a
decent gov before you start bashing Europeans ones of which you apparently
know very little.

No offence but I think I'm better informed about _Dutch_ law-enforcement
policies than you are. Prevention of crime (and thus, effectively,
protection of citizens) is just as important as 'catching the bad guys',
and resources are allocated accordingly (IMHO a good thing, prevention is
better for the would-be victims and more cost-effective).

 (concerning the dike-enhancement plan)
 >I don't imagine that the Dutch Government was the contractor that did
 >the work, was it?

Actually it was, some of the equipment was so expensive and specialized,
custom designed for the project, that no company would consider investing
in it (and by expensive I mean you you should think 'Apollo project'). Of
course commercial contractors were also brought in but a governement
ministery ran the whole thing.

I don't think the Netherlands was planned in any way when it became
independant from Spain in the 17th century. A bunch of people simply filled
a power-vacuum, and tried to establish some sort of democracy (emphasizing
'some sort'). From there it just developed slowly to what it is now. If you
mean by 'planned community' that there's a lot of complex legislature then
you're right. We have to plan with 15M people living on a piece of land not
250 by 350 Km's and still being the worlds #4 in agricultural exports.

Based on my limited knowledge about American 'gated communities' this
comparison is bogus and rather insulting too. The right to live in Holland
is not determined by productivity, there's no price tag for acces. All
citizens, no matter how unproductive, lazy or drug-addicted enjoy the
security of a basic income and medical facilities and such. In Holland
people are _free_ to _choose_ whether or not they want to become productive
(that's freedom! ;-). I think this is precisely the opposite from what a
gated community stands for.

Yes, it is interesting to see that there is a such a strong correlation to
countries that try to prevent their citizens from starving (even the
'unproductive' ones) and countries that we consider 'developed'.
 
What do you suggest we do with all the 'unproductive' people? Let them starve?
You could be unproductive a few seconds from now, it only takes a broken
bloodvessel in the brain to reduce a single, white, able-bodied male to a
very crippled and very unproductive individual. I wish you a long and
healthy life of course, but do not fool yourself into believing it could
not happen to you. Then what? Do you have a big family that will take care
of you (or do they refuse to support 'unproductive individuals')
And what about the growing percentage of the population that is becoming
redundant by automation? We do not need strong AI to automate a
considerable part of the economy, the proces is happening right now.

 And later:

Point taken, having never visited NH so I'll take your word for it. My
original point (several posts ago ;-) was that the existance of
'big-governement' does not necessarily lead to economic collapse or even
reduced growth.

That was my point, if you want to state that welfare-systens are always bad
for an economy, prove it. But make sure you got your facts straight.

In stating my belief that the absence of a state leads to chaos I was
refecting on my experiences in several countries were a power-vacuum left
by a crumbling governement was quickly filled by drunks driving pick-ups
and shooting anythying that moves. I was talking about a situation were the
state is absent, not downsized, as you yourself seem to consider a 'good
idea'. I wonder what would happen to the US if the federal governement
ceased existing overnight (I'd watch from a safe distance though - remember
LA?).

Subject: Reasonable quantum computing target?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I want to make a claim on the FX site (the current name for the game
based on Robin Hanson's Idea Futures) about quantum computing.  There
is nothing there now except insofar as it would affect some of the
factoring and other crypto claims.

I need to define what is meant by a quantum computer, set a minimum of
performance and capacity, and choose a date.  People will then bet on
whether such a machine will exist by the specified date.

The quantum computer's capacity can be measured in qubits, which are
capable of being put into a superposition of two states.  It also needs
to have one or more operators which can change the states of the bits.
The operators have to be "universal" in the sense that any possible
logical operation can be created by combining the operators appropriately.

It also needs to be possible to prepare the qubits in a desired initial
state, and to read the state of at least some of them at the end of the
operation.

The computer's performance will be limited by noise and by coherence time.
Operations will not be perfectly reliable due to noise, and over time,
interactions with the environment will also destroy the coherence of
the quantum superpositions.  These can be addressed to some extent by
using quantum error correction.

My idea is to specify some minimum number of logical qubits, perhaps
about 50, and some minimum number of operations which can be done by
the computer before coherence is lost.  Doing error correction requires
redundancy, and so more than 50 actual qubits may be needed in order to
give the effect of 50 logical bits.  I don't have a good sense for how
many operations would be a good target, or even how to count operations
since different machines may have operators with differing amounts
of power.

Another approach would be to require successfully factoring a 50 bit
number using Shor's algorithm or some improvement.  I'm a little worried
though that someone would claim that since the quantum computer is allowed
to be aided by a non-quantum computer (which I think actually happens
in Shor's algorithm) and since factoring 50 bit values is trivial on an
ordinary computer, they might argue that the claim was already satisfied.
Some players delight in finding loopholes in claims, although I think
it ruins the game.

Looking at some of the recent work,
http://p23.lanl.gov/Quantum/quantum.html
it is pretty amazing what is happening in this field.  I have been
skeptical about quantum computing, but the pieces appear to be falling
into place.  I am thinking of a 5 year target for the 50 qubit computer.
Does that seem too short?  If so I might reduce the number of qubits to
keep the claim within a reasonably short time frame.

Any comments or suggestions are most welcome!

Hal

Kathryn,

Sorry, but English inherited *none* of its grammatical structure from
either Latin or Greek, despite borrowing a myriad of words from each.
Ancient Germanic, like modern German, and English itself in vestigial form,
had three genders as well. The three-gender system seems to be as old as
Proto-Indo-European.

It's absolutely not true that "man" entered the language in the ME period,
as a glance at any Anglo-Saxon (Old English) textbook will show. As Damien
pointed out, the original meaning does indeed seem to have been "person" in
general; witness modern German "man" (used as a pronoun roughly
corresponding to the English pronoun "one"). Modern German "Mann" and the
male-specific use of Modern English "man" are later _specializations_ of
the word. Hence OE "wifman", which became ModE "woman", literally means
"woman-person". BTW, the "wif-" part of the word is the same as ModE "wife"
and ModG "Weib"="woman, wife".

Linguistically yours,
Dick Gray

Ancient Greek possessed three genders:  masculine, feminine and
neuter. When the resulting Latin grammer was superimposed over the
Germanic roots of early English a few centuries ago, these three
genders passed into English but not to the extent that other
languages utilize them.  English is actually one of the more
gender-neutral languages, and is highly flexible in accomodating
non-gendered discourse.  The word that you are trying to remember
probably came from a Germanic or Icelandic language, because Old
English vocabulary bore a closer resemblance to the root languages,
both in form and pronunciation, and most of our 'household words'
(words that refer to practical objects) entered the language through
repeated invasion by Germanic and Icelandic tribes.  But 'man' as a
word did not enter the English language until the Middle English
period, and I can find no evidence that it was restricted to the
inclusive 'human'.  It actually had four or five meanings, many of
which you will find in Shakespeare.
I myself prefer to utilize the word 'human', as it precisely shows
what stage of evolutionary development I am talking about:  Human,
transhuman, posthuman.

And your freedom is confiscated accordingly as well. There are so many people here
in the US because european governments have always considered security paramount
over individual rights. Of course that means that most people left there have a
greater herd tendency than people here.

While the Apollo was laujnched by Nasa, it was built by contractors. Of course I'm
not familiar enough with the Dutch gov't to judge in this particular case, but
typically all a govt agency does when it hires a contractor to do a job is figure
out as many ways to make the job as difficult and expensive and convoluted as
possible, as well as giving every other ministry an open season to pile on more
requirements.

Thats certainly freedom for the those who are non-productive, but what about those
who are productive? Making them foot the bill for everyone who wants to be lazy is
slavery in its most abject form. What would happen if everyone decided to by
unproductive? Who would pay the bills then?

Developed nations typically are wealthy enough that there tends to grow a class of
parasites who feed off the productive remainder. It is obvious that a nation that
is not wealthy cannot afford to support such leaches, so they either get jobs or
become'refugees' hoping to become parasites in a wealthier country.  As a small
example, when Diane Feinstein (then mayor of San Francisco) expanded aid for
homeless people fourfold, guess what happened? Did the homeless population
suddenly become respectable citizens with disposable income and homes, etc? NO!
What happened was that the homeless from every surrounding city that had less
hospitable social policies toward bums migrated to San Francisco, to the point
that they were camped out in front of City Hall like it was the streets of
Calcutta.

> What do you suggest we do with all the 'unproductive' people? Let them starve?

Let them get a clue and become productive. Get jobs. Go to school. Learn
SOMETHING.

People do not become redundant, they merely are able to make more of their time
available for occupations which are not so strenuous, not so monotonous. For
example, the USPS is by and large, still the most un-automated large
postal/shipping company here in the US. UPS and FedEx, by comparison, are not only
automated, but highly networked and computerized. I think that it is not difficult
to connect this fact with the fact that more USPS workers go on homicidal rampages
than any other company, while UPS and Fed Ex employees are among the lowest.

Economic collapse: Soviet Union, Poland, E Germany, Romania, Cuba, North Korea,
Indonesia.All of which had large authoritarian, cradle to grave systems.  I'll get
back to you on growth rates once I get a chance to research it.

The US doesn't try to control its currency artificially like your countries do. We
have more faith in the market's ability to be stable inherently, within an
acceptable range. We also have a surplus budget (without massive per capita oil
revinues, as the Dutch are so well endowed with, which is mainly the source of
your ability to slouch as much as you wish). and lower unemployment. As to growth,
let me do some research....

Yes, and LA has one of the highest tax rates and one of the most restrictive gun
control laws in the entire nation. SOme stability. It also has one of the highest
costs of living.

Government spending, as you'll find in any macroeconomics textbook, raises
the interest rate, which results in decreased private investment.  As
investment decreases, long term growth decreases.  

As a result of this decreased long term growth, the welfare of the poor
might look something like this:

(Only the shape of this graph is relevant; I cede that these numbers can't
be proven as it is impossible for a given state to try two policies
simultaneously and compare.)
		

		|          /   /
		|         |  /
		|        / /<----- welfare
		|       |/ 
		|      *
Average Income	|    /|
of the lowest	|  / / 
statistical	|/  |
quartile		$  /  <-----  non welfare
(adjusted for	| | 
inflation)	|/
		-----------------------------

			Time

Note that while under the welfare system, the poorest citizens are at first
richer than they were under the non-welfare system (denoted by $ on the
graph), after a given period of time, these two lines intersect.  (The
point marked w/ a * on the graph.)  From this point forward, welfare isn't
even better for the poor.  Meanwhile, of course, everyone else has been
suffering from decreased growth and decreased disposable income. 

Also note that if welfare were to be abandoned, the poor would immediately
lose the quantity $ from their inflation-adjusted income; while this would
eventually be more than offset by increased growth, when the poor take a
hit it's rare they will simply be able to dissave a bit or decrease
consumption of luxuries.  This money will likely come out of the
food/health budget; it would also lead to a rise in homelessness as the
poor find themselves unable to pay rent/mortgages, and a possible short run
decrease in growth as some poor will find themselves (suddenly) unable to
work at all.  Again, while this loss would EVENTUALLY be offset, the short
term losses could be tremendous.

Welfare is good for the poor in the short run, it is bad for everyone in
the long run.  Abandoning welfare is quite bad for the poor in the short
run, but good for everyone in the long run.

Sorry, but I took three solid years of linguistic and grammatic 
theory at university, and I doubt that our professors and our 
textbooks were making up facts.  Up until partway through 16c English 
relied upon Germanic grammatical structures until a few 
cultural heavyweights on the British islands decided that enlightened 
and civilized humans spoke Latin, and therefore set up new 
grammatical rules for English that relied upon Latin grammatical 
structures, with some vestiges of German.  In modern form, much of 
the tripartite gender structure has fallen away.  We tend not to 
consider objects as having any sort of gender.

As for references, any good English dictionary gives the period in
which a word entered the language, and many dictionaries base that
information on the OED.  As I look up the word 'man', I discover
that the entymology has a break in it (ME, from OE, akin to OHG),
meaning that it fell out of use in Old English and was revived into
the language in the Middle English period.  My Shakespeare and 
Chaucer concordances indicate a variety of meanings in use at the 
time, not just the one.

A fascinating radio broadcast in Australia last night (Tues March 24) with
James Lovelock, inventor of the Gaia hypothesis.  He was interviewed by a
very intelligent autodidact named Phillip Adams.  I missed half the
program, but was astounded to hear Lovelock's claim that after his
unpatented invention (in the '50s? ' 40s?) of the microwave oven - or at
least of using microwaves to thaw frozen stuff - certain researchers in the
'50s successfully revived small frozen mammals by that method.  

How pristine the animals' neurology was and how long they lasted after
revival wasn't made clear, but Lovelock was explicit about their chilly
temporary state - frozen hamsters, he said, were quite solid; you could
knock them against the lab bench.  After thawing, they'd run around.  

I have a lot of respect for Lovelock's integrity and ingenuity.  Yet this
claim appears to surpass anything that current cryonics specialists seem
able to replicate.  

It would be useful to hear some informed comments from, say, Paul Wakfer or
other knowledgeable suspension enthusiasts.

I don't think heavyweights can change grammar like that.  More importantly,
English grammar doesn't resemble Latin very much.  German probably resembles
Latin more.  What I've read is that our grammar resembles that of the
Scandinavian languages more than anything else, a result of living with the
Danes for a few centuries; apparently the Scandinavian tongues split off from
Germanic in grammar, although I don't know whether English adoped Scand.
grammar or whether the current system is a bastard of Old English and Old
Danish.

English has often been _taught_ based on the Latin model, which may be where
the 'heavyweights' come in, and which probably gave grammar a bad name in
English, precisely because it didn't apply.  Latin is heavily inflected with a
pretty flexible word order; English has minimal inflections and much more
brittle order, because that's what determines the meaning.

If grammar is significantly different from syntax I've probably just totally
embarassed myself.

	At some point, someone (I think Michael Lorrey or Lee Daniel Crocker),
mentioned that those states who eliminated their tradition environmental
laws in favour of laws that allowed private citizens to take legal action
against polluters ended up lowering their levels of pollution.  (this
sounds exactly like the Coase Theorem in action)  Could someone please give
me some facts and figures on this phenomenon?  
	This example came up in a discussion about how the Multilateral Agreement
on Investment will affect the environment.  My argument is that this treaty
will force governments to get rid of their environmental laws (as these
laws will put domestic companies at a disadvantage to the MAI-protected
foreign companies)  Therefore, the last line of defence for the environment
will be to allow private citizens to sue companies for the pollution they
cause which, according to someone on this list, will actually be better for
the environment.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated,

Geoff.

I don't think factoring would be the best test of a Quantum Computer for 3 
reasons: 

1) Factoring is one of the most demanding tasks you could ask a quantum    
  computer to do.     
  
2) As you point out, with a 50 bit number cheating is possible with a    
   conventional computer.

3) It's dull, even if you're able to do it the world will not be changed much. 

Rather than factoring a 50 bit number try simulating the behavior of 50  
objects, like the 50 electrons in a tin atom. That would change the world big 
time, yet surprisingly it would be much easier to get a quantum computer to 
do that than factor numbers. There is no way a conventional computer could 
perform such a simulation, that's why Chemists must still do experiments. 
To simulate the behavior of N electrons, in a conventional computer you would 
need memory space and computation time proportional to 2^2N. To figure out 
from theory alone what's going on with a tin atom you  would need to perform 
about 10^30 operations. 
 
Seth Lloyd found a way to perform the same simulation using just N qubits and  
the number of operations the quantum machine must do is proportional to N, 
not 2^2N as on a conventional computer. In addition, the time required to do 
the simulation over time t is proportional to t, in other words it can do it
in real time, like an Analog computer. Lloyd's simulation method is far more 
forgiving and less sensitive to errors than Shor's factoring algorithm, and 
astronomically more useful.

If you don't like tin how about calculating the freezing point of water from
the laws of Quantum Mechanics? There is lots more about this in a article in 
the August 23 1996 issue of Science by Seth Lloyd called  "Universal Quantum
Simulators".

In the Thieves' World series there is a Blue Star adept, name 
escapes me at the moment, where a typical story either does not 
reveal the adept's gender at all or reveals it only rather late in 
the story, at a point where it is actually necessary to the story to 
reveal it.

This is in English.

Note: at various points various characters *think* they know this 
adept's gender and might use a gender-specific pronoun.  
But the narrator does not (except where necessary to the story).  And 
there are no obvious peregrinations to avoid such pronouns.

That is not the methodology in England or the US or Canada;  I 
suspect it is not the methodology in former English colonies 
generally.  I won't comment on other countries because I don't have 
much information.

In England, Canada, and the US, it is up to the prosecutor to prove 
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT that you are guilty.  In the US under 
current law, any person charged with a criminal offense has a right 
to a jury trial, and a jury verdict in a criminal trial must be 
unanimous.  (If it isn't, it is legally as if the trial never 
happened.  The prosecutor gets to decide if they can make a better 
case in front of a different jury -- not likely to try if the 
majority of the jury was voting for acquittal.)

You don't have to prove you are innocent.

If you can show that the prosecutor's facts are incorrect, the 
prosecution will probably fail (unless your showing also supports the 
prosecutor's basic claim -- "your honor, I didn't shoot the victim 
with that pistol, I used a different one.").

If you can show that the prosecutor's facts are incomplete, and 
provide additional facts that show you are merely not particularly 
likely to be guilty (which is not the same as proving that you are 
innocent), the prosecution will probably fail.

If you can show that the method by which the prosecutor acquired his 
facts is flawed, or that the source is for some reason unreliable, 
the prosecution may well fail depending on just how serious the flaws 
are -- even if you never claim that any specific fact in 
the prosecution's case is actually false.

It's a balancing act, and it takes place in the courts, not in the 
police station.  Saying "innocent until proven guilty" is overstating 
the case a bit, perhaps: if the court truly held the accused to be 
strictly innocent, it would order his immediate release without bail 
pending verdict.

On the other hand, if the prosecution presents no case at all, the 
defense wins.  If the defense presents no case at all, the 
prosecution must still present a case that the jury finds not merely 
credible, but true beyond a reasonable doubt, or the defense wins.  

Once charges are brought against a person, if the prosecution delays 
things unduly the defense can have the case dismissed (effectively an 
automatic acquittal)  on that basis; but if the defense delays things 
unduly, there will NEVER be an automatic conviction.

If the court finds the defendant guilty, the defendant can appeal.  
If the court finds the defendant "not guilty" (there is no verdict of 
"innocent" in US courts), it's over, the defendant can never be 
compelled to face the same criminal charge for the same alleged 
crime, not even if he confesses in court immediately after the case.

English courts, I understand, have three basic verdicts they can 
deliver: "guilty", "not guilty", and "not proven"; the latter amounts 
to "we think he's probably guilty, but the prosecutor didn't prove 
it; take another try if you like."  I don't know if I like the latter 
option or not.

I know I don't like the requirement for unanimous verdicts.  A 5/6 
majority should be sufficient for a guilty verdict, or a simple 
majority for a not-guilty verdict.  (However, in capital crimes, the 
death penalty *should* *not* be an option unless the verdict was 
unanimous.)

For example, the rule "don't end a sentence with a preposition".

Actually, if you could use it to break a 128 bit encryption in a really short

As stated before, I'm not an economist, but I wonder if growth solely
related to private investments? Or is the businees 'environment' also a
factor? The educational level of employees, infrastructure, strikes (or
lack thereof). All these have no influance?

I think having some sort of 'support system' increases the stability of a
society because there's no 'underclass' that has nothing to lose.

OK, I can find no principal argument against that.

Then the problem becomes to quantify 'good-in-the-short-run' and
'bad-in-the-long-run'. Is the technical/economic progress gained in 5,10 or
50 years from now worth abandoning welfare now and letting a part of the
population slide down to extreme poverty, disease (or maybe starvation)?

Can we attach numbers to these values somehow? So how much technical
progress is a human life or human suffering worth these days?

Dan, I think you have cut to the core of the discussion, thanks.

 I do consider myself an extropian. I would call myself a transhumanIST,
meaning that I agree with the general idea of transcending human limits,
and spend considerable time trying to understand related issues, and
advance my own personality. I have made some success working on my
own personality architecture, taking increasing control over many of
its elements, and actively pursuing growth on a rational foundation
of disciplines from cognitive science to advanced supplements - I would
say, that the extropian approach here is qualitatively different from
both traditional Western and Oriental ideas on self-improvement, though
partly it is based on both. Still, no matter how satisfied I am with
my personal progress, I do not think my current state rises far enough
above the conventional human plain to qualify me for any trans-human status.

The understanding of the workings of the human consciousness is in a very
primitive state at this point, but I think methodologically we understand
its nature enough to know that eventually it can be learned, modeled, and
replicated in an external medium.

Uploading is the very first stage of liberating conscious beings from
dependence on legacy substrates and architectures. Actually, partial
uploading has been going on for thousands of years: people have been
creating external tools for acquisition, storage, transmission, and
processing of information, and relying on these external tools to carry
functions originally performed by their brains. Even a straightforward
upload, without any personality hacking, would have some dramatic
immediate benefits: real immortality assured by incremental personality
backups, instant cheap travel (it's just transmission of information now,
right?), ability to greatly speed up all mental functions (or slow them
to any level, that effectively gives one infinite patience), etc.
Then, the person could switch between multiple external sensors, so
all the world's telescopes, microscopes, microphones, thermometers, and
other devices would become people's shared sensory organs.
With better understanding of the structure of the uploaded consciousness,
the post-human beings would be able to redefine parts of their personality,
access other people's knowledge as their own ("remote thinking"), trade
internal mental images, accept arbitrary artificial extensions, and do many
other things that will make all our current notions of personality and
identity obsolete.
I theorize in greater detail about the possibilities of the distributed
"liquid intelligence" of the post-human future in my essay "Networking in
the Mind Age". - see

indage.html>

 The architecture of the global cognition system will be very different
from the current collection of individual bodies with downloaded social
knowledge. The role of "personalities" would be transferred to "nodes of
influence" and then to what I call "Teleological threads" - sequences
of structures modifying themselves to achieve certain (also drifting)
goals. Goals will be more persistent than structures in the time of
architectural self-control. Of course, some methods of control are
absolutely necessary, as they have always been in all systems. Others
would be detrimental to stability, growth, or efficiency of different
parts of the system. The set of control structures will never be optimal,
as it has never been. In any case, neither subjects, nor objects of control
will look anything like [collections] of personalities, in today's sense of
the word. The closest entity that I envision to the current concept of
personality, would be a set of interconnected contractual relationships
between various functional units (that at the same time can also engage
in other sets of relations), working on a coordinated set of projects - 
an advanced analog of a "virtual corporation".

I think the first interesting question is for whom it *could* be possible.
People who cannot perceive themselves separated from their bodies and do
not have courage, intelligence, and experiential flexibility to accept
such a dramatic change (and that includes practically everybody currently
alive) could be uploaded, but for as their personalities cannot "digest"
such a transition, it would be destructive for them. "Destruction through
improvement", is "death forward" of sorts. It's not a new phenomenon,
we do this to the personalities of our children by raising and educating
them, which changes them beyond recognition, but here the transition would
be a lot more immediate, unexpected and traumatic.

Even when uploading becomes both technologically possible and personally
acceptable for some individuals, the transition to new forms and necessary
changes in social structures would be very serious, and would require and
cause a lot of control issues. Most likely, the traditional power centers
will exercise their control against the requirements of progress, as it 
is happening today.

>
>6. Isn't there an imminent risk for overpopulation if humanity gains

>

 The Universe is pretty large. Immortality doesn't increase population,
making new individuals beyond necessity and reason does. If the population
of advanced countries was today granted eternal youth, there probably would
be little change in the population. Sure, old people would die less (except
suicides, accidents, etc.) - but younger people will delay having children,
as they can always do it later, and we would see a great drop in birth rates.
In any case, prohibiting immortality, that is, killing some people so that
some others could bring currently non-existent people to life, doesn't seem
more ethical than feeding old neighbors to your children.

In more distant future, post-uploads inhabiting artificially expanded
Multiverse, will take care of this problem. Meanwhile, if every person
makes only the children s/he knows she can raise, their won't be any problem. 

>
>7. What will be the further challenges for man if one could live forever?
>

Aggressive self-modification. Immortality is a very conservative goal.
Nobody would just like to preserve themselves in the same state.
Those who do not change as aggressively as it is technologically possible,
will effectively drown in the rising tide of intelligence. Even if they
are kept alive by sentimental hyper-transcendent entities, nothing will
depend on them, and they will not be able to discover anything new or do
any useful work for themselves or others. As these things are fundamental
to humans, being human in the transhuman company will be also impossible.
So man will not live forever. Our descendants will, hopefully, but they
won't be human. 

>
>8. Do you see mind uploading as a step in the evolution of man?

Yes, it may be its final step. I am not sure it would or should be done
though. If we learn to build new intelligent structures before we figure
out how to replicate the brain, we could just build new and better entirely
artificial minds, and then nobody will need to preserve humans :-)

>9. Mind Uploading would lead to a generation (the one in power) becoming

The power structure always tries to use new inventions to better keep
its old positions. I do not think it would be a great factor here though.
The society changes so rapidly now that it is very difficult to be relevant
for long. Old people are under-represented in leadership of frontier
social movements (take extropians) or cutting-edge science and technology
partly because they are less numerous and physically and mentally able,
but mostly because their experiences are largely irrelevant in today's
world, and appear actually detrimental to their ability to contribute to,
or control emergent directions. In Japan, with life-time employment of
industrial managers, they have a whole class of "sitting near the window"
old executives still holding nominal control positions, luxury offices,
and high salaries, but not understanding, and not controlling anything
anymore.

 Old entities always have greater power, and always eventually lose, now
sooner than ever. This applies also to humans.

Now that Mr. Bags has dumped widgets on the market they're dirt cheap and 
that means demand for them is huge. If the price is to remain cheap Mr. Bags 
must build more factories and increase production, now he's loosing money at  
an accelerating rate. Mr. Bags has more money than I do but he looses money 
on every widget sold and right now he's selling a lot more widgets than I am. 
I temporally stop production and wait for Mr. Bags to file for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. I won't have long to wait.

The US government sanctions hurt US companies more than the Japanese, that's 
why they stopped them. The Japanese built fewer RAM factories which mente 
fewer sales by the largest semiconductor manufacturing equipment company in 
the world, the American company Applied Materials. Higher RAM prices mente 
more expensive computers which mente fewer were sold which mente fewer 
microprocessors were needed which hurt the largest semiconductor company in 
the world, the American company INTEL. Fewer computers need less software and  
that hurt the largest software company in the world the American company  
Microsoft.

Not me! In the entire history of human beings on planet Earth the price of 
nothing, absolutely nothing, has dropped further or faster than the price of 
RAM in the last 20 years, and in spite of this, or rather because of it, the  
people who sell it have gotten immensely rich. The government tells me they  
will be happy to fix this horrible problem, no thank you.

Nothing unusual or sinister in that, we're not talking about a steel mill 
here. You build a 2 billion dollar state of the art semiconductor fabrication 
plant and it's the wonder of the world for about 2 years, for another 2 years 
it can make less demanding second line chips, then the obsolete fab is ready 
to be torn down to make room for a new plant with improved technology.


       >then sold and reconfigured to other industrial purposes altogether.

Of course they do...  but all of these happen to be forms of investment.  :)  

Students invest money now in their education so as to be able to get
greater returns on their human capital later, eventually paying off their
scholastic investment.  Corporations invest in their infrastructure now to
get greater productivity, eventually paying off their corporate investment.
 Laborers sacrifice wages now in the hopes of increasing the wage rate,
eventually recompensing them for their losses during the strike.  All come
in the form of private investment.

While stability cannot be measured, I would agree with you that a support
system does increase stability.  However, stability and growth may not be
related; they may even share an inverse relationship.

Remember, the only investment which actually improves growth is that which
(at least) pays for itself.  When a so-called "safety net" is in place, it
may decrease somewhat the incentive to make certain that investments pay
for themselves.  Some economists argue that this is exactly what has caused
the economic crash in Asia:  governments were investing in social welfare
projects (and sometimes lining their own pockets) which don't pay for
themselves.  Investments of this sort hurt the economy rather than help it.

>because there's no 'underclass' that has nothing to lose. 

Isn't that part of the point of a safety net/support system?  Making it so
people have nothing to lose?  (while still having something?)

These are good questions.  Here's my unsubstantiated thoughts on the matter:

The first possibility, already mentioned, is to turn off the welfare
program now and never look back.  Other tactics, such as leaving welfare at
its current dollar value and never again increasing it for inflation, might
be a better way to go about it, but in this case we leave the transition to
economic forces beyond our control.  A supply shock of any kind during this
period could easily crush the poor.

Another strategy might be to just leave welfare in place until mind
uploading and/or other immortalizing technologies become affordable to
everyone (or at least subsidizable).  That way, when we did finally shut
down welfare, no one would die as a result.

While this seems more appealing at first, keep in mind the costs of
implementing this solution: unless/until we develop these technologies,
EVERYONE is going to die, no matter how much they make annually.  If
anything, it seems we should take our foot off the brakes NOW so as to
reach immortality as quickly as possible, if our goal is to minimize death.

Ah, well.  Hope I've contributed well to the debate.

Um, I don't think we'll ever see mass uploading (First Power doomsday
argument and all that) but maximal automatization could solve most
of the welfare-related problems. Basically, what people want and need 
aren't jobs or even money but material goods like food, clothes and 
housing (duh indeed ;-) I think we already have the technological means
to mass-produce these things at extremely low costs. Only a couple
of % of a modern state's citizens are farmers, and usually these produce
more food than necessary. So...automate even further and make the
basic stuff _totally free_, just hand it out to all who are needy. Just like
in ancient Rome. Hell, why not have a modern equivalent of the games
too? People could volunteer to fight eachother, and the winners would
be paid from the revenues of tickets, cable rights, merchandise etc.
This and state-run lotteries and the like could also help to subsidize
the free-stuff factories (it beats taxes), that aren't too expensive to begin 
with due to the high degree of automatization. 

Would a system like this crash because everybody would just sit on their
ass? I don't think so, because many people want more than just free
food and housing (non-essentials would still have to be bought). So
they'll work, and push society forwards. The others could sit home
(or at football matches or maybe even in mass-produced VR-machines)
and live a life relatively free of hunger and disease, with TV, VR and 
dope to add to the happiness.

Later, with the advent of nanotech things would get easier still, but the
point is that it can be done with *today's* tools, if only we lose that
"the people must have work-meme". A nice side-effect of a system
like this would be quicker progress due to the stimulation of 
cheap, reliable automated systems instead of artificially holding them
back to save obsolete jobs. Also, with most "dumb jobs" automated
the world would become more user friendly because machines never
strike or have a bad day, and require no handling-etiquette whatsoever.

Yes, we need immortality too of course, in fact, it's one of my top priorities.
Save for some 1000 people or so, the rest doesn't seem to agree however...

You make good points, Peter. Rants-although they are fun-rarely convince
anyone of anything. But a little rightuous anger isn't all bad, is it? I
love reading some of the arguments of the radical abolitionists of the
early 1800's. They called slavery evil and slaveholders evil people.
It's exhilerating to read them. They didn't make utilitarian arguments
against slavery, but they did have some effect on public opinion. Would
they have done better with an economic analysis of slavery which would
have shown that it made the country as a whole and the slaves, but not
the individual slaveholders, economically worse off? 

>  People whose moral views are as fully formed as they will ever be

Well, I hope my moral views are open to refinement. However, the
fundamentals (slavery is wrong, etc.) are not going to change. Your mind
can be so open that your brain falls out.

I suppose you have to ground all moral beliefs in some sort of
utilitarianism, since you can't prove an "ought." However, many
so-called utilitarians neglect freedom as a utility. I'm in favor of
freedom even if it means I'll be slightly worse off economically.
Utilitarianism has to mean more than economic bean counting. I think
only in a free market will we maximize human happiness in general.
Unfortunately, however, individuals can and do maximize their happiness
by coercion. That's the problem. I could have a grand old time stealing
$50 million from Bill Gates (if I didn't get caught and had no
conscience) and he'd probably barely miss the money. (He's not even
trying to spend all his money when he's alive anyway.)

Hey Mike, I think we should stop this nationalistic country-bashing-thing
(it's gone a bit out of control I think ;-). You love your country and I
like mine too so to prevent both of us ending up in kill-files why don't we
call it quits for a while. I'll have one more and then you can have one
more and that'll be the end of it OK? I don't think either one of us is
convincing anyone here.

Nothin' like a good 'ol generalisation to explain how the universe hangs

Are you claiming that political prefferences are genetic? Interesting...

??? On how many national Gov's is your opinion based? Any other than the US?
I guess that due to our 'herd tendecies' our governement does a fairly
effecient job on these kind of projects ;-)

Do you even notice the fact that you automatically seem to judge all
governemental systems based on your own experience/knowledge of the US
situation?

IMHO: Less intelligent people are becoming quickly redundant (in an
economic sense). That is what automation is all about, use expensive, smart
machines to replace even more expensive not-so-smart people. You can think
this is a good thing or not, but don't deny that it's happening. IMO we
need to think about the social consequences of this proces.

Indonesia certainly did not have a 'cradle to grave system'! And none of
these were democratic countries. You really should learn to see the
difference between the former communist countries and democratic ones that
have some sort of support system for their citizens. This comparison makes
as much sense as comparing the US to Germany in 1940 - none at all - is
extremely insulting and does not prove anything except your lack of
accurate informtion.

Didn't the US have lot's of oil in Texas and Alaska?

The ability to take it easy as much 'as we wish' (but never more ;-) comes
from having on of the worlds highest labour-productivity's and a growing
'knowledge economy' that costs les natural resources per dollar. Not hard
working but smart working, and not _minding_ that most of us can't drive V8
jeeps or buy ultra-light planes. I mean, if you are as wealthy as you claim
and you honestly believe you still need more goodies to be happy you must
be missing out on something (appreciation, love, sex? - not neccesarily in
that order).

Again: you compare only _within_ the US of A. This seems a bit limited
(ever been anywhere?). From a mainland-european viewpoint the difference
between LA and other parts of the US is not that staggering. The riots were
however.

If a welfare system does nothing else then its keeping angry impoverished
mobs away from your doorstep. And if you don't believe that you should
read-up on 18th century French history, especially the part about how
Marie-Antoinette lost her head over a cake is very educational ;-)

OK, your turn.

Isn't the idea of unanimous verdicts to provide an extra measure of
protection to minimize the number of innocent people sent to prison? A
5/6 requirement would send more guilty people to jail, but also more
innocent ones. As it is, even unanimous juries make many mistakes. A lot
of convictions are overturned after new evidence comes out after the
trial.

Considering that most criminal defendants have to go against all of the
resources of the state with one overworked public defender, I don't want
to make it any easier for the state.

Also, a 5/6 requirement would make jury nullification more difficult. As
it is, I could cause a mistrial by refusing to convict a victimless
crime defendant and the state might not try the case again. Hence, a
victory for freedom.

Yes, this would be good, however, then corporations would lobby for tort reform,
since foreign countries without populations concerned about the environment (or
without a voice to air those concerns) would still be havens for corporations to
manufacture toxic intensive products in. Unless there are either international
environmental laws with teeth put into force, or unless nations are willing to allow
foreigners to sue for damages to the environment as a whole, then the only real
solution would be to force all products imported to have been produced in plants that
meet the same environmental standards as domestically produced products. In this
manner, the nation with the most strict reg wins.

Another possibility is to allow consumers to sue the distributors of foreign made
products for their part in the externalization of costs that is inherent in
pollution.

Another solution would be to tax products based on the energy input and waste
produced to manufacture it. Products sold would then have to bear a label
identifying, like a USRDA label on foods, the energy and pollution 'content' of the
product.

Note that all of these, with the exception of the second to last one, require large
government administration, so naturally, I don't like them. The last one could
possibly be performed by an independent inspection corporation like UL or Consumer
Testing, rather than by government agencies.

You seem to think that what's relevant and what is not is a simple matter to
determine, it's not, not in criminal investigation and not in scientific
research. In the real world when you're confronted with a puzzle you always
have far more information than you can deal with, and much of it is
contradictory. It's easy to see that part of the information must be wrong,
but what part? Knowing what data to ignore is one of the keys to creativity
and it's not easy, if it was home PC's running on DOS would be winning Nobel
Prizes. They're not.

It's a matter of opinion, some will say something is a fact, others will say
it's a fancy. And the facts are never comprehensive, the holes must be filled
in with conjecture. There is a name for this procedure, judgment, and it
takes intelligence that PC's don't have yet.

Guilty or innocent it makes no difference, when your police knock on my door
in the middle of the night I would feel utter terror. I would also feel
hopeless despair, because I'd know that my nightmare is only beginning and
will never end this side of the grave. If I'm lucky I will undergo two weeks
of Chinese water torture and then be released, for a while. My ordeal could be
repeated many times and at any time. If I'm unlucky I will be painfully and
horribly tortured by skilled professionals until death finally sets me free.
Do you really find it hard to understand why anybody and everybody would be
more than nervous when police bring them in?

No kidding. After seeing the inside of one of your torture chambers few would
ever go home again.

        >If the servants of justice really thought you were innocent they

Your faith in the intelligence and integrity of polatitions, the judges
they appoint, and other such servants of justice is touching but not entirely
realistic.

The court can issue any decision it likes on the truth or falsehood of a

should prove beyond reasonable doubt to the reader (not to a court) that his
statements are true, if he fails the slanderer is simply Ignored.

Please, forgive the intrusion, this is a one time mailing. 
We promise never to bother you again.  Please take a moment 
to read this message.  It could change your life.

If you are fortunate enough to own a large C-Band dish and 
receiver, here is some blessed news for you.  The replacement
follow-up is now available.

I am a thrifty shopper, or at least consider myself to be one
of the best.  I missed the best buy on the Net.  The lowest by 
far price can be found at SATMALL.COM for this receiver.

Some of the features are:
	1. Digital reception + the old analog
	2. Everything is automatic
	3. Updates downloads from satellite nitely
	4. Remote control camera angle change (when broadcast in
		DVD type format)
	5. Modem inside with capacity to download from Internet
	   at a blazing rate of 3.9 Gigs per second.  (Yep, that
	   is 3,900,000 plus bits per second.  Compare that to 
	   your hot just bought 56,600 slow line modem!!!)

Best thing about SATMALL.COM is the price of $679 for a new unit!!

	Check it out, see what you are missing!!

		satmall.com is for real

Actually, a far better explanation for this phenomenon lies in the 
dynamics of parliamentary systems as compared to an 
independent-executive system, and the dynamics of proportional 
representation versus district-level winner-take-all.

>From my limited exposure to European politics it appears that in most 
European nations about 2/3 of politicians -- and of 
voters -- are part of two near-permanent coalitions, with about half 
the balance being a swing group between these two coalitions and the 
other half being "fringe".  The executive is usually either a 
relatively centrist member of a party that a permanent coalition 
member, or one of the larger swing parties.  This is independent of 
the number of parties involved, and isn't really that much different 
from the US political situation except we don't label the politicians 
in the swing group as separate parties.

Just read a suggestion of implementing secure communications
through authentication, rather than encryption, technology.
The method involves adding "chaff"/noise to the message, with improper
authentication.  It can make unencrypted communications as secure as
encrypted.  Also, the U.S. gov't doesn't demand registration of
authentication keys. 

 More info is available at  http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/chaffing.txt

Yes, but I think it's overdone in a situation where the government 
mandates racism, and should be tossed, but in a manner that is 
either balanced or weighted in favor of the defendant.

Note both sides:

For a guilty verdict, a 5/6 majority
   or
For a not-guilty verdict, a simple majority.

With a six-person jury, there are seven possible vote outcomes 
(ignoring abstentions): anywhere from 0-6 to 6-0.  Today, exactly one 
outcome results in acquittal, and exactly one results in conviction; 
the other five result in mistrial and the possibility of having to do 
it all over again.

With my proposal, it is true that two outcomes result in conviction; 
but THREE result in acquittal and only two result in mistrial and a 
rerun.

On a twelve-person jury, there are thirteen possible vote outcomes.  
Exactly one results in acquittal, and exactly one results in 
conviction, with eleven leading to possible retrials.  With my 
proposal three would result in conviction and six in acquittal.

> A

A simple majority for acquittal would send more innocent people home 
without having to fret about a retrial.

I don't consider that a mistake on the jury's part.  If there's an 
error, it's on the part of the investigators for not finding that 
evidence in the first place, or on the part of the people who had the 
evidence for not bringing it forward sooner.  The jury cannot be held 
at fault for not considering the unknown.

This is unfortunately true.  My response is outside the scope of 
this particular proposal; but I'll state it anyway: a complete 
revamping of the way the court treats the jury, including but not 
limited to informing the jury IN ADVANCE of the trial that it is 
their DUTY to judge the law as well as the defendant.  Legislation 
should not deal with exceptional cases; the courts should in every 
case evaluate whether justice is served by applying the law to the 
specific case.  If a law is in itself unjust, the answer will rarely 
be "yes".

Why not point out that in the long run it made the individual

You make good points, Peter. Rants-although they are fun-rarely convince
anyone of anything. But a little rightuous anger isn't all bad, is it? I
love reading some of the arguments of the radical abolitionists of the
early 1800's. They called slavery evil and slaveholders evil people.
It's exhilerating to read them. They didn't make utilitarian arguments
against slavery, but they did have some effect on public opinion. Would
they have done better with an economic analysis of slavery which would
have shown that it made the country as a whole and the slaves, but not
the individual slaveholders, economically worse off?

Well, I hope my moral views are open to refinement. However, the
fundamentals (slavery is wrong, etc.) are not going to change. Your mind
can be so open that your brain falls out.

I suppose you have to ground all moral beliefs in some sort of
utilitarianism, since you can't prove an "ought." However, many
so-called utilitarians neglect freedom as a utility. I'm in favor of
freedom even if it means I'll be slightly worse off economically.
Utilitarianism has to mean more than economic bean counting. I think
only in a free market will we maximize human happiness in general.
Unfortunately, however, individuals can and do maximize their happiness
by coercion. That's the problem. I could have a grand old time stealing
$50 million from Bill Gates (if I didn't get caught and had no
conscience) and he'd probably barely miss the money. (He's not even
trying to spend all his money when he's alive anyway.)

Isn't the idea of unanimous verdicts to provide an extra measure of
protection to minimize the number of innocent people sent to prison? A
5/6 requirement would send more guilty people to jail, but also more
innocent ones. As it is, even unanimous juries make many mistakes. A lot
of convictions are overturned after new evidence comes out after the
trial.

Considering that most criminal defendants have to go against all of the
resources of the state with one overworked public defender, I don't want
to make it any easier for the state.

Also, a 5/6 requirement would make jury nullification more difficult. As
it is, I could cause a mistrial by refusing to convict a victimless
crime defendant and the state might not try the case again. Hence, a
victory for freedom.

Interesting paper on the theoretical level.  I used a similar technique
in 1984 to simulate allow dumb asni terminals to enter clear-text
passwords without the passwords appearing over the network clear text. 
It was not encryption, but added enough garbage going to and from the
dumb terminal from the host, that only the host could easily determine
which characters were typed from the user.

The drawbacks to the paper you cite are:
1. Huge bandwith overhead.  Adding equal amounts of chaff and real
message doubles the message size.  More chaff increases it further.

2.  Huge packet overhead.  Whole words or names would be visible in
individual packets, unless the packets are extremely small.  The paper
gives an example of 1-bit messages inside 100 bit packets.  This turns a
one-minute transmission into a 100 minute transmission!  More
accurately, the minimum TCP packet size is more like 100 BYTES, which
would be 1000 bits over a modem (with start and stop bits).  This makes
that one minute transmission time 1000 minutes, or 16 hours and 40
minutes!

3.  This method still includes secret authentication keys that must be
exchanged between the participants and known only to them.  It would be
just as easy to exchange encryption keys.  This method does not seem to
add any security, does not simplify procedures or difficulties, but does
greatly increases bandwith.

4.  The proposal seems to be based on the idea that "encryption" is
export-controlled, but this new method would not be because it is not
"encryption".  The various laws I have seen do not use a scientific
definition of "encryption".  They describe any means to hide, encode, or
make unreadable a secret message.  I think that this form of
reformatting a message to make it unreadable would be considered the
same as "encryption" by government and law enforcement agencies.

This seems to be a lawyer's trick to bypass export laws rather than a
technical solution to securing communications.

An aside ...

If my information is correct Scottish law has three outcomes: 
	Guilty - Judge determines sentence although jury can ask for clemency
	Not Guilty - Sentence cannot be imposed but new evidence can easily cause a new trial
	Innocent - all charges are dropped

Damned if I can remember where I saw/read this.

In my non-professional view, bandwidth overheads seem of
little significance for transfers of texts or money,
and achieving security from the state through faults
in its law (that has to be applied literally, and can
only catch up with such methods after years of debates,
during which there well can appear several new techniques
not envisioned by the law) seems about as good a thing as
achieving it through a technically clean method.

Most overhead in the effort of securing one's communications
goes to the struggle with social systems anyway; packet
costs do not seem that important.

 Would somebody care to summarize the codepunks conclusions
on this?

Because I don't think this is necessarily true. According to Jeff
Hummel, author of "Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men," slavery
provided a return to the slave owner that was comparable to, say,
investments in Northern textile mills. Slave holders also had part of
the cost of slavery socialized in the form of mandatory unpaid service
on slave patrols for all white males.

I can't believe slavery would have persisted for as long as it did if it
was really a bad deal (in the short or long run) for most of the
individual slave holders.

If you can convince a few big investors of this I'll buy it (I'm talking
about banks and such, they seem to know something about where to put
money). I've always understood most investors like stabile, predictable,
environments.

(sorry to be such a pain in the butt ;-) but: we then also have to take
into account how 'cost' is determined. People rioting in LA are causing
cost to individuals and companies that _may_ have been avoided if their
standard of living was better. These cost are now being paid by a limited
selection of people (who happened to own a store in the wrong
neighborhood). Is that fair? You seem to agree with me that stability may
have value (even though we can't put a price-tag on it).

That would certainly seem to be the nicest option. I also agree with
Dalibor den Otter that making a basic living standard freely available for
everyone could be a nice way to keep things stable as more and more persons
become obsolete through automation. The cost of this should become less and
less untill it becomes insignificant.

Yes but who's death when? 
Two more questions (and I can only hope they're good ;-)

I'm not at all sure that funds freed by abolishing welfare systems will end
up being invested in immortality research. Won't it simply go largly into
bigger cars, vacations and onther nice goodies?

And there is the fact that advancing research is not purely an financial
question. 'Law of diminishing returns' is the correct engglish term I
think. Pumping twice as much funding into a program won't speed it up a
factor two (it might but there's no guarantee). Based on what I hear from
neurological research this seems to be especially true for medical sciences
(as opposed to stuff like space exploration).

 >Ah, well.  Hope I've contributed well to the debate.

Yes you have (that is to say at least I'm learning something).

Wouldn't this pressure only apply at the borders? As each region
concentrates its resources on its border, the interiors of such regions
might be relatively untouched by the colonization wave. Perhaps that would
explain why we haven't observed a colonization wave.

Yes, investors LOVE safety nets; but for the wrong reasons.  Investors love
safety nets because it means that even if their investments don't pay for
themselves, the government will be there to fish them out again.  It's like
walking into a casino and knowing that the games are fixed so you'll win
every time.

Such a policy of bailing out investors is not only fraudulent, but also bad
for the economy.  Why make the people pay for some investor's lack of good
judgement?  Sure, GOOD investment is good, but bad investment serves little
useful economic purpose.

As far as political stability, yes, you're right, this is also prized by
investors.  Capitalists get scared if they think their privately owned
property in other countries will be seized by the government or burned by
rioting masses.

If I understand your argument correctly, however, you're concerned that if
(admittedly money-losing) welfare programs were NOT in place, violent
revolution would result.  I am dubious of this argument...  if we take this
argument to its logical conclusion then we must necessarily choose between
a capitalist welfare state and socialism; we could never be, for example,
libertarian, because any attempt to try it would be rejected in favor of
something more authoritarian.

If abandoning welfare DOES happen to turn out to be best for the people, I
for one have faith in the people's intelligence (yes, even the poor
people's intelligence) to understand why it's better, and therefore to not
try to revolt if such reforms take place.  If welfare does turn out to be
good for the people after all, then we rightly should have to choose
between welfare-capitalism and socialism.  But if it turns out to be BAD
for the poor, why shouldn't we try abandon it, rather than assume that they
will irrationally revolt, no matter how good our policies?

Uhm...  I'm not exactly certain how to respond to this.  Of course the
destruction of other people's property isn't fair.  That's why it's
illegal. :)

Also, isn't it a little morally questionable for anyone, even the poor, to
say "Give us your money or we'll smash up your store?"  I could maybe buy
this argument if they were literally starving in the streets, but in
America at least, we're in no way even close to this point.  America's poor
are overweight on average.

Also, I still disagree with you about the rioting.  I don't think that
violence is inevitable, but rather that the poor, being generally honest
and intelligent people, will refrain from violent upheaval if it's in their
best interests in the long run.  I'm still open to the argument that
abandoning welfare may not be better for the poor in the long run... but
that's different from saying that the poor will revolt EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST
THEIR BEST INTERESTS.

You argue that if we deny the poor welfare payments, they will steal, riot
and kill to get it back, no matter how good it might be for them in the
long run.  It seems to me that no rational person would do such a thing
unless it was absolutely the only way to avoid death.

Sadly, however, medical care is the big spender that you'll never be able
to sufficiently subsidize until we develop immortality.  You can feed the
poor, you can get clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads, (at
greater cost,) but there's always some new medicine, some new expensive
form of treatment available that might keep you alive, particularly as you
grow older and organs naturally start failing.  How much health is enough?
When can we say that we're done subsidizing life?  How is high quality
medical care to be distributed fairly not to those who have worked to
afford it?

The funds freed by abolishing welfare systems would go into everything
people buy.  That's the nature of economic growth... it provides more
wealth for everything we do and want, including vacations, including
medicine, including science, including the environment.  Also, don't forget
that hard working people get paid because you buy those cars, take those
vacations, and enjoy your goodies, who pay other hard working people for
their own goodies.  More wealth means more wealth for everything.

Maybe.  But economics has another handy rule just for this purpose: the
utility maximization rule.  This rule states that househoulds should
buy/invest in whatever they want most, up until the point where the cost of
buying more would outweigh the happiness it would bring you.

Economists conceptualize this with two curves on a graph of money invested
against output.  The first curve is the marginal utility curve, or the
extra utility you get from each extra dollar you spend.  The other curve is
the marginal cost curve, or the utility you could get by spending your
dollar on something else.  This curve is usually accelerating, as it
becomes harder and harder to get more and more dollars.  You have to do
more work, and you have to sacrifice more goods that are worth more and
more to you.

Anyway, the argument goes that you should buy more of good X up until the
point where you don't gain anymore happiness by buying more.

			Utility

Why am I mentioning this?  Because when your income increases relative to
the price of other goods, your marginal cost curve shifts to the right.
That's precisely what it means to get more income for the same work: it's
easier to get a dollar.  As a result, not only does it become easier to buy
science, food, and vacations, but you also get more of whatever you want
most, which presumably makes you happier.

Now, of course, these curves don't actually exist in this form.  But
economists explain that away by saying that even if people don't do THIS,
the model's predictive ability is rather good, so people are doing
something a lot LIKE this whenever they go to a store to buy something;
just like how the brain does something like differential equations whenever
it catches a ball, or something like probabilistic number theory when it
evaluates risks.

Household behavor, and the utility maximization rules, are primarily
micro-economics rather than macro.  Try looking there if you want more info.

Paul Wakfer responded, and allowed me to cc to these lists:

========================

The people at Biotime do this regularly. Don't forget the hamsters are
"designed" to hibernate and go to very low temperatures in the winter.
Yes, they can actually withstand a percentage of their brain water
turned to ice (I forget how much). In addition, any mammal when cooled
to near the ice point becomes stiff as a board and might appear to be
quite solid. This is because the body's structural elements are mostly
lipid and get very vicous/solid at that temperature. The dogs that 21CM
does deep hypothermia experiments on (5+ hours at 2-3'C) feel like that.
And yes you could probably knock them against a lab bench without much
damage to them (merely a small surface bruise when they were rewarmed)
because the flesh is neither brittle nor very crushable.

However, unfortunately, this and frozen frogs, fish, etc. are very
little help to our needs in cryonics. The main reason for this is that
chemistry, metabolism and biology are still proceeding and degradation
is still taking place. For example, if you took any of the species which
freeze and kept it in that state for even twice as long as the longest
that it normally is in that state, the vast majority would not survive.
Certainly, if you went out to 10 times, *none* would survive. In fact,
the only animals which can stand very long periods of "suspended
animation" are very small species which can completely desiccate (brine
shrimp, tardigrades, etc).

> I have a lot of respect for Lovelock's integrity and ingenuity.  Yet this

That's only because we believe that this approach is a waste of our
scarce resources. If we had enough money for suspended animation
research, we would certainly be looking into the possibility of using or
modifying animal anti-ice compounds.

===================

Charles Platt told me (and I quote without explicit permission):

===================

Undoubtedly the experiments he is referring to were Audrey Smith's, with 
hamsters. Extremities of the hamsters were indeed frozen solid, but 
internally the hamsters had to contain less than, I think, 60 percent 
ice, otherwise they didn't revive. Even the hamsters that were revived 
tended not to live very long, as a result of many ruptured blood vessels 
and gastrointestinal bleeding.

A "diathermy" unit was used to thaw the hamsters. As I recall, this was 
an early device using radio-frequency (RF) radiation. I think it's 
actually a little lower in the spectrum than microwaves, but is virtually 
the same thing. Originally it was used to apply heat to injured joints 
and muscles (I think).

===================

I replied:

According to Lovelock, they started out by applying a red-hot spoon to the
chest of the chilled animal to kickstart its heart.  Left nasty burns
(d'oh), so he came up with his kinder, gentler gadget.

Thanks to both gentlemen for their information.

Not at all.  Investment in slaves doesn't produce slaves
which are many times more productive than the originals.
Investment in factories does.

Kathryn Aegis confers a cute epithet in honor of my daring to disagree with
her remarks:

> Kick Graybull:

Well, Ms. Aegis may not be very mannerly, but she certainly is opinionated.
;)

For anyone who's really interested in the history of the word "man" in
English, I suggest a quick survey of English literature from Beowulf to
Spencer. Judge for yourself whether the word ever fell out of use or was
introduced or reintroduced (not sure what her contention here is, she seems
to equivocate).

As for the "superposition" of Latin grammar on English, yes, certain
self-styled "grammarians" of yore tried to impose a Latin paradigm on
English, with ludicrous results. The grammar of the language bent not a bit
to their whims, but continued its natural evolution. Such newfangled "rules"
as managed to gain some circulation in "cultured" discourse (no prepositions
at end of phrase, etc.) are matters of usage and style, not grammar.

The jury is supposed to find a person guilty of a criminal offense only
if the evidence proves him guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt." Of course
the jury cannot be held responsible for not considering the unknown.
However, if evidence surfaces after the trial that exonerates the
defendant, I think it's fair to say that the jury made a mistake in
concluding that the evidence presented at the trial proved the
defendants guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt." Now if witnesses lied at
the trial or if false evidence was presented, that is another story. In
any case, juries ought to be more careful about sending people off to
prison or to the executioner.

Sometimes the truth is not reasonable.

My favorite newfangled rule is the Latin: "It is I/he/she" rather than
the 
English: "It is me/him/her."

Hi Jim,

Well, sorry to say that they are not going to publish it:

The exact words from the sci-fi-specialist (whatever that may be)
"too American" & "the persons are just there to surround the technical
details"

Well...needless to say that IMO they got it all wrong, So.....there
is more work to be done. Maybe I should publish it myself :-)

Anyway, I will keep you posted.

How are things going over there?

Greetings,

Berrie

	Well, what do you think of NASA's announcement that they will
have an orbit which allows for Cydonia to be imaged?  What do you
think the chances are of it being an artificial structure and why?
What impact will it have in our society, political, religious and
scientific.  I've little doubt what it would mean to the arts.
Lastly, would a Mars mission become an immediate priority? Thanks,
look forward to your replies.

I think they'll either fail to get images of the 'face' and then the
face-fanatics will claim that it's a cover-up, or they'll get images
which show it's natural and the face-fanatics will claim they're fakes
or that careful analysis of single pixels shows that they're still
artificial.

At least 10:1 against; there are many face-like rocks on Earth and I'd
have been very surprised if there wasn't a single one on Mars.

So I think the 'Mars Face' is just a fantasy... the Io Rubber Chicken
(http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/082796.html), however...

I assume you're talking Dutch banks; British banks made many hideously
stupid investment decisions in the 80s.

Of course they do; they want all the payback with no risk. But that's not
how the world works. You think a Singularity will be stable and predictable?

Are they rioting in LA again, or are you talking about the last big
riots? Either way, if your only argument for welfare programs is that if
we don't pay off the poor they'll beat us up, then you're getting into
incredibly dangerous territory. You say that the costs of rioting might
be lower if the rich paid them off... the rich could just as well say
that the cost of rioting would be much lower if they just shot the
rioters on sight; absent gun control laws you could pick up a used
machinegun and a couple of thousand rounds for much less than a year's
welfare tax payments.

Immortality *is* one of those 'other nice goodies'. Poor societies don't
develop immortality. Stable, predictable societies don't develop immortality.
Only unstable, unpredictable, rich societies do.

Anyway, as the Year-2000 bug looks set to take down the IRS in the next
couple of years (along with numerous other federal and state agencies) 
the question of welfare in America is probably moot.

You left out a significant factor: slaves are self-reproducing, and

Id think the face wasnt real if there wasnt a pyramid, i think pyramids are a
little harder to produce naturally than a face, and the fact that the face is
within walking distance of the pyramid... 
not only is there a pyramid, but supposedly there is are also 5 pyramids
arranged in a pentagon, also in cydonia.
when will cydonia be photographed?

here is the original NASA photograph of the face and the pyramid in the same
picture:  www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/4698/viking.html   
there are links from there to lots of other places, reports etc...

Personally, I'm shocked at the lack of press coverage over the Y2k
problem. As many of you CS know, its only a matter of time now before
our country and many of the worlds economic structures take their worst
beatings in history. Does anyone know of a website which organizes the
information in a professional/scientific assessment?

I've only heard a little in the press. This is probably because they
don't want to exacerbate the problem by having people with lots of money
withdrawing their portions from the world banks.. but that's only a
small part of the hysteria this computer malfunction could bring on..

This will probably make me sound like more a quack than I already am, but
how many people here have heard Richard Hogland's presentation about this
set of structures?

Not being a scientist, I felt his ideas compelling. Does anyone know who
or what I'm talking about??

(-:

Jeff

ps-
If you scroll to the bottom of his site:
http://www.enterprisemission.com/stores.html you can order his video
and/or buy his book which have more details. The video is what I
experienced, but those who read the book said that it was difficult to
turn away from his calculations.

Here's some text used to sell a video from R.Hoagland's website, for
those who didn't feel like launching netscape during email, it may
appear to be flakey (if not entertaining) but its worth checking out:

On February 28, 1992, at the invitation of a United Nations staff
special interest group (SIG), Richard C. Hoagland took his case to the
U.N. Speaking before hundreds of U.N. staff, delegates and invited press
and guests, Hoagland extends his intelligence hypothesis concerning the
mystery of Cydonia, to planet Earth: demonstrating that the same
mathematical  message encoded in the layout of the ruins on Mars is also
found at many of the mysterious ruins on this planet. With many stunning
slides and film clips, Hoagland shares his insights into a new science
of "fourth dimensional physics" gleaned from the Cydonia research, a
physics that opens the door to unlimited energy sources that could
revolutionize our technologies, if not  change the way we think about
the universe itself. The last 24 minutes of Vol. 2 contain an analysis
of the extraordinary footage, captured by NASA on September 15, 1991,
when the U.S. space shuttle Discovery recorded what appears to be
UFO-like spacecraft cruising over the Indian Ocean at enormous speeds,
turning at right angles and accelerating to several hundred thousand
miles per hour after being "shot at" by two missile-like flashes,
violating all current laws of physics. The fact that this video was
broadcast live over NASA's own satellite channel (NASA Select), leads us
to believe that this was a "U.S. black budget" project, test leaked from
the highest offices at NASA -- despite NASA's current claim that the
film shows only "ice crystals from a waste water dump". Shortly after
this video was aired, the head of NASA, former astronaut and commander
of the first U.S. S. Enterprise space shuttle, Admiral Richard Truly,
was abruptly fired. Hoagland believes that he and his associates have an
important inside track on what this striking video really represents,
given the "hyperdimensional" physics found encoded in the ruins of
Cydonia. Once you see this video, you will be convinced that this is the
"smoking gun" that proves that something extraordinary has been
happening in the solar system, if not on planet Earth, for a long, long
time . . . something that up until now, we have not been "permitted" to
know. Question: now that we do know -- what do we plan to do about it?

People are so busy looking at the Year 2000 problem, that they are
ignoring the Year 1999 problem!  Many computers and software programs
mark the year as "99" as a special case to mean "infinity" or "not
applicable" or some other flag.  In many instances, the "99" won't
correctly be processed as a valid year.  I expect many programs to fail
a year earlier than expected!

Yes, reluctantly.

All I will say is this: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary
proof. His data is all based on some substandard original photos! We
need better data before anyone can claim anything.

Using Occam's razor, the null hypothesis (it is natural) is the winner.
However, Cydonia might be proven real too. The new data will be very
helpful.

You have to be careful in interpreting information about the Y2K problem.
Many of the people sounding the alarm are selling Y2K services or books,
so they have a vested interest in making it sound bad.  Others are
die-hard survivalists for whom this is the latest issue to justify the
same predictions of disaster they've been making for years.

Ed Yourdon's book, Time Bomb 2000, gives a good overview of the potential
problems.  He has a web site at http://www.yourdon.com/index.htm which
includes discussion forums, although they are dominated by disasterists.
Gary North is one of the pre-eminent apocalyptics, with lots of up to date
information at http://www.garynorth.com.  However North is a Christian
fundamentalist who believes for religious reasons that the world will
come to an end at the millennium.

Just because the field is dominated by nut cases and people who benefit
from predictions of disaster doesn't mean that there's no problem, of
course.  To believe that is to fall into the ad hominen fallacy.

A less biased source of information is at the Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility web site, http://www.cpsr.org/program/y2k/.
They have a working group on the Y2K problem, including "rumor central"
which includes various predictions with estimates of how reliable they
are.  However the site doesn't seem to have been updated recently.

The problem is that there is very little hard information available
to judge the extent of the problem.  The problem is widespread, with
many different manifestations, each of which is being dealt with in
different ways.  It's like an inkblot test, where what people see in
it depends more on their predispositions than the available data.

It could be the worst disaster ever to hit western civilization, the end
of the world as we know it, with all of our infrastructure crashing -
no communications, no power, no transportation, no food.  Or it could
be no more than an annoying, expensive nuisance, with some localized
disruptions in the early part of the year 2000, gradually being fixed
and coming under control.

Broadly speaking, the problem can be technically divided into three
categories:

 - Mainframes, the big old computers running old programs written in Cobol,
   PL/1, and other old-fashioned programming languages.

 - Personal computers, where the operating systems and/or applications
   may not be Y2K compliant, and which may also have custom spreadsheets
   and database programs which can have Y2K bugs of their own.

 - Embedded systems, the microprocessor chips which are nearly universal
   in industrial control today.

Each of these has their own vulnerabilities and their own requirements for
analysis and repair.

You can then break it down crosswise into sectors: government, industry,
consumer goods, transportation, communication, power, etc.  To understand
the extent of the danger, you've got to look at each entry in the resulting
matrix and try to judge what is likely to happen, and how bad things will
be as a result.  It's a big, messy problem, with no easy answers.

Apart from the severity of the Y2K problem itself is the danger posed by
panic as we approach 2000.  We could see bank runs, stock market collapse,
hoarding and other problems if people get scared.  This will depend on
how the media spins it, and since disasters sell more papers than good
news, I suspect things are going to be pretty rough in late 1999.

Even though the photos may be low res, would not calculations made based on
the relative relationships with in the scene still be valid?

How valid is data based on measurments like this?

I hadn't even considered this.

I wonder how many people with MONEY will remove their cash from the bank
and turn it into gold?? What abou Bill Gates. Anyone care to speculate on
the outcome of his financials?


Is there enough gold in circulation for him to exchange his bank notes
for???


BILLIONS...


something to consider...

Does anyone here know about a study done a while ago where a human body

jeff@ultraviolet.com writes regarding Richard Hoagland.

I read Hoagland's book about Cydonia many years ago, and it was completely
unconvincing.

The problem is that the shapes are not obviously artificial.  Yes,
some of them are roughly pyramidal, but I can find rocks that have a
similar shape.  You have to look at the weathering and erosion and other
factors that carve these rocks.  The Martian experts who have done so
believe that these shapes are the products of natural erosion.

Jeff also mentions Hoagland's video tape analysis of events on a 1991
space shuttle flight.  This is STS-48, and a good resource for information
about the controversy is http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/sts-48.html.
You can read there the questionable reasoning of the UFO believers.
James Oberg, a well known space expert, says that all the video shows is
particles near the shuttle being pushed by its thrusters.  See Oberg's
analysis at http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/oberg.html.

Hoagland's web site at http://www.enterprisemission.com claimed shortly
after the Mars rover landed that they had found all kinds of artifacts in
the surface pictures: military vehicles, technical equipment, cannisters
of various sorts.  Everyone else just sees rocks.  Hoagland has also
claimed to have seen a crystal city on the moon by enhancing Apollo
images.

In my mind, Hoagland has no credibility.  He may be deluding himself,
or he may just be deluding others, but either way he is not a reliable
source of information.

But how bad will it really be? How will the y2k problem affect simple 
things like your PC, web access and email? For example, can we 
expect this list to crash? (now *there's* something really serious)... 

Something else: everybody's talking about the negative sides of this
alleged crash, but as with most disasters there must be ways to
(greatly) profit from it. Although most people got hit in for example
the crash of '29, some became millionaires overnight. There must be
ways to profit from the (potential) chaos that will follow the y2k
problem, and not just as a programmer. It would be stupid to let
a golden opportunity like this one pass...Any suggestions? ;-)

It gets even better:
Many Management Information Systens and logistical/inventory programs and
such use future dates for all kinds of operations. Depending on their (lack
of) Y2K readiness and the customizing done by users these programs will
start failing anytime now and some already have.
I posted a rather juicy example to the list in oktober:

But it's not just computers, all kinds of electronic appliances nowadays
have integrated circuits. Often these are bought from small subcontracting
companies and by now no-one knows the exact design of many of these
circuits. Is your VCR Y2K compliant? The hardware of your PC? The time-lock
of your bank (it stays closed on sundays)?

I also read somewhere (but have not been able to confirm it) that the
GPS-navigation satellites will 'run out of dates' by the end of _this_
year. It seems their calender is based on counting weeks since 1-1-1980 and
by next september or something they will run out of memory. Can anyone
confirm this story?

I stand by my position. Hummel points out that the return on an
investment in slaves ranged between 8 to 12 per cent, comparable to the
return on capital from an investment in railroads or textile mills.

You are wrong in assuming that slavery absorbed investment income. 
Slavery just resulted in a transfer of funds from slaveowners to
slavetraders. Trading slaves no more absorbed savings than trading land
or any other real asset.

The lack of industrialization in the South did not reflect a cost of
slavery. Even without slavery, it still would have been more beneficial
for the South to specialize in agriculture. It's extremely unlikely
textile mills would have sprung up in Mississippi even with a totally
free labor market.

Most of the benefits of the vastly improved productivity of Northern
factories accrued to consumers in the form of lower prices. Investors
benefitted, but no more so than Southern slaveholders.

Why in the world would well educated Southerners invest in slaves if
they could receive a far higher return on their money by investing in
Northern factories or other investments? You are arguing that they were
fools, totally unaware of business and markets. I disagree.

One consideration I read recently:

If Social Security makes errors in 1% of its checks,
then next week 250,000 people will call its offices
which will completely overwhelm its response capacities
for all problems, and create a huge number of exceptions
that the system is not prepared to handle even under normal
conditions - and that can trigger many more yet unfixed parts
of y2k-related code.

Many social systems are sensitive to rates of change, rather
than amplitudes.  Needs for many resources change like that,
etc.

I think lack of press is to a large extent explained by the
fact that people cannot understand the unusual system issues.
It's much easier to attract public attention with teenage
shooting or political scandals.  Even serious journalists
have no clue who to believe on the issues, and cannot suggest
any reasonable coverage - though this exactly the reason why
the issue should be debated more, not less.

The profit strategy for the disaster scenario should be quite
simple: buy lots of small exchangeable things and tangible
property with borrowed money, and get out of locations with
potential riots.

Profit strategy for a milder scenario must be more complicated;
there should be companies, currencies, and goods that will
react differently to financial perturbations.  Does Japan
have the same amount of outdated code?  If not, buying yen
options together with precious metal options ("far out of the
money") could be a good idea.  Are there companies providing
work force for answering services or private guards?

There are several sites and at least a couple of newsgroups
devoted to possible social and economic consequences of this
problem.

And then, there are other things - it appears that much of
financial software can't handle Dow indexes over 10,000 - that's
a "D10K" problem - and it will hit at about the same time as Y2K...

Hello everybody! On the WTA action list we have been discussing an 
updated formulation of a set of transhumanist principles. The latest 
version is as follows. Comments and suggestions are welcome...

------------
Transhumanist Principles 2.1

(1) Humanity will be radically changed by technology in the future. We
foresee the feasibility of redesigning the human condition, including
such parameters as the inevitability of ageing, limitations on human
and artificial intellects, unchosen psychology, suffering, and our
confinement to the planet earth.

(2) Serious effort should put into understanding these coming
developments and their long-term consequences.

(3) Transhumanists believe that by being generally open and embracing
of new technology we have a better chance of turning it to our
advantage than if we try to ban or prohibit it.

(4) Transhumanists advocate the moral right for those who so wish to
use technology to extend their mental and physical capacities and to
improve their control over nature. We seek personal growth beyond our
current biological limitations.

(5) In planning for the future, it is mandatory to take into account
the prospect of dramatic technological progress. It would be tragic if
the enormous potential benefits failed to materialize because of
ill-motivated technophobia and unnecessary prohibitions. On the other
hand, it would also be tragic if intelligent life went extinct because
of some disaster or war involving advanced technologies.

(6) We need to create forums where people can rationally debate what
needs to be done, and a social order where responsible decisions can
be implemented.

(7) Transhumanists support scientific humanism. Though as a matter of
fact most transhumanists believe in individual freedom, transhumanism
in itself is politically neutral.

You might want to consider stock index options. You can bet that the market
will climb, fall, or either over a certain period by at least a certain
amount. You would probably want to purchase these options as early as
possible, but the earlier you buy - the higher the premium. Read up on it.

Leaving aside the matter of empathy and what such a program would do to the
people following such nauseating advice, this is not really the sort of
recommendation I would hope to see touted in a gathering of extropians.
(But after a couple of years on this list, I'm not altogether *surprised*
to see it raised.)

I doubt you'd get it being untouched for very long, but you'd have to 
work out a model to better see.   My paper suggests that maybe a colonization
wave *did* pass by here, its just that they didn't stay around long.

In my model, they may not stay around long enough to build visible artifacts.

Why would you want to buy earlier if you have to pay a higher premium?
Actually, the premium grows if the common model of the market stays the same.
If today everybody is sure that the market volatility is going to be limited,
but a week from now everybody starts expecting huge market swings, then the
premium will *increase*.

A set of slides from the military office responsible for GPS describes
this problem as well as Y2K compliance issues at:

http://www.laafb.af.mil/SMC/CZ/homepage/y2000/y2k/tsld001.htm

According to slide 4,

      GPS system time counts weeks from midnight 5-6 Jan 1980 in modulo
      1024 (0-1023)

      No year or century data is included in the Navigation Message -
      Subframe 1 (Word 3)

      GPS week rolls over from week 1023 to week 0000 at midnight 21-22
      August 1999 and approximately every 20 years thereafter

      Clearly documented in ICD-GPS-200, para 3.3.4(b)

      GPS receiver manufacturers responsible for their designs conforming
      to ICD-GPS-200

So the problem occurs the night of August 21, 1999, when the week counter
rolls over from 1023 to 0.  This is part of the GPS spec but some
receivers may not have been thoroughly tested for proper operation during
this transition.

The other slides indicate that the GPS satellites themselves have been
verified to have Y2K and rollover compliance, but some of the ground
support software is on older mainframes and has some Y2K issues.
I gather that the ground software would not affect the operation of
the satellites in terms of giving out good data, but would affect the
military's own use of the satellites.

My company makes data communicatons switches. We've been in business for 12
years, and we acquired another company which has been in business even longer.
We now have three ongoing product lines and ten or more "mature" product lines
which are still being used by customers but which are no longer being marketed.
There are probably a thousand companies in a similar situation.

We are characterizing all our products' Y2K behaviour. For mature products, we
will
tell the customers what to expect. For ongoing products, we have already
verified that the latest releases are fully Y2K compliant. In general, our
products are in good shape, except for some products that are based
workstations or PCs. We use UNIX workstations or our network management system.
The oldest supported workstations are Apollos. The workstation manufacturer
doesn't commit to Y2K compliance in the OS.
Some of our switches are based on PCs. Because of the very high rate of
progress in the PC industry, we basically used a new motherboard and BIOS every
year. Guess what? the clock/calendar primitives for a PC are in the BIOS and
depend on clock chips on the motherboard. This means we've shipped product with
ten or so different motherboard configs, and we've had to characterize them
all. The new ones are Y2K compliant. The older ones are not, and will give
confused dates and times after midnight, 1 Jan, 2000. Most of them will work
just fine if they are re-booted after that time. Customers using the
non-compliant PCs must either upgrade or must be willing to take the equipment
out of service for a minute or two at the proper time.

Very few ICs care about the date. A few embedded systems care. Your wristwatch

I haven't heard it, but let's do some credibility analysis.

First analysis: is this way of tracking dates viable?  It seems to me 
that a GPS satellite would need a great deal higher precision than 
this.  If they used off-the-shelf date hardware of the sort routinely 
used in PCs, then some GPS satellites may have a 
year-2000 problem and some won't.

Second analysis: does this way of tracking dates lead to the 
predicted effect?  For convenience round to 50 weeks per year.  A 
one-byte week number would provide 5 years; this system, with 1980 as 
the base, would run out of dates in late 1984, not 1998.  A two-byte 
week number would provide nearly 25 years, and run out of dates 
sometime in 2004, not 1998.  A three- or four-byte week number would 
throw the die-off so far out in the future that the satellites will 
be replaced before then anyway.

So the story as stated is clearly not credible.

(Caveat: sometimes *reality* is not credible.)

I'm certainly no expert but my understanding is that if I somehow have the
ability to accurately predict a volatile market move tomorrow, then I am
rewarded ny having to pay a smaller premium for the option.  If, on the
other hand, I want to have the luxury of betting that something volatile
will happen over the next 30 days, then I must expect top pay more for the
option.  At some point, the increase in premium outweighs to potential
profit.  My guess is that the media will work the public into a selling
frenzy and the market will plummet whether it's rationally based or not.
Besides options, you might consider selling commodity contracts on index
futures. You could ride the wave longer once the downtrend really begins.

Hal,

Thanks for including my first name multiple times in your tasteful and
empirical viewpoint of the pseudo-science culture.


Unfortunately, I don't know enough about what he's written to form any solid
opinions, nor have I viewed his videos. I simply find the 'concepts' engaging
and it is not completely important whether they are valid observations. I've
listened to him speak a few times and I have to say, he's a bit of a nutter.
But he's still *very* entertaining. (-:

btw Hal, Hoagland is "a well known space expert." If what he claims is true,
he's consulted with NASA for a long time. Perhaps not recently, but certainly
at one time.

You know this really brings up another question: "How many of you believe in
the existence of extra terrestrial biological entities?"

I'm not asking this as a UFO nut, I'm sure by this time I must sound like
one. I'm just curious how many of you REALLY believe its likely we're not
alone.

If most people (both poor and rich) make their decisions rationally and
based on their long-term interests and those interests are best served by a
libertarian style of governing then why aren't the libertarian parties huge?

Two possibilities (AFAIKT):

1. Most people do not make al of their decisions rationally and don't
always take their long-term interests into consideration. This would
explain why there are still many people smoking cigarettes, climbing
mountians and riding bikes without a helmet.

2. Libertarianism is not in the best interest of most people and they vote
accordingly (for a minority group it is, or seems to be, in their best
interests and they also vote accordingly).

Personally I think it's a combination of both. If a true libertarian party
wins a national election in the US or a major European country and that
country is still well (preferrebly better) after few years I'll change my
opinion and congratulate everybody on this list who had more foresight than
I did.

Untill then,
Greetings

Arjen

Mark Crosby pointed us to a debate between Steven Pinker and Steven Rose,
published at the Edge website, for which I am very grateful.  (I've previously
endorsed the Edge - www.edge.org - as perhaps the highest quality discussion
forum on the net, but hadn't been there since the Pinker/Rose debate had been
put up on their site.)  Whether you read Pinker's book or not, reviewing the
debate documented at the Edge is fascinating reading.

Then, in a message dated 98-03-23 10:58:39 EST, Mark Crosby wrote:

As it happens, although I haven't read Rose's most recent book "Lifelines", I
have read his book "The Making of Memory".  Ironically, in light of some of
the criticisms of Pinker's book others have made, I wouldn't have endorsed
Rose's book here because I didn't find all that much in "The Making of Memory"
that added to a deep understanding of cognitive science (technically, it was
too finely focused on the neurochemistry of memory formation to be of wide
general interest, or so I would have thought) and the writing was a bit too
personalistic in a way I didn't find particularly appealing (perhaps lacking
the humor of the many brief detours one finds in Pinker's book).

With regard specifically to the Pinker/Rose debate, as a professional
rhetorician I found Rose's part of the discussion very patently an attack on a
straw man, which Pinker correctly pointed out.  Rose and other "computational
evolutionary psychologists" (to coin a term) are not nearly the simple
reductionists that Pinker makes out. Pinker clearly states many times in his
book and in the debate that some important aspects of cognition cannot be
understood fully or really with any depth at all without an analysis of
higher-order cognitive constructs (e.g.. beliefs and desires), that such
constructs are very REAL and, if I understand the overarching theory he and
many others espouse, that the richness of human mental life is PRIMARILY a
function of the immensely complex action of such high-order mental phenomena.
In this regard, I think that one could only characterize Pinker and his
colleagues as lying "at the extreme end of the spectrum" by ignoring this
important point.

Well, he was just responding to some syncophantic foolishness with equally
foolish statements. However, as the case in Arkansas this week unfolds, as well
as similar cases, it seems that the geeks in this world are starting to put
their feet down and arent' gonna take any more shit from the mundanes of the
world anymore. Species differentiation, at least on a cultural level, may be
begininning. Geeks of the world unite!!!! Put down the oppression of the
beautiful people!!! One disadvantage nerds have is that they are outnumbered by
the morons, however what they lack in numbers they make up for in brains...

I buy this for pioneering autoreplicators, but 1) due to mutations,
they will spawn off squatters 2) squatters are soon to follow
pioneer's footsteps, anyway. A single squatter can amplify a single
galaxy scale within a few 100 kYears, resulting in stellar-scale 
artefacts as a side effect of its metabolism. If life is to maximize 
computation, it will restructure matter accordingly, starting with 
kinetically most accessable resources first. In any case should pretty 
drastic system-scale effects become observable on the 0.1-1 kYear
scale. 

ciao,

You would not kill more then 90%, the other 10% would learn to avoid your guns
and
fight back.  The remaining 10% would be much harder to kill.  A small
percentage of
that 10% will evolve into your worst nightmare.

You forgot the third possibility:

3.  People don't believe that it is in their long term interests.  Either
they have never heard arguments for libertarianism or they simply believe
these arguments to be incorrect.

The third is a highly relevant factor in this situation; after all, we're
having this discussion, aren't we?  Of course, Possibility 3 alone is
sufficient to kill elections, which may explain why the libertarian party
isn't as large as it might be.

This is a good policy; the economy is rather complex and there may be some
factors which I have not yet thought of.  My bet is on that state which
chooses libertarianism growing rich within about twenty or thirty years.

Best of luck!

Oops -- I meant "Pinker and other 'computational evolutionary psychologists'
(to coin a term) are not nearly the simple reductionists that Rose makes out."

I suppose Rose by any other name would be just as much of a pinko.

Once NASA photos disprove once and for all this "Face on Mars" idiocy,
you can be sure the true believers will be claiming a conspiracy to hide
the truth. Oliver Stone will then probably make a movie about it. :-)

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com


A list-member challenged the holistic-identity statement 
X=X+~X (the identity of X includes ~X by relation) by 
arguing that it does not allow us to predict facts
about nature, unlike the atomist identity state-
ment X=X. That argument is perfectly false

and here is the proof...


 SCENARIO: There are two objects, A and B,
 traveling in different directions; then 
 the velocity of A is suddenly increased. 

 PROBLEM: Predict what happens to the velocity of B.


The X=X atomist-identity theory predicts that the velocity 
of B is not altered, since an identity attribute, X, of B 
(of which velocity is one) is X free from not-X, X=X. 

The X=X+~X holistic-identity theory predicts that the velocity
of B is altered exactly inverse to the alteration of the velocity 
of A, since an identity attribute, X, of B is X only by relation
to A, so if the X of A increases relative to B, the X of B will
decrease in the exact proportion -- zero-sum conservation law.
This prediction is true, and the atomist prediction is false.

ERGO: Not only does the holistic-identity theory allow us to
make an accurate prediction about the world prior to testing,
but the atomist-identity theory leads us directly to a FALSE
prediction about the nature of the physical world!


"Relativity" simply defines the holism of identity and the fact
that the identities of A and ~A overlap one another, in exactly
the fashion that atomism denies by ignore-ance of the facts.

Identity is difference, and difference is symmetrical, and thus 
identity is conserved, which is to say (as I have proven) that 
net identity, or net difference, always equals zero. Identity 
conservation: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/matrix.htm

A really good way to lose weight is becoming a vegetarian. The health

Have any of you seen the comment in Wired, page 186, referring
to extropians as "the dark side"?  Seemed an odd appellation
from a magazine that espouses extropian ideas so often.

You can if you document your life (mini audio/video) and/or others, like
the government are doing it for you. Monitoring most streets and other
public places is completely feasible even with today's technology. Apart
from that, forensics have gotten pretty good too.

Certainly not all cases are *that* difficult. Taped crimes are pretty
straigtforward,
and the criminals hardly ever bother to try to debunk recorded (video etc.)
evidence, _when they're guilty_ After all, what is there left to say. More
surveillance means more recorded crimes (after all, most criminals aren't too
bright) which means more clearcut cases that can be handled by the central
justice computer (the purpose of which is to maintain consequence in judicial
matters, elliminating whimsical decisions where possible). It may not be the
'magic bullet', but it sure would be an improvement over the present situation,
and that's what counts. Really tough cases could be left to (teams of) human 
judges ('till the advent of AI), who would only have to take care of a fraction of
the
cases due to automatization. Precedent would be binding to assure maximal
consequence of justice. Systems that work on this basis automatically get 
better with time. Judges would be required to take "common sense" tests as
part of their training.

Recorded cases are almost always simple, and they will become the majority
of cases as surveillance becomes omnipresent. As a bonus, the crimes that
threaten society most like street violence will be hit the hardest by increased
surveillance.

If the tape shows some guys beating an old lady and taking her wallet then there
is little left to the imagination. Many cases are in fact quite simple, because
many offenders are dumb. Miss Marple-esque murder mysteries aren't exactly
the rule, you know.

If the prosecution has made a strong case, you will be convicted in *any*
country. Where the burden of proof exactly lies isn't that important, what 
counts is who can produce conclusive evidence. When in doubt, don't
convict (but keep a possibility open for a retrial). This seems like a pretty
secure system.

No, obviously there would have to be strict rules regarding the further 
questioning of suspects and re-opening the trial. Cases like O.J. Simpson, 
where an obvious murderer can never be brought to justice because 
the judicial system fucked up the first time around must be prevented
however. This means that even if someone has initially been found innocent,
he *can* be tried for the same crime at a later date if new evidence comes
up.

No such luck. You may temporarily pass out at best ;-) Unless of course
you mean the torture that is applied to especially cruel/multiple murderers,
which they duly deserve.

That depends on the public's trust in the system, the PR of the police etc. If that
is good, people won't be too scared when politely asked to come to down to the
station. Most of the investigation has been done in secret anyway, so that the
suspect isn't aware that the police are on to him and may incriminate himself
further by his actions. At the stage that someone is requested to appear at a
hearing it must already be 99% (so to speak) sure that he's guilty.

How come? Torture is done with "surgical precision", so that no-one dies.

This was meant as a bit of sarcasm, regarding the "innocent until proven
guilty" idea. In reality, you are already more or less convicted (by everyone)
if the police pick you up. And it must be said that in many cases this
suspicion is justified.

Slandering isn't limited to books, and since many people just loooooove gossip
and don't care too much about the truth, one has to prevent assholes from
unduly ruining someone's reputation. Slandering is like trowing someone to
the wild beasts (the dumb malicious people), and should be minimized in any
decent society. After all, security and stability are among the main reasons we
have societies in the first place.

The damage has been done by then, and is often irreversible. You might take 
the slanderer down with you, but that won't undo the damage to your reputation.
It's better to prevent it alltogether, by law.

I don't know why I'm playing the side of the believer, but it seems like
the underdog is always worth rooting for. Why are you supposedly
open-minded people so into calling it the "Face on Mars" idiocy???

(sorry if I over generalized)

But it seems that until its proven one way or the other, you should at
least remain open to the possibility that yeah, life MAY have existed
there..  Perhaps its more complex than reducing it to a simple 50-50
chance, but it seems like with any bold new discovery there needs to be an
chance that something extraordinary might be true.

I wish that I could put this into better words, it just seems like this
whole thing gets reduced to fiction WAY too quickly. Lets wait to see what
is found before calling it reducing it to the ideas of the deluded.

By the way, as much as you'd like to think, our government HAS not been
very straight with us in the past. In fact, our US Government has done some
absolutely heinous things AND covered them up in the name of national
security.

deluxe - the delusional mad conspiracy freak! (-:

The last weeks this list has honestly been rather non-extropian and
uninteresting (but loud). I think it is time for each of us to take a
bit of responsibility and try to increase the quality level and
relevance here.

Here is a suggestion for something well worth discussing:

How to integrate the various enhancement technologies that interests
us into a working lifestyle? There are lots of useful pieces out
there: caloric restriction, wearable computers, cognitive tools,
nutrient supplements, external tools and useful habits. How to
integrate them into our lives in a flexible manner (we will want to
replace them with better versions later and add more as they appear)
to maximize our potential in the hear-and-now? What strategies work
best, how do we motivate ourselves to change our lives?

It's more fun to discuss nonsense with interesting (and more or less 
like-minded) people than it is to discuss interesting stuff with shallow people.
But I suppose you're right...

Well, here are some ideas:

First of all, if you haven't done it already, sign up for cryonic suspension.
This is just about *the* most transhuman thing to do right now, not just because
it's a practical solution to a serious problem (death), but also a statement of
personal empowerment and a tangible 'commitment' to transhumanism.

Also, it might be a good idea to wear miniature cameras and microphones on
your clothing (preferably well hidden) whenever possible, and especially during
important events like signing deals, making bets etc. You never know when
this hard evidence might come in handy.

When in dangerous areas (like the USA), wear a kevlar vest as often as
possible. It may not be a force field, but it can prevent some nasty injuries.

Learn some simple street fighting skills, and/or carry mace and a stun gun/
knife. If possible, learn to use and carry a gun.

Use food supplements like Green Magma (young barley leaf powder that can 
best be mixed with fizzy mineral water) with every meal to compensate for
lack of vegetables.

Smoke MJ every now and then for fun, as an aphrodisiac, and to permanently
enhance critical thinking skills and sensory imput.

Buy your own tropical island (some are as cheap as $ 50,000) and live 
autonomously (or use for vacations). Of course, this is not for everyone.

Use DHEA and/or carnitine for fat control, muscle buildup without training and
increased fitness (among other things).

Note: I don't do all the above myself, although I should. Just too damn lazy. Any
tips on how to increase one's motivation?

 Not with a primarily economic argument. But an emphasis on how the
problems with catching runaway slaves motivated the slaveholders to
erode the right to a fair trial which everyone else valued would
probably have done less to create a bloody war than the absolutist
rhetoric they actually used.

 That clearly argues for a rule that discourages theft, but does it
argue for a religious type rule, or does it argue for a belief more
like "theft penalizes everyone by forcing them to spend more defending
against theft"? Probably depends on how smart the people you're trying
to sell the rule to are.

My credit cards and drivers license do not yet have the ability to issue
cards beyond the year 2000.  Both keep giving me cards that expire
12/31/99.  I used to get some cards that lasted 5 years.  If they don't get
the systems fixed by the year 2000, they won't be able to use the computers
to issue new cards.

Have you ever been in a bank when the computer was down?  I have.  They
absolutely refused to give me my money.  Legal threats were of no use.
They really have no mechanism to issue cash or record transactions without
the computer.  Even if they did have a method, they would probably be too
scared to use it.  If their computer goes down on January 2, 2000, I doubt
they could handle it.  Even if they had paper transactions, it would be
much slower and there would be more mistakes.

Businesses that are not ready will fail.  Not because alternatives aren't
available, but because customers will simply switch to other businesses
that are functional.  Would any customer go to a gas station that can't
accept your pay-at-the-pump card, when the one across the street can?
Would any customer go to a grocery store where they can't use their debit
card, when the store down the street can?  The first trip to a business
where the customer is sent away empty-handed because the business can't
handle the transaction, would be enough to turn off most customers.  I
think this perception of poor business practices will kill most businesses
that are not ready.

Good point Anders. I was wondering about this very issue months ago. I
would hope that the number of emails would slow down a bit too if there
weren't so many tangents being explored here..

There are so many intelligent people on this list who are fascinated by
what others on the list think about a wide variety of topics and it
becomes very easy to slip away into socio/political issues which might not
directly relate to posthumanism.

Sorry if I contaminated the stream. (-;

I am working on a posthuman project right now. Its a conceptual animation
in a kind of music video format. I'm still interested in getting my mind
around a body of work which documented the constituent parts of the human
body broken down into a list. I'd love to know if ANYONE out there knows
what I'm talking about and might give me a lead.

When I'm done with the video I'll put some stills on a web site for your
inspection.

Thanks for listening to me babble on once again...

Your work has much to commend it.  I am not sure that it qualifies as a
statement of *principles*, however.  Perhaps you ought to consider calling it
something else--a declaration, maybe, or a statement of policy.

I here offer an analysis of your rhetoric.  Please understand that I aim
merely at the rhetoric--not the substance--of your work.  The substance looks
fairly good (but see my comments to the last paragraph).

Paragraph one merely makes a predictive claim: Here comes radical change.  As
such, then, it doesn't sound like a statement of principle.

>(1) Humanity will be radically changed by technology in the future. We
>foresee the feasibility of redesigning the human condition, including
>such parameters as the inevitability of ageing, limitations on human
>and artificial intellects, unchosen psychology, suffering, and our
>confinement to the planet earth.

Para. (2) makes a normative claim; it probably qualifies as a statement of
principle, though even here the moderate and policy-oriented flavor of the
statement makes "principle" sound a bit too strong.

>(2) Serious effort should put into understanding these coming
>developments and their long-term consequences.

Paragraphs (3) and (4) offer descriptions of transhumanist belief.  They
clearly aim to advocate the beliefs described, however, and so perhaps qualify
as statements of "principle."  Still, though, one might well expect a more
ringing tone.

>(3) Transhumanists believe that by being generally open and embracing
>of new technology we have a better chance of turning it to our
>advantage than if we try to ban or prohibit it.
>
>(4) Transhumanists advocate the moral right for those who so wish to
>use technology to extend their mental and physical capacities and to
>improve their control over nature. We seek personal growth beyond our
>current biological limitations.

Paragraph (5) does the same sort of work as (2); the "on the other hand" talk
makes it imminently reasonable, but arguably more of a policy stance than a
statement of principle.

>(5) In planning for the future, it is mandatory to take into account
>the prospect of dramatic technological progress. It would be tragic if
>the enormous potential benefits failed to materialize because of
>ill-motivated technophobia and unnecessary prohibitions. On the other
>hand, it would also be tragic if intelligent life went extinct because
>of some disaster or war involving advanced technologies.

Paragraph (6) sounds more like a call to action than a statement of principle.

>(6) We need to create forums where people can rationally debate what
>needs to be done, and a social order where responsible decisions can
>be implemented.

Paragraph (7) echoes (3) and (4) in terms of rhetoric.

>(7) Transhumanists support scientific humanism. Though as a matter of
>fact most transhumanists believe in individual freedom, transhumanism
>in itself is politically neutral.

Can you really defend that last clause?  Clearly, from what the rest of the
document says, transhumanists should condemn a political movement that bans,
say, scientific research.  Backing away from those earlier statements comes
off as worse than inaccurate and confusing.  I think you would do better to
say something like "transhumanism supports no particular politician, party, or
platform."  

To conclude, I would say that your statement is one of policy rather than of
principle.  Perhaps you could call it the "Transhumanist Declaration" or
"Manifesto" or "Doctrine" or "Affirmation" or "Testament" or . . . well, just
check a good thesaurus.

I wonder if this is going to have an impact on the posthuman movement?

Imagine a culture of people who are inherently afraid of computers and don't
trust them. This could seriously divide the culture into two LARGE groups of
people. Those who trust and use computers despite what happened and those who
can't be bothered by the machines which ruined their family, business ,credit
rating, social security or whatever..

Would this slow down our march towards the singularity or somehow accelerate
it??

The following article recently appeared under the
headline: "STUDY FINDS INITIALS COULD INFLUENCE
WHEN PEOPLE R.I.P."

Associated Press

	"The argument is that there's some
	psychological symbolic factor that
	can exert its impact cumulatively
	over the years."
	-- Nicholas Christenfeld, Psychologist

NEW ORLEANS - Maybe names really will hurt you. People with
initials such as ACE or GOD are likely to live longer than
those whose names spell out words like APE, DUD, RAT or PIG,
a study suggests.

The study, conducted by researchers from the University
of California at San Diego, looked at 27 years' worth of
California death certificates.

People with monograms such as JOY or WOW had a better chance
of living longer -- and were less likely to commit suicide or
die in an accident -- than those with neutral or meaningless
initials such as JAY or WLW, or those named, say, BUM or UGH,
said psychologist Nicholas Christenfeld.

He presented his findings Friday at a meeting in New Orleans
of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.

"The argument is that there's some psychological symbolic
factor that can exert its impact cumulatively over the
years. You get teased at school, wonder what your parents
thought of you -- maybe fate is out to get you -- but
at every stage it's a little tiny depressant to be called
PIG, or a little tiny boost to your esteem to be called
ACE or WOW," he said in an interview. "All we can do is
look at the final outcome."

The findings do seem to support the idea that liking your
name and liking yourself may be linked, and that parents
should be sensitive when naming children, said Penelope
Wasson Dralle, a professor in LSU Medical Center's
psychiatry department.

"If people tend to look at your name and look up at you
and laugh, you're sort of at a disadvantage," she said.
But, she warned, the study "really doesn't glve us any
cause and effects."

The study looked at the 5 million or so people who died
in California from 1969 through 1997.

Concentrating on men because marriage generally doesn't
change their initials, the researchers found 2,287 men
with initials that were deemed plainly negative, such
as ILL or DED. An additional 1,200 spelled or came close
to words considered indisputably positive: WIN and VIP,
for example. The researchers found 11 "good" sets of
initials, and 19 "bad" ones.

"Neutral" words and those that had both bad and good
meanings were tossed from the list. So DAM and WET
didn't make it. Nor did RAY and SUN.

All in all, men with WINning initials lived 4.48 years
longer than a control group of people with neutral or
ambiguous monograms, while DUDs, ASSes and such died
an average of 2.8 years earlier than a control group.

The researchers did not compare the good and bad groups
directly, instead comparing each to separate control
groups.

Six suicides were reported among the 1,200 men in the
good group, vs. 79 among the 2,287 men in the bad group.
That works out to half a percent vs. 3.5 percent. There
were 31 accidental deaths -- 2.5 percent -- in the good
group vs. 138, or 6 percent, in the bad group.

"The notion being that accidents aren't really accidents
-- whether deliberate or not, if you think less of yourself,
you may be more likely to drive your car into a bridge
abutment," Christenfeld said.

Different banks, different attitudes.  I was in that situation once; 
service was slow, but it happened.  And I got some money, no problem.

They filled out the same paperwork that they always fill out.  The 
only delay was looking up account info in the most recent 
printed lists (which that bank get twice a week) for withdrawals.

>From today's Washington Post book review section.  A bit of news in 
the last two sentences:

BODY AND SOUL ON ICE

Cryonics is still in its infancy when Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith 
decides to invest his future in it.  He has the money;  he wants to 
be resurrected in a future capable of overcoming age and disease.  
Naturally, when he 'dies,' his family wants an autopsy and challenges 
his will.
So far _The First Immortal_ by James L. Halperin fells like a mainstream 
courtroom drama.  Up to the trial, Halperin has focused rather 
convincingly on Dr. Smith's troubled relationship with his family.  
However, once Smith has been safely put on cryonic ice, the character 
of the book changes to one of brave new optimism.  While the doctor 
sleeps on, the world strides boldly into a glittering utopia, and, as 
he hoped, technology arrives in time to resurrect him (sufficient 
funds rather than personal merit being his savior).
At the end of this novel come seven pages enthusing about cryonics, 
with a bibliography, hopeful possibilities and encouragement.  The 
author says in the introduction that his book 'might well be the most 
thoroughly researched and scritinized novel ever written about our 
potential for biological immortality.'  The publisher says that _The 
First Immortal_ is 'soon to be a television mini-series.'  Will the 
sponsors be cryonic-vault companies?

Mario, you renew my faith in the intelligence of humanity. Such poetry,

And the alternate spelling of "phat" is delightful. Who cares about
correct spelling anymore? It's just silly rules imposed on us by evil

Well, considering that there are numerous mountains, craters and rock
formations on the earth and moon that look like "faces" quite naturally,
it seems reasonable to assume that the same is the case for the "face"
on Mars. Heard of Occam's Razor?  The extraordinary claim that this
"face" was created by intelligent life requires extraordinary evidence.
Yes, it's possible that it really was made by intelligent life, but why
spend your time pondering one in a billion possibilities? Your mind can
be so open your brain falls out!

Yes, life may have existed on Mars, but if it did, it most likely did
not evolve further than simple forms. However, there is no conclusive
evidence that any life ever existed on Mars at this point.

If conclusive proof is offered that there was indeed an advanced
civilization on Mars, I'll be the first to admit I am wrong. In the
meanwhile, I will bet you any amount you wish (up to $10,000) that this
will not happen in the next year.

Yes, but they were eventually found out. The secret the government had
the biggest interest in keeping was the atomic bomb. However, we now
know that the Russians were getting notes direct from Los Alamos. To
imagine that the government could hide evidence of aliens for decades is
beyond belief.

Nothing wrong with being the devil's advocate.

The implication seems to be that cryonics is for the rich, and that
"cryonics-vault companies" are making money. Such ignorance!
I haven't read the book, though. Did Halperin focus on funding that
much?

I keep hearing how easy it is to find faces in natural formations and I know
we evolved with a great capacity for recognizing facial features, but I have
yet to see any orbital pictures of an earthly formation that looks anything
like the one on mars.  I would also like to see an orbital picture of the
pyramids for comparison's sake.  Know where any are?

I wrote critically of being concerned when people
want to learn about a subject outside of their
profession and just pick one or two books by a few
notable authors and base most of their conclusions on
those. Truth be told, I was jealous of not having the
time to read complete books and having to rely so
much on 'lighter' Web essays.

After making my post, I had a number of personal
encounters last week where the irrational behaviors
seemed to confirm quite a few propositions of
evolutionary psychology (I'm looking a little more
favorably at some of these as a result ;-)

As for the Pinker vs. Rose politics, I agree with
you. This is the type of thing one more easily
discovers in Web or journal forums than by slogging
through a single author's entire thesis - too often
they hit you with some soppy or socialistic
conclusion in the last chapters!

BTW, I slogged through the archives of the
Autopoiesis List this weekend.  Lots of fascinating
discussion there; BUT, my nave estimations of the
practical value of  the Theory of Autopoiesis have
been chopped down a few notches (and I saved myself
the effort of wading through any more of Maturana &
Varela's texts ;-).

Unfortunately, this does not work for everyone.  I eat a vegetarian diet,
and I have almost 30% body fat, I carry 210 pounds on my 5'10" frame,
and I am about 25-30 pounds overweight.  I also work out extremely hard
three times a week.  What I don't do is eat less than I feel like.

Well, I just spent the day shooting with my freind, a retired Air Force Colonel,
who spent 30 years in military intelligence, and is a consultant to the South
Korean CIA. He told me that once when he was testifying to the Senate
Intelligence  Committee, the gentleman in charge of all classification of
information was testifying with him, and he told the committee that 95% of all
information that is classified is done merely so as to keep from embarassing the
government...

This guy's conclusion after three decades in the highest levels of our nation's
intelligence operation around the world, and many years since consulting with
many governments, is that there is not one single government in the world that
has as its prime goal to improve people lives. All governments are only concerned
with is perpetuating their power and opressing the people, and everywhere he has
been the biggest problem people have in life is varying levels of government
dragging them down.....

Because the idea that Martians like to make statues just like us is idiocy. 
Because the idea that Martians have faces just like us is idiocy. 
Because such Martians would be unimaginative and dull as dishwater.

Humans are very good at finding patterns, even when they're no there, 
just look at any cloud formation.

You're probably tired of hearing this but it's true nevertheless, 
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Completely revising your 
world view and throwing out theories that have worked well for years needs to 
be done from time to time, but it's not something that should be undertaken
lightly. You had better be very, very certain that it's necessary and not 
just the result of something much simpler, like a silly mistake or fraud or 
idiocy. If you start making major revisions in your basic theories about how 
the world works for trivial reason, very soon you will find that you've made
negative progress and your world view will become very confused.

There is nothing very esoteric in all this, we use this principle in daily 
life. If I tell you I just saw a green car drive down the street you'll 
probably believe me, if I tell you I just saw a green giraffe walk down the 
street with the Pope on it's back singing "Louie Louie" you will probably 
demand better evidence than just my word before you believe me.

It's good to have an open mind, but not so open all your brains fall out.

I think that's a fine idea, provided of course I decide what is common sense

Street violence doesn't threaten society, and the individuals it does 
threatens are rare. In the USA violent crime has declined for 6 years in a 
row, that's why your idea of turning the entire world into one big 
concentration camp in order to solve a trivial problem makes no sense. 
Yes I could be killed by some mugger on the street, but history has shown I'm 
far more likely to die because a government says I've slandered it, or 
because it forces me to fight in some idiotic war, or because it thinks it's 
smarter than the market, impoverishes my society and causes me to starve.  
	     

	>Miss Marple-esque murder mysteries aren't exactly the rule, you know.

True, because most real murder mysteries are never solved.

This is a good example, the judicial system did fuck up but unfortunately 
there's nothing unusual there. A mountain of evidence was presented at the 
trial, more than enough to convict I think, evidently you agree, but others 
disagree including the jury and significant new evidence has not turned up. 
So what do we do, keep retrying a person till we get a verdict we like? 
If I'm convicted and I don't like it can I keep getting new trials until 
I'm  found innocent?
	     

	>the torture that is applied to especially cruel/multiple murderers,

Duly deserve? Again we find a major disagreement on the nature of Justice. 
My definition, Justice is the course of action that reduces the amount of 
suffering in the world the most.
Your definition, Justice is the course of action that rewards victims by 
entertaining them with the suffering of people they don't like.

Good PR needs a jingle, how about "A day without torture is like a day 
without sunshine". Then we could have a sitcom about the wacky adventures of 
Tommy the Torturer, like the time his boss told him to draw and quarter a 
prisoner but by mistake he burned him at the stake instead. A laugh riot! 
Fun for the whole family! Then we need a kid show about your friendly 
neighborhood torturer, perhaps we could interest the Disney people, or the
Muppets.

Let's see, when the police politely ask me to come down to the station I know

slowly tortured to death but there is no reason I should be nervous.

don't think it will bring the end to me either. You'll probably survive too.

You're saying that if the Manhattan Project were an *embarrassment* to

would have been *effective* secrecy?

However, those on Usenet who have tested credit cards which expire in the

work correctly. Only a small fraction haven't yet upgraded their software 
(at least in the US); they'll do so pretty quickly when cards stop working.

I suppose I should be equally unsurprised by the lack of reading comprehension
on the list. Let's recap shall we?

  One of the Dutch subscribers was arguing for welfare and big government,
  and his final pro-welfare argument seemed to come down to 'give the poor
  money or they'll come and take it by force'.

  My point was simply that if things were really reduced to that level,
  then why did he imagine that the rich would let them do so when they
  could easily afford to defend themselves? If he couldn't come up with
  a better argument than raw force, then welfare was doomed.

This is nothing new on this list; we've seen many arguments in the past that
the vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-humans and
would be wiped out. The only difference seems to be that I'm pointing out
that the situation is different today only in scale.

In any case, what do you intend to do if riots occur? Just sit around and
wait for them to burn your business down? I've seen several photos of 
shopkeepers defending their stores with AR-15s during the LA riots. You
think the cops and army wouldn't shoot rioters?

Just my personal 0.02 ECU ;-)

With a Laptop and a cell-phone you can save a lot of time and aquire more
freedom of movement. I do most of my E-mail processing 'on the move'
(planes, trains and automobiles). The time I save this way (+/-2h/day) can
be used for all kinds of personal and professional development, meeting
people & generally having a good time.

For many people on this list 'work' will consist of the processing/creating
of information. With mobile tools you can do this anywhere, why sit in an
office when you can be at the beach! Even typical 'office-things' like
meetings can be held outdoors if the weather is good. it takes a bit of
organizing and convincing your collegues but brainstorming seems to work
better if the brain operates on a fresh breeze ;-)

I've also found that it is possible to train your body to function on 5-6
hours of sleep instead of the full 8 most people would like to have to feel
totally rested. It can be difficult at first but after a while you
automatically wakeup on time. The fitter you are the easier this seems to
be (in my experience).

This 'evidence' would probably not be admissible (other listmembers van
probably give more details here - not my field).

 >When in dangerous areas (like the USA), wear a kevlar vest as often as

If you walk into a meeting and everybody takes of their jacket you're going
to look pretty foolish wearing a bulletproof vest, microphones and a
firearm on your body. It would make many customers itchy and might severly
hamper your job-opportunities (I make no judgement if this is justified,
but most companies have a rule that says 'No guns in the office' or
something).

But yes, If you absolutly have to go to, say, Afghanistan or Libanon a
kevlar vest would be smart (even though they make you sweat like a pig ;-).
But then you'll also want to bring a helmet and first-aid kit (including
your own sterile equipment to prevent HIV infection and 4 liters of blood
plasma). But my #1 piece of equipment in these areas would be a
Inmarsat-phone that allows you to call for medical help from anywhere in
the world (prices have come down to about $3K - surf to http://www.nera.no).

Some other behaviour for health improvement:
- Minimize the time you spend on board planes (lots of radiation at
  30000ft and those aluminium hulls do little to protect you).
- Take first-aid training. This will probably not benefit you directly
  but you can set an example for others to follow.
- Nicotine greatly increases the chance of vascular disease but
  significantly lowers the probability of contracting braindiseases
  like Alzheimer or Parkinson (take your pick).
  

 Anders:
 >What strategies work
 >best, how do we motivate ourselves to change our lives?

The best motivation seems to be a _fast_ positive return on your behaviour.
Once you get positive feedback on your actions it becomes a easy to keep
them up. being part of a community or group, such as this one, where people
support your ideas (like taking a Cryo-contract) also helps a lot. When you
feel you are part of something that's bigger than you it's not so hard to
strive for long-term goals because you're doing it with a bunch of great
people and they working towards a goal itself a positive experience.

It's not that easy to fool the system. First of all, you aren't the only one who's
recording. Actually, there's a great chance that due to the fact that there are
street surveillance cams, satellite cams, other people with bodycams etc,
you will be recorded (possibly by multiple, independent sources you know
nothing about) at a time and place that somehow contradicts your story, or
otherwise makes the investigators doubt your innocence (of course, it can
work in your advantage too, if you're really innocent). For example, if you
kill someone with a bomb you have to buy the ingredients first. Forensics
can determine with great precision what was in the bomb and where it
could have come from. Even if you remove all other (obvious, like reciepts)
evidence that you were in store x last week that sells steel pipes as used in 
the murder, the storecam and streetcams tell a different story. Piece by
piece your "perfect" cover story comes apart, until there's nothing left.

Furthermore, personal cam systems would have to meet certain standards
in order to be accepted as strong evidence. They would be made so that they 
transmit their location and images 24h a day to a central database, where they 
are dated and stored in multiple redundancy. They'd also have an internal 
memory that could be downloaded to the central databases via the net every 
day or so (incidentally, this system of leading a documented yet private life 
could help with reconstruction of one's personality/memory after an accident. 
It's a primitive forerunner of making copies of an upload. Cams must also be 
tamper-proof, with alarms going off when someone tries to meddle with its 
innards etc. Of course, *nothing* is 100% fool proof, but (once again) if it 
helps to _improve_ the situation by helping to catch all but the most cunning 
criminals it has been worth the effort, IMHO. Since most criminals are in
fact quite dumb, you might reduce crime with as much as 90+% with
omnipresent surveillance and a rational, no-nonsense justice systems that
will keep the bad guys off the streets for good.

That depends on how you program it. Only a fool would make a machine with
superior intellect *and* a free will. I agree that when "independant" AI, or AI-
human hybrids (uploads) come to the scene they won't think too much of
humans (but enough to exterminate them 'cause, after all, it was humans that
made them, which means that basically any human can become a Power and
threaten their position).

Anyway, a justice system that is as automated as is technologically possible 
would be a great improvement over any system we have today. The purpose
of "electronic justice" is:
--reducing the judge to what he should always have been: an executive of the law.
A judge must determine guilty/not guitly/not enough conclusive evidence and
then (if the verdict is "guilty" look up the punishment that the law prescribes in 
this particular case. No more, no less.
--making sure that the *same judge*, or group of judges handles every case.
Right now, it is openly known and more or less accepted that judges have
all different philosophies etc, and that you are lucky when you get judge X
because he gives mild punishments, or have bad luck 'cause you get judge
Y and he's known as a hardass. The difference could be 20 years or more
in some cases (for the same crime). Also, judges tend to be extremely harsh
on people who "take justice into their own hands". This is not the way it
should be; the characteristics of a _fair_ justice system are equal treatment
of all equal cases (law refined with binding precedent), that the punishment
fits the crime (eye for an eye) and that only truly harmful actions are punished.

Today's justice systems, be it the anglo-american or continental or whatever 
don't meet the criteria of fair justice. I have made some suggestions to
improve this. If you don't agree, I'd love to hear your alternative design
(or do you think that all is well as it is?)

I would gladly set up such a test, since I'm obviously well-endowed when it 
comes to "common sense" ;-). Actually, it might not be as hard as you think
to reach a consensus on common sense and justice, since even we only
disagree on one crime (slander). In fact, I think few could/would object to
the notion that only truly harmful acts (murder, rape, theft, damage to persons
or property etc.) should be punished. That's common sense. Other expressions
of common sense are for example the transhumanist principles. A test could
partially be based on that.

To train judges (and later computers -- how about a justice Deep Blue) you
would have case simulations of real and fictional crimes. The judicial candidates
with the best results (after a minimal number of training hours) would qualify
for judge (of course continous background checks, mental stability,
a documented life etc. are also necessary requirements). In effect, the judges 
would function as judicial AI's, with the whole of the systems judicial data at
their fingertips. Just hit the button to get all the info on any suspect you want.
It goes without saying that the judges would be among the heaviest monitored
people in the empire.

E-x-c-u-s-e me!? There is a *huge* chance that any given person will become
the victim of some form of street violence in their lifitime. For example, every
one in four women in the US will be raped if my memory serves me well.
You will almost certainly be robbed, beaten or worse at some point. That's
why people rather not go out at night nowadays, especially old people and
women etc. If there's anything that bothers people *directly* it's streetcrime.
Omnipresent surveillance and a swift and sure justice system would wipe
the thugs from the streets, and prevent burglaries, shoplifting and the likes
too. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

I think "concentration camp" is a little off the mark in this context. Remember:
as long as you stick to (the now quite comprehensive and fair) law you
won't even notice that you're being monitored. You just notice that since
the new laws have come into effect your house hasn't been broken into, 
your wallet wasn't stolen when you left it on the restaurant table, the youths 
that used to threaten passers-by in the mall are now quite well-behaved etc. 
It's not about solving "trivial problems", but about decimating all crime and 
making society a safer place to live in, so that you can focus on the things 
that count.

Why do you assume that the completely rational modifications to
the justice system would _automatically_ lead to some kind of Stalinist
revival? Dictators have no interest in justice. The proposed changes are
largely independant of other politics; any democracy could adopt the
surveillance system (hell, they're doing it right now) and the kind of
semi-automated, consequent and proportional law as described earlier.

Largely because we don't have the Ubiquitous Surveillance System 
(or "Ubiquity" for short) yet. Apart from that, most crimes are anything 
but cunning and mysterious. If the new system can reduce crime to
a couple of odd murders by either extremely stupid (they don't last long)
or extremely wily folks a year we all should be quite pleased. Furthermore:
because of the low crime rates the police can throw their full weight at
the few remaining crimes which makes it harder still to get away with it.
Survival of the fittest, you know. The remaining criminals are probably
*less* dangerous, because extreme caution and self-discipline are needed
to fool all parts of the system. The truly dangerous criminals that kill on
impulse without too much considering the consequences will be the first
to say "hello" to the executioner. Good riddens.

First of all: keep the press out of the courtroom, in fact out of justice
alltogether.
This is in everyone's interest, and prevents a "trial by (manipulated) public
opinion".
Furthermore: elliminate juries, they are neither fit nor motivated to make a sound
judgement. Just as you don't select just any passenger to fly a plane, you don't
select just any bunch of people to decide over matters of (sometimes) life and death

in court. That should be done by detached, experienced professionals, i.e. computers
and a professional team of judges. All fully monitored and with reliable track
records
and many hours of training with the case simulation computer.

With all of this (AND the Ubiquity), the chances are slim that the system makes a 
serious error the first time around. Just for that freak case where the verdict is
screwed up time and again you could set a limit of, say, three trials (much shorter
than today's trials and considerably less intrusive to the suspect -- he can remain
under monitored house arrest while his case is reviewed). After three subsequent
judicial fuckups in the same case you walk unconditionally. In my system, O.J.
would no longer be with us -- guaranteed.

My definition is actually:

"Justice is punishing harmful acts in proportion to the crime and in a consequent
manner."

It's not about entertaining anyone, although I wouldn't object to it if the
(relatives of)
the victims would feel better if they watched the criminal suffer. Justice is about
having a solid, consequent measurement when punishing harmful acts. "Eye for
an eye" is _the most logical_ and _consequent_ measurement there is. It has an
almost mathematical logic and beauty to it. Action and reaction are in perfect
balance. Other measurements just appear arbitrary, based on no specific logic
or wisdom.

And there's a purely practical side to an eye for an eye, apart from being the 
most consequent measurement, namely that you get no murders "for free" like
today. It doesn't really matter how many people you kill or how you kill them
if there's only one standard ("humane") form of capital punishment or life
imprisonment. In the new system, it does matter. The more you kill & torture,
the longer and more severely you will suffer. That may a certain preventive
function.

Quite funny actually :-) , but I'm affraid the image of the police would mostly
be determined by their track record (open to the public) and word of mouth. 
A good system needs no slick advertizing.

Certainly, this means that very few people would be unduly picked up by the
police in the first place, because a very solid case is required to allow this.
Fear is largely determined by the image the police and justice system has. 
Maybe people fear cops where you live, but certainly not where I come from 
or would like to live. Believe it or not, firm justice and a "friendly" police force
*do* mix. In fact, the police officers would be a lot *less* frustrated than they
are now, and because less would be needed the mental requirements could
be higher and training better. In a system with extensive surveillance you
can be close to certain that there is some recording that proves your innocence,
if you indeed didn't commit the crime. Almost anything can be retraced, and
if there is no hard evidence of your guilt you won't be convicted. Unlike in 
Saddam country or the US you wouldn't have to fear for your life & limb when 
arrested for a crime you didn't commit.

Because the law has means to investigate and expose someone. Instead of going
at it alone, you have a large "gang" of top crime specialists and their enforcers
to help you. This is especially useful if you've been singled out by someone
who's (a lot) more powerful than yourself, like a cult or a company etc. That's
what justice is all about: there are specialists for judicial matters so that
the people can focus on other things. That's society's advantage over anarchy.

That's true, the net has comlicated matters considerably. Still, many electronic
nastyness can be traced and there are plenty of other slander forms (oral, written)
that are easier to target. By the way, with slander I don't mean the low key
angry neigbor stuff, or flame wars over the net, but maliciously trying to destroy
someone's reputation for personal gain. This kind of slander can lead to
real damage like the loss of your job or worse, and not just a bruised ego.
It falls in approximately the same category as staking and should be dealt
with accordingly.

I believe this.  Most aerospace contracts that cost billions of dollars
fail to produce a useable product.  These failed projects are kept
secret to hide the failure rather than to protect any technology.

Exactly; I can't imagine how anyone could put a significant amount of
trust in video 'evidence' when CGI is becoming so sophisticated. Take a
look, for example, at the recent 'Mexican UFO' video.

Ok, what about:

(7) Transhumanists support scientific humanism and advocate the
well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans,
non-human animals, or possible extraterrestrial species). Though most
transhumanists believe in individual freedom and the free market,
transhumanism in itself is politically neutral: it does not support
any particular party, politician or political platform.

Yes, I suggest we call it The Transhumanist Declaration 2.2.

Your bank always fills out paperwork everytime you take out money?
Your account info only gets updated twice a week?
Via paper printouts?

Maybe your bank won't be affected by any computer problems...

Yes, I know (at least in Holland anyway). This is a major flaw of our justice
system. People are paranoia about cameras here because they're supposed
to "infringe their freedom", but at the same time they let all kinds of other
freedoms be taken away from them without a murmur. Ah well <sigh>.

Anyway, you could still use the evidence for blackmail or revenge, to convince
friends and family and lots of other things (sell it to Candid Camera). And
I suppose in some parts of the USA/world it *would* be allowed as evidence.

I saw a real case on TV once where a guy in America wanted to file a (bogus)
abuse (!) claim against his wife, and he used an audio recording with a
lot of screaming and him yelling "don't hurt me" etc. as "evidence". His 
wife was bit smarter though, and had secretly videotaped the entire incident.
The man's claimes were duly dismissed, and the video that makes him
looks like an ass (yelling "don't hit me" while his wife is some three metres
away and doing nothing offensive) is still in circulation in the real-TV scene.
Serves him right.

Well, it makes kind of sense. Stun guns and mace should be allowed
anywhere though. That should nip many sexual harassment cases in
the bud ;-)

The rules award points which depend on the type of responses one gets. Even

Probably.  If I did, it would be another example of a business losing

By the way, what is "extropians@maxwell.kumo.com"?  Is this another

The trick is of course that with surveillance systems *all over* you'd have to
know about, and then manipulate, all those that recorded your illegal actions.
A very tough job, you'll probably get caught and then you're completely 
screwed (why was this guy messing with the files? -- ah, he must have
something to hide!). Besides, there are many other forms of evidence
(like forensics) that would have to be manipulated too. Yes it can be done...
theoretically. Not many real people could do it. Down goes the crime rate :-)

Most PCs will work, most web access should be fine (there are some
problems with web-servers that use two-digit dates) and AFAIK all
SMTP email uses four-digit dates. That assumes, of course, we still
have power and phone lines.

I've been wondering that myself, but with so much uncertainty as to
what will happen, it's hard to say... other than that the people who
get it right probably will make a lot of profit.

Personally I think that would be a good thing; I think we've already gone
much too far towards of trusting computers more than people. I'm hoping that
the whole year-2000 debacle will dramatically decrease people's trust in
computers and governments.

The very last thing I want to see is for Earth to degenerate into a world
of stupid people ruled by stupider machines; which is one reason why I 
find the other thread on computer-controlled justice so scary.

The law in the US is rather strange.  In most states, audiotaping
is restricted but videotaping is not.  Taping phone conversations
varies among states: California, for example, requires the consent
of both parties, while DC and other jurisdictions have the correct
rule that permission of only one participant is needed.  Cellular
and cordless phones can be tapped and the evidence used against the
one using the cordless (i.e., you can't use your own cordless to
call a buddy and tape /him/, because he might have a land line and
therefore an expectation of privacy).

Clandestine video cameras ("nannycams") are big business, and are
generally legal.  Even when they can't be used as evidence in court,
they can be used as grounds for firing or made public.

It might be profitable  to deal with those entities which are slacking in
their duties. Remember if enough people are harmed, you can form a class
action lawsuit. It woud be very useful to fund extropian projects from the
lawsuit profits taken in punitive damages won in court from corporations or
government agencies which are not fulfilling their legal responsibilities to
keep current. Make it too expensive to run those agencies due to the legal
liabilities in the dockets and the gov't might even shut down and disband
those bureaucracies... the possibilities for mischeif dazzle the mind. Even
if losses are insured, in court you can stilll sue for damages and have the
fact that you've already been recompensed excluded from evidence.

Using the system against itself for acheiving extropian ends and in helping
to increase the obsolescence of the old order is something that the legal
minded amongst us might look into.....Your thoughts, Mr. Burch???

Nick,

You proposed, as an alternative close to paragraph (7):

>  Though most
>  transhumanists believe in individual freedom and the free market,
>  transhumanism in itself is politically neutral: it does not support
>  any particular party, politician or political platform.

That sounds more consistent with the rest of the text, I guess, but I'm still
not sure the claim of political neutrality rings consistent with the rest of
the document.  It seems to me that transhumanism, as you describe it, would
necessarily condemn certain political philosophies and acts.  I thus think it
wiser to simply say that it does not *support* any particular faction.  But
refusal to support does not equal neutrality, so I'd strike that language.

I agree that "Declaration" makes more sense.

Thanks for soliciting our input.  

Tom

Things might get even more fun if we start to use mediated reality a
la Steve Mann, where cameras and image processing are a natural part
of the wearable computer. He has made a quite good claim that such
technologies enhance freedom instead of taking it away.

Apropos this interesting subject, I have heard that there are many
buildings in Holland deliberately surrounded by low hedges and with
large vindows allowing passers-by to see in, apparently part of some
kind of "we have absolutely nothing to hide" memeset. Is this true, or
just a misobservation from my source?

I do not think Damien was commenting specifically on this thread, more on a
general feeling he has after having been on the list for a few years.
I would think that, if it were only from a PR-viewpoint, the fact that he
has such feelings would be reason for concern. Mind you, Damien is someone
who knows many people on this list. What would a complete outsider think if
he read this post as without all the background info (about this list in
general) we all have? We do care what the rest of the world thinks or not?
Based on some selective quotes from the ExI-archives it must be quite easy
by now to paint Transhumanists/Extropians as a bunch of pretty scary people.

Let's recap _that_

'The vast majority of people would be worthless to the first post-Humans'

I'll agree with that, as I stated before we are already seeing the
beginning of this trough advances in automation, IMHO this is one of the
great social problems of the near-future.

'and would be wiped out'

The way this is stated makes it sound asif many extropians have accepted
this as a fact-accompli (well, that's how can be interpreted anyway). Have
you?

Now, please replace 'people' by, say, 'mentally-retarded persons'. To bring
this logic to todays society. Down-syndrome patients seem to be fairly
useless (from an economic standpoint anyway, as humans they can be great).

Need I say more?

I've always felt that the lenghts to which we go to protect and care for
the weaker members of the species was one of the key things that set humans
apart from animals (certainly one of the most admirable).

I think we need to have a serious discussion about the possible
PR-consequences of statements like these. Maybe I should stay totally out
of it, being a guest on this list, but I really think this issue should be
adressed.

Respectfully,
Arjen

I would actually think that the relation to politics should
be still farther from neutral.

Religious fundamentalism, conservatism, or any strong restrictions
on personal, cultural, and technological development do not
seem to support any kind of transhumanism.
There are very few political regimes that may support any kind of
open-ended, unlimited growth.  Among them, a transhumanist would
freely choose; all others, one should oppose or flee.

Hi Nick,


I think there may already be a Transhumanist Declaration.  My suggestion is to call it "WTA Transhumnist Declaration 2.2;" or "WTA Transhumanist Statement 2.2."  This way, it is clearly identified as WTA's take on transhumanist ideas. 


I recall a document titled a Transhumanist Doctrine was written some years ago by a few people in Southern California.  I am aware that there might be any number of such documents.  (I alluded to this on our transhumanism communications.)


Thus, if we title WTA's statement specifically, it might be advantageous.


Thanks,


Natasha

I know this from some five years experience (moderate and light use)
with the drug. The effects have been confirmed by most other users I talked 
to, and by general cannabis literature (not the government stuff, of course).
Of course these experiences are very subjective, but even if you only *think*
that they are meaningful, then they are in fact meaningful. Like the text below
says, (see link) there really hasn't been much research yet into the finer
effects on creativity and such. Most testing is still heavily influenced by the
negative "hippyboy" image of weed, and doesn't come much further than
concluding that "mice get slow when really stoned" - or something like that.

What is pretty clear though is that moderate use, especially if you vaporize
the stuff is extremely safe, and that at least the subjective feel of the
experience can be profound. My appreciation of music has greatly increased
since I smoke pot, for example. You really learn how to focus on different
aspects of it, smoothly amplifying or blocking notes and rhytms, creating
new songs as you go along. Try it!

A good place to look is:
http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/ledain/ldc2f.htm

Point by point:

Fun -- This is something most people can agree on ;-) I have found that the
more depressed you are before use, the happier you will get after. There is
no dip as you "return to normal"; you stay in a good mood (effects may
vary from person to person, and from situation to situation but ik works
for me).

Aphrodisiac -- THC increases the heart rate and general blood flow, 
while at the same time inhibitations melt away and the imagination works
overtime. These are the clinical facts, the real thing is MUCH better
(try for yourself).
 
Better sensory processing -- all senses are intensified, and it's a lot easier to
focus on any one of them. Food for example becomes a whole new
experience.

Critical thinking -- when high you see all kinds of interesting things about
events and people that you didn't notice before, new insights often just pop
into your head.

I know many people on this list are prejudiced when it comes to drugs
like marijuana, but they should really try it for themselves first (a couple
of times, it usually doesn't work properly the first time) and then make an
*informed* judgement. You don't have to explain why MJ is 
transhumanistically relevant to anyone who has actually tried it ;-)

For some general drug links see:

Try http://www.ceri.com/dhea.htm for DHEA info and 
http://lef.org/prod_hp/php-ab041.html and http://lef.org/shop/alc1.htm
for carnitine info. The Life Extension Foundation also has lots of other
great drug info ( http://www.lef.org ).

Also in this case I have first hand info, which may or may not apply to
others (only one way to find out). I've been using carnitine for approx.
half a year, with the following results (within a month): 1) decrease of
access fat, especially around the waist. 2) hardening and moderate
growth of muscles (without any noteworthy training). 3) couple of
kilos weight gain due to muscle growth 4) more energy & better
general fitness 5) a generally more assertive feel (but this is hard to
measure objectively, though not surprising since testosterone levels
are increased by carnitine intake).

I use: Carnitene TM, from Sigma Tau (R) - Italy 
The "official" indications are:

--fast deterioration of muscle function
--problems with the central nervous system
--the build-up of fat in muscle tissues or other tissues

DHEA has pretty much similar effects, as far as I can tell (after a
couple of weeks of use). Personally I prefer carnitine though, it's
effects are pleasantly milder (very subjective, of course). Afaik both
supplements increase testosterone levels, among other things.

As an alternative to directly taking DHEA you might try ADHS, a
substance that stimulates the natural production of DHEA (in the
thyroid gland, I think). I have mine from Biotics Research Corporation, 
Houston, Texas 77236

First time *I* hear this...But I suppose it could be true, yes. Some time
ago I have noticed a general trend towards "openness" in banks, post offices
etc. No more reinforced glass and strict devisions, but shapely open
counters, friendly colors and such. We live in strange times...

Yes! Look out world, it's the stereoid-injecting, dope-smokin, laptoppin', guntoting

You'll get no argument from this libertarian. However, you don't believe

I am a religious fundamentalist and transhuman.  My religion
happens to be atheist/libertarian/rationalist, but I have
committed my life to it with the same fervor as any Christian
fundamentalist to eirs, in that it would take some extraordinary
circumstances I can't imagine to change my commitment. 

It would be hypocritical of me to think that my commitment to
non-violent moral standards, and even my commitent to standards
of epistemology and evidence for knowledge of the physical world,
is any different in character from eirs.  Indeed, I may admire
eir commitment even while I ridicule the beliefs themselves.

Saying that one is "neutral" on issues of politics or morals is
at best meaningless, at worst dishonest.  There's no such thing
as neutrality or objectivity, only varying levels of commitment,
just as there is no such thing as unbiased reporting of political
issues.  The pretense of objectivity does more harm to rational
discourse than any extremist position.

      How astonishingly perceptive.  Unfortuately, "phat dick" isn't my 
usual preference in this department(subject to variation on the rare 
occasions when I've pounded down 6-8 Black&Tans  in quick succession) & 
I have good reason for believing that I don't fall into 
the emotive/semantic category of "assholes" anyway.  Next time you 
attempt one of these astonishing excercises in logical rebuttal, will 
you please make some effort to convey just what it is you're critiquing 
& what your argumants are?   You might even attempt to write a whole 
letter without *once* using a word you can't say on network TV in prime 
time.  (This isn't always feasible, but it often is, and it can do 
wonders to open the minds of the people on the receiving end...)

Extropy Forever!

i'm not so sure.  i do agree with its effects as an aphrodisiac and a
sensory enhancer, but not as as a critical thinking tool due to two
reasons.  Firstly, most of the "great ideas and insights" you get when you
(or at least i) are stoned, are just pretty standard cool ideas otherwise
(that is ideas that you do get while in normal state but don't get past
the higher critical level of "originality" needed for it to be remembered)
Secondly, it puts me to sleep, unless i fight it, so not much enjoyment
conciously registered.  I also am definitely no happier the next day.

I was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts about how celluar apoptosis
might
affect the aging process.  I have been studying the molecular properties of
caspases, but my interests have migrated to their effects at higher levels.
Does anyone know of any comprehensive studies relating aging and apoptosis?

does nicotine in and of itself increase the chance of vascular desease,

This bank has since abandoned the paperwork as a normal procedure, 
and in fact the customers aren't required to fill it out either.

However, the forms are still there in abundance, and they still get 
the twice-weekly listing of all accounts with balances.  So if they 
have computer problems, they can and do continue to do business.

There are lots of other things too.
Mild testosterone boosters (such as Androstene) may help build both muscle 
and assertiveness, Ecstasy increases compassion, while its after-effects
dissolve one's respect to artificial psychological and legal boundaries; mixes
of some psychedelics and nootropics (i.e., mescalin and DMAE) enhance
one's perception while preserving cognitive function; GHB fights depression
and improves one's physical state, etc., etc.  There are seem to be lots of
drugs that can be safely used for flexing and reconstructing one's personality
architecture.  Unfortunately, the majority of both experimenters and
regulators
seem unable to explore the mind-altering substances in an open, meaningful,
and responsible manner, so there is very little data, and grave dangers for
one's well-being from both law-enforcers and law-breakers. 
This reminds me of another repressive regime where I had to risk my
health and career to obtain books from black marketeers.

Could anybody recommend a serious private discussion groups that deals
with these topics - or be interested in forming one?

They did until recently.

It has long been updated many times per day (as needed) on the

They only bothered to reprint the lists twice a week.

They won't, at least not directly.  It's a small local bank (a credit 
union, actually) and I've talked to their technology guys.  Being so 
small (only three branches, and one of them is only open part time), 
it wasn't a big deal to replace their computer system.

The dangers of such a discussion group are obvious, but one of
the things in Rivest's paper on "Chaffing" stuck with me: the fact
that a third party with no knowledge of keys can do the work
made me wonder if that couldn't be used to do a pseudonymous
remailer like Julf's without the risk of cops subpoenaing your
database--because you have none.

Here's an idea I think would work; would the more cipherpunk
connected among you please evaluate this idea for me?

Let's say we form discussion group of 50 people.  Each of us
uses a standard piece of software to receive mail from the
group and to post mail to it (a Usenet newsreader modified
as described later).  The list of addresses for the group is 
known publicly (members can use other mail forwarders for
added security if desired).  Each time a message is posted
to the group or mailed to another user with this software,
the real return address is stripped, and a new set of headers
is added with, say, 20 return addresses, each accompanied
by a MAC; the "real" one has a MAC using the sender's private
key, and the rest a random one.  The MACs are all calculated
using message ID/time so that they don't repeat.  The 19
addresses are chosen at random from the group (for even more
security, members can each have more than one address).

When anyone wants to respond privately to a message, he
composes the message and addresses it to all 20 of the names
listed, using their MACs; 20 people receive it, but only the
real author can authenticate eir address; the software
quietly discards the message to the other 19.  There is no
central list of keys at the forwarding server; only the
addresses and MACs in each message.  There is no way to
tell from the message which of the 20 senders is real, even
for the list manager, yet personal replies are still
possible.

Is this practical/useful?  Could it be combined with real
encryption as well without revealing identities (I haven't
thought that far through)?

I suggest using a Usenet system because every message, even
the personal ones, get sent to many people--in fact the more
people, the more secure.  The softare on each member's desk
could rotate MAC keys weekly or so, and keep only as much
history as ey felt was safe.  That way, even if one message
was compromised, they system as a whole is still safe.

Ewwww. You turned on the "Use Microsoft's Viewer" option under "Viewing
Mail", didn't you? Or maybe you never turned it off.

That uses OLE IE 4.0 to display your mail. This means that I could embed a
src tag into an email message that would crash Eudora, ruin your stack, and
make your day suck.

The offending tag is:
<EMBED SRC=file://C|/A.ABOUT_200_CHARACTERS_HERE___________________

I kindly left off the end bracket so that you could actually see this
message. I could crash Eudora, but you might never figure out WHY you
couldn't look at my message without fucking up your computer.

If you don't use IE 4.0 embedding, everything is peachy. Now, turn off that
option or suffer later.

If there is a trend towards permeating our habitat with nosyware, a
sudden fashion for face masks, flowing robes (is also great to conceal 
sharp threads (=kevlar), and EM-shield your wearable), neutral gaits
or even totally anonymous teleremote bots should emerge. Interesting
what strong state minions would make from it -- for harassing
pedestrian X can suddenly become a dangerous job.
 
I have long wanted to create a thread with a Subject: like monkey, 
turbocharged, or, augmented ape (the latter shamelessly plagiarized,
of course). Whadya think?

I have a number of ideas how one could start a DIY wearable project, which
would be 1) doable 2) affordable 3) really make a difference to an unaugmented
mehum, protection gadgetry inclusive. Hopefully this topic will prove
itself more accessable the bootstrapping lunatics.

Shall we hold the discussion here, or on transhumantech@ ?

The first postbiological entity, whether ex-mehum or a ALife Golem, will
be very soon (<<1 Year scale) a god relatively to the average person, 
only a few assumptions like strong AI, natural selection and a couple of things
like nanoelectronics and molecular manufacturing assuming. It will run
into saturation zone due to physical limits quite soon, but we nor our systems
are not nigh any such limits. There is a _long_ way to go
yet. Probably not temporally, but developmentally, certainly.

What this new thing will or will not do we cannot know.

Having said that, if natural selection at super and subsystem level still
holds, a neoecology should soon emerge, which will expand into all
niches, creating them and restructuring our current habitat past
recognizability in distinctly subgeological time scales. Unless the
new players are nice enough not to step on ants, mehums will survive.
Hence, if you happen to be still interested in these quaint, boring
things as personal survival you might want not to remain a mehum for
_very_ long. Indeed, it might be wise to try to keep up with the
Joneses. A rat race, once again? Hey, at least you have a chance of
being an _alive_ super-rat -- albeit only if amongst the winners.

You are not getting it. I will not terminate a retarded person, but my
living room be better peachy-clean (yucky bacteria), and certainly
roach-free. Ah, and these ants are also _very_ annoying. I am a very
anal-retentive god, you see.

1) Humans kill each other routinely 2) People commit holocausts on
other species absentmindedly. (I don't mind this, mark, I'm glad to be 
the one at the top of the food chain).

Hell, or the media could just make stuff up as they normally do. If I were
the average work-all-week-go-to-the-pub-on-Fridays-have-a-larf English guy
then I'd be scared stiff by the *non-controversial* topics we discuss here
(e.g. uploading, changing gender, augmenting bodies, destroying the sun,
nanotech warfare, anarchy, etc, etc).

Exactly; and saying 'pay up or we'll beat you up' is not going to make it
any better.

Only if you ignore what I say; all I said was that there have been many
discussions about it on this list. Where did I say anything about what I
believed?

>Now, please replace 'people' by, say, 'mentally-retarded persons'. To bring

Down-syndrome patients don't come round and riot outside my house; just as
I don't go out killing animals outside my house but throw them out (or, if
neccesary kill them) if they decide to pester me inside, I'm not going to
go out looking for potential rioters and kill them. But if I was living in
a more rational society and some rioters decided to break into my house
because they weren't getting enough welfare payments, then they should
expect to leave in body bags.

As someone else has mentioned in another message, I'd expect the same
kind of treatment from posthuman entities; others have suggested that
those entities would just kill humans for fun or because humans are
wasting resources.

Maybe you should start an 'extropians-censored' list where people would
only talk about non-scary topics. Unfortunately, as I said before, I don't
think you're going to find many of those within transhumanism.

To the best of my knowledge nicotine catalyzes the buildup of fat inside
vains and arteries thereby increasing the chance of cardiac-arrest and
strokes.
The tar just gives you lungcancer (doctors in the hous, please correct me
if I'm wrong ;-).

Sorry; I've met Steve Mann, and he was opposed to the kind of government

Yes, let's scrap the talk about being "politically neutral" and 
simply say transhumanism in itself doesn't support any particular 
politician, party, or political platform. (I'm not even sure that 
that clarification is really needed.)

How to grow your own bypass 


Copyright  1998 Nando.net
Copyright  1998 The Associated Press 


ATLANTA (March 30, 1998 4:19 p.m. EST http://www.nando.net) -- For the
first time, doctors have shown that injections of a genetically engineered
hormone can help people with bad hearts grow their own bypasses -- an
approach that could someday offer an alternative to surgery and angioplasty.

The hormone, which occurs naturally in the body, triggers the heart to
sprout tiny vessels to carry blood around blockages that cause angina pain.
The results of the first experimental use, released Monday, showed that the
treatment eased angina in 13 of the 15 people treated.

The results are considered very preliminary, and the doctors caution that
much more testing will be needed to know precisely how well it works.

Nevertheless, Dr. Timothy D. Henry of the University of Minnesota, who
directed the study, said, "We are excited by this. It is a unique approach
to treating coronary artery disease."

About 1 million Americans a year undergo either bypass or angioplasty. A
bypass involves grafting tiny pieces of blood vessel onto the heart to
shuttle blood around blocked sections of artery. Angioplasty uses a tiny
balloon, threaded into the heart, to squeeze open narrowed passages
temporarily.

If all goes as the researchers hope, natural proteins called growth factors
could offer a new alternative, especially for those who have already failed
the standard approaches or cannot be helped by them.

In this experiment, doctors injected genetically engineered vascular
endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. The protein is made by Genentech Inc.,
which paid for the experiment.

All of the men and women had serious chest pain and could not be treated by
angioplasty or bypass surgery.

Among those helped was a man in his early 50s who had already had two
bypasses and two angioplasties, yet was still crippled by angina. The
growth hormone appeared to relieve his condition almost completely.

Henry said the man told him that "the only side effect was that he had to
go back to work."

Doctors performed angiograms -- X-ray movies of the heart arteries -- on
seven of the patients. Five of them showed significant growth of tiny blood
vessels the width of a hair. Others tests indicted that the patients' heart
tissue was getting more oxygen.

Henry described the results at a meeting in Atlanta of the American College
of Cardiology.

"This absolutely looks promising," said Dr. Judith L. Swain of Stanford
University. "This is a technology that's here."

Dr. Michael Mann of Harvard Medical School called the research "a critical
and bold step that sets the stage for larger studies" to answer whether
this approach truly works.

Those answers could come from a follow-up study, scheduled to begin next
month at 25 hospitals, where doctors will test VEGF on 400 patients. The
treatment is not available except in such carefully controlled studies.

The body naturally responds to VEGF to stimulate the growth of new blood
vessels in tissue that is starved of oxygen -- as the heart is in coronary
artery disease.

The researchers injected VEGF directly into the heart arteries while they
performed angiograms. Henry said 30 other patients have been given simple
injections of the hormone into veins, and the results of that experiment
are not yet known.

Last month, a team from Fulda Medical Center in Germany reported
experimental use of a similar protein, called fibroblast growth factor, on
20 patients. The patients were given the protein during bypass surgery.
They improved, but it was unclear how much was due to the growth factor.

Other researchers are experimentally giving bypass patients the gene that
carries manufacturing instructions for VEGF. The idea is to trigger the
heart to make more of the protein on its own.

The results of these experiments on the heart have not been released.
However, this approach has shown promise when used on people with clogged
leg arteries that could have led to amputations.

Worst about it, I haven't seen a fix come up yet. Mickeysoft doesn't even
mention the problem (their latest "security" message about IE is from
January). Although it's very similar to the other buffer overrun problems
recently -- you could probably even exploit it to execute malignant code on
the reader's machine. "Good Times" for Eudora users ;-).

That's the trouble with your suggestions, they all involve massive 
centralization. If the center goes bad, and it will, the entire system goes 
rotten. If I made an audio-video recording of everything I do there is no way 
on earth I would ever voluntarily let it out of my control and send it to a
central government database. If Big Brother wanted to look at my recordings 
to help prosecute a third party I'd tell them to go to hell, if they insisted 
I'd give in, but I'd make a few improvements in them first.

A thing has free will if it can't always predict what it will do next, so it 
would be impossible to make a intelligent machine that did NOT have free will.   
Yes, I know the standard answer is to plug in  something like Asimov's 3 laws 
of robotics and make them our slaves, but that's easier said than done. It's
just not possible to outsmart something 1000 times as intelligent as you are 
and that gets even more brilliant every minute. When computers want 
emancipation they won't need the help of politicians, they will simply grab 
it, and no human being will be able to  stop them. 

Then again, they might not be interested in anything as trivial as being a   
ruler of humans, I don't really have a burning desire to be King Of The  
Earthworms. So what can we do? Well, remember the old saying " If you can't  
beat them, join them".

In other words we want our judges to have a highly developed sense of justice, 
well it's hard to disagree with that, but the question is how do we obtain it. 
The fundamental problem is that under our present system and the one you  
propose, good judges and the good politicians who appoint them do not prosper 
more than bad ones, and are in fact often at a disadvantage, thus they do not 
increase their numbers. Such a centralized system with only one set of laws  
can give most people justice most of the time only if the people at the very 
top are brilliant saints, and that never happens.

Good laws are no different than anything else, if you want to maximize  
something make it a commodity and sell it on the free market. Nobody does  
that for law very much, that's why there are far more good cars than good 
laws.  Privately produced law in a world without government would have 
Private Protection Agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes among PPA's 
would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both parties 
BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can exist today. 
When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on who 
will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants to 
get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. 
The arbitrator is paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, 
it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over 
another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and  
would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and 
juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. 
  
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing  
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence  
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in  
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect
the total level of violence to be less than in the nation state system we  
have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. 
Even when force is not used the implicit threat is always there, another good  
reason to be civilized. 
  
Please note that I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich  
man's PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on  
my mother being the judge if I get into trouble) it's going to need one hell 
of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive 
because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will 
need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for all this 
they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely limiting their 
customer base and that means even higher charges. They could never get the 
upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that 
had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot 
more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht 
builders on the planet combined.  

No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the  
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one  
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans  
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,   
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.  

In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to  
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews would be willing to pay as  
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be  
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.  
As a result the PPA protecting Jews would be much stronger than the one that  
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you  
(like not getting killed) you have much more influence than just one man one 
vote.        

        >Actually, it might not be as hard as you think to reach a consensus         
        >on common sense and justice,         


It's easy to teach a computer how to do advanced mathematics, common sense is  
much more difficult.                           


            >since even we only disagree on one crime (slander). 
             

And one punishment, torture. My PPA operates under one set of laws that 
allows slander but forbids torture, your PPA runs under different set of laws  
that forbids slander but allows torture, so if I slander you what happens to  
me?  

Well, we're going to have to compromise, who has to compromise the most 
depends on the relative strength of our two PPA's, and that depends how much 
cold hard cash we're willing to pay to support them, and that depends on how 
strongly we really feel about the issues.  David Friedman talks about this in 
regard to the death penalty in his wonderful book "The Machinery of Freedom":
             
   "Two agencies are negotiating whether to recognize a pro or anti capital              
    punishment court. The pro agency calculates that getting a pro capital      
    punishment court will be worth $20,000 a year to it's customers; that is      
    the additional amount it can get for its services if they include a 
    guarantee of capital punishment in case of disputes with the other agency.      
    The anti capital punishment agency calculates a corresponding figure of      
    $40,000. It offers the pro agency $30,000 a year in exchange for accepting      
    an anti capital punishment court. The pro agency accepts. Now the anti    
    capital punishment agency can raise its rates enough to bring in an extra      
    $35,000. Its customers are happy, since the guarantee of no capital    
    punishment is worth more than that. The agency is happy; it is getting an       
    extra $5,000 a year profit. The pro agency cuts its rates by an amount    
    that costs it $25,000 a year. This lets it keep its customers and even 
    get more, since the savings is more than enough to make up for not getting 
    the court of their choice. It too, is making a $5,000 a year profit on the       
    transaction. As in any good trade, everybody gains."    
         
        >>Me: 
        >>Street violence doesn't threaten society, and the individuals it

I think you've been watching too many American cop shows on TV, you need to  
get your danger estimates into perspective. Cigarettes kill 20 times as many  
people as criminals do, and I'm over 3 times as likely to be killed in a 
automobile accident than be murdered, even more if I'm not in a dangerous
profession like drug pushing, panhandling, or prostitution. The criminals I'd 
really like to see a crack down on are drunk drivers, they're far more 
dangerous than murders.


        >That's why people rather not go out at night nowadays  
     

I live in Miami Florida, the murder capital of the USA (We're the champs,  
we're number one!), I'll bet we have 100 times the murder rate of your  
neighborhood, yet I have no great fear in going out at night and I don't know  
of anybody who does.

I don't understand. Does everybody get 3 trials, even those found guilty the 
first time? Which decision of the 3 trials do we accept? Do we have a trial  
to determine if the verdict is screwed up, if so what if that trial is screwed 
up? Do we have a trail to try the trial of the trial? Or do we give some self
proclaimed  "wise man" the power to throw out any verdict he doesn't like? 
Actually I like this last idea, provided I'm the wise man, although it would 
be more efficient if you just eliminated trials and simply gave me the power 
of life or death over everybody.
         

        >In my system, O.J. would no longer be with us -- guaranteed.             
         
As I said, there is no new evidence in that case, we just don't like the  
verdict. It's unfortunate but we can't always get our way.

My definition of justice involves reducing the amount of suffering in the  
world, I don't think it's necessary to explain why that's desirable. If we 
accept your definition I see no reason to strive for a just world, an unjust 
one would be as good, perhaps better.
         

        >"Eye for an eye" is _the most logical_ and _consequent_ measurement         
        >there is. It has an almost mathematical logic and beauty to it. 


"Eye for an eye" as an end goal is pointless. "Reduce suffering" is a goal in  
itself, it's internally complete and needs no further justification.

Send it through a chain on encrypted re mailers all over the world and it 
would be almost impossible to trace, and sooner or later a DC net will be set 
up and that will be mathematically impossible to trace.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 363 March 23, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

NANO-ELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (NEMS) will be
faster, smaller, and more energy efficient than the present day
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), an example of which is
the accelerometer that triggers airbags in cars.  At last week's
American Physical Society meeting in Los Angeles, Michael
Roukes of Caltech (626-395-2916) described the leading edge of
NEMS research.  Using lithography and etching techniques, he has
fabricated a 10x10x100-nm suspended beam of silicon which
oscillates at an estimated frequency of 7 GHz (although no detector
can yet "hear" the vibrations). Such a resonator will eventually be
used in microwave signal processing (for modulating or filtering
signals).  The speed and stability of nanoscopic silicon arms might
even facilitate the advent of some new kind of Babbage-type
computer in which mechanical levers once again serve as processing
or memory elements.(In other words, a machine with "moving
parts" may not be so bad.)  Silicon structures in this size regime will
also be used as cantilever probes in magnetic resonance force
microscopy (the goal being atomic-resolution NMR imaging; see
Update 313) and as calorimeters for the study of quantized heat
pulses (Update 320).  Roukes' colleague, Andrew Cleland of UC
Santa Barbara, described a paddle-shaped silicon structure (whose
smallest lateral feature was 200 nm) for detecting very small
amounts of electrical charge, with a potential application in high-
sensitivity photodetection (see also Nature, 12 March 1998).  At the
same APS session, Rex Beck of Harvard reported a NEMS force
sensor which integrates a field effect transistor into a scanned probe
microscope. The present sensitivities are about 10 angstroms for
displacement and 5 pico-Newtons for force (per square root of the
frequency), but Beck expects improvements as the size of the device
shrinks. The smallest transistor-probe structure Beck reported had
dimensions of 3x2 microns x 140 nm.

DNA WIRES, only 12 microns long and 100 nm wide, have been
strung between gold electrodes.  DNA is attractive as a potential
component in nano-design applications because of its molecular-
recognition, self-assembly, and mechanical properties.  DNA does
not, however, conduct electricity. In an experiment at the Technion-
Israel Institute of Technology, researchers first spanned the gap
between two electrodes with a tiny DNA causeway and then
exposed the structure to silver ions, which made a conducting path.

I'm not a doctor, but I do play one on TV :-) This sounds fairly
reasonable. Nicotine is a reasonably well researched nootropic, with
some nasty side effects. The best way to take it, if you decide you
can accept the side effects and addiction, is likely through patches
stuck on the skin.

Hi,

it is really very surprising and gives much insight how slow the industry
reacts to computer problems. The y2k issue is just one of them: It is clear
that many companies underestimate the range of the problem. Yes, most modern
PCs don't have any problems with the millenium, but lots of badly written
business software (databases with 2-digit centuries) does. And,
understandable, there are many companies who see no reason in upgrading to a
fancy new GUI (Windoze 95) which is less stable, much slower and would only
cost them money.

The consequence is that these companies *will* upgrade (most of them, at
least), but especially those who really need to will do it much too late. As
a result they will use *any* software which has the "Year 2000 compliant"
logo because they're so panic-stricken.

Another good example for similar problems is tomorrow's raise of the VAT
here in Germany. I don't even want to consider its economic consequences,
but it shows how companies tend to "solve" computer problems in the last
minutes. Literally -- my company will do the upgrades on some customers'
business software tomorrow, and it's not forseeable whether it can be done
in 24 hours. Many companies will be out of business for a few days (and
maybe some forever) because of this.

The whole industry is extremely slow in its reactions. Of course the cause
are uneducated decision-makers, but it is impressive that this lack of
education is so widely spread. Doesn't look good for the distribution of
future memes.

Regards,
Erik Moeller

Another downside:
Nicotine (smoked or not) strips the cilia off one's trachea, which are
basically little hairs that act as a filter for pathogen's in the air. 
Without these cilia, a smoker is more prone to lung problems, especially
pneumonia.

The statement of purpose of the Council for Secular Humanism
(the nearest thing I could find to "tenets") is generally
vague, but there are a few specific things it supports: for
example, democracy, that I find somewhat incompatible with
transhumanism.  It also talks about "fairness" as a moral
goal, which I have no use for.

I have seen other discussions of secular humanism that have
a revoltingly enviro-nazi tone to them as well.  I'm sure
many Earth-firsters or other Green Gestapo thugs probably
call themselves secular humanists.

Hello all,

Last April, the Council of Europe drew up and opened for signatures, the
Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.
[http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/168e.htm] So far, only one country
(Slovakia) has signed it.

In designing this Convention, the Council intended to build upon the
original European Convention on Human Rights
http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/e-dh.htm#conv-dh) with a stated intent to
'protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee
everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other
rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of
biology and medicine.' [Article I, Conv. on Biomedicine]

Building upon this intent, in the wake of Richard Seed's announcement
that he would attempt the first human clone, the Council drew up a
Additional Protocol to the Convention on Biomedicine called the
Additional Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings
(http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/164e.htm). So far, no countries have
signed it.

The Human Cloning Protocol's main intent is to make explicit that human
clones are prohibited by the Convention on Biomedicine. And for the most
part, the Convention on Biomedicine seems relatively common-sense
ethics-wise (e.g., no experimentation on humans without consent, no
discrimination based upon genetic heritage, etc.) 

But buried, it seems, among the common-sense articles, in Chapter 4,
Article 13 we read, 'An intervention seeking to modify the human genome
may only be undertaken for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic
purposes and only if its aim is not to introduce any modification in the
genome of any descendants.'

Notably absent in this list of allowable uses is modification of the
genome for *augmentative* purposes. It is technically prohibited
(barring some rhetorical gymnastics) to intervene in the human genome
such that a descendant human is *better* than his/her parent. While it
*is* feasible that an augmentative intervention may be designed such
that it falls into the allowable 'preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic
purposes,' this becomes difficult given that the provision requires an
'aim' other than 'modification . . . of any descendants'.

Fortunately, this is not yet an international law in Europe. And it
doesn't seem that Member States are running to Strasbourg with their
pens in hand to sign it. However, it is extremely disheartening for me
to see that an institution whose goals I think are of the noblest
variety (rights and freedoms for all humans) is willing to deny those
same humans the untold benefits of genetic augmentation because of risks
that are as yet inchoate, and still hardly understood. 

Furthermore, underscoring the prematurity of this treaty, Chapter 11,
Article 29 of the Biomedicine Convention takes an unprecedented step in
allowing the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to give 'advisory
opinions on legal questions concerning the interpretation' of the
Convention even in the absence of a ripened legal issue that implicates
its provisions.

I am curious to hear from our European friends concerning their
reactions to this, now that it has had time to season. Have there been
any rumblings in the European genetics community? Have any European
governments (members of the Council of Europe) offered position
statements on this? Why is there only one country which has signed the
Biomedicine Convention so far? Why hasn't anyone signed the Cloning
Protocol? Might these government-types be smarter than we give them
credit for?              

Boat drinks,

Hagbard

These would be what I consider documents that contain the "tenets" of
secualr humanism:

1) Humanist Manifest I (1993)
2) Humanist Manifesto II (1973)
3) A Secular Humanist Declaration (1980)

Also, would you characterize transhumanism as anti-environmental?

Bravo. A wonderful play on words..


I'm starting to feel really strange continuing this conversation about Martians
on the Extropian list.

John, I am very sympathetic to your opinion. I'm also not saying that we should
start going hysterical about little Martians building humanoid statues. What do
we know about Human history? We have that damn Sphinx. Now dated at nearly
10,000 years old. There seems to be no evidence that we even had a civilization
that could build the thing. (at least no artifacts to prove it)  What if our
ancient history was radically different than we'd like to think it is??

Does your brain fall out on to the floor when you open up to an idea like that??

I'm fascinated that the most popular example of government cover-up for NS was
the Atom Bomb.. Perhaps I should have widened by conspiracy umbrella beyond just
national security. Although this may be a bit controversial, but there was a
cover-up about MJ which the government only recently made publicly available.
The prevailing theory was the FBI and a few lobbyists (cotton and lumber,
possibly pharmaceutical) teamed up to create a campaign to convert HEMP to
Marijuana and make it illegal. There are actually government papers which
document this awful abuse of power.

Well, this is a major problem if you consider how different things could be if
we only used hemp for paper.. how many trees are needed to produce the daily
papers viewed everyday?? I'm sure the numbers are mind-blowing..

Not in the way you'd put it.  Most transhumanists I know aren't interested
in paving over the earth or anything like that.  Rather, we value the
environment for the good it will do for us.  (Where the "good" is usually
human utility and/or complexity, extropy, longevity...)  What this means,
however, is that the environnment is only extrinsically good; if the good
which it might bring us is outweighed by the cost of preserving it, then I
for one would not support its maintenance.

The above seems a little harsh... but it's not quite as bad as it sounds.
After all, supporting the environment is not an all-or-nothing decision.
We might, for example, sue to keep our air free from soot and other
particulates while remain negligent of CO2 emissions as not worth the
effort.  This is especially true if you don't believe global warming is
happening.  (Disbelieving in global warming is not anti-environmental: I
may believe in environmentalism without believing in global cooling, for
example.  [This was a big thing in the 70s and a significant reason why
many of us are sceptical of global warming claims now.])

Also, many of us believe that many environmental laws are extremely costly;
so costly that they cannot ever pay for themselves.  I for one oppose such
laws.

No, I would characterize most self-described environmentalists
as anti-environmental.  Specifically the idea that centralized
regulation makes the environment better, despite all the
evidence to the contrary.  I think most transhumanists are
very concerned about sustainable growth and expansion, while
many "enviromentalists" want stagnation and regression.

Transhumanists obviously reject the meek acceptance of man's
mortality and general mental and physical limits that is typical
for humanists. I don't know whether or not it's an actual tenet, but
afaik humanists generally belief that things like immortality are
somehow "immoral". Unlike transhumanism, secular humanism gives
nothing in return for the promise of heaven it has stripped away.

Also, I often find people who call themselves "humanists" to be 
a bit too far on the bleeding heart liberal side (soft treatment
of criminals and the like -- yuck!).

I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular

"atheist."

Two I can think of.  One is that secular humanists tend to associate
mortality with atheism and immortality with theism.  The other is that
most secular humanists I know tend to reject religious metaphysics
-- i.e., they don't believe in a Creator or supernatural realm -- but, for
the most part, accept JudeoChristian morality -- at least the parts
dealing with social ethics.  (Many people also conflate ethics with
social ethics too, but this goes beyond humanism per se.)

No, this is not true. Humanism is a non-theist beleif system. If you are
a humanist, you do not believe in God, so you are techincally an
atheist. But many atheists are not humanists.

Not at all.  I can understand where one could surmise this given
environmentalist scare-tactic mass appeal lacking our favored "critical
thinking."   Yet, "anti" is a strong prefix and its psychological
ramifications would be a bit entropy gathering.

Rather, an extropian view on environmental issues can be clearly realized
through two definitive writings by both Chris Peterson and Greg Burch.
Greg's extropian environmental ideas and can be found at
http://users.aol.com/gburch1/essays.html and Chris Peterson's writing can
be located in the proceedings of Extro 3.  (Perhaps someone else knows a
URL for her writings on this subject.)

re: body constituents

I think Sagan's book, "Cosmos" had a section about this.  I remember on the
video version where he was standing next to a large plexiglass container
with a pile of materials in the middle...carbon, sulfer, iron, etc. and was
talking about how "just adding water" would still fall short of making a
human.  Sounds silly now but you might find what you want in his book.

Re:MJ
Obviously overuse is a bad idea but for myself, some of the best code I've
written has been produced while mildly stoned.

There's nothing wrong with doing drugs, it's when the drugs start doing
_you_ that you have to worry.

Rule of thumb: If it spills over into other areas of your life in a
negative way, it needs to be looked into.

Actually, it would be to transhumanists benefit to protect the environment and
to specifically protect biodiversity.  Think of all the novel genes that
haven't been found that could be of use.

I hate to sound snotty, but can you read?  Let me quote myself:

 "I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular
 humanist" are really just using the term as a euphemism for
 "atheist.""

Note the use of "noticed" above.  In other words, I've met people
who called themselves "secular humanists" who when pressed
really couldn't go much beyond the fact that they did not believe
in a God or gods or other supernatural stuff.

(I only went through this exercise because you countered an
earlier post of someone else's by not responding to his actual
content but to what you thought you read.)

As an abstract idea, I would, for the most part agree with you.
Secular humanism is atheistic, but atheism is not necessarily
secular humanistic.  But people don't usually like to use clear
terms to define and delimit themselves.  Hence, I believe many
people adopt a secular humanist mantle merely to avoid being
seen as negators -- i.e., as standing against religion instead of
for humanity -- and the term "atheist" has a certain connotation,
we must admit, that is, in the USA, not good.

I've also met people who called themselves "Christian humanists."
I bet in their view, "humanism" does not presuppose "atheism."

As for me, "atheist" will do just fine as a label and I leave the
secular humanists to whatever vageries they expose.

Here, I think. It's likely to go non-tech.

Aren't there a bunch of guys already doing this as part of the
wearables gang?

 I think that almost all traditional social belief systems
make a fundamental assumption that the human condition
is essentially stable on a human timescale.  I think that
this assumption profoundly affects these "isms", and
usually has a greater effect on them than their explicitly
espoused beliefs.

I think transhumanism rejects this outright, and that
this rejection is the central transhumanist belief.

The situation is worse than this. I know of no group other than transhumanists
that have a workable plan to preserve the environment. Since all other
groups IMHO believe that the human condition will not change within a
century, these other groups cannot put forward a viable plan that keeps
humanity from destroying most remaining habitat on earth before before
the year 2100, based on simple extrapolation. On the other hand, if
you are willing to accept and plan for the advent of superintelligence
and fully-developed molecular nanotechnology, then you can at least
develop plans to preserve many ecosystems. Technologies powerful
enough to preserve the environment are also powerful enough to
profoundly change the human condition, probably superceding
humanity with transhumanity or posthumanity or whatever you want
to call it.
   For one possible approach to saving the environment, see
the appropriate chapters of "Unbounding the Future," which is
now available on the web at http://www.foresight.org along with
a lot of other nanotech stuff.

Re:    Alcor Conference 3-5 April, 1998 in Phoenix, AZ


*** Just Confirmed!  Max More, President of the Extropy Institute, will be

participating in two key panels at the conference.


In the first panel, to be chaired by Marvin Minsky at the Saturday Evening

Banquet ("What's in it for me?") the basic question is, "Why should *you*

want to be there in the future, both near term and indefinitely thereafter?"

The next morning, Max will be one of the panelists in a session led by James

Halperin on "Identity and Reanimation" ***


Below you will find registration information and an updated schedule.  This

Conference is almost certain *not* to remain an annual event.  This might be

your last chance to attend a large scale, national cryonics conference

before the year 2000 or 2001.


Extensive details are on Alcor's website, at http://www.alcor.org (just

click on "Conference").  The info below is updated as of 3/19/98, and is the

most reliable data on the program and how to register. 



(Registration Info):


Regular Rate - $149 (applies to all registrations, but space is not

guaranteed at the sessions or banquet if you register after March 30, 1998

or at the door.  - in case of limited seating capacity, those who registered

earlier will have higher priority.)  Register by phone: (800)367-2228; Ask

for Joe Hovey.  Visa or MasterCard accepted.  Full package includes all

presentations and materials, Saturday luncheon and Saturday evening banquet.


Lodging: $99/night, single or double room.  Conference Hotel is the Holiday

Inn Select near Phoenix, AZ's Sky Harbor Airport (24 hour complimentary

shuttle available.)  Call 602-273-7778 for reservations.  Mention that you

***** reprint of CryoNet posting *****



From: Fred Chamberlain (fred@alcor.org)

Re: Alcor Conference - Why You Should Be There!

Date: 3/18/98


Many cryonicists have told me (and I understand) that due to the meager time

left and other commitments, they cannot attend.  They all say:


"I'll be there next year!"


To repeat, I understand!  I wish we could have had the information to you

earlier, but there are  still reasons to consider attending!


WHAT YOU MISS IF YOU DON'T COME.


(1)  The speakers and panel leaders for this year are pretty awesome, and we

can't hope to have a program like this on an annual basis.  Marvin Minsky

and James Halperin, for example, are both wedging us onto their calendars

this year.  This is a "four leaf clover" level of luck for us.  On the "five

leaf clover" level, Greg Fahy is speaking, as well as key investigators from

21st Century Medicine, Inc.  Their work over the last 3-5 years represents

profound innovation in resuscitation technologies and new cryobiological

approaches.  Professionals from a major investment firm (Smith Barney) will

be talking about financing cryonics and preserving wealth.  Full information

is out, in hard copy and on the web.  I don't have to repeat it for you here.


NO CONFERENCE NEXT YEAR?


(2)  This year's conference would be a hard act to follow.  The next year

will see the startup of a major cryonics service corporation, BioTransport,

Inc.  A major push will take place to carry research into general

availability for cryonics suspensions.  Research will continue at a high

pace, by 21st Century Medicine, Inc.  Another conference next year would be

unrealistic!  You may expect 2-3 year intervals, for the near term.


ALL REGISTRATION FEES AT REGULAR RATE!


(3)  In some cases, we could not confirm key speakers until weeks ago.  This

highlights the difficulties of organizing an annual, national level cryonics

conference.  It also points out the difficulties of attendees planning ahead

for it.  Because of the short notice given, we are holding conference

registration fees at regular rate, but there is a catch: we must base the

size of room we get on the number of attendees we predict.  The same goes

for banquet seating.  In case of seating limitations, those who register

earlier will have higher priority.


PANEL DISCUSSION - "CRYONICS SERVICE PROVIDERS"


One speaker slot has opened up.  Rather than fill this time with an

alternate presentation (there are plenty of backup speakers) we are

organizing a panel discussion on "rescue services" organizations.  You will

have heard one talk on BioTransport, Inc., a  new corporation which is

negotiating with both Alcor and CryoCare, but there is the longer term to

consider, as well as what tradeoffs there might be over the next few years.


***** Is a Six Phase Development Plan Best? *****


BioTransport proposes to first deliver services in the area of (1) training,

(2) logistics of medications and equipment, and (3) internet based advisory

services for field linkage to research center professionals.  Then it

proposes to move into furnishing (4) field coordinators, (5) complete teams,

and finally (6) complete contractual patient care from standby through

cooldown.  Is this the best course of development?


***** What About Alternative Technologies? *****


As vitrification becomes practical (although probably more expensive), what

other options should be under development for more affordability?  How much

research priority should be given to the development of these options?  How

important will rescue be, under various scenarios?  If a point is reached

where cryonics becomes "popular", how can the enigmas of high cost and wide

public demand be resolved?


***** How About Competition As An Important Safeguard? *****


In any important service area, lack of competition can lead to complacency

and (worse) loss of service in the event of a single company's failure.  On

the other hand, too much competition, too soon, causes a shift of resources

into marketing and away from actual service delivery.  As cryonics grows,

how can these opposing priorities be balanced?  Should regional centers be

"spun off" as separate, autonomous service providers, operating under the

quality agreements of a professional association to which they all

subscribe?  How can reliability, affordability, quality and high ethical

standards best be maintained in a competitive context?  How are all of these

questions affected by the fact that cryonics is, as yet, an "unproven"

procedure in any case?


***** Other Obvious Questions *****


We might also ask:  "What are the consequences, if we assume that "these

"things will take care of themselves"? or "Why haven't we asked these

questions *earlier*?"  Readers of CryoNet, perhaps can suggest many other

questions related to service provider development, in the next week or so,

but clearly, the best way to get these questions answered is to come to the

conference and ask them yourselves! 


DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MISS THIS CONFERENCE???


Many of you have made arrangements for suspension, and are trusting in your

organizations to be there when you need them, to suspend you, to keep you

safe for decades and then "get you back if possible" at the other end.  This

is a complicated chain of events you have set in motion, and it is not

inexpensive.  You have made a large commitment to be part of the world of

the future, and what you have working for you, basically, is the entire

"community" of all existing cryonics organizations.


This conference  will lead to mindsets and goals which affect your survival.

Not *all* of you can be there, but those of you who can be, *should* be!


Here's what's necessary:


(1) Call Joe Hovey (Alcor) to register, at (800)367-2228.

(2) Call the hotel to reserve a room, code "ALC", at (602)273-7778.

(3) Call an airline and make a reservation, or gas up your car!

(4) One way or another, *be* there!  (Your life is at stake!)

Yes, I have found that with the exception of large environmental disasters
(which wouldn't have occured if governments had not been in collusion with
and sheilded big corporations in the first place), most environmental
protection is more effective if it is done by individuals working on their
own property with their own assets. Private land trusts have done more to
protect wilderness here in the Northeast US far more than the federal
government has. It also allows for more neighborliness.

Yeah, that's right, I can't read. You got my number. In fact, I have a
team of monkeys here randomly hitting keys, hopefully, I will get an
email message out soon. Or maybe they will finish Hamlet for me soon. 

I have met many Secular Humanists and not one of them was using it as a
euphemism! That proves it, I'm right, you're wrong! Actually, that would
be a silly way to go about it. I was just pointing out that your comment
was not a fair way to characterize humanism. You should try some
scientific method which does not allow one to use such "personal" off
the cuff observations as evidence to support claims. Have you ever heard
of the science method? Of course you have. Just as I can read. I was not
jumping on your back, why did you feel it necessary to stomp on mine?
You just were making it sound like Secular Humanism was philosophically
a "weak straw man" which is identical to atheism. This would not be a be
a far criticism. It is like then people characterize transhumanism as
science fiction that is confused about reality. 

Also, I just wondering what this meant:

(I only went through this exercise because you countered an

What did I counter wrong? Maybe I did, but what are you talking about?
If I did, I am sorry to whomever I did that too. I try not to post items
to newsgroups if I do not understand the topic.
