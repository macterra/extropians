I do recall, and posted a message which stated that the information
density these days is much higher than in the past, so kids know more
than they used to. Very similiar to last paragraph of your post. I
wonder if there might be an enhanced effect for kids who browse the

I distinguish "moral" from "ethical".  I see ethics as being pro-survival
(at least for the person holding them).  Morals are handed down from a
"higher authority" and as such I tend to ignore or laugh at them.

Are we assuming that the woman won't give you any pig if you ask nicely?

If not, you may be in the wrong for grabbing the pig (stealing is stealing),
but if you would otherwise starve, I would consider you justified in doing
so.  If pig-stealing carries a death penalty on this island, you're SOL.
If the penalty is a year in jail, three days of ditch-digging, a fine, or
whatever, it beats starving.

In any case, if the woman didn't steal the pig, she can roast it, eat it
raw, throw it to the sharks, or hang it up as a decoration without it
being any kind of coercion.

Government should not control radio, TV, the press  or the Internet.
Repeal regulations on sex for consenting adults.
Drug laws do more harm than good. Repeal them.

Businesses and farms should operate without govt.  subsidies.
People are better off with free trade than with  tariffs.
Minimum wage laws cause unemployment. Repeal them.
End taxes. Pay for services with user fees.
All foreign aid should be privately funded.

That is a very good question; I'm not sure I can give an equally good
answer since it depends on a lot of parameters.

Basically, the neurons contain more potassium ions than sodium ions
and outside the membrance the concentrations are reversed. This sets
up a membrane potential of around -70 mV. In the membrane there are
ion channels that can allow the ions to flow in and out; when they open
the cell is depolarized and the membrane potential increases (the cell
fires). Many of these channels are voltage dependent: they open if the
membrance potential is above a certain threshold, set by the shape
and properties of the protein molecule making up the channel. So if the
cell is depolarized above their threshold, they will open, ions will
start to flow, more channels will open and a chain reaction sets in,
and the cell fires (as it becomes maximally depolarized other voltage-
dependent channels set in, and the cell starts to hyperpolarize again).

So the exact threshold is set by:
*	The ion concentrations in the cell and surrounding liquid.
*	What ion channels are present
*	If various chemicals have linked to the ion channels 
*	Cell geometry
*	Passive membrance properties
+ a lot of other things we have not yet discovered. 

The most common way of modifying the threshold is not to change it,
but to change the resting potential of the cell. If the cell contains
much calcium, its potential will be lower and it is harder to fire;
many regulating systems in the neurons depend on changing the calcium
levels (it also acts as a primitive internal messenger signal for 
a variety of purposes).

Hi, this is Mizuho from Japan.

It is difficult for Japanese hospice to have 
a suspension facility for now.
"Cryonics" is not so popular in Japan yet.  If a patient 
comes to a hospice, learns about cryonics for the first 
time, and applies for cryonics, the patient will likely have 
problems with his or her family regarding his or her 
property.  We therefore cannot offer cryonics to hospices.

However, the purpose of a hospice is to meet patients' needs 
wherever possible, so if a patient has sufficient knowledge 
of cryonics and asks for suspension, the staff of hospic
 must grant that request.  
Hospices that understand their duties will cooperate.

Yoko, a member of Metamorphosis Society, who does volunteer (musical 
performance) work at a hospice, has the same viewpoint.
It takes 30 minutes by car from our office to the hospice where she 
performs as a volunteer.  When we can afford to have a 
suspension facility, we will ask the hospice to cooperate.

I think infinitely complex is the likely choice. I'm not sure I can
prove it (metamathematics is not my strong suit), but given the
results by Chaitin about the random and non-algorithmic structures
in the natural numbers it seems that the complexity of mathematics
is infinite, not just incomprehensible. Which is good news actually -
at least the mathematicians will never run out of new stuff to
discover (and if platonic materialism/Max tegmark's TOE holds, then
there are an infinity of surprising universes out there). 

> Would you say this is the limiting factor to omniscience?

Well, omniscience is limited by what is logically possible to know.
So even an omniscient being in our universe would not be able to
learn both the position and momentum of a particle; to do that it
would have to be "outside" the system. But in this larger system 
there will be things it cannot know, and so on. 

(You can guess that during the moments I'm a theist my idea about
God is rather bizarre :-)

Yes I read it ! maybe I just missed that part, I'll read it again
But I was referring to the "actual" start-up, like Anders Sandberg
took it. So you just "wake-up"? I thought there had to be a "pulse"
from outside, something like what they do, when someone's hart
has stopped ( a bit like flatliners, or so )

BTW: the site were the article is  www.merkle.com

Thanks again for the help !

I like him as just much as I like von Mises, Max Weber, Gottfried Dietze,
Richard M Weaver, Russell Kirk, Milton Mayer, Murray N. Rothbard, Milton
Friedman, or Peter Drucker.  Every thing they wrote was interesting,
enlightening, and true.  Every young person should read them, in addition to
many other authors.

But like the version of Moses described in the The Pentateuch And Haftorahs,
the Douay (Catholic) version, and the King James version of the Bible all
compiled and edited by Ezra the priest with his decree from the King of
Persia to make the priestly establishment (Ezra 7:24) exempt from the first
tithe; these clever fellows from central Europe and their English and
American students told the English and American publics only ten twelfths of
the Law.  The people of Israel never laid eyes on either the first two, or
the second two, tables of the Law (look em up your self, I'm not your
nigger).  That Biblical King of Persia is as responsible for the U.S. tax
code as Moynihan, Dole, and Greenspan.

All of those intellectually gifted central Europeans preached the free
market, without explaining the technical requirements for creating and
sustaining a free market, which requirements were well defined by Henry
Carter Adams in his 1887 essay RELATION OF THE STATE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION,
reduced to practice by English and American industry ever since, and
confirmed again as recently as 1954 by the "early" Paul A Samuelson; before
he had to choose between continuing an unemployed economist, or, becoming a
wealthy author of the politically correct ECONOMICS, of which I own a ninth
edition together with Stiglitz' The Collected Scientific Papers of P.A.S.,
1966.  Now there's another smart Swede?

Did Peter Drucker disclose the "concept of a corporation" in his book of that
title?  He did not, and neither did Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. in his 1963 book, MY
YEARS WITH GENERAL MOTERS.  I became acquainted with the "concept of a
corporation or commonwealth" by a fortuitous exposure to General Electric's
1940's decentralization program.  Adam Smith, in 1776, understood the
corporation or commonwealth to be the same concept in his First Maxim of
Taxation.

Step up to the plate and pitch me another soft ball,

No, you must be a time-traveler.  How are we supposed to just "look

I can't find anything to support these particular definitions; every
dictionary I have defines "ethical" and "moral" in terms of each other,
or merely of "right and wrong".  "Ethical" /is/ given the particular
connotation of relating to the practice of a profession, and "moral"
is often given the connotation of relating specifically to sexual
practices, but otherwise they are essentially interchangeable, as they
are in common usage.

In fact, because "ethical" does have the professional connotation,
"ethics" are generally applied to written codes of conduct for lawyers,
legislators, doctors, etc.; whereas "morals" are always personal.  On
those definitions, I find ethics to be worthless and morals to be
valuable.  Like you, I have no interest in codes imposed from some
authority, only what's actually right and wrong.

Because these definitions are so vague, I think it makes little sense
to maintain any distinction unless glossed for a particular argument
and limited to that argument.

Explanation for aneurosophic computer programmers:

Most neurons fire around 200 times per second, on the average.  Most people
visualize the brain as discrete sparks jumping and spreading from neuron to
neuron, not least because that's how "neural nets" work.  In reality, much of
the information may be carried by differences in firing frequency.  Some
neurons actually slow others down.

If your brain is unfrozen in an unactivated state, but with all permanent
structure present (the pattern of connections, the default frequencies), the
neurons will start firing at their default frequency.  Then the frequencies
will start modulating each other and the mind will "boot up".  At least,
that's the hope.

Limiting the scope to humans for now, a meme is a human behavior or trait
acquired through sensory input from other humans, rather than biologically.
A meme has the properties of (1) replication--it can be learned from
others, (2) mutation--it can be created newly or changed, and (3)
competition--humans with different sets of memes compete for resources.

"Memetic" is just the adjective form, so a "memetic system" is just your
collection of memes--the language you speak, the way you hold a fork,
the way you throw a baseball--even things like the rules of baseball and
the design of a fork.  These things are all reproduced by communication
and interaction among humans.

The word is a recent coinage by Dawkins in _The Selfish Gene_, and is
only recently appearing in general print, so it will likely be in
dictionaries in a few years.

I don't understand how you can use "rather" here, since you
can't have one of these things without the other.  If you're
favoring one, then you're favoring the other.  Unless you think
of the death of an individual conspecific as *not* being an
injury to the species.  But I do think morality is far and away
more a memetic phenomenon than a genetic one, although it's true
that these two domains are messily intertwingled with one
another.

Genetic selection certainly happens at the individual level, not
the species or gene level... it is not actual genes that get weeded
out by natural selection, but individual zygotes, particular
combinations of genes.  It's only the additive effect of natural
selection upon us zygotes that results in modifications to the gene
pool.  That's why biological evolution is so much slower than
cultural evolution.

At the memetic level, on the other hand, conscious selection can
be as fine-grained as we like.  I can consciously decide that X is
a bad idea, and discard it.  If I have trouble discarding it, then
I can start making fun of it, and encouraging my friends to joke
about it, and that often drives the demon out.

Well considering she used the thought experiment of an "indestructible
robot" in her ethics, people in glass houses, y'know?  'Likely' has
nothing to do with it.  I agree that ethics is for everyday life, but
what these thought experiments bring out is the deepest presuppositions
in that everyday ethics. Testing to destruction, you might say.  

Anyway, what do *you* think about the change of metaphor?  It sure seems
less intuitively obvious that the woman has initiated coercion, than
when you think of some curmudgeon fencing in a bit of sod, doesn't it?

I suppose what I'm getting at is, why would somebody feel the need to
fence in and say "this is mine, fuck off", unless there was some danger
of people rudely coming and interfering with whatever he was doing with
it, without so much as a by-your-leave.  The point of the rule of
property is not that it is a defence by the owner, but a forbearance by
everyone else - it gives bite to the notion of freedom by creating a
'clearing' for everyone within which it is possible to *be* free.

Yes ! Now, being demoniac, how about speeding up the brains of those who say

As I see it, there is only one true universal moral; the primethic. Clearly
implied by the primethic decision is the right to consent. In making the
primethic decision, I claim the right to consent for myself, and reciprocoly
offer the same, equal right to all others, while stipulating that it is
moral to defend myself. All morals systems, ethics, laws, etc. are by
agreement, flowing from the right to consent, which comes from the primethic
decision.

For words to have universal meaning, they must, directly or indirectly, be
linked to an objective phenomenon. Both defense and aggression are
objectively observable phenomena. If the primethic is universal, defense and
aggression, in the human context, must be defined non-controversially, i.e.
in their most obvious forms. I'm still working on it. Here is my latest
version of these definitions:

***"Defense" is an individual's proportionate resistance to a threat of
subjectively valued loss of life, liberty, or possessions, while
"aggression" is another individual's deliberate attempt to cause such loss.***

You're quite right. What I should have said was, "morality seems to favor
species survival over individual survival." Individuals have been known to
sacrifice themselves for others, progeny in particular.

What I am talking about is the basis of morality, i.e. universal morality,
not particular morals systems. I think we need a new word here. How about
"primethic"?

The Primethic Decision = a personal choice to the effect that proportionate
defense against aggression is *moral* and aggressive behavior which elicits
a defensive response is *immoral*.

What do you think?

The primethic decision may or may not be instinctive, but it does seem to be
widespread, and I think, either way, it provides a solid foundation for a
free (consensual) society.

Left anarchists seem to be concerned with whether you're using something
rather than owning it.  Someone killing a pig and eating it is one
thing.  Someone fencing some sod and farming it is another, but similar.
Someone fencing in some sod for farming which other people had been

Sometime soon I hope to read up on the communes around the time of the
Spanish Civil War and on the economic customs of Gypsies, as these are

No, you must be a time-traveler.  How are we supposed to just "look

What about purely creative thinking, does this require something to

To provide criticism, yes.

OK, fair enough. Here are my definitions:

***"Defense" is an individual's proportionate resistance to a threat of
subjectively valued loss of life, liberty, or possessions, while
"aggression" is another individual's deliberate attempt to cause such loss.***

Note that my definitions describe objectively observable phenomena.

My criticism is not so much of your definitions as your tendency to regard
them as proof of your arguments. Why is aggression immoral? Your usual
response is to say that it is immoral by definition. Even if your definition
were standard, it still doesn't answer the question.

I suspect you are trying to avoid the unavoidable, so let me answer the
question for you. Aggression, *in your opinion*, is immoral, because you
have made the primethic decision. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

In the hands of a malicious genii, or even an objective one, this could
easily lead to a hellish situation.  Your brain, thinking a million times
faster, is trapped in a body able to move only at normal speeds.  It will
take twelve subjective days for one second of normal time to go by,
during which your sensory inputs are limited to whatever you happened to
be looking at at the time.  This will effectively produce sensory
deprivation, without regard to what months of paralysis will do to your
psyche.  You'd probably be unable to talk or move with any coordination.
Your first act will be to fall over, if you were standing.  Luckily you
will have weeks to get ready before you hit the floor.

All in all, not a very smart wish as worded...  And you know how those
geniis are...

Pournelle's chart is more theoretical: its axes are statism and

are not the same thing!)

The Nolan Chart is more pragmatic: its axes are "Personal Freedom"
(sex, drugs, the draft) and "Economic Freedom" (minimum wage, taxes,
licensing).  Used with the "World's Shortest Political Quiz", which
some have criticized for its quick'n'dirty selection of questions
which may tend to overestimate the number of libertarians.

(Dave Nolan is a founder of the LP.)

I once met someone who objected to the Nolan Chart because it's square
and a hexagon is a more natural shape!

At 11:58 AM 9/30/97 -0400, Darrell wrote stuff.

I read your post with initial disappointment that turned around as I went
on.  I wish you'd sorted out the logic before posting.  You start by making
the oft-heard but absurd claim

We've been down this track before.  You're assuming part of what needs to
be demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding
reliably.  That's contingently true of complex critters, as it happens, but
what we need to ask is why it should be so.  (In other words, it is
logically possible that an endlessly healthy, self-repairing and fertile
couple could production-line their joint genes until the end of time, with
a superior inclusive fitness function for their very own selfish genes than
their watered-down cousin gene pool.  Both Darwin and Mendel would rub
their hands with glee without a single censorious word of reproof.)

Closer to making sense.  This again, however, tends to assume what needs to
be shown.  What are the characteristics that keep you fighting fit as a
rug-rat, a child, an adolescent and a young parent but go on to sap your
reproductive health in later years?  Having a good immune system, once it's
been primed, should give you a snappy start in life, but surely should also
*continue* as a benefit.  (On the other hand, we set out with a limited if
Vast immunity repertoire, and the little bastards who breed in us keep
changing their formula, so the simple passage of time might be enough to
make oldsters vulnerable to Widowmaker '99 - but that doesn't explain these
ugly crowsfeet and those hot flushes.)  Certain specific trade-offs have
been suggested by experts such as George Williams, but the devil is in the
details.  Hand-waving can support either tendency, I think.  

Note that this hangs on the assumption that some metabolic mechanisms
especially beneficial to the infant, say, will turn and bite later on.  I
dunno - maybe if you're a chubby cholesterol-rich kid you do better than
the lean and hungry look, and then the arterial accumulation knocks you off
after 50 fertile years.  But we know there are snazzy mechanisms for
healing sick DNA and other damage - a different point, granted - because
our gonadal DNA is 3 billion years old and not a day the worse for it (same
homeobox sequences, often enough - highly conservative).  Aside from those
pesky risks to purity of essence, to wit--

>The first place that cell damage will cause

Well... okay, that makes sense - but is exposure to free radicals and
cosmic rays and really bad television programs for 40 years so much more
damaging, even lethal, than for 20 years?  My hunch is that the machinery
for keeping gonadal DNA clean and shiny is specialised and too expensive to
share around generally, and that some suboptimal babies are not due to
damaged ova but to clapped out Mommies and their poorly maintained
life-support system innards.  True, Down syndrome is a specific
embryological glitch, an extra somatic chromosome acquired during meiosis,
but might Down births be due not so much to an excess of these foetuses
from older mothers and maybe fathers as to a breakdown in the standard
flushout mechanism for teratological deviations?  (Any experts out there?)

Surely.  It will presumably require - at least in the short term - the
physical introduction of cleaners and sweepers at the nano scale, getting
their purity guarantees and power supply from outside the body, from
culturgens rather than  directly from genes.  Works with memes, sort of.

I've found through life experience and through extensive reading of
philosophy that "coercion" tends to be in the eye of the beholder.
Those who spin the right rhetoric and grease the right palms in
regards to their view of coercion get to create things we now
call "laws". Those of you that own a house or property and are
sure of your right to keep people out(because of laws,rights,etc.)
might want to ask a decendant of an American Indian what his
view on your "property rights" are.

 IAN: And if A is on, for example where A 
 is a lightbulb, then we have at the same 
 time defined some area that is not on.

 Notice, for example, that when a light 
 is on, or luminous, the area around it 
 is not luminous... cool... or cool & hot.

 Were it not for that not-Luminosity there
 would be no Luminosity,  therefore not-L
 is a necessary feature of L. If L is all
 those things necessary for its existence,
 all those things apart from which L cannot
 exist, then L = not-L.

I assume the "misinformation" you are referring to must be WesBurts
claim that "The people of Israel never laid eyes on either the first
two, or the second two, tables of the Law".

I wasnt really claiming this information was no longer available. I
was responding to WesBurts arrogant citations of all the economic
experts he had read and the implication that everyone else should do
the same or else grovel silently at his feet.  

Some people like to cite references (Im guilty) while others (like
Lee Crocker and Anders Sandberg) are more adept at condensing complex
subjects into their own words.  Both approaches can add value.

However, I think that suggestions for *everyone* to read the
classics *as a first step* (not that YOU made such a suggestion),
ignoring principles of comparative advantage and division of labor,
are counter-productive in todays rapidly changing memetic milieu.

The recently discussed Flynn effect probably results from the
pressure of explosive accumulations of information and the development
of tools such as FAQs and search engines (recently), along with media
such as broadcast news and documentaries, readers digests and
encyclopedias (in the more recent past).  As a child (in the Sixties)
I recall *devouring* magazines and encyclopedias, almost from cover to
cover, but only *browsing* the musty volumes of the Harvard Classics
on my parents shelves.

Anyway, a happy New Year to you too (every day starts one for me!)

Actually, I'm attempting to create a de facto meaning, if not definition,
but I at least thought that I was explicit about that.  Hm -- I guess I
left out the additional "As I see it" before morals -- sorry.

I have enough faults -- please don't attribute ones I don't have out of

Well I don't own a house, but if I did it wouldn't change my belief that
in a lot of cases the land was, in the common definition of theft,
stolen from the American Indians.  That is precisely the gist of my
argument.  

I don't think coercion is subject to as much doubt as you do.  It is
amongst leftists, but that's because they are so confused about it.;-)

Due, largely, to laws on zoning and renting. If banks could rent out
offices for residential use and kick out the tenants at a day's notice
when they found a business that wanted to move in, then they certainly
would. Yet again the socialist laws which supposedly 'protect' us are
really just harming the poor.

Subject: "MORALITY?"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org


                               
The concept, morality, is probably the most popular topic of
conversation in the world.  Wherever one turns, one is inundated
by talk of morally right, or moral rights, or the complement,
morally wrong, or immoral, but I don't suppose anyone claims
"immoral rights"; at least, I haven't heard of any doing so. All
in all, there are a lot of words flying about on this subject
with some rather strong emotions often attached. The problem is
this airborne dialogue on "morality" seems to stay airborne,
which puts me to wondering just what the hoopla is all about.
What's all the rhetoric attached to? Why do some feel the need to
"justify" their actions? And "justify" by what?  It appears that
the Extropian List has its fair share of "moralist", so maybe
someone can help me out on this.

I understand cause and effect, that all actions have
consequences. I understand that consequences to my liking I call
good, and those I do not like, I call bad.  Does not every
individual do the same?  I hear "morally right" and "morally
wrong", but it fits not in my thinking. I can grasp right as
proper means suited to a specific purpose. By the same token, I
can grasp wrong means for a specific purpose. But purpose is a
matter of individual choice is it not? So, is a "moralist" simply
saying that what is suited to his purpose is called moral and
that which is not is called immoral? If not his purpose, whose?
Or what's? Can we have "good or bad" without purpose?

There are those that say that what is according to "God's will"
is moral; that which opposes is immoral. Alas, it appears that
"God's will" is a diverse thing and the differences of opinion
follow suspiciously along individual lines. One might say that it
is immoral to eat a hot dog while another disagrees, but holds
that it is moral to exterminate all non believers. Thus does
"good and evil" cover a wide "moral and immoral" range" of
differences. 

Then there are those who consciously and verbally dismiss such
mysticism as "God's will", yet cling no less tenaciously to the
idea of morality than the most devout believers in formal
religion. When pressed for an answer to the question of reference
for claims of moral or immoral, they are at a loss to provide it.
Some say that which is consistent with life is moral; that which
is inconsistent with life is immoral. This leaves a lot of
questions unanswered. If one is talking about just bare survival,
there still remains the question of personal choice. Beyond this,
choices, decisions and actions  comprise an active life. To just
say that "life" is a standard not only denies personal choice,
but totally ignores the elements that make up an ongoing life. To
prepare a list of "moral or immoral" things and attempt to
validate such a list is venture that many include in their daily
routine.  Thus by inference do they fall right back into the
mysticism of "God's will" and a set of "oughts" for one and all.
The "oughts" and "shoulds" fill the air and air seems to be their
only filler, for "ought" is recognition of "not is", and the
twain shall never in reality meet. 

The issue can be illuminated by a simple observation and a brief
question or two: The terms, good and bad, have no definitive
meaning except in the evaluation of means in respect of a
particular end. Suited or unsuited is the question that answers
the question, good or bad. So how does this "morality" stuff get
into the picture?  Is the particular end by individual creating,
or is it a claim of discovery existing independently of
individual creating? If the former, then all individuals and
their ends chosen are no less viable. All arguments of "morality"
are pointless.

On the other hand, if it is claimed the end reference purpose for
"moral" or "immoral" is discovered outside of self or
independently of any individual, whether the alleged source is
called "God", "Nature", whatever,  is immaterial. A purpose
existing independently of individual creating necessarily implies
a volitional source existing independently of individual. Thus
one must claim personal values as the basis for "morality" or
concede a "superior being" as source. I know of none who claim
the former. Although not named and often vehemently denied, this
leaves the latter, i.e, the concept, superior being, as the root
of "morality."  From the concept, superior being, comes the
concept, inferior being. This is inevitably followed by
subordination and rule. Since history books and daily newspapers
tell of the horrendous consequences, I need not elaborate here. 

To be sure, the idea of the "innate evil of man" in need of
redemption and external control by "non man" is deeply embedded
in the psyche of nearly all. In denial of this belief, they are
hard put to explain the feeling of fear at the thought of leaving
an individual to his choices and own devices. Thus do they pursue "moral
control" for the sake of "security" in a never ending self-
fulfilling prophecy of death and destruction. Do not the facts
bear out this conclusion?  An "unquestionable" sacred idea built
on illusion may be emotionally comforting, but it is often quite
deadly. 

If I have erred in my deliberations and calculations, please
point out the wheres and whys of the flaws and I shall be
grateful.

Could it be that ethics is individual while moral is group? (species, family,

Clearly, recovering stolen goods is a proportionate response to a previous
aggression.

See above.

By agreement. See below.

A description of an objectively observable phenomenon must describe that
phenomenon as it is, not as the observer wishes it to be.

The distinction between "proportionate" and "disproportionate" is clear at
it's extremes, and ambiguous in the middle. Still, it must be a part of the
definition of A/D, because a disproportionate response transforms the
defender into the aggressor.

"Threat" is another term that is clear at the extremes and ambiguous in the
middle. It must also be a part of the definition of A/D, because individuals
clearly defend against credible threat.

Note also that my definition could be applied to non-human A/D, and yes,
defense against rising floodwaters, as well. The question is not whether we
like the definition or not, but whether it accurately describes the
phenomenon. If it does, then it is a universal definition.

What does this all add up to? A/D is clearly distinguishable at it's
extremes and ambiguous in the middle. All of the ambiguity must be worked
out by agreement. For this, we need the right to consent. The right to
consent comes from the primethic decision.

In unilaterally deciding that defense against aggression, in the human
context, is moral, and aggression, in the human context, is immoral, I am
claiming the right to consent for myself, and reciprocoly offering the same
right to all others, with the stipulation that I consider it moral to defend
myself against aggression.

If others make the same commitment (the primethic decision), we have the
basis (Schelling Point) from which to negotiate further agreements.

What falls out of the primethic decision is the basis of both rights and
morality. It might well be called the libertarian decision.

Well, we wouldn't think of considering our wives to be our property, but
the original Native American would. Despite the rhetoric of leftists,
and the claims of shamans, it is quite a mixed bag on the Native
American concept of ownership of land and other property. All recognised
a minimum concept that property inhabited and hunted by a tribe belonged
to the tribe as a whole, while others that did not live at such a
subsistence level and were not nomadic did acknowledge more individual
rights. This minimum concept as tribal land was the source of much
conflict among tribes. Less nomadic natives like the Iroquois and the
Algonquin did have established individual property rights that were in
their code of law that was administered by their organized government.
Europeans seem to look to Greece and Rome as the main source of
inspiration for the US model of government, but they are either not
aware of or ignoring the Iroquis Confederation that preceded the US
government by several hundred years, and is strikingly similar in
structure. The Articles of Confederation which preceded the US
Constitution by over a decade are in fact an extremely close translation
of the Iroquis Verbal Law as recorded in the late Iroquis period.

However, after all this, I still don't understand why the concept of
implied threat of force as backing for rights of any kind is so
abhorrent. Humans are, after all, carnivores and the top predators on
this planet. It is our nature to be forceful. This is one more in a
never ending chain of examples of how liberals morality diametrically
opposes prosurvival behaviors which have proven their worth for millions
of years.

Why not?  The anarchists would claim that any system which sanctions
such inequities among human beings is unacceptable.  That holding but
not using resources which other people could use is theft, and
inefficient.  If you're not using the building how is someone else
moving into it theft?  How is it unjust?

Mark Grant's retort that the empty office buildings are guarded by
zoning laws was a rather more effective defense of capitalism.

For more hard-nosed extropians... these issues are related to
homesteading.  How _will_ property in space (favored orbits, asteroids)
be allocated?  If someone sends out loyal von Neumann machines to
'homestead' all of Mars, should[1] we acknowledge the claim?

If you just said "yes", will you acknowledge NASA doing the same thing?

If you said "no", how do you justify that?  And if your response has
anything to do with "reasonable use", you just wandered into 'left'
territory.

[1] Practically, if someone actually controlled all of Mars like that,
we might well have to acknowledge the claim.  This hardly challenges the
claim that "property is theft" -- i.e., property goes to the biggest
muscle or gun -- though.

I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Considering that we only have
100,000 active genes, as far as anyone can tell, we start out with a
rather small immunity repertoire.  But lymphocytes -- the antigen
specific white blood cells -- actually have their genes rearranged as
they split from a stem cell, thus making them the only somatic cells
which do not have the same genome as all the other cells.  Estimates of
their possible diverity range from 10^8-10^11 for B cells (blood/serum
antibodies) and 10^15-10^18 for some other branch (which by elimination
should be the T cells (which kill infected or tumorous cells) but I
could have forgotten something.)  In the latter case there are obviously
rather more possibilities than cells in the body.  More time to evolve
is no inherent advantage on the pathogens side.

The entire specific immune system is an excellent example of applied
evolution; many new lymphocytes die due to inability to recognize MHC
molecules or ability to recognize self-antigens.  B cells can change
their own genomes to an effort to develop higher affinity receptors,
although I forget what stage that occurs in.  Between all this, the way
neurons hook up, and Hofstadter's work on creativity, I'm rather tempted
to say that life is an evolutionary fractal.

And the whole point is that much DNA is not very highly conserved, and
is "a day the worse for it".  That's how we evolved from prokarya.

As I see it, morality is a strong individual statement of universal intent,
by which others are able to, with reasonable accuracy, predict our future
behavior. 

If, for example, I state that theft is morally wrong, you can be reasonably
sure that I will not steal from you, or anyone else, even if the
circumstances were such that I would probably not get caught. 

If you make the same moral commitment, this moves us in the direction of
being able to peacefully coexist, making both of us safer. Such a
commitment, being universal (I will not steal from *anyone*), is a
unilateral offer to all others to join in peaceful coexistance, making all
safer. It is in our individual interests to make such commitments. And it
very well may be instinctive to do so, as well.

The idea that someday a frozen body will be revived is sort of pseudo-science,

Incidentally, I'm not sure why you'd want to launch your corpse into space. 
If you want to be revived, you should keep it down here on earth, I think.

Here's another thought on ethics and morals. Maybe, both are

Ken is not a subscriber to the extropian list. I have been forwarding my
side of the conversation with him (without snippage of his side), because I
thought extropians might find it of interest. Similarly, he is forwarding
his side of the discussion to a list of which I am not a member.

Subject: The Spike, nanotech, and a future scenario
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

This evening I finally got hold of a copy of Damien Broderick's
_The Spike_ outside of the confines of a bookstore. I'm pleased 
with the breadth of its coverage of transhumanist ideas. I'm also
glad that something has been written about the online >H culture 
of '96-'97, something beyond the web essays and list archives
that will no doubt remain suspended in cyberspace. The book has
some of the feel, for me, that being a participant online has had;
and I think the feel of things "here" will change as transhumanism 
obtains a higher profile, and as new concepts of the future emerge.
Anyway, I enjoyed it.

Since my US trip, I've become much more involved with nanotech -
I studied _Nanosystems_ while riding the Greyhound buses out to
Dallas and Zyvex, and I formed the conclusion that it should
be incredibly easy to put together complete assembler designs
(at the component-level, not the atomic-level) from what's in 
that book. Since my return to Australia, I found a web paper by 
Ralph Merkle specifying, so he claims, a set of molecular tools 
capable of synthesizing "all the rigid hydrocarbons", which would 
include any customized diamond shape (diamond*oid* might involve
elements other than carbon and hydrogen, but pure diamond seems
enough to realize the whole gamut of nanomechanical devices).
Also since my return, Zyvex have finally obtained the atomic 
probes that they were waiting for when I visited, so they've 
started the real lab work.

All in all, nanotech looks extremely close to me. And the arrival 
of MNT, I think, would invalidate the Moore's-Law type of projection
which places Singularity in 2035 or 2025, since Moore's Law
is ultimately based on the rate of improvement of semiconductor
technology. Nanotech rod logic would provide capabilities equal to
those which a Moore's-Law projection might predict for
the late 2010s. But I can imagine a Merkle-type "hydrocarbon
assembler", using buckytubes for the bodies of the molecular tools,
being made by 2005 or even by 2000.
                                   
So I'm spending a little time trying to be a good Yudkowskian
Singularitarian, aiming for Singularity now by doing my part
to hasten a complete assembler design, and spending a little
time wondering about the wisdom of hastening the arrival of a
technology which would allow one to make a planet-killing device
smaller than a bacterium - *especially* about the wisdom of
working on it in a public-domain collaboration (like 
http://nanocomputer.org). 

And I'm spending a little time on scenario generation. An example:

After the first assemblers built, there is indeed a
period of time in which "everything goes haywire": First
politically and psychologically haywire, as the powers that be all
seek a stake, and as the sort of ideas discussed in _Engines
of Creation_ are in the news media every day, accompanying
the latest reports on nanotechnological progress. Then
physically and economically haywire, as matter compilers spread
throgh society and nanomachines become part of our physical
environment (e.g. in the form of grey goo and countermeasures!). 
We might see traffic into space increase by orders of magnitude 
and a vast increase in the depth and breadth of net connectivity
(imagine everyone on Earth being handed overnight a connection 
to Neal Stephenson's Metaverse *and* the tools with
which to add to it). If most people quit their jobs, cities
everywhere could end up looking like "Burning Man"-style anarchy.
This might all take months or just weeks.

On the human timescale, I think the "haywire period" would
end with a bang, namely with whatever the first fast minds of
"approximately human level" do. I favor the view that they
would intervene along the lines of David Pearce's hedonistic
imperative, while building a "stairway to heaven" whereby
slower entities can take steps into a transhuman existence;
meanwhile, their own accelerated evolution would have made
them worthy of the name Powers, and everything that really
interested them would be taking place in a region reserved
for their own, possibly eternal, future evolution. At least,
all this happens if they don't make a Big Mistake first. 

I feel on much shakier ground speculating about this future 
of accelerated superintelligences, than I do when spinning a 
nano scenario.

Cute joke, but I hope people remember to leave it there.

This statement may surprise some who expected to see me out on 
Saturday with at least one of the women's and other groups mounting 
counterprotests to the Promise Keeper's rally:  I have decided to sit 
this one out.  I made this decision after reading reams of material 
and listening carefully to the statements made by members of PK.

No, I do not agree with many of the statements made by PK leadership, 
and I don't trust their leadership. But I also see no indication that 
the majority of their membership rules the roost at home, either.  This 
is the 1990's, after all, and most women are accustomed to some say 
in the decisionmaking process at home, if not a large say!  
Leadership may demand one standard, but the true results will be seen 
in the families.

Simply put, from a strategic standpoint I see no gain to be had from 
ranting at a group of men engaged in prayer and reflection.  Most of 
the activities engaged in by PK members fall into the private and 
personal sphere, and I do not wish to contribute to the continuing 
politicization of those activities.  There are plenty of other arenas 
in which to fight the political battles.

Question:  How would the economy function in an uploaded society?

Answer:  First you need a product, and that product is you.  After having
your wetware converted into a new infinitely variable cut-and-paste
consciousness you're ready to start production.  You're not in control of
your production, but everyone else is.  Instead you manage the marketing
side, you've got to sell the product.  Why would anyone want to buy you?
 They don't, they reproduce you.  Maybe you've got a great sense of humour, a
brilliant understanding of quantum theory or you're just easy.  Whatever the
reason, I like you and I want a copy.  So I either copy the parts of you I
like into a new individual, or I cut and paste them into myself.  Well done,
you've just reproduced.

The more you reproduce, the safer you are.  Reproduction has always been the
main priority in the biological world and the same can be said of the upload
world.  But rather than passing your genes along, you're passing along your
memes.  And the more your mind sprawls into every corner of the memesphere,
the safer you are and the more computation you're getting done.  But if it's
possible to copy consciousness, why not just copy yourself?  Everyone will,
they'll keep copying themselves repeatedly and you'll have not distinct
advantage over anyone else.  But what if you marketed yourself so well, they
also copied you?  Now you have an advantage.

How nice of you to wish death upon the one man who has done more
for humanity than any other in history.  And I'm not just saying that
because he fed me for a year.

Absent actual physical coercion, absolutely anything one does to
cajole as many people as possible to give you money--voluntarily--
is, by definition, providing a benefit to them.  Except to the small
extent of MS's government contracts (a /very/ small part of its
business) which are not paid for voluntarily, every penny of the
world's richest man's fortune came from people who /chose/ to give
it because they derived benefit from his products.  Regardless of
how grudgingly they may have felt about being locked in, or how much
they lied to themselves about wanting reliable software (no one
really wants reliable software, they just think they do), the fact
is that they signed the checks.

Despite the fact that Microsoft never really invented anything novel,
ignores standards, bullies its competitors, and does lots of other
things people might not like, the world would be a much darker and
poorer place without heroes like Gates, who do the Right Thing for
whatever reasons.  Motives don't count--results do, and Bill Gates
gets results.

When I awake from my suspension, I'd much rather see a world with
Bill Gates than some worthless whiner like Marc Andreesen.

I have no idea what you mean here--which is the only minor "fault" I
was trying to express: that your use of language could be better.
What fault did you think I was implying?  Perhaps my language wasn't
clear enough there either, but I just reread my message, and I can't
see anything in it that can be interpreted as implying fault.  I was
talking about words, nothing more, and I thought I was very clear.

I think I've met that bartender. You think you've got him figured out, but next
thing you know, he busts out with the Bushmills when all you wanted was a Bud
draft. (Watch your drink orders evolve before your very eyes...)

Anyway, I don't think Mr. Yudkowsky has enough practical experience to propose
any new kind of bartender, complex or otherwise. (Unless he has a good fake

I'm sorry, Remi, but this one was way too good to pass up. :-)

If you haven't already done so, you ought to check out Max Stirner's
"The Unique and Its Own" (commonly - IMHO - mis-translated "The Ego and
Its Own"), which is a long, in-depth, stirring critique of contemporary
ethics/politics/religion from the point of view you've just suggested.

I've often thought along those lines - despite Daniel Lee Crocker's
cogent comments about there being no difference, I can't help feeling
that morality *is* more a "we" thing, whereas ethics is more an "I" thing.

"This is how we do it here" is morality, it seems - custom, tradition,
etc., whereas ethics seems to be more like Richard Francis Burton's:

"He noblest lives and noblest dies 
Who makes and keeps his self-made laws" 

(not sure I got the quote right there, it's from his Kasidah).

At any rate, whether or not these are the right words to use for these
things, there's definitely a distinction here to be articulated.

How does this constitute an *economic* system?  Where's the economic
calculation?  Everything costs energy to make/buy.  How do we know
whether A's having made x to "put into the environment" was a net loss
or a net gain to society (whether, to use the Marxist jargon, it was
"socially necessary")?

Also, "the whole system" is not an agent: it has not brains, it doesn't
make choices.

Also, free software transactions occur in the context of a fully
functioning economic system: I don't see how they could occur without
it.  

(BTW, I'm not hostile to your ideas, I'm genuinely interested, just very
sceptical.)

I hate to say this, but: to whom?  It's acceptable to those who are
holding the property.  So why should we accept the anarchist's
preferences rather than the property holders'?  What makes the poor
person's preferences more important than the rich person's?  This seems
to me to be a breach of universalism, universal brotherhood, equality and
all that - IOW, it's another deep leftist contradiction.

Private property in the pure capitalist sense requires no justification
whatsoever.  It is based on a fact: someone *already* controls x,
therefore they should be *left* in control of it.  Finders keepers.  By
this definition, neither first acquisition nor exchange are theft,
because they violate nobody's prior control.  They do preclude other
peoples' possibilities, but that is too vague and subjective to base a
property system on, IMHO (somebody - i.e. logically, ultimately the
State - would have to calculate the relative weights to be assigned to
these 'possibilities').

What *does* require justification is the *rule* : why *should* we leave
people in control of what they already control?  The answer to that has
two parts: a moral, and an economic.  

Roughly, the moral justification is sort of Kantian: it is an insult to
human dignity to just snatch something that someone is in control of;
also, moral autonomy requires *some* stuff - a 'clearing', or a 'sphere'
- to be in control of, and*equal* moral autonomy (or equality before the
law?) for all requires that Peter not be taken away from to give to Paul,
for that is treating Peter*differently* from Paul, preferring Paul to
Peter.

The economic justification is that rewards and penalties for an action
should, as much as possible, be restricted to the actor concerned. This
makes for economic efficiency, learning curve possibilities (a la
Bionomics), etc., etc. 

Now nothing is perfect, and there are bound to be some cases where
sticking to the rule results in 'unfairness' and inefficiency; but as
Hayek showed, as a *general* rule, private property, and the economic
system that goes with it, is the best we have yet discovered for getting
the most out of our abilities and resources.  Is the glass half empty or
half full?   Leftist anarchists say half empty: they do not see what
libertarian anarchists see, which is that 90% of the time, the system
works *extremely* well, and gives more human beings the possibility of
actually progressing in their lives than any other system yet conceived.

You can't order society by exceptions.

Good statement Kathryn. From the little I know, and what I've read in
the papers of feminist opposition to PK, it seems to me that while the
PK may be overly religious, which would set off the atheistic sirens of
any radical fem, for reasons having nothing to do with family, their
main arguments for opposing PK read to me like the same sort of
doublespeak we are seeing here in the "property is theft" thread.

Anarchists would never claim that forcing someone to give up property is
acceptable. While someone may claim to be an anarchist while espousing a
"whats mine is mine and whats yours is mine if I need it" philosophy,
they do not fit the term. Forcing someone who has invested in the
construction of a building with money earned and saved to give up
partial or whole use of that facility as they see fit is theft. That a
bunch of free loaders have latched onto an Orwellian doublespeak sound
bite as a rationalisation of their own theiving proclivities does not in
any way make them anarchists.

The only opposition a true anarchist would truly have to property
ownership would be if large property owners are using their wealth to
enforce a mercantilist economic system on a free market via political
influence.

According to old international law that predates the socialist inspired
Moon and Space Treaties, as well as US minimg and homestead laws, any
uninhabited, unclaimed, unimproved property can be claimed so long as
the claimant "improves" the property in some way. THis may be as little
as adding a radar reflector or a transponder to a body, or as much as
strip mining or terraforming, but the first minimum step in claiming a
plot of land and improving it is simply going there and surveying and
staking the property. For this reason, the gentleman in California who
is selling property on the moon is doing so without even a minimum
improvement, and therefore has not claim to the land. He is using NASA
survey data to plot out lots, so he isn't even performing the survey
himself or by his agent. On the other hand, before he started, he filed
a claim of the moon with the US government, and since they have not
responded withing 90 days of the claim, legally he could have a real
claim on the property, given that the US as a soverign power has
previously claimed the moon.
> 
> If you just said "yes", will you acknowledge NASA doing the same thing?

In 1969, Neil Armstrong claimed the moon "for all mankind" and set a US
flag on it, and set up several science gathering stations. In court,
this could possibly stand as an improvement. The only remaining question
is how much land is allowed per claim. Since Columbus claimed the whole
new world for Spain, and Spain had to give up Brazil under a treaty set
by the Pope, while England and other settlers were, for all legal
purposes, claim jumpers, but Spain was never able to fully enforce their
claim due to their losses to Francis Drake. On the other hand,
individuals were only allowed so many acres per claim under the
Homestead Act. I guess since Armstrong would more resemble Columbus than
Billy Joe Homestead, due to his officers commision by a sovreign power,
he could possibly be used to claim the entire moon for the US, and
considering that the US has not and will not sign the Moon Treaty, all
they need to do is have the military capacity in space when the time
comes to enforce the claim against any claim jumper from another
country.

Abandonment of property is a justifiable cause for condemnation. This is
the basis for so called "squatters rights", where if a property owner
does not have enough of a presence, even having an owners agent oversee
the property enough to keep squatters off the land for a given interval,
then the squatters can claim the land as abandoned. In order for the
property owner to keep the land, he or his agent must be present on
occasion to press trespass charges against squatters, as a form of self
defense against the agression of squatters. If the owner does not press
charges and allows the trespass, then there is an implied permission.

If property is uninhabited, then who is the land being stolen from? It
then is not theft. The claim that enclosure prevents its use by others
and therefore is stealing it from them is bogus, unless it is abandoned.
Remember, to claim the land, it must be improved, so the property rights
are there not mainly to prevent use of the raw land by others, but to
prevent others from uncompensated use of the property owners
improvements, that the owner paid for with money earned by the owners
means of production. No one can deny an individual the right to earn a
living and save moeny, can they?

Here's a notice for you guys, if any of you are looking at the newest
version of Corel Ventura, v 7.0. Don't buy it. The company I am working
at now bought it as an upgrade from version5, which ran just fine. 7.0
however is probably the buggiest app I've ever worked with. Frames don't
stay where you anchor them, spell check locks up on funny characters
that other parts of the program generate for codes, and files get easily
corrupted. I've consistently gotten the blowoff from Corel until I
scream and shout and send them examples of how royally messed up their
software is. Compared to Corel, Microsoft is the most customer freindly
company I've ever dealt with. Needless to say, this 1200 page software
manual I've been working on has taken twice as long as it should have,
so my bosses are pretty ripped about it.

hi

Somebody gave me a web site linking Bill Gates to 666.  His name adds up to
666 in ASCII code.  Also, the Pope's official name adds up to 666 in roman
numerals.

here it is:

www2.s-gimb.lj.edus.si/natan/666.html

sorry if i already added this to the list, i cant remember if i sent it or
not.

Does anyone have information on the status of this mediator project?
I sent mail to the author a month ago but got no reply.  I suggested
they set up a sample "sandbox" where people could practice using the
software, setting up comments no each other's pages, etc.  As it is,
the chances of finding a comment are extremely remote.  It could also
have an area where the comments are wiped every week or so, so that
people could practice leaving comments without worrying that they would

I don't mean to send a "me too!" post, but I am, just so people don't
think I was being serious, or that I am a *complete* idiot.  I
whole-heartedly agree with all of Kenita's points.  No, I don't *want*
anyone to die.  I also agree that competition would sharpen up Microsoft's
products... although I won't for a second say that I like their products
now ( my last job programming with Microsoft compilers was a painful one
at best ) I'll try to keep my silly posts to a minimum !  (except for this
one, of course ;)

I ordered my copy from Australia. $20 for he book, $10 for shipping,
that's in Australian dollars, which are 1.34 to each $US, so it cost
about 20 buck US. ordered by E-mail, received it in about 5 days.

Well, I was trying to avoid all the messy details.  My key point (borrowing
from William R. Clark's neat little simplified book AT WAR WITHIN, Oxford
UP 1995) is this: the vert immune system is menaced by `a universe of
pathogens that is not only enormous to begin with but full of pathogens
that can alter themselves genetically hundreds of thousands of times faster
than vertebrates can' (263).  (Clark has also written a book, which I
haven't seen, appositely entitled SEX AND THE ORIGINS OF DEATH - anyone
read it?  Opinions?)

>The entire specific immune system is an excellent example of applied
>evolution

Indeed, although the term `variation' might be preferable since the
`competeing' units are not put through a selection sieve and do not have
descendants as such.  The genetic deck shuffling in B cells is a truly cool
gadget, with heavy chain and long chain segments built of randomly combined
V, D and J portions, some 300 fragments in the V pool, 12 D and 6 J,
permitting a basic 20,000 different antibody chains.  But because these
segments can be assembled with overlaps, the combinatoire is truly Vast.
Clark again: we thus have a system `for mutating genes that allows you to
create not hundred of *thousands* of new antibodies per *generation*, but
hundreds of *millions*... per hour.  Every hour.  All life long' (265).

Still, those little critters at the top of the food chain, chewing on us,
do quite often manage to evade the human immune system.  I assume that's
due to their stupendous numbers (permitting each species to try lots more
moves than Deep Blue), their rapid generational turnover, and their own
coat-changing.  Nesse and Williams, 1995, observe with regard to the
latter: `some pathogens alter their exposed molecular structures so rapidly
that the host has difficulty producing newly needed antibodies fast enough.
 This is rapid change without evolution, because the same pathogen genotype
codes for a variety of molecular structures' (EVOLUTION AND HEALING, 63).  

But I'm open to correction.

>Homeobox sequences might be conserved not because they get special
>repair mechanisms, but because mutants of those genes thoroughly disable
>their hosts, possibly killing them in development.

Fair enough.  But I still have this edgy feeling that some DNA volumes in
the library of Babel have better proofreaders than others - that it's not
just a matter of throwing out any completed copy with the title printed
upside down but of intercepting the bloopers in advance.

>And the whole point is that much DNA is not very highly conserved [...] 
>That's how we evolved from prokarya.

That's *not* the *whole* point.  It's the most obvious point when the
question is the existence of diversity, but I wanted to direct attention to
the less intuitive islands of stability, and raise the question of how they
managed to remain stationary despite the flux that, incidentally, wears out
our tissues and kills us.

<< Why not?  The anarchists would claim that any system which sanctions

I don't follow that...I have nothing against inequities...in fact I beleive
equality of outcome is a farce...a myth perpetuated by "do-gooder liberals"
as an excuse to acquire and use force over others...

Equality of opportunity is a different thing...although even it isn't a

If a person owns something....it's no business of yours what he does with
it...whether you think it fair...or not...and just because you disapprove in
no way makes his use of his own property "theft"


My retort to people who make such an argument " If you're not using the

 moving into it theft? " is that it's MINE...and if you don't like it...get
off your dead ass and earn your own...I've done it...starting from ground
zero...twice...and I don't see why others can't as well...

And I was just this very minute talking to a guy...he saw me sitting at the

doing...he claimed not to know how to read or wite...and yet he owns two
trucks...and is buying three more...so he must be having some success (he was
a "minority'" by the way...one of those poor downtrodden by the evil white

and this guy can...then THEY can .

Sorry for the vehemance...but theft...and the legitimazation of

The funny thing is, by ASCII code, his name in numbers does not add up
to 666, contrary to Mac/Fundamentalists everywhere. It only adds up to
666 if you count his last last name (I don't know the proper term for
it) of III (as in The Third) as being either 111 as in one -one -one,
which it is not, it is roman numerals III and three I's in ascii don't
add up to 3, which would be the neccessary result to get 666 as a sum
for his whole name, or you'd have to call that name as "3", which would
be wrong, because if you used arabic numerals, it would be 3rd for
"third" so ascii is off again. This is one more example of idiots not
doing their homework.

I was thinking more along the technological and business lines. He
predicted cable media, malls and superstores, etc. and if you think of
how much more "progressive" the tax system is now compared to then, as
well as the current moves to allow workers to choose between income or
time off for overtime work, as well as universal retirement at 65 (since
there was no such thing as retirement back then), its pretty prescient.
I still thought his political propaganda inthe book was pathetically
naive and typical of the touchy feely justification of socialistic
policies that liberals are always pushing today.

For a reason: We want to know what we OUGHT to do, in addition to what we CAN
do.  This is natural for any volitional being.  That we do indeed
consistently seek moral rules seems to be strong empirical evidence that we
in fact have a "free will."

It seems you are saying that "good" and "bad" are simply "what I like" and
"what I don't like".  You say that "purpose is a matter of individual choice"
-- but whence comes your choice?  That is the question asked by moral
philosophers.  So far, you seem to say that there is no OUGHT, there is
simply IS.  In this view, the ultimate possibility of moral choice completely
evaporates: No set of values is better than another.  That way lies the ennui
of modern existentialism and the poverty of so-called post-modernist
relativism  Moral philosophy posits at least the possibility that we can have
some rational control, or at least some rational insight into the OUGHT.
 Perhaps we do end with the moral nausea of existentialism, but we shouldn't
head straight for the philosophical alka-seltzer without examining our
options.

Those who point to a supernatural authority for moral order MAY follow an
irrational morality: As you point out, this method is ultimately grounded on
a dictat: "Good is good and bad is bad because god (or mom, etc.) says so."
 Most folks who see morality in these terms do not engage in any rational
analysis of their morals and ethics, but simply seek a pre-designated,
authoritative code of conduct that need not and should not be questioned.
 However, there are, in fact, some rational religious moral philosophers who
are willing to honestly search out the logical bases of a theological
morality.  These people will ultimately admit that their morality is based on
authority and submission: They ultimately admit that they follow certain
rules because they believe this is some god's or gods' universe and those
supernatural beings set the moral and ethical rules for the lesser beings who
inhabit that universe, like landlords dictating the terms of a lease to their
tenants.  This conclusion is ULTIMATELY irrational, but only because it is
susceptible to non-moral scientific and metaphysical validation and, so we
see so far, fails that test.

I missed a step in your reasoning here, I think.  While I think that a
morality simply based on "life" as an ultimate value is unacceptably
impoverished for conscious beings, one can develop _A_ rational morality
based on it.  One could say that life is good, non-life is bad and then
rationally derive at least some ethical rules based on such a premise.  The
problem with such a simplistic moral philosophy is that all life forms are
not capable of moral judgment.  In such a system, one would encounter large
areas of endeavor where no moral calculus -- i.e. determination of relative
good and bad -- is possible, as you point out.  But it is one possible
rational moral system, but in a very real sense, it is not the BEST one,
because it does not yield sufficiently rich guides for action in practical
terms.  This is, in fact, the basis of my criticism of modern radical
"environmentalism".

This statement seems to assume the conclusion of your inquiry.

This is the classic critique of purely utilitarian moral philosophy, and one
I believe has much merit.  Utilitarianism is a good methodology for ETHICAL
and LEGAL analysis, but answers no ultimate moral questions.

Here we see what I call "the metaphysical fallacy" in moral philosophy: You
seem to question whether moral principles EXIST apart from moral actors in
some REAL sense, i.e. you look for them as in some way PHYSICAL referents
"outside" moral actors and, naturally failing to find them, conclude that no
rational or "objective" morality can exist.

With all due respect, wrong again.  Here you assume the conclusion you
criticize, i.e. that morality must be grounded in the will of a superior
moral actor and, naturally failing to find such a moral super-being, conclude
that no "objective" morality can exist.  We could call this "the theological
fallacy" in moral philosophy.

So it seems that, having assumed only two possible sources of morality and
failing to find them, you reject the possibility of an objective morality.
 In his post, Gary Lloy points to another possibility; that moral principles
arise naturally from the interaction of beings capable of moral choice:

This is neither morality from authority, nor is it the non-morality of
complete relativism.  Interestingly for extropians, it is the morality of an
agoric system of freely interacting moral agents, a spontaneously developed
"natural morality."  One CAN rationally derive real moral principles simply
from the way volitional agents interact over time.  It is "objective" in the
sense that the moral principles that spontaneously arise from a "moral
marketplace" of free actors are independent of the actors themselves: The
principles are "true" apart from which particular actor we may consider,
subject or object.  Such principles do not fall prey to the metaphysical
fallacy, because they are not "real" in the sense that they have some
existence apart from the process of interaction itself.  But, even though
they aren't "real" in a metaphysical sense, they are capable of objective
verification because we can test the propriety of any particular principle
without regard to viewpoint.

Extropian transhumanism brings an important new element to a view of "natural
morality" thus derived from the principles of free interaction of moral
agents.  Once one rejects the notion of an immutable ceiling on human nature,
the possibility that the analysis can be short circuited by actors in a
permanently "superior" position disappears.  If one accepts that not all
humans are created equal and that the span of a human life is ultimately
limited, then one can say that principles of moral interaction can be deduced
from a system of freely interacting moral agents, but that ultimately the
humans with the most power will be able to dictate final goals or first
principles (depending on how you look at it) of the system.  In other words,
one can end such an analysis in the conclusion that what is best for the
strongest is "right".  Thus one can conceivably derive fascism from, for
instance, the ideas of Nietzsche.  But when the "moral interaction game"
becomes effectively eternal and unlimited, the system becomes, in a sense,
"morally closed", because no moral actor can be assured of a permanently
superior power position.  Thus one rationally derives basic moral values of
tolerance and reciprocity from the very nature of the world of interacting
volitional beings.

Ahh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe *you* just decided that the

Why are the extremes not contentious? Could it be that the vast majority
makes the primethic decision, as it applies to the extremes, and the
contention is in the ambiguous middle?

>Where we need agreement -- which means, where
>we need a workable definition -- is for the middle.  

Indeed. This is the primary purpose of social agreements, to devise a
workable definition for the middle. If it weren't for the ambiguity inherent
in the A/D phenomenon, we wouldn't need agreements.

>In order for us to
>HAVE such agreement, especially for it to be potentially useful in situations

This is the *purpose* of such agreements. We can't just say, "This is the
definition" and expect everyone else to accept that. We can't just force our
definition on them. That would be an immoral aggression against them, in
violation of our primethic decision and their right to consent. They can't
just force their definitions on us, because that would be an immoral
aggression against us, in violation of their primethic decision and our
right to consent. Thus, the primethic decision establishes the right to
consent, which is a necessary precondition for *any* agreements.

>A definition that is least clear where most cases will occur is of less

Hardly. Making the primethic decision, with agreement at the A/D extremes,
means that we respect each others right to enter into agreements, i.e. right
to consent. It provides the starting point for working out the ambiguities.

It is *the* source of contention and disagreement.

Let's take it a step further. Here is a list of your basic rights:

1. The right to consent.

2. See #1.

3. See #2.

4. Etc.

Where do your basic rights come from? The primethic decision. 

All else is by agreement, made possible by the right to consent, i.e. the
primethic decision.

Dear fellow Extropians:

	Several days ago one of our correspondents (who will, as a courtesy,
remain nameless) took exception to my providing a general reference and a
suggestion as sources of information on a somwhat minor event described in
the Old Testament rather than providing a specific answer. 

Although I felt that the complaint by our correspondent was more than
slightly sophomoric, after careful consideration I concluded that it would
be helpful and appropriate to provide my fellow Extropians with the
reasoning and the value judgements behind my providing a general point of
reference rather than the specific facts and an exegetic commentary.

I'd like to think that a good teacher is one who encourages others to do
their own research and thinking. As such, the student -- regardless of
their academic accomplishments -- should be provided with just enough
information as may be necessary to start them on their quest for
information and, ultimately, understanding. Understanding cannot be
taught. Only facts can be taught. By encouraging each student to obtain
the specific facts on their own, initiative and self-actualization is also
encouraged.

By this method the student learns more than the simple facts. They learn
the values inherent in the accumulation of knowledge (epistemology) and
the need for continuous learning and intellectual evolution.

Ah -- this presumes that your correspondent has consented to a student-
teacher relationship.  I am a very busy person.  If I want references,
I'll ask for them -- otherwise I'd rather have the information I request
in the most clear and concise form possible.  If said information piques
my interest, I may ask for and/or look up references on my own.

Thank you Lee Daniel Crocker for making a voice that clearly expresses the
larger picture of Gates.


Why would we wish death on anyone?  

In reflecting on Bill Gates and his narrow vision of cryonics, perhaps we
might better view this glitch in his thinking as one that is merely built
upon negations of science's future due to insufficient knowledge.  I see his
comment as an eye-opener.  Cryonicists need to take even stronger action to
make sure that accurate and reliable information about cryonics and science
are portrayed in writings, in lectures, in art and in the media.  How we
present cryonics to informed audiences and non-informed audiences will
reflect on the understanding and acceptance of cryonics.  Gates's comments
make me want to soar even higher and faster to rev-up those who want to live
long lives, those who have the technical skills to help us achieve it, and
also those who need to have their sut-down-valve-on-life-extension opened wide.

Damien -- I concur.  Would you please post something about your book,
and preferably link to the description from a Web Page?
The only references I could find under AltaVista that included any
kind of description at all were your message to the Extropians list
saying where to buy it and that it was about the Singlularity, and
a paragraph from a literary events zine in Australia,
http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/news_24/news_003.htm,
that said:

  "Damien Broderick will have two new non-fiction books published this year, to
  follow his novels The White Abacus and Zones. Theory And Its Discontents
  will be published by Deakin University Press. Broderick describes it as a
  critique of some poststructuralist strategies and tactics, with a kind of
  discursive "theory of everything" that tries to link shifts in fashion in
  science and the
  humanities with long historical cycles. His book on posthuman technology and
  the coming singularity, The Spike, will be published by Reed in August."

That isn't very helpful.  Warning, there was a novel called The Spike,
by Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss, published in 1980 -- you may
want to filter those names.

BTW, I looked that one up just because I was also curious.  I'm more likely
to try to find information for someone on the Web if that person makes
clear that they don't have Web access or that they've tried looking (and
where) and failed to find the information.

Cheers,
Kennita

I missed that thread, but as I understand it the main reason for 
feminist opposition to PK is the overt statements of the leadership 
regarding the status of women in the family--mainly that the men 
should take back control (not ask, take).  On the other hand, as 
noted by several prominent feminists this week, if a membership in PK 
results in the man being more attentive and caring and responsible to 
his family, then that improves the situation of women, men and their 
children, and it's difficult to argue with that.

"The Spike" was written by Damien Broderick. Damien is an
Australian  writer of science fiction and science fact.
You can find a bunch of his stuff (but not "the Spike") at
amazon.com.  He is also a professor.

Damien is also a member of this newsgroup and the transhuan
newsgroup. Last year, a bunch of us began discussing the
singularity and related possible events that may occur
some time during the next 50 years. Some of us believe that
a singularity will occur in this time frame that will precipitate
an abrupt change from our existing civilization to its
successor: a "spike" in the graph of the rate of change,
by rough analogy, probably starting with a small group of
people. Others believe that the ternsision will be broader
both in the number of individuals participating in the early
phases and in the transision time: a "swell".

Damien converted this discussion into the core of the book.
He made it a lot more coherent, and added a lot of excellent
material, primarily relating to Moravec and Drexler.

It's fun to read the index, because essentially all of
the list participants in the discussion are listed. Many
of us are quoted at length.

I'm in there quite a bit, mostly because I'm the most radical
"singularitan," having predicted in May of 1996 that the
singularity would occur within a decade.

I really like the book.

I am interested in trading tapes of Leonard Peikoff's radio show 
Sundays 11A.M to 1P.M. 
P.S.T. 
I am especially interested in a copy of the October fifth show.

I would also like to talk with anyone who receives his radio program by
satellite.
If you have a full sized (not mini TV) satellite dish, and want to trade,
please phone and leave message with your phone number at (650) 604-5720
and I will call you on my $. 
If you can't call please e-mail to
jims@eos.arc.nasa.gov

The show is on satellite c1, transponder 14, audio over video, 7.5mhz.

I have tapes of the show through 9-28, and want to acquire the first
hour, which will be blacked out in L.A starting 10-5.

If you live near L.A, you could call KIEV (213) 245-2388, and protest the
loss of the first hour. They are charging the Ayn Rand institute far more
than any of the other stations, and the institute can not afford the first 
hour.

If it were a small private organization with no political aims, I
wouldn't worry about it either--but one has to be suspicious of a
group that can rally 1,000,000 men in Washington.  It is not unlikely
that they will be perceived there as an influential lobby, trying to
get their perverse ideas of what a "family" is written into law and
enforced by the state.

Good intentions are the most powerful tool of evil.

In a message dated 97-10-04 11:04:24 EDT, you write:

<< The funny thing is, by ASCII code, his name in numbers does not add up
 to 666, contrary to Mac/Fundamentalists everywhere. It only adds up to
 666 if you count his last last name (I don't know the proper term for
 it) of III (as in The Third) as being either 111 as in one -one -one,
 which it is not, it is roman numerals III and three I's in ascii don't
 add up to 3, which would be the neccessary result to get 666 as a sum
 for his whole name, or you'd have to call that name as "3", which would
 be wrong, because if you used arabic numerals, it would be 3rd for
 "third" so ascii is off again. This is one more example of idiots not
 doing their homework.
  >>

Of course, but it still works doesnt it? Instead of translating the 3 into
the number 3 represents, they just left it as 3.  Everything else is fine.

One idea which is a bit analogous to cryptography is to try to lose
yourself in the vastness of interstellar space.  As the singularity
approaches, it may be possible to outfit a small spaceship with enough
resources to keep you and perhaps some other people alive, or at least
preserved.  You then leave earth and head out at some random direction.
You'd need to make the direction choice such that it could not be
predicted by the later Singularity.  Maybe some kind of chaotic
interaction with the Oort cloud could leave you with a random direction
where all the information about which way you went has been thermalized.

You'd also have to be going fast enough so that by the time the
Singularity happens and it comes after you, the volume of space where
you could be is big enough (cubic light years, ideally).  This requires
a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The reason why it could be hard to find you is that the Singularity has
only the resources of the solar system to work with (at least initially).
Realistically they will only put a tiny fraction of that into looking
for you.  This is a very limited amount of matter, and even if they
converted it all into spaceships and sent them out looking for you,
space is so big that they wouldn't come very close.  This is why it's
like crypto, because it's easy for you to choose a random direction
(like a random key) but to find you they have to check every direction
(like a brute force search for every key).

Of course you'd have to consider what kind of sensor technology could be
used to detect a small spaceship from far away.  I don't really know
how hard it would be to spot you.

Even if this hides you, it doesn't fully satisfy Wei's requirement because
it doesn't leave you in a very good situation after the Singularity burns
out (or whatever happens to it).  Maybe your ship could have an engine
and you could return to earth after some number of years.  It's not
clear how you'd know what it was safe, though.

Wow! (I think that's already been said ;)
I never really thought of any one person doing more for humanity than any
other in history.  Bill Gates is an interesting choice.  If I had to
choose, I would say the most important man in history would be someone who
spread the most infectious pro-science, pro-free market,
pro-individualist memes. (any ideas?)  Although he is a good model of the
modern capitalist (exluding government deals), I wouldn't say there are
too many people out there who have been profoundly influences by his
memes.  Maybe I'm wrong?

What benefit are con artists to their victims?  

I see what you are trying to say, but I think you have made too general a
statement.

Maybe you could make a more specific economic statement like : "Humanity
reaps the greatest benefits when the market is consistently cleared
(supply=demand) and productive output per capita is maximized."

Can't argue with that.  I don't really wish death to Microsoft, just
healthy competition.  Maybe Linux will go public? (or has it already?)  Of
course, if I really want competition that badly, I'll have to start
writing that new OS right now...

True, but it was for compatibilities sake.  Microsoft's domination seems
to be an example of positive feedback: the more people have Microsoft
software, the more other people want to buy it so they can have compatible
software.  Do you have any ideas on how this monopoly might be felled?
(which to me seems inevitable, but I'm not sure how)

But not necessarily Gates.  If Gates didn't do it, someone else probably
would have.  The question is: would they have done a better job?

Pardon my ignorance... who's Marc Andreesen?

*cough*.  Linux is very public.  The source code is freely available and
modifiable.  People can try to make money by installing it for people
who are ignorant of it, but production is mostly a labor of love.

Personal computers have the advantage is easy setup and use, some
applications, and advertising.  In internal technical details they are
still playing catchup to Unix, which is about a decade older.  But Unix
came out of AT&T, which some people said would have trouble selling
eternal happiness.

The Dawn Of Realization


CANTO I.

The prophet stood atop his mountain and looked across the lands,
He could see the ebb of distant waves and the beachs shining sands;
The searing sun in the blue-white sky beat down upon his chest,
And his eyes shone with a prudent fire, reflecting a heart professed;
The earth may turn, and the earth may burn hed solemnly recite,
How the day of this inferior world shall suddenly become night.
 Hapless mortality and a humanesque malady afflicts me to the core;
 The wasted potential of a race so existential when they should be so much
more.

 Are you ready for the circle --the everlasting Kingdom Come?
 The storybook of glory and the mortal conundrum;
 Are you willing to hear a tale of how weve all been dreadfully wrong?
 Or are you ashamed of the past and present, and the futures far too long?
 For there always is an antidote to the worlds cascading disease--
 The plague of falsified reason seemingly carried by the breeze
 Shall always have a remedy where faiths and freedoms end:
 The pinpoint of reality which hopes and fears will mend.
 How far away is freedom...or is it truly not so far?
 It all depends on the human races choice of peace or war.
 How far are we from liberty if the concept has any worth?
 The answer lies within the genes all have had since before their birth.
 Is there a point to living life other than our wants or needs?
 The truths beyond all wisdoms end are planted like celestial seeds.
 Will there always be authority to rely upon when we fail?
 The tradition of all governments is the primal way we ail.
 For authority is death --a fatal wound to the tortured souls
 Who rely on outer forces to commandeer their roles;
 But the death doesnt end their lives, it just condemns them to live a lie
 Within a doctrinated future, and a changeable historic tie.
 And that is the saddest thing about the paradox of humanity:
 United we are all blind, though on our own we can clearly see.
 But that is all about to change...we are coming to the brink
 Where mankind will see its flaws and finally begin to think.

 We look to the desired God to ease and nullify our fears,
 We pray for resurrections of lost martyrs from lost years.
 When the truth becomes so shrouded in the irrationality of a creed,
 We seem to want a mystic escape, and a barrier from need.
 We drown ourselves in dogmas --unpragmatic points of view--
 To forget our worths and imports and remember things untrue;
 We retain all rights and freedoms we have had since life began,
 And we blame our lack of fortune on the mulishness of man.
 Though we live with no true boundaries except those which we create,
 We still have some desire to rely on twist of fate;
 But the reasons are obscure and near impossible to find,
 For the key to omniscient truths lie within each humans mind.
 Although mankind has never quite known where to draw the fragile line
 Between reality and prophesy, rational and asinine,
 Juxtapositional arguments slowly pollute the air
 With absurdity and contradiction, through the gradual lack of care.
 The intricacies of passion force all men to watch their say
 Else the conversant double standards all but block the truest way;
 The blatancy of romance makes a mockery of love,
 With the force-fed faiths of flattery and the lack thereof.
 So the dance between good common sense and its flimsy counterpart
 Turns from a waltz into a tango, from a chore into an art;
 In a war without a winner or a loser --so it seems,
 The outcome is decided in the realm of clouded dreams.

So the prophet pondered upon the world and all its numerous flaws:
The heedful obeisance of mankind to superficial laws;
And he came to the conclusion that there may well be a dawn--
A plausible realisation, an ideal paragon.
He nodded his head in surety of what he knew was right,
That the darkness of society may one day come alight;
He concluded that the possibilities are plentiful and vast,
And that the future is wide open if man learns from his bleak past.

Hmm.  In a world of private law, perhaps some PPLs would recognize

evicting them by force (fair enough for them).

I've just discovered, BTW, (and BTW what does IOW mean?) that the

Yes!!! Finally, someone who "gets it." 

These spontaneously arising moral principles, not authority/submission, are
what separates us from Hobbes' state of warre of all against all.

They are the very essence of the primethic decision (primethic instinct?),
providing the foundation upon which to build social systems.

An objective analysis of the aggression/defense phenomenon reveals that the
distinction between the two are clear at the extremes and ambiguous in the
middle. 

Between those who have made the primethic decision, i.e. defense against
aggression is moral and aggression is immoral, contention can only arise in
the areas of ambiguity. Spontaneously arising social systems can be viewed
as attempts to reconcile those ambiguities. The initiation of force corrupts
and perverts those systems.

THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART I

by Frederick Mann
						10/4/97

Introduction
------------

The Economic Means to Freedom is one among many
strategies that any individual could follow to
expand freedom.  Nothing in this article should
be regarded as a suggestion that other freedom
strategies should be changed or abandoned.

I do, however, encourage those looking for better,
more workable, and more profitable strategies, to
consider the Economic Means to Freedom.

Three important factors make the Economic Means
to Freedom attractive:

1. The actions you take are under your control
and the outcome of your actions -- the results
you produce -- for the most part depend on
your own actions.

2. The results can be quick, so you don't have
to wait for years and years before enjoying the
benefits that result from your actions.

3. Your actions can become profitable fairly
quickly.  This may enable you to spend more
time on profitable freedom-expanding actions.
It may even enable you to devote all your
working time to promoting freedom in profitable
ways. 

This is the first of a series of articles on the
Economic Means to Freedom.  Further articles are
in the pipeline.

emphatically advised to obey all laws on Earth
and in the Universe to the letter.


Principles of the Economic Means to Freedom
-------------------------------------------

Probably, about 20 important principles of
the Economic Means to Freedom can be identified.
This article covers a few.  Other principles
will be described in the rest of this series.

This article is mostly theory.  Future articles
will cover some of the specific steps you may
be able to take to embark upom practicing the
Economic Means to Freedom.  This article does
suggest a few steps to start with -- such as
finding out more about the free-enterprise
institutions mentioned below (by utilizing
them you may be able to implement some aspects
of the Economic Means to Freedom), and
subscribing to the Advanced Freedom Solutions
Mailing List -- mailto: AFS-request@involved.com>
with "subscribe" in the body of your message.


The Opportunity Gap
-------------------

As a professional consultant I've worked with
computers for many years.  I've also done some
thinking about why Microsoft has been so successful.
Why did it overtake IBM in terms of market valuation
some years ago?

Microsoft basically sells software programs to make
computers more efficient and effective and easier
to use.  We could call Microsoft's programs "computer
success programs."  At the time Microsoft was created
its potential could have been measured by the
difference between how successful computers were
at that time compared to how successful they could
become.  There was a gap between what was and
what could be.  This gap represents potential.
By utilizing this gap of potential, Microsoft
co-founder Bill Gates and some of his associates
became a billionaires and top the list of the
richest people in the world.

The "gap of potential" can also be called an
"opportunity gap."  In human affairs there is
also a gap between what is and what could be.
We suffer from "human failure programs" or "HFPs"
(like coercive political systems!) that tend to
keep many of us stuck at a low level -- if we allow
them to!  The gap between what is and what could
or should be represents potential -- the opportunity
gap.  In human affairs generally, this potential
is considerably greater than the potential that
enabled Bill Gates to become the richest man in
the world.

So, the first thing to appreciate is that there is
this huge potential of the opportunity gap.  Provide
people with the means to bridge the opportunity gap,
i.e., shift from where they are to where they should
or could be, is the essence of the Economic Means to
Freedom.

Of course, with a computer it's easy to delete an
old program and install a new one.  With humans it's
much more difficult.  We tend to love and identify
with our programs (some obsolete), even if they no
longer work very well.

Notice that it's largely because of the terrocrats
that we have the opportunity to take advantage of
such an enormous opportunity gap.  By "terrocrats"
I mean coercive political agents or terrorist
bureaucrats.  Through coercive control of "education"
and other means, they load people with human failure
programs (HFPs) -- such as "obedience to authority."
In the absence of coercive political systems, there
would be far less holding people down, and the
opportunity gap would be considerably smaller!

Also notice that as terrocrats become more onerous
and oppressive with their "laws and regulations,"
"taxes," property seizures, etc., the more they
tend to expand the opportunity gap!


Example of Economic Means to Freedom
------------------------------------

As an outstanding example of someone practicing the Economic
Means to Freedom, a businessman bought a subset of the
materials now available on <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>
in 1993.  At the time his company had assets of $286,000.
Now, four years later his company's assets are worth
about $40,000,000!  Through various stages of growth and
metamorphoses and a reverse takeover/merger, this company
is now listed on Nasdaq.  When all the reverse takeover/
merger transactions are completed, I guesstimate about 90%
of the company's shares will be owned by freedom lovers.
(The name of the company is available upon request.  This
is emphatically not advice for or against investing in
this company.)

Note: All the information referred to above is available
to you free of charge for personal use from our website:
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.  (We are supported by a
substantial annuity which enables us to provide all our
information free of charge.)


Three Economic Sectors
----------------------

The second important thing to realize is that we can
usefully distinguish three economic sectors: (1) public;
(2) private; (3) free enterprise.  The "public" sector
is the terrocrat sector.  The "private" sector consists
mostly of people who kowtow to the terrocrats and/or are
in cahoots with them in various ways.  They pay "taxes"
to support the terrocrats, they obey their "regulations,"
and they often beg for special favors like "tariff
protection."  The free-enterprise sector is also called
"the underground economy," "black economy," or "unrecorded
economy."

By "free enterprise" I mean an economic system characterized
by (1) property ownership; and (2) voluntary exchange.  In
a free-enterprise system there are no "taxes" and no coercive
terrocrat "regulations"; no one initiates force, fraud, or
the threat of force to overwhelm the will of another; people
are free to do whatever they like, provided they don't
violate the rights of others -- basically the right to own
property and to engage in voluntary exchange.  Free enterprise
is a "human success program" or "HSP."  Coercion can be an
HSP for those administering the coercion and some who
benefit from the coercion, but is an HFP or human failure
program for everyone else.

The greatest potential for providing people with the means
to elevate themselves (in all respects) is in the free-
enterprise sector, because this is where we enjoy the
greatest freedom.  One perspective of freedom is that it
represents the range of positive options available to you.
If you can find ways to operate with reasonable safety
in the free-enterprise sector, you enjoy competitive
advantages: no or few "taxes," no or few "regulations."
(For most people it's not yet feasible to completely
escape from the terrocrat and private sectors -- e.g.,
when I put gas in my car, I pay some taxes.)

The Internet makes it easier to shift assets, earnings,
and economic activities into the free-enterprise sector.
Of course, the Internet itself constitutes an enormous
expansion of the free-enterprise sector.


Free-Enterprise Institutions
----------------------------

The third principle of the Economic Means to Freedom
is the creation of free-enterprise institutions in areas
like secure communication, currencies, banking, barter,
investment, raising capital (free-enterprise share
exchanges), etc.  These institutions will make it easier
to shift assets, earnings, and economic activities into
the free-enterprise sector.  Some examples:

Anthony L. Hargis & Co., 17220 Newhope St. #201,
Fountain Valley, California [92708]; Tel. (714) 957-1375.
Banking -- gold and dollar accounts; free-enterprise
share exchange.

Natural Coin Exchange, 33838 SE Kelso Road, #2,
PO Box 569, Boring, Oregon 97009; Tel. (503) 668-4941.
Banking -- gold, silver, and dollar accounts.

World Trade Clearinghouse (WTC) <http://www.wtc-info.com/>.
Accounts in gold, silver, platinum, and five major currencies.
(If you decide to open an account, please specify "AE001"
as your Sponsor ID#.)

Gold & Silver Reserve, Inc. (E-gold) <http://www.e-gold.com/>.
Accounts in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.

Much more information on monetary and banking freedom:
<http://www.free-market.net/features/spotlight/9709.html>.

I invite veryone interested in furthering the Economic
Means to Freedom  to help create and/or expand these
and similar free-enterprise institutions.

A major consideration is that if you're stuck in the
"official" systems and they collapse, you may be in
such a hopeless situation that your very physical
survival becomes a problem.  Should such a collapse
occur, you'll be much better off if you've been using
alternative systems for some time, and you've got at
least some of your assets in them.


Benefits of the Economic Means to Freedom
-----------------------------------------

If you're an ardent freedom lover, and you live "in
the system," obeying terrocrats and supporting them
by paying "taxes," then you're living contrary to
your philosophy -- some would even say you're being
a traitor to your own philosophy.  I have no intention
here to make anyone wrong.  I admit to paying certain
"taxes" because I calculate that to be the least evil.
In this regard I choose to be a traitor to my own
philosophy.

We can think of a scale, spectrum, or continuum.  At
one extreme is being totally "in the system"; at the
other extreme is being totally "outside the system."
Each individual can calculate where on the scale he
or she derives maximum benefit.  And, of course, your
life and affairs can be compartmentalized so certain
assets and activities are "in the system,"and others
are "outside the system."

Practicing the Economic Means to Freedom enables you
to focus on doing things you can control.  In contrast
to political strategies, your results don't depend on
some terrocrats "changing the law" or a few million
voters changing their minds.  I'm not suggesting that
anyone drop political strategies.  I am suggesting that
some people will be more successful, and more satisfied
with the results they produce, and personally benefit
more from those results more quickly, if they practice
the Economic Means to Freedom.

Provided you can become successful in the free-enterprise
sector, the benefits can be quick and significant.  For
starters, if you successfully exit a "tax system," it may
be the equivalent of giving yourself a 25-35% pay raise!

By the way, my experience has been that in all the places
I've lived during the past 25 years, I have found people
in the private sector willing to pay someone like myself
in the free-enterprise sector without any problems.  It
may involve registering your own company or setting up
a trust.  I've literally had no problems -- even with a
giant American multinational company -- to set up the
arrangements such that I operate in the free-enterprise
sector.  In fact, it's often beneficial to the company
because it relieves them of obligations like withholding,
a lot of admin, and they can easily get rid of me whenever
they want to.

I find the sense of living free and prospering exhilerating!
I have a strong "beat-the-system" streak and I certainly
enjoy not having to kowtow to terrocrats -- and for more
than two decades, never having even one penny "deducted"
or "withheld" from my earnings!

Of course, there are risks involved.  You have to be more
careful what you say and do.  You have to guard your back.
For those who are risk-averse, the Economic Means to Freedom
may be inappropriate.  Possibly, you should follow other
freedom strategies.

On the other hand, operating "outside the system" tends
to reduce certain risks.  People "in the system" report
all kinds of information about themselves to the terrocrats.
They are also reported on by their "employers," insurance
companies, stock brokers, doctors, etc.  So if you're "in
the system," terrocrats tend to have lots of information
they can use against you.  In contrast, terrocrats often
have very little information concerning people "outside
the system."


What to Do Next
---------------

So, if you want to live in accordance with your philosophy
of freedom -- living free and prospering -- even make a
fortune! -- then I suggest you seriously consider the
Economic Means to Freedom.

As a starting point I suggest you subscribe to the
Advanced Freedom Solutions List, and explore with others

You now know at least one.  Though I try to base my actions on solid
rational thought as much as possible, it is not possible to derive
normative values from descriptive premises, so I must have some basic
normative values which I cannot rationally justify.  In my case, that
value is life; I choose to value life, and to devalue death and
violence.  I have no reasons to do so, only personal choice.

I can choose actions rationally to achieve my values, but one
cannot choose values by reason.  I refuse on rational grounds to
speculate about supernatural beings, so I am left with personal
choice as my source of values.  I choose life.

Some of those are candidates: I might take Darwin, in particular.  Let me

Perhaps your dictionary doesn't include "voluntarily"?  I said

Yes, the founder of Netscape.  I call him a whiner because the moment
he found Microsoft making money doing exactly the same thing he did--
breaking the standard to lock people in--instead of fighting it out
in the free market like a man, he ran running to daddy government to
make the bully go away, and he continues to fight his battle in the
courts instead of the free market.  Netscape is also a much more
blatant liar about their support of open standards than MS is.

You could make huge amounts of money out of Linux, but it would take
_innovation_ so I wouldn't expect to see the software industry doing it
anytime soon.  Make your technology open, your software free and sell your
hardware at a loss - the more people you get on the network, the more porn
you can sell.

They're all whiners.  The whole lot of them, except that nice Mr.Gates.

Maybe the reason he doesn't take cryonics seriously is because of its public
image.  Can you imagine what the press would say if Bill Gates said he was an
immortalist?  For all we know, he could be an closet extropian just waiting
to donate money ;)

O.K. have at it.  In setting your personal values as a "code of morality",
does it not logically follow that anyone who holds a personal preference, or
preferences, different from yours is considered by you to hold "immoral
values?" You say chocolate ice cream, another wants vanilla; you say brick
house, another prefers frame; you say no theft, another says steal.   What
you have not said is by what rationale your values and preferences are
superior as implied by your declaration. If all other individuals are not
afforded the same claim of "morality" via personal preferences, don't you
feel obliged to explain how and why they are excluded from the criteria you
assert as fact for yourself? If each is afforded the same criteria, and each
individual is of equal standing, if in a given instance you say "moral" and
another says "immoral", do we not have a sum, zero; meaning that the term,
morality, has no  meaning?

To be sure, you, I, and\or anyone else may agree not to steal, nor initiate
force and coercion in any way. This will, as you say, result in a peaceful
coexistence. I have no quarrel with the conclusion. The conclusion is
reflected in natural law as pertains to means and ends. The means selected
and applied are right because they result in the end mutually desired and
identified. Here choosing and implementing right means (suited to the
purpose) you call "morally right." However, suppose we agree to steal and
produce a hostile coexistence?  Once again, the means selected and applied
produces the end mutually desired and identified. Would you then call this
"morally wrong" although you agreed to it? 

Let's look at the third option: Suppose the end you choose is peaceful
coexistence and select the appropriate means, non theft, etc. to achieve
this end, but another within your social realm prefers a hostile enviroment
and selects predatory means appropriate to achieve this end. Since the
predatory means chosen will produce the hostile environment end desired, are
not these means chosen technically right the same as yours are technically
right? What remains for you to call wrong, and why? The end chosen, is it
not? Thus must you presume to qualify terms, and arrive at: Technically
right, but "morally wrong." Right AND wrong applied to the same
circumstance?  True, yet false? Exist, yet does not exist? Dead, yet alive?
Doesn't this make you a bit suspicious of the concept, morality?  

The confusion, conflicts and contradictions are derived from illusory
beliefs that lead to pursuit of the impossible. An end chosen is a matter of
volition, a natural condition that is not subject to proof or disproof. It
is means and only means that are subject to evaluation as right or wrong. To
presume to evaluate a chosen end as right or wrong is to claim the
individual creator of said end as personal property to be evaluated as means
to one's own goal. 

So, what is "morality", that is  what is the meaning of the term, and by
reference to what is the meaning derived? I can find not a trace of
objective criteria except subjective personal preference as you acknowledge.
Ergo, "morality" is dependent on being created by individual mind. Having
examined and weighed all the factors known to me from root premise to end
result, I  am obliged to accept the definition that corresponds to the evidence:

Morality is a FEELING; specifically a DOMINANT feeling of a "universal
ought" nearly universally felt. It is a feeling that there exists an
objective and universal standard of values. It is a feeling that one "ought"
to discover and live by these values. It is a feeling that most individual's
look to and depend on to measure their self value and the value of others.
It is a feeling that directs thoughts, conclusions, beliefs and actions like
no other. It is the ultimate warden of the psyche. It is the ultimate
religion for it commands more subservience of more individuals that all the
others put together.

Since "morality" is a matter of feelings peculiar to each individual, (but
believed to be an objective dictate of nature), is it any wonder that the
endless disagreements are endlessly "resolved" by violent conflict?  The
concept, morality, is by billions believed to be an absolute necessity for
peaceful coexistence. They believe this even as the earth has been for
centuries, and still is, drenched in blood in the name of morality. This
tells not of any truth of "morality", but of a suicidal and destructive
commitment to a revered and  dominant fallacy. "Morality" is just one of the
many popular beliefs that are 180 out of phase with reality. For more, see

The Latin alphabet, or just alphabets in general?  If you mean the English

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  I meant go public with shares.
Businesses tend to take a company more seriously when they can look them
up on the stock market and get their annual business report.(although, if
I'm not mistaken, Microsoft took its sweet time going public...)

Whether businesses accept an OS will make all the difference for the
company.  Just look at the success of IBM/Microsoft.  When the IBM
personal computer was introduced, it was in no way superior to the apples
already on the market.  It took off solely because businesses trusted IBM
(because of their reputation with mainframes in the business world)  I
can't see Linux really taking off until they start seeing $$$.  The market
is huge, but Linux business sense appears to be lacking. (not that I have
a problem with programmers programming for the sake of it.  I just hope
someone comes along and gives Microsoft some worthy opposition)

Setting up personal computer is getting uglier and uglier.  I like

Yeah, Amazon.com will only handle overseas books if there's a US
distributor, which my Oz publisher, Reed Books, don't have at the moment.
However they've just been bought out, and are said to have a gung-ho team
in London selling rights hard around the world.  Maybe it will work for THE
SPIKE as well.

Alas, up to now my publisher has been meeting resistance in the States
among those she's trying to sell US rights to.  Cornell University Press
showed an interest, which excited me for its prestige but alarmed me more
by its probable low print run and tone of lofty inaccessibility.  In the
event they scurried off, realising that the book was too non-academic for
their line.  Simon & Schuster also just knocked it back, on grounds that
one might find some general transhuman encouragement in - apparently they
have a similar book, or a book on a similar topic, due to come out soon.
The more the merrier - but I hope mine can be among them in the Big
Marketplace that is the USA.

>I really like the book.

I was hoping you'd say that...  :)  Thanks, Dan.

BTW, I don't have my own web page, but there's some biographical and
bibliographical stuff at the Ozlit site - toggle the URL in my sig, below.
The links there to interview/article stuff on/by me in the Mensa magazine
might be of interest.  And sadly I'm not a professor - just a research
associate at Melbourne University.  They pay for the email and xeroxing, I
give them useful publication points.  Barter economy lives!

It's interesting but I don't have the time for such a project. Also, if
I was to start a mailing list it wouldn't be to gain converts to

I don't think they've written much but they seem to have a good
knowledge of the subject, at least for me. Most of them work in the
University of Economy in Oporto, a very prestigious institution,
actually the minister of economy works for the University of Economy in
Oporto. Other economists I talk to are students of economics, they must
know something about it.

First, it's rather interesting, and I take it as an praise, when you
discreetly insinuate I might be communist. I've been insulted before, on
other mailing-lists and because of my site, and people already called me
both communist and fascist (although not in the same message, of
course). It's rather interesting how people tend to reduce others to
stereotypes and that is exactly what you are trying to do (in a indirect
way since you put an "if" before your sentence but you're not very far
from it). I'm not from left or right, I'm above all that (and I'm also a
convinced jerk but that you probably already noticed).

My world problems? Freedom? Productivity? Are you living in the same
planet I live? Do you know that more than 30'000 children die each day
of avoidable causes? Do you want to know how much people have died in
wars in the last decades? Do you know that at least 30% of the world
population lives in poverty?
I don't know about you but my idea of a good place to live in must first
correct this injustices and only then care about tax rates and
stockholders. And that is exactly why I disagree with free-markets, they
won't solve any of these problems and they will only work in the
direction of the already wealthy (and I mean a lot more wealthier than
us, or at least I) while discarding the poor. Obviously (at least for me
it's obvious) I cannot agree with such a system that might even create a
few more millionaires but will leave the overall world population in
poverty. That is not the world I want to leave for the generations to
come.

When I (or any other musician) listen to an A chord (a correct A chord,
if the guitar is not tuned it is not an A chord), we instinctively
recognize it as one (at least if it's played in a guitar or keyboard, I
never listened to an A chord when played on some exotic instruments). If
anyone disagrees with us, he is wrong because that is an A chord as
defined many centuries ago and accepted till our days by all musicians
as an A chord. Is that so hard to understand?

Er, the Latin alphabet was pretty derived itself.  Alphabetic systems
(allegedly unique in origin, unlike hieroglyphic systems or syllabries)
are traced back to the Semites.  So I could mean an original Semitic
inventor.  

Digression:
The uniqueness is in using phonemes as elements, rather than syllables or 
words.  The other two types of systems have been independently invented
multiple times; all true alphabets can be traced, in probable 
inspiration if not in design, to the Semites.  The original alphabet
didn't have any vowels in it, and recently I've wondered if from the
Semitic point of view it was functionally a syllabary.  In which case
the true alphabet was actually invented by some Greek(s) who adopted the
Semitic symbols, realized that none of them coded for vowels, fixed
that, and thus accidentally created a phonemic alphabet whereas left to
their own devices they'd probably have created a syllabary.

Significance: English uses over a thousand different syllables, but 26
letters.  We could use a few more, but still fewer than 50.  Syllabaries
often have 50-75 symbols, meaning their language is restricted to that
many syllables.

Worthy opposition?  The product is free, powerful, locally modifiable,
and can be supported by whomever you want.  Hard to beat that, unless you
want to run Excel.  See below.

It's a programming language cum virtual machine, or else a programming
language with a much larger standard library (i.e. graphics and
networking); from either viewpoint "porting" applications is much
simpler.  As you said, Microsoft's OS edge is the positive feedback of
having all the popular applications; standards can catalyze their own
growth.  Java applications can run on any machine and OS which supports
the Java VM, or can be easily compiled for any machine with Java
libraries (for C you have to worry about local extensions, like
graphics) so your choice of OS/machines wouldn't be constrained by
available applications.  You wouldn't need Windows to run Word or Excel
if they were ported to Java; you could run them anywhere which supported
Java.

I dispute that. :) Going on our relative portions of the Spike, I think I
actually came across as being more radical than you, probably since Damien
believes youths _should_ come across as radical.  Although I don't think
there's much point in comparision; we both believe the Singularity could occur

[In response to Lee Daniel Crocker:]

Bill Gates and Microsoft have been known to commit illegal acts.  I'm not
talking about antitrust, but about acts which would remain illegal under a
Libertarian government... although, since I believe you support abolishment of
patents and copyright laws, you might not see it that way.  (IMHO, this
constitutes the abolishment of private property on the informational level,
and hence Communism as we move towards an information-based economy.)

I'm not talking about the Macintosh business, which was all invented by Xerox
anyway.  Pen Windows, for example, was stolen from GO computing; Microsoft
Post-It will also run if you type "3M Post-It".  ("Damn, I knew we forget something.")

To some extent, Microsoft's dominance derives from their illegal and unlawful
theft of intellectual property.  Even if intellectual property should be
abolished, as Lee advocates, Microsoft's competitors couldn't use Microsoft's
intellectual property, and Microsoft was either stealing or using coercion so
that only it had free access to intellectual property.  Unlawful, any way you
look at it.

I do not condemn or condone Bill Gates.  He is one of very few people that
have fully realized an inalienable individual right that has become unpopular
in modern times:  The right to exert decisive influence on the course of history.

But it is possible that Microsoft's dominance continues because numerous small
competitors, that should by right have replaced Microsoft in its niche,
instead failed because Microsoft stole their software.

Bill Gates is neither wholly good nor wholly evil.  He is a genius, and it is
ultimately his intelligence and his will that powers all of Microsoft. 
Intelligence above all is power, as I believe I have said elsewhere, and it is
possible that this near-unique fact of genius in control is what maintains
Microsoft above all others.  Microsoft also goes out of its way to recruit
geniuses regardless of their coding ability, in the wish to "train them up". 
This tremendous fund of brainpower may also go a long way towards powering Microsoft.

Bill Gates has acted more than once to influence charitable issues he regards
as important, such as educational quality.  He regards himself (or claims to)
as someone who simply happens to be a steward of a large share of humanity's
resources.  He has stated that he intends to give all of his wealth away
before he dies.

He has also acted unethically, at least in my judgement, in order to preserve
Microsoft's preeminence.  He has stolen, lied, cheated, and blackmailed.  So,
of course, have most of the other great men of our time; he was simply the
most successful, and I doubt that he ever viewed himself as stepping outside
the bounds of fair but utterly cutthroat competition.

He's someone to be reckoned with in Silicon Valley and indeed the whole world.
 He has taken on archetypical status, entered into the realm of legend.  He
spends at least 10% of his time talking to the media.  He has power and even
the sort of power that corrupts.  He has genius-level intelligence, but not
necessarily all *kinds* of intelligence.  He's not a servant of any ideology. 
His "The Road Ahead" is as much a computerized failure of imagination as "To
Renew America".  And he's human, and mortal, and fallible, and lacks any great
ethical imperative to override his own self-interest.  He's very, very
competitive.  He'd use nuclear weapons on his opponents and call it fair play,
and in Silicon Valley, he may be right.  What matters to him is winning.

Bill Gates once scored in the top ten in his state.  I scored second for the
Midwest for the grade above mine.  I know full well that someday, we'll either
be boon allies or blood enemies.  You'd better believe I'm studying him very carefully.

My views on this topic are somewhat controversial.  I know, having expressed
them here before, the last time I left.  As I again consider leaving to pursue
Real Life interests, I suppose it's only appropriate that I acquit myself in
the manner to which I have become accustomed.

I've reviewed those last posts often, and I hope that I've learned something
from the experience, and from the informed criticism of my peers.  In
particular, I hope I can now convey something that I failed to convey before.

Anyone who studies General Relativity or quantum mechanics may perhaps begin
to appreciate something of the true strangeness of the Universe.  It is not a
human place and is under no obligation to obey human laws.  It is
_unintuitive_.  Quantum Physics, thus capitalized, is usually cited as support
of this, although in my opinion Special Relativity - much less General
Relativity - is very much stranger.  And most of those who babble on about
Quantum wouldn't know a complex probability amplitude if it walked up and bit
them in the leg, which is the really strange part - that the foundation of our
Universe depends on numbers which we call "imaginary".

Perhaps to a die-hard algebraist this would be quite appropriate; after all,
complex numbers are closed with respect to algebraic roots, which "real"
numbers are not.  But nobody can see 2 + 3i cows.  Nobody can imagine a square
whose sides are such that it has an area of -1.  We can't visualize it.  And
yet complex numbers form the foundation of our state-vector-reduced "real" Universe.

Human evolution is against complex numbers.  They form no part of the human
mind.  They are foreign to us, external to our selves, our goals, and our
natures, external to the regularities which forged the reality we now call
Real Life.  And yet the true laws, the Laws of Physics, tick on regardless. 
We were not consulted, and our opinions have no effect on What Is.

This, I believe, holds true of ethics.  Right and wrong are objective facts,
and not facts which we or *any* volitional agent were consulted about.

If you have a religious friend, try asking em whether God can, by an act of
fiat, turn wrong into right.  Can God simply declare that the Holocaust was in
and of itself a good thing, by an act of Its omnipotent will?

One who answers "No" has stepped into a vast empty space and committed eirself
to a frightening position indeed.  E has said that right and wrong are
independent of Humanity and God, and are under no obligation to conform
themselves to our desires.

Consider Conway's "Game of Life".  Life proceeding under the cellular
automaton rules is independent of all external influences.  If some living
beings evolved on that vast grid, their religions would surely be false, and
their fate decided by no greater authority.  They would be beyond the
protection of God.  They would have no guarantee that the just would prevail,
or that they would reach Singularity, or that any greater principle guided
their Universe - save that two maintain and three give birth.

One who states that ethics are beyond the influence of God, or beyond our
influence, also states that ethics are beyond all protection - that we have no
guarantee that our own conceptions have anything to do with it, that there
*is* any "right".  For all we know, the Holocaust was a wonderful thing and
liberty the greatest evil.  I'd sure like to know, which is why I keep putting
so much effort into intelligence enhancement.

What we are evolved to regard as "right" is as irrelevant as the numbers we
evolved to see as "real".  True right and wrong are outside of our opinions
and unaffected by them.  And nobody knows what right and wrong truly are,
INCLUDING me!  When asked an ethical question, we are in the same position as
a Newtonian physicist asked the true nature of time.  We can't possibly get it
right; we must simply avoid all questions of "true natures" and go with the
best guess we can make.

Anyway, that's why I keep on having trouble in discussing this with the
members of this List.  You keep on talking about evolution, and about what you
think.  But that's irrelevant.  You and I can no more affect right and wrong
that way than we can flatten the Earth.  Humans were not consulted here.

You keep on talking about whether your goals will prevail or whether they will
be subordinated to some higher authority, and I feel like a fish who has swum
into a lecture on how to fly.  Is your opinion that the Earth is flat
subordinated to the reality that it is round?  The two move in different
continuums; neither can be "subordinated" to the other.  Opinions cannot
triumph or be subordinated except with respect to other opinions.  With
respect to ethics, you can't prevail over some higher authority or subordinate
yourself.  Those are not your options.  You can either be wrong, or right. 
Opinions are either wrong or right.  Goals are either wrong or right.  And
wrong and right themselves simply are, like all truth values.  You have placed
yourself in the position of the student facing the legendary epistemology
exam:  "Take a position for or against the truth.  Defend your position."

It's true that opinions can strive against other opinions.  My goals can be
forcibly subordinated, or I can be free to make my own choices.  And I would
rather the latter, of course.  And I particularly wouldn't like my goals
crushed by some overconfident moron who thinks e's Figured It All Out, which
is roughly as likely as a preliterate Neanderthal figuring out General
Relativity.  But if I choose to be ethical, I have not "subordinated" myself
any more than a scientist subordinates emself to the truth.  It is not that
there are certain truthful opinions, and the scientist "relinquishes" eir own
opinions to be tyranically crushed by the truthful ones.  The scientist
attempts to bring eir opinions into correspondence with the truth.

Likewise, my goals are not "subordinated" to the higher goals which happen to
be true right and wrong.  For one thing, I don't *know* what true right and
wrong are.  So the process is as much a matter of truth-seeking as anyone who
wants to know whether the Earth is really flat.  Getting emotionally attached
to the goals evolution gave me as a starting set, identifying them with myself
and going all protective, is as ridiculous as striving desperately to protect
your conviction that the earth as flat.  I'm not talking analogy here, I'm
talking simple identity.  Goals, like opinions, have objective truth values
and come under the same rules as our models of reality.

No doubt some people think that all goals have objective value zero, or that
goals don't have objective values, or that assigned goal values don't have
truth values.  I only hope that these people will understand that I don't
believe as they do, and that ethical arguments between us are futile.  We're
living on different planets.  I don't think there can be any point of contact
between objectivist and subjectivist ethics.  It's as if a debate over the
shape of the Earth was being conducted, where one side wanted to know what the
shape "really" was and the other fought valiantly for freedom of opinion and
decried any side that tyranically declared a single truth, or even that a
single truth existed.

**************************************************************
Being dedicated to the future progress of humankind

Dear Kennita Watson and other fellow Extropians:

The ability to learn is more than slightly dependent on the desire or
willingness of any individual to learn. The biggest handicaps to learning
are the arrogance and self-righteous egotism that frequently accompany
ignorance. 

The desire to learn frequently involves the application of an informal or
social as well as a formal academic teacher-student relationship. Just as
no one should ever be ashamed of asking for information, no one has any
valid reason to be critical of any method intended in good faith to
provide information. 

Offering alternative methods of learning are always desirable. No mode of
learning, however obscure is invalid. Nor should any well intentioned
offer of information ever be rejected on its face value. Always
constructively consider the motives of the source.

Thank you,

AMG

Ah -- this presumes that your correspondent has consented to a student-
teacher relationship.  I am a very busy person.  If I want references,
I'll ask for them -- otherwise I'd rather have the information I request
in the most clear and concise form possible.  If said information piques
my interest, I may ask for and/or look up references on my own.

Even if God existed it would not produce an objective morality free from 
contradictions because an obvious question would immediately arise, is God 
independent of the concepts of good and evil? If the answer is yes then God 
has nothing to do with morality, except that He is supposed to act morally 
just like everybody else, although exactly why anyone, infinitely powerful 
or otherwise, "should" do so is not clear. If the answer is no then the 
statement "God is good" becomes a vacuous tautology, about as deep as 
"God is God".

Descriptive premises: Cops carry guns; I've personally
seen cops "rough up" victims who "crossed" the cops;
Via media, I've received many descriptions of cops
"roughing up" victims, or worse; Because of my lifestyle
"outside the system," I am more at risk from cops than
most.

Normative values: Don't "cross" cops; If confronted by
a cop, e.g., if pulled over for allegedly speeding, I
should play the role of an obedient supplicant.

Questions: Are my normative values rationally derived
from my descriptive premises?

Can I reasonably lump all me normative values together
in a high-level abstraction called "morality?"

Because individuals are unique and have unique
circumstances, will they tend to have "moralities"
that differ in some respects?

Because humans have much in common, can we expect
common denominators among "moralities" that are
rationally derived via observation and prediction?

Prediction may be a key here; is rational prediction
possible?

Suppose, e.g., statistical analysis indicates that
behavior X tends to be followed by consequence Y (say,
death) Z percent of time, while no other behaviors
or characteristics correlate with Y.  Can we rationally
predict that in future, ceteris paribus, X will cause Y
with probability Z?

Are there predictable cause-effect relationships
(descriptive premises) from which normative values
can be rationally derived? -- Don't do X because it
tends to cause Y?

Could you reasonably argue that all my "ises" (descriptive
premises) are stated in a manner to include "oughts"
(normative values), thus I'm really deriving "oughts"
from "oughts?"

Or, do certain "ises" by their nature automatically
imply "oughts?"

Is continued life an automatic "ought" for a living
creature with human-like consciousness?

Or, could it be an automatic "ought" only under
certain conditions?

Sorry, Eliezer. I knew you were also a radical singularitan, but I
didn't
recall that you were also in the "any day now" camp. I've lent my
copy of the book out and have not yet ordered another. I know that
the two of us arrived at our conclusions independently, and I was
very reassured when I found your work. It made me feel a bit less like
some kind of pseudo-religous nut. (Yes, I know feelings can be deceiving
:)

I find it very frustrating that the list spends so much time on
irrelevant issues of economics and politics. The current economic
and political environment will not change significantly prior to
the singularity: there's not enough time, even if the event occurs
in 2025.

Logically, in order to break such domination you need to make the
compatibility issue irrelevant. If people don't have to worry
about compatibility, then competition becomes possible again and
"lock-in" dies. The Internet/open standards movement is the
way to solve the problem, and it _does_ solve the problem as
long as everyone sticks to the standard (both providers and users).
It falls apart the instant you use those "cool Netscape frames"
that aren't part of the HTML standard. The same thing is happening
with Java- Microsoft is slowly but surely corrupting it by adding
Windows-only features that will entice developers to tie themselves
(and the users of their software) to the Windows platform. It seems
that even in "internet land", MS finds ways to lock people in. The
only way to break the cycle is through personal diligence on the
part of developers to reject MS and embrace true cross-platform
solutions. And even then, that only takes care of the OS monopoly.
They have a whole other monopoly on software, and curing that
hasn't even begun yet (unless you count XML??).

There are several: Red Hat, Debian, Yggdrasil, Slackware.  Red Hat
is the largest and most likely to become a publicly-traded company,
but none have specific plans so far as I know.

Okay, wrong use of tenses.  Let me rephrase:

To some extent, Microsoft's current dominance derives from their past illegal
and unlawful theft of intellectual property, which was is now protected by
law.  Even if the concept of "intellectual property" is ethically incorrect
and there exists a moral imperative towards its abolishment, current laws
prevent Microsoft competitors from using Microsoft's intellectual property. 
Microsoft therefore had an unfair and unlawful advantage, because it had
copied competitors' software while the competitors were prevented by law from
copying Microsoft's.

Fork on whether "intellectual property" is ethically incorrect.  If it is,
then Microsoft correctly copied its competitors software, but did take
advantage of the U.S. government to impose coercion on those competitors so
that they (the competitors) could not copy Microsoft's software.  If
copyrights and patents are ethically correct, then Microsoft comitted an
ethical violation by copying software.

End fork.  Microsoft is in violation of Libertarian ethics and U.S. law,
although perhaps not for the same acts.

I have to disagree with you at least on the economics part. Before
we get to a singularity caused by nanotech or powerful enough
computers for human-level AI there will be major economic changes
due to the increasing cheapness of computing power and bandwidth.
These changes result in what Wired calls a "Network Economy" (see
Wired 5.09, "New Rules for the New Economy"); we already live in
the beginnings of this, everything on the net is part of it. Article
is here: http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html
It makes some interesting points, especially the idea that most
if not all commodities in our world are dipping towards being free.
Anything from a CD player to a modem to a stock quote online gets
cheaper. In the coming years your phone line will dip towards free
as they offer you better stuff(xDSL) for $$$. Reading and becoming
familiar with these ideas can give you a powerful edge- for me,
reading it triggered an idea for a new net-based business that
is starting up on Monday!

As for politics, I can tell you from my experience that since I
ran into the net 4 years ago it has significantly changed _me_.
I think that over the next 25 years or so as the majority of
the planet gains net access (hopefully) there is the potential
for something to happen.

I consider this subject to be very relevant ot transhumanism. In
particular, it may relate to the "how the west was won" thread,
and more generally to how we encode what we think.

I don't know about syllabaries in general, but I do know a little
about Japanese. The Japanese syllabary, or Kana, is called
"the 50 sounds." It has 50 symbols, and is formally arranged
in a five-by-ten matrix. There are 5 vowel sounds, and each column
of the matrix corresponds to a vowel. There are 9 consonant sounds,
the first row of the matrix contains syllables for the vowels, and
each of the remaining 9 rows contains the syllables for a consonant
followed by the vowel.

Three of the syllables in the "w" row have fallen into disuse, so
when Japanese school children sing their version of the alphabet
song they replace these syllables with the vowel syllable to retain
the 5-sound pattern, and when they write out the matrix they leave
the entries blank.

The syllabary actually contains a great many more syllables, because
there are several ways to modify each syllable:
1) there is a mark that lengthens the vowel, yielding a total of 10
vowels.
2) there is a symbol that adds an "n" to the end of a syllable
3) There is a mark that changes the consonant to another consonant,
  so there are actually 18 consonants, not 9.
4) there is yet another mark that converts a few (2?) of the consonants
to get consonants for foreign words yielding a total of 20 consonants.

So, japanese has 10 vowels and 20 consonants, for 210 syllables, each of
which can be used with or without the trailing "n", for about 420
syllables. All syllables are either vowel, consonant-vowel, or
consonant-vowel-n.

There are a few exceptions, but they relate to variations of the way
you pronounce a particular syllable in context with another. For
instance,
the trailing "n" is pronounced as an "m" in some cases, and when the
syllable "shi" is followed by a syllable starting with "t", the "i" is
dropped. However, you cannot create new syllables as we do in English:
you are stuck with the 420 syllables of the Kana (The mis-named 50
sounds). 

Why is this relevant? isn't it just a coding convention? I don't think
so.
A person whose first language is japanese apparently has a grat deal of
difficulty thinking about syllables that do not fit into this scheme.
Does this constrain the way the japanese think? If so, how are english
speakers constrained? Will we need some other representational method
to relieve these constraints?

More in the sense of potential than probability.  I think that the most
probable time is actually 2008... using my oddest calculating method yet.  I
figure that in the fifteen years between 1980 and 1995, the E.T.S. went from
2035 to 2020.  That is, each year the projection moves up by one year.  If
this continues, the Singularity should occur in 2008.  I find this argument to
be strangely compelling, perhaps because it sounds so meta.

But yes, I feel it's obvious that the Singularity could indeed occur any day
now.  For all we knew at the time, it could very well have occurred when Lenat
fired up EURISKO (a Power seed if there ever was one).  I think the Web is now
more than powerful enough to wake up if we knew how to program it. 
Nanotechnology might well be a single breakthrough away, and breakthroughs can
occur at any time.  I should also note that the amount of programming
necessary to create a >Web - the Power seed - could almost certainly be done
right on this computer in front of me, if I knew how.

But I actually do believe that we've got several years to go before Big Money
starts pouring into Singularity development.  Once that happens, I'd give 2:1
odds that the Singularity or worlddeath will occur within two years.

There's a function it never occurred to me I was serving - making everyone
else look sane by comparision!  That really _could_ be useful in getting
people to take the Singularity seriously.  Vinge can say, "Oh, I'm not radical
at all, compared to Clemmenson or Yudkowsky."

On that, I disagree.  I think that there could be world-shaking developments
for up to a year before Singularity.  It could be that the >Web or a like
Power pops out of nowhere and takes everything over.  It's also possible that
nanotech or IA will appear and persist for years before the fast-mind problems
are solved.  I mean, maybe you can hack neurons with nanotech to bring them up
to electronic speeds - neural impulses max out at 1/3,000,000 the speed of
light.  And maybe you fall over in convulsions, and you can't.  It could go
either way.

And the acceleration of time works both ways.  The Singularity will occur by
2025 because 2025 is well into the 22nd century, in inflation-adjusted 1974
years.  More than enough time for economies and governments to change drastically.

No, indeed, as long as people hold this mystical concept of
singularity in their minds there will be little change in
their condition of slavery under the present political

Given the opaqueness of the neotech stuff, general relativity and
quantum mechanics, I think the battle is one of communications: how
to make others understand what you mean, so that they can judge
whether it is worth studying or not?

As I tried to explain, it doesn't. He isn't Bill Gates 3, he's Bill
Gates the Third, abbreviated as III, which if you count as i's, do not
allow the sum of 666 for his whole name in ascii, so its merely
anti-Bill propaganda and not even true numerology, even if someone were
stupid enough to ascribe any credibility to neumerology in the first
place.

If that were true, then it should be counted as "3rd", NOT "3", so the
numerology is also false there.

Listen I could go on for hours on all sorts of numrological
coincidences, like the fact that Pope John XXIII who guided the vatican
through Vatican II was known as The Navigator before Vatican II, that
the head of the Priory of Sion in Switzerland, credited by many to be
the spiritual head of freemasonry, who was elected at the same time as
that Pope, also went by the name of John The Navigator, and was the 23rd
head of Sion to assum the name John. Blah Blah Blah.

I assume you haven't yet read Robin Hanson's essay (If Uploads Come First,
http://sunsite.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/hanson_uploads.html) about upload 
economy? He seems to reach the same conclusion as you. 

However, there are a lot of other things that can be traded: virtual
environments of differing complexity and uniqueness, access to the physical
world, knowledge and experiences.

This is where you diverge from Hanson; he assumes uploads are essentially
indivisible since they are complex, interconnected structures with no
clear modularity - my sense of humour exists as an emergent property
of my whole neural net, which makes it hard to copy. I would say this is
the likely state in the beginning, but as soon as we begin to learn how
to reverse-engineer our minds, then things can get interesting.

Whether you love him or hate him, that act or feeling indicates that you
have been profoundly affected by him. Only those who have never seen a
computer in their lives haven't been directly affected by him. Even they
still have been affected by him indirectly by the changes in the people
they deal with who have been directly affected by him.

I personally think so, while others here do not. it could be said that
your volunteering to expose yourself to subliminal coercion by using
media sources that employ them is your own waiver of caveat emptor.

A victim of a con artist is merely a student getting an informal,

I can. If a company, like Corel, would sell competetive software that

i believe it may have been his genius in the beginning, but thereafter

I think "right and wrong" constitute *descriptions*,
possibly with a reliability that can sometimes be
estimated quite accurately, that certain behaviors
can be predicted to produce certain consequences.

They could be regarded as heuristics or rules of
thumb.  As we develop and evolve we improve them.

All our ideas, concepts, words, numbers, and other
symbols *and their meanings* are our creations.  We
hope they reflect or represent aspects of reality
in a useful manner.

If you argue that what others think or say
about "right and wrong" is irrelevant, then
-- unless you have superior ability to think
and say -- it seems to me that you have to
also conclude that whatever you think or say
about "right and wrong" is equally irrelevant.

Surely, your notion that, "Right and wrong are
objective facts..." is just what you think and
say?

In what way is a straight extrapolation of Moore's law
"mystical"? I feel that the assumption that the human
condition will remain substantially unchanged is much
more of a fantasy. Moore's law is a simple observation
of our current reality. What do you think life will be
like in 2020?

I agree that the pre-Sincularity era may be chaotic and that serouis
technology-driven changes may occur. I am very interested in discussing
the likely nature of these changes. What I'm frustrated about is the way
in which the group concerns itself with libertarian issues, tax
issues, welfare issues, etc. Even if the libertarian philosphy is
valid in the abstract, the transition from our current politico-economic
system to a libertarian one, or to any other substantially different
one, would take so long that it will be overtaken by events before it
can be completed. Basically, IMO libertarianism is a philosophy that
describes one way in which a human society can constitute itself. But
human societies don't generally change rapidly without a great deal of
distortion and pain. I simply don't feel that such a rapid change is
justified. The existing setup is good enough to see us through to the
singularity without an earlier politico-economic revolution. I certainly
don't object to refinments, but revolution is uncalled for. Instead
as a society we need to worry about predicting and where possible
ameliorating any negative consequenses of the inevitable pre-singularity
technical upheavals.

Actually I find that the Singularity stays about 20-30 years in the
future.  I'd like to see some evidence that anyone in 1980 predicted it
to be in 2035, 55 years in their future.  I don't think anyone even knew
about the Singularity back then.

20-30 years is enough time for significant changes in technology and
in society.  When the movie 2001 was made, it did not seem implausible
that a space station, lunar bases, AI, and a manned mission to Jupiter
could occur in that time frame.  In fact, technology has not advanced
as fast as was expected back then, at least not in those areas.  AI has
been 20-30 years away since the 1950's.

Personally, I think we are going to hit a big wall in computer technology
in the next ten years.  They can't keep making silicon features smaller
indefinitely, the electric fields (voltage over distance, and voltage
can't drop below the diode bias voltage which is an inherent aspect of
the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies
will have to be developed to replace silicon.  It may happen, but there
is nothing which looks very practical as a replacement right now.

It's our old friend, the S curve.  Right now the growth in performance
looks exponential, just as the increase in sewing machine speeds (or
virtually any other industrial performance measure) looked exponential
at one time.  But they hit a limit back then, and we will probably hit
a limit ourselves now.

That doesn't mean that progress will stop; all the ramifications of
the information revolution will continue to develop even if computer
performance tops out a few orders of magnitude better than we have
it today.  And there are other technologies which are poised for growth,
biotech of course, and possibly materials science, microtech, etc.  These
are probably going to be the hot fields of 2010.

But I am always suspicious of that 20-year prediction horizon.  We can
guess what will happen technologically in the next ten years, but beyond
20 we really have no idea.  "Here there be dragons," and we are inclined
to put our wonders safely in the 20-30 year period.  In practice though
things often take much longer than we expect.

Yes, many things will get a lot cheaper. Moore's law is an exponential,
and has survived all attempts at constraint due to physical laws
by hoppong from one technology to another. Yes, the underlying
concept of economic value will change radically for a large percentage
of current GNP. Yes, this is all revolutionary.

Yes, our political world is changing in some ways due to bette
information flow, and may change some more.

There will be dramatic pre-singularity econimic changes, and
possibly technology-driven political changes.

My point is that we should be discussing these changes, not
political and economic philosophy based on the current situation.

I'm writing a paper on superintelligence. One of the things that I 
want to do is to spell out in some detail exactly why most of thinks 
that we might very well have superintelligence within 30 or 40 years 
or sooner, even in the absense of nanotech. Then I want to address 
the problem of whether we can make any good guesses about what a 
superintelligence might do, whether we will be able to control it, 
etc.

Here's one fun idea that might elicit some interesting comments:

If we take a human brain and simply speed it up enough, will it be a
superintelligence? Would a dog brain be?

Any human of normal intelligence could function as a universal 
Turing machine, if augmented with enough scrap paper, time and 
patience. According to Church's thesis, Turing computability equals 
mechanical computability, so what the brain does is Turing 
computable. (I assume that Penrose's argument to the contrary is 
wrong, and we disregard possible exceptions that have to do with the 
feasibility of supertasks or the unavailability of enough matter in 
the universe.) What a (finite) superintelligence does would also be 
Turing computable, so a human scrap paper, time & patience), if 
speeded up, could be a superintelligence, provided she run an 
appropriate program. We don't know that this program could be made 
short enough to be stored in human long-term memory, (else it would 
have to be provided as an input on the scrap paper), but I believe it 
could. My guess is that a universal intelligence algorithm could be 
made so simple that it would be an easy task for a human to memorize 
it. Perhaps it would suffice to specify some simple architectural
 properties of a neural network, together with some fairly simple
 learning rule -- something like combination of Backprop, Infomax and
 Hebb's rule perhaps. But whether or not it could be made so concise,
 by using some scrap paper input, I think that even dogs could be made
 to perform on a genius level. Here's how:

Recipe for Cani da Vinci, genius dogs

Ingredients: 20 poodles, universal intelligence algorithm,
nanotechnology

1. Take a twenty poodles.

2. First we need to put the dogs in training. We teach them the basic
operations of a Turing machine: the inputs are given to the dogs as
color-coded light signals, the output is a push with one of their
paws. Poodles are clever dogs, and they should be able to learn this
in a few months.

3. When the learning task is completed, the dog's brains are uploaded
onto a virtual computer that runs on a Jupiter brain.

4. They are presented with input from a virtual tape ("scrap paper")
by having their (virtual) nervus opticus stimulated. The output from
each dog is defined by measuring the activity in their (virtual) motor
nerves.

5. The instructions the dogs have to perform are written on one side
of the tape, so that they don't need to remember them. The dogs just
(virtually) run back and forth between different parts of the tape,
carrying out simple instructions.

6. Here is why we need more than one dog: eventually a dog will get
bored with the task and begin making mistakes. But all twenty dogs
will not start to get bored at exactly the same time. Now, the output
of the total dog house is defined as the output that most of the
individual dogs gave for a the input in question. Any dog that gives
an output different from the total output gets a (virtual) electric
shock, so that it returns to the learned scheme.

7. The Turing machine that is simulated runs the universal
intelligence algorithm (or alternatively simulates the evolution of
the brain states of an uploaded human genius). Amazing feats of genius
are performed by this dog house.

-- I anticipate that Anders will suggest that superintelligences will 
make entertainment out of shaping human organizations into 
entities that perform intelligent tasks, just as we have fun by 
watching circus animals behave. :-)

THe thing that annoyed me about Phenomenon was that they felt they had
to include that whole psychokinetic capability, that hugely amplified
intelligence wasn't phenomenal enough.

There have been a few posts in this thread containing expressions to the
effect: "Why do people talk about (libertarian) economics and politics and
law so much? None of that will matter when the singularity arrives."  Setting
aside for a moment discussion of just what the (or "a") singularity might be
(I would describe myself as a Reform Singulatarian, I suppose), I believe
that questions of economics, politics and law are all the more important in
the shadow of the singularity.  On the one hand, we should care dearly about
how social systems will speed or retard technological develpment and, on the
other, at the advent of post-humanity we will be in sore need of guidance for
our conduct with enhanced power over nature and each other.

The measure of our social systems' vitality and freedom will correlate
directly, it seems, to the speed of technological advancement.  More free
exchange of information should correlate to faster technological development.
 A richer and more diverse economy should result in more leisure for the
spreading of tranhumanist ideas.  More fluid legal systems should tranlate
into lower "transaction costs" in the formation and operation of enterprises
for carrying out the transhumanist agenda.  True, these things may well
promise only incremental changes, but such changes have a way of adding up
and, at some point, reaching the stage of qualitative change.

I don't expect any sort of extropian/libertarian "revolution" prior to the
advent of real post-humaity.  The possibility of conducting experiments on
smaller or larger scales MAY present itself, if anonymous digital commerce
develops far enough before other radical technological transformations occur
(such as nanotechnology or uploading).  If such opportunities present
themselves, we ought to be ready for them, and discussions of economic,
political and legal theory are a good foundation, if we have the chance,
pre-singularity, to implement them.

However, where these contemporary discussions will really pay great dividends
is in the period immediately following the advent of powerful transhuman
technologies.  Many social systems, the current nation-state among them, will
be significantly undermined if "mature" nanotechnology, significant
intelligence augmentation, artificial superintelligences or widespread, full
uploading come onto the scene quickly.  But the need for social systems won't
evaporate.  On the contrary, social actors with newly augmented powers will
be more than ever in need of reliable and acceptable social systems.  Unlike
engineering and the sciences, TALKING about such things is in fact how social
systems happen.

We had some debate on this issue before, in June, 1996, in the more
conventional terms of whether the insights of a genius could ever be
achieved by a normal (or somewhat subnormal) person, given enough time.
I argued that they could not, that no matter how long or how hard an
average person thought about the problem, they would not come up with
the theories of general relativity or quantum mechanics.

A possible test for this I proposed was to take some hard problems from
the Mensa tests and give an average guy unlimited time to try to solve
them.  Might be hard to prevent cheating, though.

This is not a very interesting answer to the question, IMO.
By postulating the existence of a super-intelligent computer program,
you are in effect assuming that super-intelligences already exist (since
the program could presumably be run much more effectively on a computer
than on the clumsy simulation a human or dog pack could provide).  The
interesting question is how difficult it will be to create the program.

Also, as opponents of Searle's Chinese Room paradox argue, if you do use
humans or dogs to run the Turing machine, the super-intelligence is not
that of the humans or dogs.  Rather, another entity comes into being,
the intelligence being simulated.  So while you can *create* a super-
intelligence using fast humans or dogs, they will not *be* the super-
intelligence, as you originally asked above.

The question I wonder about is, if the genii we talked about a few days
ago granted the (misguided?) wish to speed up mentality a million-fold,
would the resulting person be a super-intelligence simply in terms of
applying his own native reasoning powers to the problems he faced.

Full agreement here...

So how long do you think it will take for your car to become an
extension of your home entertainment system? It is one of my
current dreams (if I had the money) to form a company to network
my car to a CD jukebox at home so I can listen to any of my
CDs without having to cart them all around. Ditto for programming
your VCR from afar... The only real limitation I see is the cost
of wireless connections. But with companies here in Atlanta offering
unlimited airtime until Jan 1. and companies in SF like Metricom
offering unlimited 28.8 speed access for $40/month it seems
possible. All of this of course is an extension of the idea in
Negroponte's Being Digital book about moving bits not atoms...

This is a good point, and I think that visions of a Singularity

I have to disagree here. Things like x-ray lithography and copper
chips recently demonstrated can easily keep the industry afloat
for the next 10 years. Even after that there are candidates
currently being successfully researched like: optical logic gates,
quantum computers, quantum dots, and other stuff I don't know
because I'm a software guy not hardware... All of these advanced
pieces of technology have been demonstrated to actually work,
although they are very far from being powerful enough to even
replace a Pentium. But at least there are possibilities, and work
being done on these in the next 10 years should provide ways to
keep Moore's law going.

I'm relatively new to the list, but my understanding of an "S curve"
is that is for a particular technology- like aluminum+silicon
chips like a Pentium. Obviously each technology reaches a limit,
and something new like copper steps in. The question is can we
keep finding newer and more powerful technologies, right?

What is interesting is that all of those fields relate back to
computing and may make more powerful computation available...

For anything related to software engineering (AI), I agree with
you. Unless we can come up with ways to reduce the complexity of
software development, things there will get slower and slower.
Hardware on the other hand should continue to grow for at least
another 20 years even with the technologies we have today. The
question is: does super-hardware without AI software bring about
a singularity? Or will the super-hardware make the effort of
programming an AI possible?

I guess my definition of profound holds a little more weight... but, yes,
I agree, the majority of people have been affected(profoundly or not) by
Bill Gates.

BTW, I don't love or hate Bill Gates, I just seem to have frequent
problems with his company's software.

Well I definitely do not agree with the "others."  What if your property
is surrounded by a bunch of hired hypnotists from Coke swinging
pendulums and chanting "drink coke, drink coke" (OK, that's kind of silly)
But still, if people own all the property around you, and you just happen
to look out your window... I think you have been physically coerced.  The
only defense I can see for this in an anarcho-capitalistic society is for
some consumer organization to monitor companies that practice coercion and
organized massive buoycotts.  Still, if Coke can hypnotize enough people,
why would they care about a buoycott?  Maybe the consumer organization
should take more drastic action in this case...

I see an anarcho-capitalist society as being a bit violent, but certainly
more interesting.

Here's a relevant bit from THE SPIKE (pp. 37-8):

============================================

Today's cutting-edge components are not just small, they are very, very
small.  Sooner or later, one is bound to run out of profitably accessible
space, down there on the etched circuits.  Even if there's ample unused
room at the nano level, will we be able to push the atoms around quickly
enough, and cheaply enough, to continue our dizzying plunge downward into
micro- and nano-chip utopia, and upward toward the Spike?

Certainly, Hans Moravec assured me.  Relax.  `The engineers directly
involved in making ICs [integrated circuits] tend to be pessimistic about
future progress, because they can see all the problems with the current
approaches, but are too busy to pay much attention to the far-out
alternatives in the research labs.  As long as the conventional approaches
continue to be improved, the radical alternatives don't have a competitive
chance.  But, as soon as progress in conventional techniques falters,
radical alternatives jump ahead, and start a new cycle of refinement.  When
short wavelength ultraviolet is no longer good enough, there are X-ray
synchrotrons, electron-beams and even scanning tunnelling microscopes.
Existing ICs are still so far from the 3D, quantum electronic possibilities
already demonstrated in the lab, and the economic incentives to keep the
race going are so huge, that I see no reason to expect things to start to
slow down for several decades - and then we have a whole new regime, that
will make our current time look like the Stone Age.  (And if chip plants
cost ten billion dollars, well, that's partly because they have to be so
big to make the quantities that the market demands.)'
		
The latest news from Moravec is even more astonishing.  By 1997, according
to his analysis of computational bang for your buck, the Moore's Law curve
returned to its original doubling-every-year, and has now swept onward into
even swifter acceleration.  He comments:  `By 1993 personal computers
provided 10 MIPS (million instructions per second), by 1995 it was 30 MIPS,
and in 1997 it is over 100 MIPS.  Suddenly machines are reading text,
recognizing speech, and robots are driving themselves cross-country.'

================================================

Every curve saturates.  Will new curves emerge (or be pushed) to take up
the slack?  Seems plausible to me.

Is this the Strong Anthropic Principle or the Strong Anthropic Principle in

Going from memory (books lent out):
Vernor Vinge gave birth to the concept in 1979.
The first calculation with respect to human-equivalent AI was performed by
Hans Moravec and gave a result of 2035.  I believe this was 1980 or
thereabouts, although it could be 1984.

Yeah, but that was wild optimism, not an extrapolation based on previous rates

Yawn.  Copper circuits, qubits, quantum transistors, STM, nanotech, diamond
disk drives, parallel processing, networked computing, etc, etc, ad Singularitum.

That depends on how you define "intelligence".  If you define it the way I
defined "smartness" in _Staring Into The Singularity_, then the answer is no. 
If you define it in terms of exaflops, the answer is yes.

Check out http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html

It has the answers to all, yes, *all* of your questions.

You are entirely incorrect, for much the same reason as Searle.  It isn't the
human that's superintelligent, it's the program.  It doesn't make a difference
whether a human, dog, robot, or computer does the Turing operations, because
it's the program that's intelligent or not.  All of this, by the way, is on
the same semantic level as that old conumdrum:  "If a tree falls, and nobody
hears it, does it make a sound?"

Um, I doubt it, but he'd be wrong if he did.
Few things would be more pointless or less ethical.

Eli has a good point, though he's a bit scattered in expressing it.
Microsoft has used existing intellectual property law to protect its
market, while at the same time taking advantage of holes in the law
to use the ideas of others.

On the whole, I do not think that intellectual property protection
was really necessary or even beneficial to MS on the whole; in fact,
I'm sure they lost more money because of it than they made.  But it
is nonetheless hypocritical of them to play both sides.  If they
believe, as I do, that intellectual property is just a government
subsidizing the cost of exclusion for one type of business over
another, then they should refrain from using it for themselves.

The cost of exclusion is an ordinary expense for any business; there
is no reason that authors and inventors should be privileged to have
the state bear those costs for them.  That's nothing but snobbery,
treating inventors as if they are somehow more "worthy" than ordinary
craftsmen.  The result is plain: the decline of craftsmanship and
customer service in the last century is the result of IP law shifting
the economy to artificially value innovation over quality.

That conclusion requires a premise you failed to state:
that you desire to stay alive.  Those same descriptive
premises, combined with the normative premise of wanting
to die, would rationally lead you to conclude that you
/should/ piss off a cop.  Without sneaking in the normative
premise, there's no way to reach a normative conclusion.

The physics in such a would  be much simpler than in ours but just as in ours 
the laws of physics are only half the picture, the other half is initial 
conditions. Because there is more than one way to produce a pattern in Life 
you can not run the game backwards to find those initial conditions.

If so then I see no reason to obey its principles, even if I knew them. I'll 
make objective morality a deal, I won't bother it if it won't bother me.

             
        >For all we know, the Holocaust was a wonderful thing   
      

There is only one way anybody could convince me that the Holocaust was a  
wonderful thing, send in their Nanomachines and massively rewire my brain, 
and even then "I" wouldn't be convinced because the resulting creature would  
be so radically different that it would no longer be me. If objective morality
says mass murder is good then I say objective morality can kiss my ass  
because subjective morality is better.

If there is an objective morality then I agree that our opinions do not 
effect it, and I would go further and say that objective morality does not 
effect our opinions. If we do not effect it and it does not effect us then 
Ockham's Razor says that the Objective Morality Theory is not needed. 
Einstein did not prove that the luminiferous ether was nonexistent, he only 
proved that the idea was silly, but that was enough

Then "morality" doesn't need your help so don't worry about it, let it keep 
doing whatever in the world it's doing, and if anybody asks your opinion about  
starting a second Holocaust keep advising them that it's a very bad idea.


        >With respect to ethics, you can't prevail over some higher authority 
        
             
So all objective ethics means is that if somebody more powerful than yourself  
tells you not to do something then you'd better not do it? In some cases that  
might be good advice but seems a bit anticlimactic for such a grand concept.

No, it's not like the shape of the Earth, it's as if the debate was over  
whether the Three Stooges were funny. Suppose you watch a film of the stooges  
and laugh, but then somebody says "Yudkowsky you have made an error, that  
joke was not funny. I have found that Objective Humor exists and with my  
comic algorithm I can calculate the humor content of any message string to  
16 decimal places and do it in polynomial time. The calculation proves  
conclusively that the joke was not even slightly funny, it produced a zero." 

And yet you still laughed. "Objective Humor" didn't think it was funny, but  
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky did.

One has to distinguish qualitative intelligence, the ability to
come up with good solutions to problems, from quantitative intelligence,
the ability to solve many problems in a certain period of time.
Speeding up a mind will only increase quantitative intelligence.

The archetypal example is of course the uploaded dog: it will
remain a dog, even if it lives for millennia.

The man screamed "No! Not the Chinese Room! Not the Chinese Room!" as
the guards carried him away. 

As others have pointed out, it is not the dogs that are intelligent in
this system, just as our neurons are not intelligent. The intelligence
resides on a higher level.

It seems like you have a quite good simulation of my thought processes.

About Eliezer's view that this would be immoral: I think it can be
ethical to do, as long as the humans voluntarily agree to form the
organisation. "Wow! Look at this: that PostAnders entity has a really 
great idea about a selforganized democracy. Let's try it!"

I remember, for a week or so ago, Anders and a few others posted about
"proofing" Astrology, and other weird Ideas... I have read an article by
Asimov, where he takes a number any number, and shows the numerologistical
significance of this very number. I could probably do the same thing...
(Fact is, with 1,2,3,4,5,7,9 and 13 as "holy" numbers, one has rather much
mobility...)

It isn't certain that 666 is the number of the beast, many translations of
the bible say 606.

I personally, regard the last part of the New Testament (I cannot remember
the english name, but it's the part with all the magic numbers everywhere)
as bullshit. (Excuse my french, all you cristians out there.)

I've read *the* major epos in ancient Nordic believe (Vikings etc.). It is
more or less identical, and says just as little about what life's about...

Someone:

Why not?? It's a rather nice language, especially since it runs on almost
any processor, without that the programmer has to take to much of a special
care... It is also rather stable, virii programming in Java would be rather
difficult...

Ever heard of JavaOS ?? Comes from Sun, is an OS written in and for Java...

Having defined morality as a strong individual statement of universal
intent, I recognize that others, having different personal values, may have
different intentions. It is in my interests to judge whether those
intentions pose a danger to others, and thus potentially, to me.

Knowing their moral intent, I may predict their future behavior, and judge
them to be potential friend, or potential foe. From my viewpoint, a
potential friend is more valuable to me than a potential foe, and his values
thus superior.

When I say "moral" it has meaning to me and to others. When others say
"immoral" it has meaning to them and to me. It communicates intent. Is it a
hand or a fist?

In accordance with my personal values and goals, yes.

If I called it "morally wrong" that would be a fraudulent statement
concerning my universal intent. The end selected, however, poses a potential
danger to others, and I would expect them to consider that end, and the
means of achieving it, to be immoral.

Yes, they are the technically right means for achieving his desired ends.

You are mixing his means with my ends...and vice versa. He has chosen the

I make no such claim. I simply predict his future behavior and act
accordingly. I judge his moral values to be dangerous to others, and
consider it to be moral to defend myself. I will not aggress against him,
but will defend against his aggression. This combination (the primethic
decision) precludes claiming others as personal property.

Morality is rooted in the objectively observable phenomenon of
aggression/defense. It comes from the fact that humans, as volitional
creatures, must necessarily choose to defend themselves against aggression,
and decide that it is "right" to do so. The far less desirable alternative
survival strategy is to subjugate themselves to aggressors, thus losing
volition.

It is defense against aggression. It is a reluctance to subjugate oneself.

This results not from morality, but from subjugation of will to others,
whose ends are dangerous to others, and thus immoral. The aggressor's
perceived need to convince their followers that their aggression is
defensive, and thus moral, attests to the widespread existance of the
primethic decision.

Having defined morality as a strong individual statement of universal
intent, I recognize that others, having different personal values, may have
different intentions. It is in my interests to judge whether those
intentions pose a danger to others, and thus potentially, to me.

Knowing their moral intent, I may predict their future behavior, and judge
them to be potential friend, or potential foe. From my viewpoint, a
potential friend is more valuable to me than a potential foe, and his values
thus superior.

When I say "moral" it has meaning to me and to others. When others say
"immoral" it has meaning to them and to me. It communicates intent. Is it a

If I called it "morally wrong" that would be a fraudulent statement
concerning my universal intent. The end selected, however, poses a potential
danger to others, and I would expect them to consider that end, and the
means of achieving it, to be immoral.

Yes, they are the technically right means for achieving his desired ends.

I make no such claim. I simply predict his future behavior and act
accordingly. I judge his moral values to be dangerous to others, and
consider it to be moral to defend myself. I will not aggress against him,
but will defend against his aggression. This combination (the primethic
decision) precludes claiming others as personal property.

Morality is rooted in the objectively observable phenomenon of
aggression/defense. It comes from the fact that humans, as volitional
creatures, must necessarily choose to defend themselves against aggression,
and decide that it is "right" to do so. The far less desirable alternative
survival strategy is to subjugate themselves to aggressors, thus losing
volition.

It is defense against aggression. It is a reluctance to subjugate oneself.

This results not from morality, but from subjugation of will to others,
whose ends are dangerous to others, and thus immoral. The aggressor's
perceived need to convince their followers that their aggression is
defensive, and thus moral, attests to the widespread existance of the
primethic decision.

Long-time denizens of this list and the Transhuman list will recognize the
discussion in this thread as essentially identical to the one Rich Artym, I
and others carried on more that a year ago.  Doc Artym called his theory of
absolute subjectivism in morality and ethics "Unlimited Individual Freedom"
(remember "UIF"?) and the discussion was initiated by one of the usual
triggers for such conversations, debate over the merits of free markets.
 Ultimately, though, the debate came to center on disagreement between those
(like me) who make claim to the existence of an "objective morality" and
those who reject such claims.

In that torrent of words, I attempted to make clear that I rejected any
METAPHYSICALLY or AUTHORITATIVELY objective morality.  Rather, I find one
core set of moral values to be "objectively right" in the nature of life in
society for volitional beings.  Much of the opposition to a claim of
"objective morality" is in fact an attack on the straw men of claims of
metaphysical or authoritative objectivity.  

I see that one can rationally reject the notion of objective morality if one
rejects either (1) the notion of "free" will or (2) the desire to live in
society.  These are unsatisfying alternatives to me.  In the case of
volition, while I see an ultimate material determinism in the behavior of
sentient beings, it seems that determinism is overwhelmed by the more
important emergent phenomena characteristic of complex adaptive systems such
as a conscious mind.  In other words, the insights of complexity theory
trivialize the ultimately deterministic character of consciousness, because
any model capable of truly "predicting" the behavior of a conscious system
must be at least as complex as the system modeled.  Given the exquisite --
and growing -- complexity of conscious systems, our minds are thus
EFFECTIVELY indeterminate and the notion of a "free will" is therefore more
useful than any "metaphysically true" statement that we are ULTIMATELY
determinate. Interestingly, I have not found in transhumanist circles any
real objection to the idea of an objective reality based on determinism.  We
as a cultural movement seem to accept the notion of "free will" without much
question.

The second "escape hatch" can give more comfort -- if that is the word -- for
those who proclaim the ultimate subjectivity of morals.  There is no
objective morality for one who rejects life in society and becomes a TRUE
hermit, completely insulated from interaction with other volitional actors.
 For the man who is truly an island, there is no moral right or wrong, and
others can make no moral judgment of him.  I personally would find this an
unacceptably high price to pay for the dubious pleasure of being able to
validate a notion of purely subjective morals, but will concede that the a
priori condition of life in society is "no more than" a subjective matter of
taste.  At least until some god-like nanotechnology places mastery over the
material universe at the fingertips of a lone individual, though, this taste
for life in society has much to commend it to the individual who desires to
live a life of more than bestial comfort.

With these introductory comments, let me attempt to restate my thesis: The
process of social interaction of volitional beings itself contains the
information necessary to derive certain rules of conduct -- "moral values" --
which are, in the most meaningful sense possible in discussions of morals,
ethics and law, the "best" such rules.  Distilled to the most meaningfully
abstract level, such values include reciprocity and the non-initiation of
force.  I concede that it is logically possible to express such values in
conditional terms, e.g. "If one wishes to be free of unprovoked violence, one
should not provoke violence."  Those opposed to claims of "objective"
morality seem to find this logical possibility to be important, even
decisive.  I do not.  

As I point out above, there are only two choices concerning life in society:
Either one lives utterly alone, or one lives in some society.  A "society of
thieves" is not physically possible, over any great length of time.  This is
verifiable in any "natural history" of morality (i.e. HISTORY itself)  and in
theoretical terms (i.e. game theory).  Thus the ultimately conditional nature
of moral statements can be distilled to only one conditional statement: If
one chooses to live in society, one MUST observe certain FUNDAMENTAL rules of
conduct.  Such rules of conduct have traditionally been expressed as "moral
values" and calling them such does no violence to reason.  In ultimate
analysis, we can indeed see that calling such rules "moral values" is a sort
of short hand, masking the conditional premise of a choice of life in
society, which may be logically considered arbitrary.  But, as I have
attempted to explain above, I find that expression of this conditional
statement is trivial.

I would say that the choice itself was "morally wrong" because inconsistent
with the prior choice of life in society.

Not at all: You posit a "good thief", in the sense of one good AT thievery.
 But our thief is a bad person, in moral terms, because she chooses conduct
inconsistent with life in society.

In a certain sense you are right, Delmar, in that the act of moral judgment
itself is subjective.  However, in any sense in which morality can have
meaning, those judgments can be validated externally as consistent with the
social life of conscious, i.e. volitional, agents.  Moral JUDGMENTS do have
subjects and objects, of necessity.  But making the judgment alone does not
make the object of the judgment "property" at all.  In making this statement
you leap forward, from morals, through ethics (in my personal vocabulary, the
art of applied morals) to law.  A long chain of reasoning and social practice
is masked by this leap.

Now you seem to speak of the psychological aspects of morality.  In fact, we
do indeed have moral feelings or sentiments.  A good working hypothesis is
that such moral feelings are simply the subjective experience of our own
moral values.  However, as extropians, we seek to make the workings of our
own minds as rational as possible: We may still have moral sentiments, no
matter how transformed and augmented we are, but we value rational
examination and formation of such sentiments as much as possible.  But that
we have such feelings makes us no less capable of pursuing a rational
morality.

I agree completely that an UNREFLECTIVE reliance on moral sentiment as the
sole guide for action is apt to lead to violent disagreement.  However, I
conclude from this that we must work all the harder to rationally examine our
own morals and seek the most objective possible guide to them.

For me, at least, these questions are answered by identifying the one
conditional premise upon which morality is based, i.e. volitional actors
living in society.

It seems such logical conundrums are irrelevant to a rational morality and
are of the same type as asking whether an omnipotent god could make a rock
too heavy for her to move, or whether on omniscient god can have free will.
 By definition, the god in your problem has no society, since she is in an
infinitely superior power position.  I'll allow that there can be no morality
for such an infinitely powerful being and, if at the end of the universe such
a single being exists, then morality will have been extinguished as a logical
possibility or practical necessity.

For me, this anguished note is uncalled for.  Moral "truth" is not of the
same character as metaphysical or logical truth.  One might say that there
are metaphysical or logical Truths, but only moral truths, because morality
can not be reduced "below" the level of social systems; it is an emergent
phenomena of the complex adaptive system that is the life in society of
volitional beings.  However, viewed from within the framework of such
systems, they ARE truths.  Viewed from outside such framework, they mean
nothing.

I thought CDs used a fairly high bandwidth, on the order of
44K bytes per second per channel? If so, your radio bandwidth must
get a lot cheaper to support this application. Also, it's supposed
to be illegal to build gear that delivers the raw binary from the
audio CD: only the analog waveform is delivered from your player,
I thought. This is why you have that silly extra wire connecting
your CD-rom drive to your sound card to play audio CDs. All in all
you are probably better off using a DAT tape to copy the CD.

English speakers, as sloppy as they often are, are wed to precision.
To wit:

Complete sentences in English have a subject, a verb, and (generally)
a predicate -- implied if not spoken.  Perhaps a language in which this
was not true would be difficult for us (I, strangely enough, can't think
of one off the top of my head).

How about a language with no representations of past, present, and future?

Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,
imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?

That said, I think that English speakers are among the least constrained
on the planet, since we steal words from so many different languages.
We do, however, seem to have problems with melodic and clicking
languages.

Here is a piece of a mongraph I was commissioned to write about the History
of the Alphabet. The numbers at the end of sentences are footnotes.

Harvey Newstrom  (harv@gate.net)

The earliest form of written communication used pictures to convey ideas.
Clay tokens were used to represent property in Iran by 8700 BC.1  By 3500
BC, Mesopotamian merchants were pressing these tokens into clay to keep a
record of the marks.2  These are the earliest instances of symbolic writing
not involving realistic representations or drawings, although less than two
dozen "words" were created.3  The Sumerian cuneiform style of wedge-shaped
marks were used for recording numerical counts before 3000 BC.4  The
Egyptian hieroglyphic system was developed by 3000 BC,5 and was the first
system of standardized pictographs, although the writing still consisted of
little pictures of the items discussed.  By 2700 BC, some cuneiform marks
had been developed to represent words other than numbers.6

The first alphabet to develop was a common Semitic script used by the early
Hebrews, Phoenicians, Moabites, and Aramaeans to phonetically record their
languages, appearing about 1500 BC.7    These letters were derived from the
Egyptian hieroglyphs8 and had a meaning associated with each symbol, but
for the first time also had a phonetic sound associated with each letter so
that any spoken word could be recorded in writing.  This earliest form of
writing was called Phoenician, Canaanite, or Paleo-Hebrew script.9  The
earliest known examples of this Paleo-Hebrew script are names engraved on
potsherds and other objects from around 1500 BC.10

A form of this script written in cuneiform style was found on many clay
tablets dating back before 1400 BC.11  These tablets used the Paleo-Hebrew
letters to record a language now called Ugaritic.  These tablets also
indicated that the sequential ordering of the twenty-two Hebrew letters was
already established by that date.12  The angular lines of the Paleo-Hebrew
script (that easily lent themselves to the cuneiform style) eventually gave
way to the yod-shaped brush strokes of the Aramaic-Hebrew or Square script.
This style was called Aramaic because the process started with the speakers
of the Aramaic language around 400 BC and eventually spread to the speakers
of the Hebrew language by 100 BC.13  This style of writing the Hebrew
letters is used to the present day.  The twenty-two Semitic letters used
for early Phoenician comprised the first alphabet ever created, and the
oldest alphabet in the world.14  If one discounts the Iranian tokens, the
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Chinese ideographs as no more than little
models or drawings of objects, then the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet is seen to be
the first writing system in the world.  The initial idea that symbols could
represent abstract ideas without resorting to clay models or drawings began
with the twenty-two letters that Semitic languages still use today.

Around the 800 BC,15 the Greeks borrowed the Paleo-Hebrew script, keeping
the same order of the letters and the same names of the letters.  These
later evolved into the various Greek forms of the letters between 750 BC
and 700 BC.16  The Etruscan civilization appeared after 800 BC and
flourished until about 300 BC.17  The Etruscans based their alphabet on the
Greek alphabet.18  The Latin alphabet was based in turn upon the Etruscan
alphabet,19 with the earliest extant examples of Latin text appearing
between 250 BC and 100 BC.20  We can trace the lineage of the Latin
alphabet in use today back to that very first alphabet, the Paleo-Hebrew
script.

Other alphabets were developed later and were often based on the original
Phoenician-Hebrew script.  The oral traditions of these other societies
were first put into writing after the Ten Commandments were already carved
into stone and after the Torah was already being repeatedly copied by
various scribes.  The Arabic alphabet derived from the Hebrew alphabet,
first into the Kufic Arabic script and later into Classical Arabic script
around 600 AD.21  Although Taoist tradition claims that Fu-Hsi invented
Chinese writing in 3000 BC,22 the earliest extant examples of Chinese
pictographs are oracle bones from about 1500 BC.23  The Chinese script was
not standardized, and the oral traditions such as the I Ching were not put
into writing until about 1000 BC.24  Sanskrit seems to have developed
between 1400 BC and 800 BC, when the oral tradition of the Vedic hymns were
first committed to writing.25  Although many cultures claim an older oral
tradition than the Hebrews, the Paleo-Hebrew texts in various languages
including Hebrew comprise the oldest non-hieroglyphic texts in the world.

I want reliable software; at home I use Linux for everything but the

Nonsense; Microsoft receives a massive subsidy from the world's
governments in the form of copyright enforcement. Without that it
would be a much smaller company than it is today.

Having said all that, I've recently moved from working on Linux to
working on Windows, and I'm impressed by the amount it's improved
since my last 'Windows experience' with 3.0. The main things that bug 
me are the memory usage, sluggish performance (a 166 MHz Pentium 
running Windows 95 feels much slower than a 90 MHz Pentium running
Linux), and the way that the applications work fine until you want to
use them with something other than a Microsoft application (e.g.
exporting email into a standard Unix mail file format). 

Then there are the little things; I installed Netscape because Internet
Explorer was so unreliable, and if I run Explorer it puts up a panel
asking whether I want to reinstall it as the default browser, like 
no-one could possibly want to run a browser that wasn't written by
Microsoft.

The other problem is security, which is notoriously lax. And Microsoft
go a long way to reduce it themselves; for example I read recently that
IE 4.0 has a 'feature' which allows any Web site to retrieve a list of
recently visited sites from your browser... I'm sure that will come in
very handy for industrial espionage in the future. I won't even mention
Word macros or ActiveX downloads.

excuse me, but you have a lot to learn about what passes for ownership by
law in white man's world (theft, murder, extortion, prostitution) and
from personal experience i'd be quite willing to bet that the man's
trucks were part of a scheme outright owned and operated by a thief (read
mafia)... i suggest you pay a little attention to where the money is
coming from and going to in this "economy" as they have the nerve to call
it - try the "cia-drugs" list, which only scratches the surface of our
wonderful means of "owning" our way of life. i have also had the
experience to know that people who are so defensive about "coming up from
nothing" have their own second thoughts about where the money REALLY came
from. (actually, you have my sympathies, i have been there...believe me,
you're better off broke than dead to God.)           -velvet

And I recall CarlFs fairly recent comments about problems with the

the cover of the current issue (971006) of Forbes magazine roars about
"Life at 100,000,000,000 Bits Per Second" and "Photonics is the next
stage of the digital revolution."

Now, I dont find the concept of technological Singularities very
useful (except in the sense that Anders Sandberg recently defined
them); but, Howard Banks Forbes article, "The Law of the Photon"
starts off as follows: "Moores Law said that chip power would double
every 18 months. Thats plodding. The new law of the photon says that
bandwidth triples every year" and continues: "Making all this possible
is photonics . . . There is no official name for the law that says how
fast this science will carry us into the next century. We could,
however, call it Paynes Law, in honor of David Payne, a 53-year-old
physicist at Britains University of Southampton. Payne is perhaps the
leading scientist behind two key inventions in photonics over the past
decade and a half."  These are listed as the optical fiber amplifier
and wave-division multiplexing.

And Brian Atkins replied:
< For anything related to software engineering (AI), I agree with you.
Unless we can come up with ways to reduce the complexity of software
development, things there will get slower and slower. Hardware on the
other hand should continue to grow for at least another 20 years even
with the technologies we have today. The question is: does
super-hardware without AI software bring about a singularity? Or will
the super-hardware make the effort of programming an AI possible? >

I have long felt that communication is just as important as
computation to the development of AI / SI / Uploads / Nanotech.  I
dont expect a capital-S Singularity, but I do expect things to get
VERY interesting at an increasing rate of change.. While our
computational capabilities have been expanding according to Moores
Law, bandwidth, and the human ability to utilize it, have not been
keeping pace.  The Web, after all, is only a few years old.  One
promising approach to finally achieving real AI is the recent
emphasis on agent-based computing along with even more recent attempts
to create software for the emerging Global Brain (c.f.,

Linux doesn't correspond to any one firm, unlike e. g. Windows
NT.  There are a number of different firms supporting,
distributing, and developing for Linux: most of them are
private, but I believe a few of them (Caldera?) are public.

No, unlike C, Java defines a virtual machine layer which
interposes itself between the running Java program and the
underlying hardware/native-OS.  For many intents and purposes,
this virtual machine layer may be treated as an OS.  It goes
much much further than C's standard library.

Gender.  We've escaped the pointless chains of gender most other
Indo-Europeans languages have, but we still have it in our pronouns.
This fuels the current debate over non-sexist language and may make

Moore's "Law" gets different versions because it's not as much of a "law" as
most people claim.  Over the last 35 or so years, the doubling rate has
varied between one year and two years, with 18 months a decent long-term
estimate.  I believe the "law" was originally stated as every year, because
it was doing just that for several years in the 60's.  It was revised to 18
months in the late 60's.  The 70's and 80's had several periods of about 2
years, and at least once in the late 80's Moore changed it to every two
years.  Now, I think, it's around 18 months again.  

Moore himself is quite upfront that it's an empirical observation and has
varied over the time period.  In Wired recently he said that the law will
probably hold for another 10-12 years but doubts that it will hold beyond
that.  Beyond that, we will have to move to a radically different system than
wiring and transistors photographically etched on silicon.  There's no
particular reason that this other technology (which might not exist then)
will have the same emergent phenomena as current chip technology.

Just to reinforce an idea:

About teleporters, a very economic way to design them is:

1. Scan the structure of the individual or object.
2. Dissociate the body of the object/individual and reutilize its matter for
other application.
3. Transmit just the structure to the new place, and there use new atoms to
reconstruct the individual/object.

It is much more economics than try to send the matter of the entire
individual/object....

Dan, why do you think that issues of economics and politics
will be irrelevant after the Singularity?

Do you think that post-Singularity entities (PSEs) will not
require scarce physical resources to carry out their projects?
I suspect they will, and that much contemporary economic theory
will be applicable to analyzing their behavior as a result.

Do you think that PSEs will be incapable of forcing one another to
do things non-consensually, and that they will not develop
institutional means of minimizing or at least controlling this sort
of circumstance?  I concede that this seems more plausible (blue
goo?) than the "postscarcity" nonsense, but it doesn't seem
very likely to me.  

Eliezer's position that right and wrong objectively exist, and that
we do not currently have adequate cognitive access to them, seems
like a very reasonable position to me.  Where he loses me is
that part where he seems to assume that some future entity is
more likely to have adequate cognitive access to objective
right and wrong than we do.  

(This is where Tipler's baroque fantasies of the Omega point lose
me too.  The Omega point looks to me like nothing more or less than
the marriage of Heaven and Hell.  Tipler goes on and on about the
Heaven part, and never mentions the Hell.)

the chemistry) if nothing else will cause problems.  Other technologies

End Finney quote

Relevant to this topic there is a recent article at Cnet entitled:
"Moore says Moore's Law to hit wall"
By Michael Kanellos
September 30, 1997
http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,14751,00.html

An excerpt:
Moore's Law is coming into direct conflict with the law of nature. So says 
Gordon Moore. 

Intel's chairman emeritus told an audience at the Intel Developer Forum 
today that the industry's ability to shrink a microprocessor through 
improved manufacturing processes is going to start butting up against 
the finite size of atomic particles. Barring a radical shift in 
microprocessor science, this means that the ability of the industry 
to double the computing power of a chip every 18 months (known as 
Moore's Law) may slow. 

Moore in fact showed an electromagnetic image of a microprocessor 
made under Intel's currently cutting-edge ".25 micron" chip production 
technology, in which the individual atomic layers could be counted and 
identified. 

Some time in the next several years we get to some finite limits, 
but not before we get through five generations," Moore said. According 
to one study, the physical limitations could be reached by 2017. 

"That's well beyond my shift," he quipped. "So someone else can do it." 

End excerpt. The rest of the article is available at:
http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,14751,00.html

The end of Moore's law has been predicted multiple times by individuals
involved in manufacturing . However, advances in materials and processes
have kept occurring to keep Moore's law roughly on track.

Building structures at the atomic level certainly seems to depend on
primarily bottom-up procedures instead of top-down lithographic
procedures.  Perhaps one could use a hybrid approach based on
self-assembly of molecular subunits guided by larger lithographically
built structures, or maybe molecular nanotechnology will mature.

Herb Simon and Allen Newell presented one of the most interesting early
(i.e., 1958) collections of predictions about artificial intelligence.
Since so many predictions are being made on this list I think it is useful
and fun to look back at older predictions. 

>From the web pages of Alan Bundy:
http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/staff/personal_pages/bundy/teaching/2-method/notes/ai2-meth-notes/node3.html

Bundy says the following quote can be found in:
Simon, H.A. and Newell, A. (1958). Heuristic problem solving: The next
advance in operations research. Operations Research, 6(1). 

``On the basis of these developments, and the speed with which research in
this field is progressing, I am willing to make the following predictions,
to be realized within the next ten years: 

1. That within ten years a digital computer will be the world's chess
champion, unless the rules bar it from competition. 

2. That within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an
important new mathematical theorem. 

3. That within ten years a digital computer will write music that will be
accepted by critics as possessing considerable aesthetic value. 

4. That within ten years most theories in psychology will take the
form of computer programs, or of qualitative statements about the
characteristics of computer programs.'' 

End quote

The development mentioned in prediction one arguably happened in 1997
(http://www.chess.ibm.com/). Of course, the match was not for the world
chess championship as recognized by a major chess organization, but
Kasparov is widely recognized as the best human chess player.
This event took 39 years after 1958 instead of ten.

The closest match for prediction two I can think of extemporaneously is
the proof that "Robbins Algebras Are Boolean" 
(http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/index.html).  A computer
program did not "discover" this theorem, but a program called an automated
deduction system was used to prove it. 

Here is an excerpt from the press release announcing this result:

The Robbins problem, which has puzzled mathematicians and
logicians for more than 60 years, has been solved by automated
reasoning software developed in the Mathematics and Computer
Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory.  The problem
was posed by Herbert Robbins at Harvard University in the
1930s, and some of the great mathematicians of the century
have worked on it.

End excerpt

The proof of Robbins Theorem was done in 1996.  Other proofs such as the
"Four Color Map Theorem"  and the "Non-existence of the Finite Projective
Plane of Order 10" required the use of computers and human thought.

Maybe some list member will know about a match or partial match for
prediction three.

Prediction four is not easy to assess because psychology is a diverse
field and the prediction refers to "most theories in psychology".  Yet,
computer models of human thought are certainly influential nowadays.  See,
for example, Steven Pinker's recent book "How the Mind Works"  W. W.
Norton and Company (1997)

The Encyclopedia Britannica claims that Linear A was a syllabic script
dating "from approximately 1850 BC to 1400 BC."  Linear B is backdated to 
1600 B.C., with records dated from 1400 to 1200 B.C.  This doesn't seem
consistent with Hebrew being the non-hieroglyphic writing in the world.

I did some more Britannica reading after my last post on the subject.
Semitic (at least Hebrew and Arabic) words -- morphemes -- are
distinguished by their consonant patterns.  Interspersed vowels do have
significance as inflections, but meaning is determined by the
consonants.  So someone decided that they need only write down the
consonants, leaving off tense and number inflections, perhaps similar to
the way we used to leave out punctuation.  The article insists that this
is a more usable system than it seems.  I can only defer to their more
informed judgement.  Europe did do without punctuation or even word
boundaries for a while.  (And Hebrew later came up with some vowel
marks, although these seem like training wheels for literacy.)

Scholars therefore disagree as to whether Aramaic should be called a
syllabary which skips the vowels or an alphabet.  Apparently they've
compromised and called it a "consonantal writing system" instead, which
is certainly undeniable.  My speculations were confirmed: when the
Greeks adopted the Semitic script, and discovered there weren't any
symbols for vowels, rather important for word differentiation in Greek,
they turned some symbols to vowel representation thus creating the first
undeniable alphabet.  And the syllabary nature of the Linear scripts
confirms my guess that left to their own devices the Greeks would have
come up with syllabaries.  As Linear B has 90 signs and still can't
handle consonant groups, we may be grateful for the alphabet's
serendipitous birth.

Which simply illustrates the unexpected benefits which may come from
diversity, and perhaps cautions us against hasty standardization.
Mnemosyne and Qwerty help us if the world had quickly adopted Chinese
logographs.

Better than the alternatives of private war and buyout is the
possibility of second-level arbitration between the two PPLs.
Our present-day archaic monopoly-law-providers have multiple
levels of appeal... I'm not sure why people find multiple
levels of arbitration so difficult to visualize in a
non-monopolized system of law production.

In practice, such second-level arbitration would probably amount
to arbitrage of the buyout proceedings, but would probably be more
efficient and less unpleasant for all concerned.

One of the things I like about the Austrians among economists
is that most of them are very careful *not* to base their
arguments on assumptions of perfect competition or perfect
information.  Some less sophisticated students of classical
economics seem to think that markets require perfect
information (a condition closely related to perfect
competition) in order to work; Austrians on the other hand see
the market as being *productive* of information.  It requires
some information to work, but it does not require perfect
information in order to improve the quality of the information
(accuracy of the price signals) flowing through it.

One of the problems I have in arguing with left-anarchists (and
I used to be one) is that by refusing to acknowledge the
desirability of a fairly uniform social institution of physical
property in the first place, it's hard to get them to care
about the accuracy of price signals.  Without accurate price
signals, I doubt that Great Societies (such as the one we are
living in at present) can stably persist.  I doubt that it is
possible to stably provide enough food for six billion mammals
as large as we are without good price signals.

Now you are *really* confusing the issue.  First you raise the
left-anarchists purported distinction between personal and
private property, and then you go clouding the much more vital
distinction between physical property and intellectual
property. On intellectual property issues, I am still very
sympathetic to the left-anarchists, and my indignant reaction
to IP laws (which seem to me to be ways of slanting the playing
field in favor of those people who *already* have a cognitive
advantage over most of the other players... horribly
"regressive" in old left terms) may have been what got me
confused in the first place.

I suspect that the institution of private property in physical
objects and regions is one of our species great serendipitous
and inadvertent inventions, like money and language.  It's
difficult enough without confusing that institution with the
much more recent and deliberately (not spontaneously)
originated voodoo notions of "intellectual property".

(This is intended as a philosophical point: I don't have any rancor
against those who make their living selling intellectual property,
even if they use current laws to enforce their claims.  We all have
to compromise with the state sometimes, so I try to refrain from
too vigorously finding fault in that department.)

I'm confused about exactly what Moore's Law states.  From
http://www.ebtmag.com/issue/9607/07sr5.htm:

   Moore's law, which states that the number of transistors per
   chip doubles every two years,

>From the Jargon file, e.g.
http://www-sc.ucssc.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/jargon/00000462.html:


   Moore's Law: /morz law/ prov. The observation that the logic
   density of silicon integrated circuits has closely followed the
   curve (bits per square inch)  = 2^((t - 1962)) where t
   is time in years; that is, the amount of information storable in
   one square inch of silicon has roughly doubled yearly every year
   since the technology was invented.  See also Parkinson's Law of
   Data.

>From an article by Gordon Bell,
http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/BARC/GBell/MicroprocessorReport.htm:

   It is safe to predict the 2047 computers will be at least 100,000 times
   more powerful. If hardware continues to evolve at the annual factor
   of 1.60 rate we know as Moore's Law, (Moore, 1996) then computers that
   are 10 billion times more powerful will exist! Magnetic storage density
   and fiber optic data transmission rates, have evolved at the 60% rate
   (a doubling every 18 months, or 100 times per decade), too.

So, I have doublings every two years, every year, and every 18 months,
all offered as statement of Moore's Law.

I suspect Moore originally said doubling either every one or every two
years, and revised this to doubling every 18 months.  But it would be
interesting to know the truth.

Well, of course it's moral with informed consent.  *Anything* is moral
with informed consent.  That's not the same as the "circus" theory.

I still maintain that it would be pointless to form human organizations into
Turing machines.  Besides, this doesn't take a posthuman entity at all.  I bet
Bill Gates could make Microsoft simulate a small Turing machine with a few
simple mandatory self-propagating memos.  Maybe he's doing it already.

True, but RealAudio and other compression technologies are getting
good enough nowadays that you can deliver near-CD quality (like
playing a portable CD player through your car's cassette player)
over a 56kbit modem. So just hook up a RA server at your house
and a laptop in your car and you are set. You could even theoretically
make your own wireless network using wireless ethernet transceivers
if you don't travel too far from your house. Voila, free networked
audio. The only challenge is to consumerize it enough to make a
product... Just the idea of being able to ditch your discman and
be able to listen to any of your music anywhere in your city would
catch on quite easily if it was fairly competitively priced.

Some people trace the Singularity concept to Vinge's story "Bookworm,
Run".  This was published in 1966 and predicted intelligence enhancement
in 1984 (according to the notes published with the story in True Names).
The story ends with the expection of a transformed world.

Hans Moravec's Mind Children was published in 1988.  He predicts that
computing power capable of human-level AI "would be available in a $10
million supercomputer before 2010 and in a $1,000 personal computer
by 2030."  This would range from 22 to 42 years away.

If you plotted such things as the fastest a human had ever gone,
or the highest a human had ever gone, you would undoubtedly have
people at Jupiter by 2000 if you extrapolate that curve from ca 1970.
Gregory Sullivan wrote here here last December about predictions by G.
Harry Stine in 1961.  Stine extrapolated based on previous rates of
progress and found that human speeds should become infinite in 1982.
Instead we saw a levelling off of the rate of progress.

Diamond disk drives, parallel processing and network computers
are irrelevant to the technological limitations I was referring to.
I don't know much about copper conductors, but I suspect that they will
provide only a modest improvement in performance, and don't help with the
limitations of the silicon gates themselves.  Qubits, quantum transistors,
STM, and nanotech are unlikely to be providing commercial-quality and
-cost computer components in this time frame.  For the next decade it is
unlikely that we will see a commercially viable move away from silicon,
and if we do, it will probably be to something like gallium arsenide,
which at least has been proven to be usable to build computer circuits.

The real question is this: will we see a failing of Moore's law in the
next ten years?  Will the performance per price of computers continue
to grow by a factor of two every two years?  This would require five
doublings in the next ten years.  I don't think it will happen.

2008 is not within the 20-30 year prediction horizon, but few people will
agree that it is a reasonable prediction for the Singularity.

Guess I was wrong, then.  Obviously "Objective Humor" isn't being defined as
what causes the neural events that I experience as laughter, but in some
different way.  Maybe there is such a thing as "Objective Humor"... although I
can't really speculate without fully knowing what it is that *we* experience
as funny.  Maybe our own brains use a "comic algorithm" with an extremely
elegant and objective core, but various neural malfunctions keep throwing us off.

Maybe everyone uses the same core criterion for "laughter", so that a joke
could be invented which was funny to everyone.  Then if somebody who suffered
a massive stroke didn't laugh at that or any other joke, we would say that the
joke really was funny and the person was wrong - his laughter neurons
malfunctioned.  Or if someone suffered a stroke and started laughing all the
time, or started laughing whenever he saw the color purple, we would have no
bones about saying that purple wasn't "really" funny and the behavior was the
result of brain damage.

You can object to this on ideological grounds, but in point of fact this *is*
what a normal, sane, non-philosophical human would think about the above situation.

Let me first say that I agree that it would be an entirely useless 
enterprise to implement the dog Turing machine. I also agree that, as 
in Searle's Chinese room experiment, it would only be the whole 
system, not the individual dogs, that would be superintelligent. I 
furthermore agree that the whole message was rather silly, but I 
posted it because I thought it would elicit some comments that might 
spark an interesting discussion.

Interesting. What is your opinion on the following hypothesis?

(H) Take a person X of normal intelligence who knows the basics of 
some standard programming language. Give him an arbitrarily powerful 
computer, complete with camera eyes, microphones, robot arms etc. 
Then it is possible to educate X in less than a week in such a way 
that he will be able to program his computer to achieve 
superintelligence.

The idea is that what one may call a universal intelligence algorithm 
might well be very simple. For example, if one knew enough about the 
initial conditions on the earth 4 billion years ago, one might be 
able to simulate evolution and thereby at least human genius level 
intelligence. The same could probably be done with a much leaner 
information base. It doesn't even seem implausible to me that some 
genetic algorithm or neural network architecture/learning rule that 
might be so simple that it could be written on the back on an 
envelope could achive superintelligence, given enough hardware and 
unlimited interaction with the external world. I can say something 
even stronger: I think it quite possible that a universal 
intelligence algorithm could be fairly easily discovered. Perhaps it 
could be done in a few months by a smart guy, perhaps in an 
afternoon. The reason nobody (as far as I know) has yet done this 
discovery is that the algorithm would be extremely inefficient and 
therefore practically useless. But it might still be fun from a 
theoretical point of view. Perhaps I will have a go at it myself.

Given sufficient motivation, disregarding the problem of sensory 
interaction (that would probably cause the person to go made within a 
second), and assuming he had been taught one universal intelligence 
algorithm, then the answer would be Yes.

I'm not sure that "constraint of thought" is the problem so much
as constrained communication ability.  It is simply more difficult
for a person raised on Japanese sounds to distinguish others, as it
is very difficult for Amercian to distinguish the many vowel sounds
of some European and Asian languages.  That constrains cooperation,
but I don't think much else.  My Japanese co-worker calls me Mr.
"kuraku", but once I understood that we cooperated just fine.

I am more likely to believe that /grammar/ plays a much more important
role in constraining thought itself, because complex relationships
are part of the nature of thought.  One can diagnose certain mental
problems, for example, by examining the grammar of the patient.

Several Asian languages use a "topic-comment" structure rather than
subject-verb.  In Chinese, for example, "Fish: eat" is a perfectly
valid sentence, but must be disambiguated by context (one does not
know whether the fish is the eater or the eaten without more info).

Lojban allows both forms, and some others such as the prenex.  So
one can say "Fish: eat", or "Joe eats the fish", or "There is a fish,
such that Joe eats it."  The semantics of the first form are just as
ambiguous in Lojban as they are in Chinese, but the grammar is not:
the grammar unambiguously describes where the semantic ambiguity lies.

> How about a language with no representations of past, present, and future?

Don't know of any offhand.  Lojban /does/ allow you to leave out that
info if you want, so you can say "Joe [eat] fish" without committing
yourself to whether this happened in the past, present, future, or
other tenses (where English requires you to pick one).

> Or a language with no distinction between declarative, interrogative,
> imperative, and subjunctive (or some subset thereof)?

Don't know of any there either.  Even in Lojban, one /must/ decide
ahead of time whether you're asking a question or making an assertion
or issuing a command.

And fine vowel distinctions.  That's one reason the French laugh at us:
no Amercian can say "En peu" with anything close to the right vowels.

And finally, there is the obvious thought-constraint of gender, and
the parts of speech themselves: nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  Classical
Chinese had no gender, but regrettably one of the "modernizations" it
suffered this century was to make it more European by using the male
words as generic pronouns, the female ones as female-specific, and the
neutral ones fell out of use.  I don't know of any other natural language
that is gender-neutral.  Most artificial languages are.

Lojban is the only one I know of with no distinction between nouns,
verbs, and adjectives.

Has anyone used Lojban for computer applications yet? Would it really be

I agree with you completely, however there are newcomers to this list,
notably from countries less advanced along the siungularity curve as
ours, that still don't understand or agree as to what point we are
starting from. WHile one would think that the death of the Soviet Union,
the end of Socialism in China and most other control economies, as well
as the end of the welfare state in many western nations, would be enough
of an indicator to prove the point that "free enterprise is the superior
economic system", there still seem to be plenty of people on this list
who refuse to learn from history, and refuse to acknowledge the truth of
today's global economy. 

Before we can discuss where we are going, any discussion group needs to
agree on where we are now.

Some linguists who study writing systems call the Semitic scripts
"abjads".  In Semitic languages, words inflect around not a root but a
series of consonants; if you understand the context, you will know which
vowels apply.

They already had (Linear B), and lost it with the collapse of Mycenaean
civilization.

Syllabaries are generally best for languages where the typical syllable is
one consonant and one vowel or just one vowel.  Languages like English or
German, where syllables can be CCCVCC (streets), are a little harder to
transcribe without a godawful number of characters.

Some syllabaries fit their languages very well, such as Japanese and
Cherokee.  Others don't fit so well, like the Mayan languages and
Mycenaean Greek.  Writers in these scripts had various kludges to get by.
The Mycenaeans just ignored the consonants on the end of a syllable, so a
word like Agamemnon might be written A-GA-ME-NO.  The Mayans covered the
end consonants by treating them as the beginning of a second syllable, one
with a silent vowel, generally the same vowel as the real syllable.  A
word like 'kutz' might be written KU-TZ(u).

The best English text dealing with writing systems is _The World's Writing
Systems_, by Oxford Press, 1996, edited by Peter Daniels and (somebody)
WIlliams.

I didn't think much about it till I got involved with this company that
is trapped in Corel Ventura. I've had more corrupted files, access
violations, lockups, you name it, in the past two months than in my
previous 7 years working with computers. Just today, I tried to use
Ventura's "publish to HTML" function. It froze up a half dozen times
while half way through the job of converting a software manual into a
website. I finally got a halfway decent output without crashing on the
seventh try. It took setting the virtual memory at a fixed 300 megs to
do it, and it still took an hour to process.

Its all a matter of using your own means of self defense, or a hired

Pretty much, but its all relative, really. I'm pretty good at seeing
through most scams that people try to pull on me, but its only since
I've been conned enough to the point where I make it a point to be on
the lookout, looking for the catch.

So ELiezer projecting 2008 is not so far off, at least for the first
steps. Market penetration would still take time, though I'd expect lab
models to reach market competetiveness within a decade at that point,
simply because of the added capabilities laboratory human level  AI
would give to accellerating Moore's rate even more.

This is more an indicator that such rates of progress are dependent
indicators, not leading indicators. That space technology has been at
the mercy of public policy and military strategy, rather than driving
the market, would explain why its been so retarded. One might also blame
environmentalists and arms control advocates. Nuclear propulsion was
supposed to be the next big leap in propulsion, which would have made
space travel pretty cheap. Nowadays, its a pain in the butt to try to
get a little old robot probe with a plutonium generator off the ground
without an international protest. Advanced conventional propulsion, like
the aerospike engine, which will be used on the Lockheed Venture Star,
has been in use on Air Force and CIA spy planes for over a decade, but
is completely black due to the restrictions of "national security". It
wasn't until the late 80's that private business was legally allowed to
compete in space, so its no wonder things have floundered.

In this respect, its the economics of traveling to low earth orbit that
are the stumbling block, not true space travel. Getting to low earth
orbit means that you are halfway to anywhere in the solar system, in
energy terms.

THough, the current s curve is in processors. We are still at the
beginnning of the cost/performance curve with respect to
multiprocessor/neural net computers. I think once we start to hit the
wall with processors, we'll start to see more and more affordable
multiprocessor PCs, which ought to last another decade at most before
another wall is hit, at which point more exotic technologies will start
to become available, as soon as the neural computers are cheap enough to
make widespread use in engineering applications. This will bootstrap the
affordability of the R&D to develop the new exotic technologies.

To those who live it, they will never notice any drastic change, and no
singularity, per se, will be reached. People will always consider the
limit of the knowable to be x many development cycles in the future.
Granted, as things speed up and people get smarter and smarter, x will
continually shrink, but the amount of shrink will diminish over time to
a set amount of time in which extrapolation is reliable. Remember, an
event horizon is only such in relation to a specific point in the past,
it itself has no fixed point.

It's worse than that: CCCVCCCVC is a single syllable in such English words
as "scratched" and "stretched". (I always wondered when that bit of trivia
would serve a purpose in some conversation apart from its trivia value...)
Nine letters, seven phonemes, one syllable.

Good points, I usually just use (or abuse) the language without
thinking about it. However, I was thinking more in terms of
linguistic constraints that map into the way our human brains
are  wired. We are now confronting the near-term possibility
of remodelling our brains, via uploading or computer augmentation.
Will we need new linguistic constructs to use the new hardware
effectively? can we get some idea of what we need before the
hardware is available. This is roughly analogous to designing
a new higher-level computer language in conjunction with a
new processor.

I think we have one already.  Do a bunch of things; see what happens;

The tricks, of course, are in the representation of ideas and the

algorithm or part of the hardware.  If you call them hardware, though,
then we do know the algorithm to produce superintelligence, because the
algorithm of evolution will have produced us, our brains, and the ideas
which designed the superintelligence.  You just need to run the program
long enough on enough hardware with enough interaction with the external

CD audio is actually 88kbytes/channel ( 2-bytes/sample * 2 channels * 44100
samples/sec = ~176kbytes/sec ) or slightly less bandwidth than a T-1 line.  

However, radio broadcast standards are 32000/samples per second per
channel.  Additionally, FM broadcast audio has a signal to noise ratio of
no more than 60dB (usually less), or roughly equivalent to 10-bits/sample
instead of the 16-bits/sample for Red Book audio.  Using non-linear
encoding you could probably fit that into 8-bits/sample.  Degrading the
source signal to the level just described should produce sound that is
indistinguishable from quality FM broadcast, and could fit in about 30% of
the bandwidth space of CD audio.  It should be noted that the frequency
spectrum and resolution specified for CD audio requires a minimum of 1500
ft^3 of non-reflective space for accurate sound reproduction (i.e.
expensive car stereos are a waste unless you own a convertible).

As for pulling raw audio off a CD, I've seen it done, but the software
requires low-level access to the hardware.  If your drivers don't support
it, you probably can't do it easily under most operating systems.

Oh?  and what, pray tell, might that be?  I have a couple of decades

(business, management..etc)...but I will be the first to admit that my
understanding of the intricicies are superficial and incomplete...please
enlighten me...and I don't follow how theft, murder , extortion, or
prostitution either follows or is relavant...

do you mean theft as  practiced by the IRS?   Murder as practiced by the
BATF?  And what's prostitution (of the sexual variety I assume?) got to do
with anything...BTW prostitution is legal in Nevada...(with certain
restrictions)..has been for decades...and seems to be working quiet
well....I've seen "CatHouses" located in close proxmity to those dens of
supersition and ignorance...churches....and they both seem to peacefully
co-exist...

anything about his trucks...but he's by no means atypical...I know several
much like him...me for instance...does that qualify for the bet?)) that the

You are a theif?...otherwise how do you have this personal experience?  

But nonetheless..there ARE multiple pathways to acheive his purported
position..  For example...the one I took....I acquired my CDL (which required
the ability to read and write by the way...but some rules are ignored for
"minorities"...after all they have been soooooo abused by us evil mean white
boys...and it would be unfair to expect them...given this abuse...to have to
meet the same standards that we do)...and drove for a major carrier for a
year or so...after that time I bought one of that carriers trucks...they
required a thousand dollar downpayment...with financing thru a third party
(Associates Financial Corp)...I then made my truck payments...paid the truck
off...and viola!....I own a truck...free and clear...(no mafia needed)...

I hired an accounting firm to do my paperwork...(the IRS and various
theives...er...government agencies....regularly change the rules...in hopes
of catching "violators"...and fining them...so it's best to have "hired guns"
who keep up with sort of thing...and I didn't want to fool with it...when I
quitt driving for the day I want to relax...not do paperwork...and it's cheap
enough...less than $50 a month. So given that...he really WOULDN'T need to
know how to read nor write..

After that...I accumulated capital...(in the process changing
carriers)..bought my own trailer (paid off)...and traded for a newer
truck...(Stiiiiiiiiiiilll) no mafia needed.  The new truck cost more used
than the old truck did new...I could have bought two less expensive
trucks...hired a driver and continued the process toward the situation which
"that man" has already attained...did I so desire...I don't...I'd rather have
a nice rig...(and there are very few nicer)..and the freedom to do pretty
well what I please...not having to worry about employees...(and addittional
government rules, regulations, penalties..and costs...

(read
 mafia)...>>

could be...only I don't consider the mafia to be theives...they are
unsanctioned free enterprise entreprenuers operating in an enviroment bereft
of gov. subsidies...bringing products and services to those who are willing
to pay for them...without regard to sanctions by the masters in charge who
decree otherwise...( a very high risk business...requiring rather drastic
business practices)..while I disagree with them in specifics...I agree with
them in principle...and find little diference (in principle) between their
activities and those of say , blockade runners during the civil war...or
other cases of "smugglers" providing goods and services unallowed by the
controlling regime.

<< i suggest you pay a little attention to where the money is

all five trillion dollars of it? (per year....and growing...the drug
money...and the under-ground economy on TOP of that.)...sorry...I gotta life
to live...no time

 <<to in this "economy" as they have the nerve to call
 it - >>>

five trillion (more actually) a year GNP...with hundreds of trillions of
investment...surely this qualifies as an economy...(no quote marks
required)...and it doesn't take much nerve...merely application of common
english usage. 

<<<try the "cia-drugs" list, which only scratches the surface of our
 wonderful means of "owning" our way of life. i have also had the
 experience to know that people who are so defensive about "coming up from
 nothing" have their own second thoughts about where the money REALLY came
 from.>>>


first you're upset a about the mafia...now youre uptite about the REAL
theives and scoundrels...the government...well so am I...but that has nothing
to do with the fact that if youre willing to work hard you can make someting
for yourself...

 (actually, you have my sympathies, i have been there...believe me,
 you're better off broke than dead to God.)           -velvet-

I don't know if I need your sympathies or not...but you just lost all
credibility with me at the mention of a construct of
superstion....(apparently you are infected by a particularly virulent,
long-lived, and destructive meme)....I thought we were conduciting a rational
and reasoned discussion.

Instead of sympathy...if you desire to exercise your "compassion", and/or if
you agree that you lost you "bet", then I suggest you make a donation to The
Libertarion Party, The Extropians, The ForeSight Institute, The Second
Millenial Foundation....or just give a sawbuck to a hooker and then walk
off....any of these actions will serve a more useful function than
sanctimonious "sympathy"

Well, maybe.  The "Greeks" were not as monolithic as your post
paints them.  The Linear scripts developed among the Minoan/Mycenean
civilization, whose descendants were mostly to be found among the
slave and helot classes of the civilization usually referred to as
"classical Greece".  Hellas and the Aegean went through several
centuries of illiteracy (this was the time when the Homeric bards
were creating the Iliad and the Odyssey in their long-term memories)
after invaders from the north finished off Thera's damage.  The
descendants of those illiterate invaders were the people whose
names come to mind when we think of classical Greece.  And they
learned how to write from the Phoenicians because the Linear scripts
were completely forgotten centuries before they even began to take
an interest in literacy.

It might even have been a clever bilingual Phoenican sailor/trader,
fluent in Greek, who realized that to use his alphabet to write in
Greek he'd need to assign vowel values to some of the otherwise
useless letters.  Don't jump too quickly to credit the Greeks with
this innovation.  (They already have scores and scores to their
credit anyway.)

The Phoenicians, for anyone who cares, were largely the same people
who were earlier known (e. g. in the Old Testament) as the Canaanites,
and whose colonists were later known to the Romans as the Carthaginians
or Punics.  One thing that is interesting about them is that they
were the first people I can think of who established a merchant
aristocracy that lasted for hundreds (maybe thousands) of years.
In most civilizations of that era, merchants were *never* allowed
to get the upper hand over landowning soldier types.  This is one
reason why the Hebrews hated them... at the time of the Hebrew-Canaanite
conflict, the Hebrews were warrior herdsmen and the Canaanites were
urban traders.  Likewise, the Romans hated them with a passion,
the Romans being prominently countrified landowning soldiers at
that point in their history.

Hanno the Carthaginian apparently led the first ship to circumnavigate
Africa:  he brought back stories of the noonday sun appearing in
the northern sky.  This was everything he needed to claim to utterly
discredit himself in the eyes of his contemporaries, and utterly
clear himself in the eyes of we latter-day readers.

It is widely claimed that the Punics practiced human sacrifice to
their gods (one of whom, I believe, was named MAMMON), including
sacrifice of children.  But then again, history is written by the
winners, and after the Canaanites got the stuffing knocked out of
them by the Hebrews and the Phoenicians by Alexander, the Romans
finished up by plowing salt into the soil of Carthage and selling
the entire population into slavery... let's just say I'd take the
tales told by the winners with a grain of, er, salt.

Another slam that one finds against the Punic peoples in books like
the Encyclopedia Britannica is that they produced little of artistic
interest.  I figure they were too busy making money by paying
attention to what other people wanted, and finding and shipping it
from far places for them.  The proud altruism of the merchant
sometimes goes so far as creating alphabets for one's trading
partners.

I'd think that the easiest fix would be to start building chips in three
dimensions, as cubes. Of course, they'll have to build in passive
temperature controls, though possibly active systems built at the micron
level might be a good first boost to mass nano machinery production.

Of course, then, they'd have to to license the Borg(tm) name from
Paramount as a trade name for the processor.

Well, "psychological tools" covers a very broad territory.  Which
psychological tools were you interested in discussing?

There are extensive online discussion groups for investing, though
that does get discussed on this list from time to time, it's a big
(and mighty contentious) subject.  I tend to like what Harry
Browne wrote on the subject before he lost his marbles and went
into politics (half-kidding, there), but the last couple of
times I brought it up on the list, it didn't seem to meet with
much approval or interest.  Apparently, many of Browne's ideas
about investing are considered crackpottish, even among
extropians.  ;)  And all of his advice is heavily slanted
toward North Americans.

There's an excellent FAQ about calorie restriction, by Brian Manning
Delaney, available at 

	http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/bmdelane/cr.htm

I haven't been very scientific about it: after I read Walford's
books, I mysteriously developed the motivation to lose 35 pounds
over the course of the next two years (hard data can be very
motivating in the right context!), and since then I've just been
trying not to regain it.  And when the mood strikes, I try to
rearrange my diet in a more paleolithic direction: "How many hot
fudge sundaes per year would my ancestors of forty thousand years
ago have been in the habit of consuming?  Can my genome really deal
with this?"  And I think I've managed to modify my habits enough
that I probably eat *slightly* more dark-green or deep-yellow
vegetables per week than I used to.

But the time since I ate my last bag of Cheetos is
embarrassingly small.

Maybe there are "inherent physical limits" - but the ones you mention aren't.

Very true.  Quantum computation, for example, should have doubling qubits
instead of doubling transistors.  So after 10-12 years, the size of the RSA
key crackable by a computer will double every two years (or something like
that).  Nanotech should make a huge leap, followed by a few more huge leaps,
and finally bottom out at something like a quadrillion times current speed. 
Combine the two and you have enough computing power to do, well, pretty much
anything you damn well feel like.  You could simulate a centillion humans on a
chip the size of a dust speck, and do a thousand aeons of subjective time
every second.

So at this point, I don't care in the slightest what kind of S curve these
technologies follow or even if they do follow an S curve, because this is
enough computing power to warp the Universe.  We are talking *way* beyond
what's necessary for Singularity.  Just simulate random object code until you
get a Power.

And quantum nanotech isn't even the fastest chip we can build, using the
modern laws of physics.  I can think of two different ways, using current
technology, to build chips that operate at infinite speeds - no infinite
temperatures, no baby Universes.  The more speculative method wouldn't even
cost more than a couple of megabucks, since you wouldn't need the space probe
and the particle accelerator.

I think it's more that PSEs using "contemporary" economic theory would be like
NASA using Aristotelian physics.  At the very best it might be like NASA using
Newtonian physics to calculate orbits - a close approximation.

The PSEs can figure out their own damn economic theory.  *I'm* working on my
program architectures.

Let me ask the following question:  Do you think that PSEs will be able to
intuitively comprehend general relativity or quantum mechanics?  Perhaps to a
human with a redesigned visual cortex, GR would be "obvious".

I am bounded on all sides by the processes I can model.  Only the ability to
redesign my brain can break that kind of bound.  Even Einstein could have been
said to be operating on the impetus of the Michelson-Morley experiment, giving
him the needed insight into the unintuitive operating principles of the
Universe - i.e., he "looked in the back of the book" using a physical
experiment.  Maybe we could do that with respect to right and wrong - using
the objective phenomenon of the subjective experience of pleasure - but this
still strikes me as difficult.

Anyway, given that I don't have cognitive access to X, it seems reasonable to
try and extend my cognitive access before giving up.  It could be that Reality
itself is closed with respect to ethics, but I have absolutely *no* way of
knowing that.  I mean, my theory of ethics is based on being *completely* in
the dark.  Rewiring my cognitive architecture seems like a nice place to start
- even if it doesn't work, I'll be more intelligent when it comes to figuring
out the next attempt.  I can't think of any better way.

With all due respect to Tipler, I think the Omega Point is pure trash. 
Theology, and not very good theology either.  Although I liked the proof that
an infinite amount of computation can be performed using infinite time and
finite energy or infinite energy and finite time - whether the Universe is
open or closed, in other words.  It might have practical applications.  But
I'm not sure that's original with Tipler.  And aleph-null computations doesn't
necessarily mean you know "everything knowable" - maybe it takes aleph-one. 
And the phrase "everything knowable" sounds an awful lot like "the class of
all classes".

English doesn't handle different forms of concurrency well.  Pretty
much we have "while", "during", and such.  What about ways of expressing
doing multiple things at once in "task-sliced" vs. "time-sliced"
concurrency modes?  And if there are multiple copies of you in constant
communication, you'll probably want ways to refer to your various points
of view and their intersection/union while at the same time preserving
your sense of identity (whatever that is -- different discussion).

What about expressing multivariable dynamically-changing probabilities?

What about ways of expressing the passage of time for one of you that's
still and another of you that's moving at .99c, when you're "talking to
yourself"?

Personally, I've always been at a loss for ways to adequately express
joy and wonder, and I could hope that a new language would help with
that, too....

Well, that's really only CCCVCCC, in phonemes.  Although I have heard
someone in a used record store say that they discount the "scratcheds".
We'll have to contrive some way to squeeze an extra liquid in there:
perhaps "scraltcheds"?

Well, not really - it's just that if you want to write a more complex
syllable, you have to live with some redundancy and/or ambiguity.  I
imagine that the earliest writing was mainly a mnemonic aid: the reader
already knew generally what the text was about, and so could resolve
ambiguities from context.

The longest known Linear B text, which I find in a book which I'll cite
in a moment, runs as follows.  On the left I'll put the transliteration, 
and on the right somebody's best guess of the intended words.
Note how many consonants are omitted!

Also of interest: Nakanishi, _Writing Systems of the World_ (Chas.E.Tuttle

of a newspaper, as well as stamps and the like.  Has some errors in Russian
phonology iirc, which is not surprising in a book translated from Japanese,
but not important.

Free will means the inability to predict ones own actions, I don't see the

          >(2) the desire to live in society. 
                      

Personally I do want to live in society, but I don't see anything unique, 
objective, or universal about such a desire.   
    
                           
        >A "society of thieves" is not physically possible, over any great         
        >length of time. 
                           

For a society to work it's best if certain conventions are followed by most 
people most of the time, but these conventions don't form a unique set,  
almost any practice you care to name, I don't care how repugnant, is 
considered moral by some culture somewhere. Besides, these conventions are 
just practical matters to take into consideration consider if you want to 
build a society that works in a certain way, I don't see why they deserve the 
lofty  title "Objective Morality" any more than a table listing the amount of 
stress a steel beam can take are ethical laws.

Yet another problem, if "Objective Morality" really is objective then there  
should be some evidence of it in the non human world but we see none. If you 
gave me the job of designing the cruelest possible process for producing life 
and intelligence I could not come up with anything more horrible than 
evolution by random mutation and natural selection.
                           

        >If one chooses to live in society, one MUST observe certain         
        >FUNDAMENTAL rules of conduct.  
                           

To be more precise, if people chooses to live in society most Should observe  
certain FUNDAMENTAL rules of conduct most of the time for the society to work 
well. But there is no Objectively Moral reason that a society should work 
well, and at any rate, these are just engineering considerations.

I hope I don't come off sounding too cold hearted in all this, but if 
somebody claims to be able to prove OBJECTIVE morality then the game moves 
out of the gentle examining room of ethics and religion and into the harsh 
no holds barred arena of science, because objective facts is what science is 
good at. Like any theory it must be strong enough to survive brutal criticism,  
only the very toughest theories survive in science and I'm afraid objective  
morality is a dead duck.

I don't understand, how can there be no morality for God if objective morality 
exists, or are you saying that God could exist or objective morality could 
exist, but not both?

Obviously, and for that very reason it's equally obvious to me that whatever 
"Objective Humor" is defined to be it should have no interest to you.


        >Maybe there is such a thing as "Objective Humor"


Well maybe objective humor does have a useful meaning, but just suppose it 
does not and I could prove it, would you then vow never to laugh again?  
I doubt it, and if I could prove that objective morality did not exist I very 
much doubt you would start pushing people into gas chambers.

We could only conclude that his brain was working differently than that of 
most other people, not that one was right and one was wrong. Even if the 
brain was dead and starting to rot I can't think of any OBJECTIVE reason why 
it's inferior to a living healthy one, although I can think of lots of very
powerful subjective ones.

Hey, the universe is not a democracy and we're not talking about a popularity 
contest. You've set a very high standard for yourself, determining objective 
fact, and that can't be done by a show of hands.

It varies by language, of course.  I imagine those semetic languages were

I think we'll have to wait another few years to claim this prize.
Kasparov is in fact the FIDE recognized world champion, but Deep Blue
would probably not have made it through the preliminary rounds of
the world championship challenge procedure, because it was written
specifically to beat Kasparov; it was tuned to his style, and learned
from his matches.  It would certainly do well in general competition,
but it would probably lose to someone with a very different style of
play from Kasparov's, like Mikhail Tal or Vasily Smyslov.

Frankly, I think Chinese logographs would have served us well.  It is
actually a much more efficient system for printing, reading, and even
writing: there are, on average, fewer penstrokes per Chinese word
than per English word.  They also survive the centuries better, not
being subject to phonetic drift (peasants from opposite sides of China
who would strain to understand each other's speech--if they could
manage at all--can both read Lau-Tsu with ease, while students today
have difficulty with Shakespeare, and most don't even attempt Chaucer).

The only disadvantage to logographs is longer learning time.  I think
that's a minor nuisance, really, for all its benefits.  In the computer
age, storage would be more efficient, but a manual input device would
be trickier, so that's a downside I suppose.  We might have been forced
to develop higher-resolution displays sooner, too!

There is actually something called 'the caveman diet', developed by 
an immunologist, with which I am periodically threatened when I become 
too neglectful of my own.  I understand that it is nearly impossible to 
follow outside of moving to a special clinic in Texas where they 
(I suppose) do the hard labor of skinning the mastadons in the courtyard 
and lightly singing them for consumption.  Nuts, twigs and spring water.  
No pesticides, processed foods, everything raw.

The second question is a definite yes, because of its unambiguous
phoneme-to-word parsing, unambiguous predicate-logic-based grammar
(both verified by YACC), and rich mathematical expression ability.

Members of the group have developed software to parse the language,
but I don't know of anyone using it for a practical computer application
(though there are potential applications for which it would be useful
even if never spoken by humans--intermediate representation of multi-
lingual texts, for example).  With probably fewer than 200 speakers,
the grammar only this year finalized, and the first textbook not yet
on paper, it is probably too early to place any bets.

There is somebody on the list who use a quote from Gibson. "The future
is here. It's just not evenly distributed"

This will probably also be true after a possible singularity. I find it
hard to see that suddenly everybody will upload. From poor chinese
farmers, African tribes to enviromental fanatics. There will just be an
even wider gap between the haves and hasnots than we have now. They will
still need earthly politics.

Oh and by the way. The 30-35 year timelimit for the singularity doesn't
come with a warranty. It could just as easily take 500 years or a
billion year. A new ice age or a little meteor could wreck havvoc on
this planets fragile enviroment soon enough.

	ARBOREAL COMMUNISM ?   N O T 


	(c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard

	SCIENCE NEWS [1] recently reported a study 
	purported to have found an example in nature 
	of organisms practicing the communist ethic 
	"from each according to ability, to each 
	according to need." This alleged communist
	conspiracy includes the Paper birch [2], 
	the Douglas fir [3], and several fungi [4].

	SN proclaims that this study "challenges 
	the current ecosystem models, which assume 
	that plants constantly compete with one 
	another for resources." That extrapolation 
	is, however, not supported by the evidence.


	WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS

	The study found that carbon dioxide (CO2) 
	in the form of sugar is distributed from 
	the roots of trees in the sun with the most 
	CO2 to the roots of trees in the shade with 
	the least CO2. This egalitarian transfer is 
	performed by a network of subterranean fungi. 
	The result is a more equitable distribution 
	of CO2 than would otherwise exist in the 
	arboreal community. As SN states:

	   The [research] team showed that 
	   some trees give their neighbors
	   carbon that they have captured
	   from the atmosphere. An under-
	   ground network of fungi collabo-
	   rates in transporting the goods.
	   ... The network envelops the 
	   roots of both types of trees.

	   The scientists discovered that 
	   shade [ or need ] enhances a 
	   tree's ability to receive [CO2].

	Irrespective of this fungi-facilitated sub-
	sidy, the trees have a symbiotic relation 
	(mutualistic symbioses) with the fungi in 
	which the trees give the fungi CO2 in ex-
	change for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), 
	which the fungi liberate from the soil.[5] 
	It is after this tree-fungus exchange that 
	the fungi will then transfer some of their 
	earned CO2 to trees in need of CO2. 

	This process of redistribution subsidizes 
	CO2-starved trees that are shaded under the 
	canopy of larger trees that take up all the 
	direct sun. The researchers found, however, 
	that as a rule, birch trees tend to experi-
	ence a net loss while firs enjoy a profit. 


	WHO SUBSIDIZES WHO?

	With the SN report entitled "Communism In 
	Trees Goes Underground," the presentation 
	of the study by SN promotes confusion by
	suggesting that this egalitarian distribu-
	tion can be attributed to the trees them-
	selves, when in fact it can only be attrib-
	uted to actions of the "middle men fungi." 
	Statements like these cause this confusion:

	   Although plants don't plot to 
	   overthrow capitalist regimes, 
	   their actions demonstrate a 
	   clear communist bent. ...
 
	   ... trees give their neighbors 
	   carbon... Birches subsidized firs...

	Let's think for a moment: if you gave the 
	baker $5 for bread and then the baker gave 
	$2 to the poor,  it would be erroneous to 
	say that you subsidized the poor. Yet that's 
	just what SN is saying by suggesting that 
	because Tree 1 (T1) gave fungus (F) CO2 in 
	exchange for N and P, and then F gave Tree 
	2 (T2) some of that CO2, therefore T1 has 
	subsidized T2 -- a false conclusion.
	
	          exchange      subsidy
	             |             |
	  (TREE 1) <---> (FUNGUS) ---> (TREE 2)

	T1 gave x to F in exchange for y, therefore 
	T1 subsidized neither F nor T2. F, not T1,
	subsidizes T2. Because T1 does not subsidize 
	T2, the extrapolation presented by SN that 
	this study "challenges the current ecosystem 
	models, which assume that plants constantly 
	compete with one another for resources" is 
	simply NOT supported by the evidence. 

	(It should be noted that while fungi are 
	members of the kingdom Fungi, which is a 
	division of the kingdom Plantae, fungi are 
	not plants; so to claim that the plants 
	in the study subsidize each other is false.
	Mutualistic symbioses -- not an example of 
	the communist ethic -- between plants and
	fungi is already well-established. [5])

	The fact is that the evidence presented in 
	the study indicates only self-interest on 
	the part of all the organisms in the study.


	NAKED SELF-INTEREST RULES

	The only possible instance of a subsidy 
	and thus of "communism" to be found in the 
	study is the "gift" of CO2 by the fungi to 
	trees in need of CO2. In this way it could 
	be said that the fungi act like Robin Hood 
	-- taking from the rich to give to the poor. 
	But what's in it for the fungi?

	The answer seems obvious to me: I suspect 
	that the fungi feed weaker trees that grow 
	in the shade beneath larger sun-drenched 
	trees because this subsidy ensures that 
	trees will shade the ground more constantly 
	than they would without the subsidy, thereby 
	maintaining the dark, damp, and cool condi-
	tions that the fungi need to survive.

	If, due to lack of CO2, smaller trees did
	not exist under the dark canopy of large 
	trees, then when those large trees died -- 
	particularly if many died suddenly -- the 
	ground would be exposed to more sunlight 
	than if a new crop of smaller replacement 
	trees were always waiting under the canopy 
	to quickly fill the vacated space. Maintain-
	ing such an  "assembly line" of trees en-
	sures the constant shade the fungi need. 

	Maintaining a constant rotation of trees also 
	ensures a continuous supply of falling dead 
	trees, which the fungi consume. Which is what
	one of the researchers suggested, hypothesiz-
	ing that by feeding the weak, the fungus may
	be "planning for its next meal." [1]

	Through exchange with Tree 1 (T1), Fungus (F) 
	subsidizes Tree 2 (T2). When T1 dies, T2 is 
	ready to take the place of T1. F then subsid-
	izes T3 via exchange with T2 in preparation 
	for the death of T2, and so forth... sustain-
	ing a continuous life-support system for F:

	  (TREE 1) <---> (FUNGUS) ----> (TREE 2)
	 (T1 dies) ----> (FUNGUS) <---> (TREE 2)
	  (TREE 3) <---- (FUNGUS) <---> (TREE 2)
	  (TREE 3) <---> (FUNGUS) <---- (T2 dies)
	  (TREE 3) <---> (FUNGUS) ----> (TREE 4). . .

	(The fungi may feed firs more than birches 
	because firs provide not only more darkness, 
	but, being evergreens, provide it more con-
	stantly. The fungi might support a species, 
	such as the birch, that provides less of 
	what it needs simply because if the fungi 
	supported only one species of tree and a 
	disease wiped out all of that tree, the 
	fungi would have no trees and no shade.)

	It stands to reason, based upon the evidence, 
	that the system of egalitarian CO2 distribu-
	tion maintained by the fungi exists only to 
	sustain a continuos life-support system for
	the fungi.  There is no reason to believe 
	that the fungus or any organism in the study 
	acts out of selfless "communist" altruism.


	IN CONCLUSION

	Rather than fulfilling the romantic role 
	of a Robin Hood, the evidence suggests that 
	the fungi act like a farmer who maintains 
	an egalitarian distribution of resources 
	to his crops, such that if one field grows 
	more slowly, he gives it more water and 
	fertilizer from the common supply than he 
	gives to crops growing more quickly. In 
	this most likely scenario, the "gift" that 
	the fungi give to the weaker trees is no-
	thing but an act of naked self-interest,
	not altruism, on the part of the fungi.

	While the fungi do take from the rich and 
	give to the poor -- most likely out of self-
	interest -- the study uncovers no evidence 
	of selfless subsidy, no evidence of altruism, 
	and therefore no evidence of arboreal com-
	munism. Furthermore, the SN extrapolation 
	that the study "challenges the current eco-
	system models,  which assume that plants 
	constantly compete with one another for 
	resources," is not supported by the evi-
	dence in the study. Apart from my disagree-
	ment with the SN extrapolations, I still 
	think SN is an excellent publication.

What about David Cope's EMI system?
(see http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/home)
It is probably best described as computer assisted composition, but
it is not unlikely that it could fool at least some people at a 
"musical Turing test".

Well, this does come up from time to time. The direction of discussion
seems to drift on this list, sometimes turning esoteric, sometimes
becoming very down-to-earth. Right now it is fairly esoteric. But 
if you are interested in the practical questions (and many of us are,
despite our philosophical debates), feel free to post comments or
ideas to start new threads on the subject. 

Personally I'm working on human memory systems, trying to learn how
they work and can be enhanced. Tomorrow I'm going to hold a seminar
in my research group about memory modulating chemicals, I hope to
be able to post some useful results here sooner or later.

Since you didn't know about the essay, you were original in your own
thinking, although your conclusion was not original (or rather, partially
original - the essay doesn't deal with selling copies of parts of our
minds).

Huh? Why would they not be useful to me? If I decide I'm bored with the
immense fantasy VR world I inhabit and want (say) a tropical forest world
instead, I would definitely have a use for a VR world. And if I want to
build a private Game of Life universe in a jupiter brain, I would need
physical access and the necessary skills (which does not need to be 
copied, I might just as well hire somebody) to do it.

Judging from the standards they come up with, no thanks. Self mutilation

But how well do they deal with construction (composition?).  In English,
it takes a simple set of prefix and suffix additions to get from
"establish" to "antidisestablishmentarianism" -- how does Chinese handle
such things?

I find it an exceptional advantage to be able to call across the country
or across the ocean and talk to people and understand them.  People today
having a hard time with Shakespeare and Chaucer is more an issue of
general illiteracy and lack of the Chinese reverence for the ancestors
than of phonetic drift.

As I understand it, each logograph in Chinese is a completely separate
word.  How many of them are there?  I seem to recall a number around
40,000.  English has about 350,000 words.  Consequently, many things
can be said in fewer words in English than in other languages, offsetting
the "fewer penstrokes per Chinese word" that you mention.

I might be able to to better with this given a lot more time and a
reasonable time of day -- I love language, and while I find it maddening,
I love English, so I hate to let this sort of thing go -- but I need both
to sleep and to get back to work.  I hope this at least adds to the
discussion.

Kennita

Hello,

On our last meeting ( Excedo ) we came across an
interesting subject.

Does an uploaded person keep "fighting" fore more space.
As in, add-ons of "memory blocks" for your ever expanding mind.
Or will there be a time, when enough is enough.
If not, will we have a War of the uploaded Brains for the
mater in the universe to convert into memory ?	

Greetings,

Berrie

This is likely individual; some people and beings may want to
grow forever, others may want to remain at a certain size.

[One interesting take on this problem is Charles Stross' _Scratch
Monkey_ (http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html)
where the Superbrights (>H AI) compete with the Ultrabrights (>>H AI)
for resources and most importantly, information input. I disagree
with his model, but it is an interesting (and somewhat bloody)
story about the relation between humans, transhumans and posthumans.]

Matter (or rather processing capacity) will likely be scarce
in the long run, since the "growers" will need it, and so does
the "small is beautiful" individuals who don't grow but reproduce 
(the "small is beautiful" individuals who don't reproduce will
form an ever shrinking subset of the population, and will not 
matter). So there will likely be competition, yes, but not
necessarily war. 

War is so wasteful, especially when the enemy could easily deny 
you the resources you want by having his nanoprocessors self-destruct 
if he is killed; you would have to rebuild them at a noticeable 
expense. On the other hand trade might be a very common way of
resolving the scaricity problem. It is of course possible to launch 
colonies near lightspead to get at the uncolonized frontier far
away, set up a "info hotel" and wait for the customers to arrive.

Once you have a fitness function you can do gradient ascent and add 
noise to avoid getting stuck on local maxima; in principle you could 
even do an exhaustive search. However, if this is to work for the 
average person with the superfast computer, as in my formulation of 
the problem, then we would need to find a way to formalize the 
success criteria. We must teach him to write a progam that evaluates 
whether a given evolved network is intelligent or not; because it 
would take too long if he were to do the evaluation manually. So how 
can we formalize a criterion for intelligence? (A given IQ test like 
the Raven Progessive Matricies wouldn't work in this case, since a 
network would evolve that would answer those particular questions in 
an ad hoc manner, but wouldn't generalize to other problems.)

Subject: Re: "Morality?" - Composite Reply
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org


On Oct. 2, 1997, I posted an item captioned, "Morality?" I
received a reply from Gary Lloyd, Greg Burch and Lee Daniel
Crocker. There is also a reply to Mr. Crocker's response by
Frederick Mann. I thank one and all for their interest, comments
and questions. I responded to Mr. Lloyd's reply and I have since
received another. Mr. Burch has also added considerably to his
contribution. All in all, the volume is rapidly increasing and
getting beyond quick handling. In light of the current
circumstance I have concluded that a singular composite response
focusing upon the central points and questions of the issue will
avoid unnecessary repetition and aid in communication. Of course,
if there is any specific question or point that anyone wishes me
to address, just say the word and it shall be done. 

What is clear to me is that I have failed to communicate my
conclusions and position on the concept, morality. Rather than
discuss and speculate about cause, I shall endeavor to remedy by
sharper focus on a few points.

As I see it, the issue and focal point is this: I see the
concept, morality, as definitively and inherently attached to the
illusory, but much believed concept, superior being; a concept of
many variations often far removed from formal religion. 
Consequently, the derivative concepts, inferior being,
subordination and rule are anti individual and inevitably
culminate in hostility and violent conflict.

On the other hand, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Burch, and no doubt many
others, see the concept, morality, as adaptable to the concept,
individualism, with resultant peaceful non coercion that the term
individualism implies. Thus, are we consciously in accord as to
end desired, but divided on the question of means. This is the
chasm I shall try to bridge.

Mr. Lloyd states:

>Morality is rooted in the objectively observable phenomenon of
>aggression/defense. It comes from the fact that humans, as
>volitional creatures, must necessarily choose to defend
>themselves against aggression, and decide that it is "right" to
>do so. The far less desirable alternative survival strategy is
>to subjugate themselves to aggressors, thus losing volition.

The statement assumes that an individual MUST choose a particular
end: the end, survival. This contradicts the natural element of
choice. 

In response to another post, Mr. Crocker addresses this current 
situation as well:

>That conclusion requires a premise you failed to state:
>that you desire to stay alive.  Those same descriptive
>premises, combined with the normative premise of wanting
>to die, would rationally lead you to conclude that you
>/should/ piss off a cop.  Without sneaking in the normative
>premise, there's no way to reach a normative conclusion.

As Mr. Crocker implies, the choice to live does not constitute a
"natural standard" . When one incorporates in his thinking the
fact that the choice to live is a subjective choice not an
objective mandate, one arrives at far different conclusions about
a lot of things. The idea of "life" as a "natural standard" may
seem innocent enough because most consciously choose to live, but
the premise denies the reality of individual choice and opens the
door to the limitless choosing of values for another or others.
If there is an "objective standard" of "life", it follows that
each and every value making up a philosophical life is likewise a
matter of "objective value" - or "ought to be." The concept,
morality, itself presumes to set an alleged natural standard, and
thus presumes to displace individual preference. This is the root
premise of subordination and rule. If peace and harmony is the
goal sought, this belief system is bad news. 

The general history of mankind, up to and including present day,
has be and is one of dissention, hostility, and violent conflict. 
Behind this effect are the actions that cause. Behind the actions
lie the beliefs that direct. These beliefs are for the most part
propagated and promoted by the use of language. If the beliefs
that underlie these hostile action are true, I see no possible
remedy. If these beliefs are false, i.e., do not conform to
objective reality, it follows that the language usage that
promotes and sustains these beliefs likewise does not conform to
objective reality. When one matches words to the real, a picture
emerges that is far different from the one painted by language
distortion. 

At the forefront of it all is the term, truth. We all claim to
search for truth and quite often claim to find it. Suppose,
however, there is some disagreement as to what is or is not
truth. Would we not need to know what truth is in itself that we
have a reference by which to decide? Absent such a common frame
of reference, what can the possible outcome be but confusion and
conflict?

Mr. Burch writes:

Isn't  truth quite simply an idea or belief that conforms to
objective reality?  The recourse to alleged "dual definitions" is
an indirect admission that "moral truth" (often referred to as
"spiritual truth") is in conflict with "metaphysical or logical
truth." In other words, fallacy.  At this juncture, I will not
pursue further, but suffice it to say until I see a second
objective reality, which is necessary to give the "second truth"
definitive meaning, I reject without equivocation the idea and
all that is attached to it.

Getting to the mission at hand, the "problem words" currently in
focus are: good, bad, (evil) moral,(good) immoral (evil). A
saturate teaching that one is subjected to from infancy on is the
idea of "the forces of good and evil."  This teaching sets "good
and evil" as objective and constant universal elements. This idea
is not only promoted in formal religion citing an omni god as the
"ultimate good", the idea is promoted to saturation by "community
values", "national interest", "values of society" and a host of
other "divine abstracts" reinforcing the emotional impression of
values existing independently of individual; values that express
or imply a superior being; values that individuals are programmed
to believe they "ought" to hold. As false as this whole scenario
is, it is usually a lock that binds the mind to "duty."

Mr. Burch writes:

Yes indeed, I do say there is no objective ought. Even on the
face of it, the idea of an objective ought is an obvious
contradiction. The word itself is opposed to IS as "ought" is
necessarily referenced to what is not.  Among other flaws, it
implies objective reality is alterable by subjective choice as
well as setting an obligation existing independently of
individual volition. In short, there is no "ought form is." 
There are often word games pretending otherwise, but none survive
"the ordeal of definition."

As for: >In this view, the ultimate possibility of moral choice
completely evaporates:< - Because it never was. Choice, yes.
"Moral choice", myth.

Mr. Burch's comment above assumes without question that values
are subject to determination as right or wrong. With all due
respect, I must question, that is, disagree.  The belief that a
value or values are subject to determination as right or wrong
comes from the idea of selecting the "proper and superior values"
inherent in the "superior beings."  In the real world of
individual and subjective value, the term value always asks the
question: value to whom for what purpose. Value is not something
existing independently of individual and inherent in a thing or
circumstance. To speak definitively of value is to say that
someone ATTRIBUTES value to a thing or circumstance, a set of
conditions as it were. If an individual attributes value to a
particular goal, desires a particular set of circumstances, how
can this valuation be subjected to the determination as right or
wrong? Can it be evaluated as means to itself? I cannot accept
the question as it stands because there is no definitive judgment
of one set of values being better than another because the
natural characteristic of attributing value is not subject to
validating or invalidating as right are wrong. This function
applies to means, not ends.

So, how is it that the illusory idea of "good or bad" values gets
to be a major part of the philosophical and social scene?
Perhaps, exploring "good and bad" will help answer the question.

Mr. Burch also writes:

>It seems you are saying that "good" and "bad" are simply "what I
>like" and "what I don't like".

That's exactly right; and I'm not talking just about me, but you
and everyone else as well. The terms, good and bad, are merely
expressive synonyms for *suited to personal purpose* and
*unsuited to personal purpose* respectively.  Let's see what
happens when we set aside popular notions and feelings and attach
the terms, good and bad, to human individual, the actual
objective reference. Human individual is the real is it not? If
so, then what else can stand as definitive reference to find the
actual meaning of symbols, good and bad?

Suppose there is a small wood fire going. Suppose you value
eating cooked food and are cooking your supper over this fire.
Suppose an individual comes along and dumps a big bucket of water
on the fire. It goes out. Do you say, good, or do you say bad? 
Since dumping the water and putting out the fire negates the
means to fulfill your purpose of cooking supper, you would call
the action bad, would you not?

Suppose there is a small wood fire going. The fire is close to
your house. The wind changes and the fire is about to ignite your
valued house and burn it down. Suppose an individual comes along
and dumps a big bucket of water on the fire and it goes out. Do
you say good, or do you say bad? Since dumping the water and
putting out the fire fulfilled your purpose of saving your valued
house, you would call the action good, would you not?

Same entities. Same actions. Same end result. - But a different
call as to whether good or bad, right? So what made the different
call? Your varied purpose, right?  Your value judgment of end
desired by which to evaluate the means as suited or unsuited to
current purpose, right? Isn't this always true whether were
talking about your varied end desires or the end desires of other
individuals? 

The foregoing utilizes real individual as reference and 
illustrates the DEFINITIVE (conforming to reality) application of
the terms, good and bad. How does one arrive at a constant
"objective morality" while incorporating the fact that the
definitive designation of good or bad is infinitely variable in
step with subjective individual purpose? 

All speak of the "moral good" etc. as "objective" and fixed. This
requires a constant and universal purpose. Thus one is obliged to
abandon individual as reference and rely on "God's will", or
other alleged source of a singular universal objective value.
Since morality is myth and exists only as a feeling, it is not
uncommon for conscious mind to reject the idea of a universal
superior being as source. Nevertheless, when we eliminate human
individual as reference for the concept, morality, what remains
except an expressed or implied superior being; indeed, what
psychological force does the concept, morality, have without
subordinating individual to an "external superior?"

Most believe (feel) that if one is not guided by a "moral code",
he is "evil incarnate" and given to all sorts of murder and
mayhem. As usual, this belief is exactly backward.  I am an
advocate and practitioner of individualism. My operational
premise is self ownership. This premise rejects initiation of
force and coercion in any and all forms, including governmental
systems. I hold this philosophy solely because I believe it is in
my best interest. I need no, and seek no other validation. 

If another individual values something I have and chooses to try
to gain it by theft, there is nothing to prevent me from
resisting for no other reason than his actions are not suited to
my purpose of keeping that which he covets. I do not call his
valuation or action "immoral" for the word is meaningless except
to imply a universal code of values that said individual and all
others "ought" to hold and practice. Nor do I   defer to any
imaginary superior being seeking sanction of "moral right" to
"justify" my defensive actions. Such thinking is admitted
subservience to a "higher authority". If one looks to "higher
authority" for the "moral right" to defend, cannot one just as
easily look to "higher authority" for the "moral right" to
command? This is the danger and destruction of the concept,
morality, and illusory objective value. Do I not describe the
"justification" for the horrors of  history and present
circumstance?

I am acutely aware of the nearly infinite psychological
resistance to the ideas expressed and implied herein. The
resistance is evidenced in the centuries of unquestioning
devotion and dedication to the concepts, god, government and
morality that have consistently failed to bring about  peace and
harmony. Indeed, a few simple definitions easily predict this
perpetual failure. Millions talking about government as if the
term symbolizes a volitional acting entity does not erase the
factual definition that government IS the initiation of force and
coercion. Neither faith nor language distortion for sake of self
delusion and  preferred self image will ever change this fact;
nor will all the believers in the world manage to change natural
law and cause an end result contrary to the means employed. 

As always, show me a flaw in my thinking and I will be grateful.
However, unsupported declaration of error will not suffice.

No.  Halving the size of a quantum bit does not improve its computation.
 Quantum computers will probably be most limited by the difficulty of
isolating them from any outside influences that could collapse their wave
functions.  It's a wholly different problem.  Generally very small
improvements will make very big differences, but even those very small
improvements seem very difficult.

Yes, quantum nanotech would be incredibly powerful.  But it's not imminent.
 Quantum computers can't yet multiply 3 by 5 to get 15.  We can't even make
one individual gear for a nanotech device.  If Moore's law hits the wall in
five more doublings, as he anticipates, neither quantum computing nor
nanotech will be available to bail us out, barring a miracle.

I recently read that BT Labs are predicting Quantum Computers for 2004, which
is a nice little power increase.  I also read that IBM are using
teleportation as a means for faster than light communcation.  The really
interesting thing is, this was all in a business computing magazine, so all
this has now officially gone mainstream.

Ever seen Corel Office for Java?  To be fair, it's still young and it's

IE 3.0 had the same 'feature,' but it could only download the information to

Germans build big compound words, but Chinese just string many words
(and small "particles") together.  The necessity to compound words is
a result of treating words as single-function nouns or verbs.  In
Chinese, one doesn't need separate words for the noun "tree" or the
verb "to tree" (whatever that might mean), or the adjective "treeish",
or the abstract quality of "treeness"; one simply places the word
"tree" in context and along with particles that mark its use.  Even
new nouns can be created by simple juxtaposition of old ones, as the
symbols "tree, flower" used together mean "vegetation".

Yes, the technology of the phone might have been different had our
language suffered as much phonetic diversity as the Chinese; perhaps
the telegraph would have been more useful, the symbol set much larger,
and would have been automated sooner.  Or maybe facsimile transmission
would have caught on earlier (it was invented early, it just didn't
catch on until the 80's, because voice had always been more practical).

Yes, that's a good point.  Chinese does use more words per thought
than English, so the writing advantage probably isn't that big.  It is
improved somewhat by the fact that Chinese is so horribly ambiguous.
While one needs many more words to express a thought accurately, they
generally don't bother.

Erm.. to have a society of thieves you would have to have 'rules of conduct'

I don't think processors are the most important development.  The combined
power of the global computer network triples every 10-12 months (I forget
who's law this is).  What we need is more networked computers per person, and
more persons (until the advent of real AI.)

I was looking from the perspective of the seller and not the buyer, and in a

would just think "I wan't a tropical rain forest" and there it is.  If I
wanted a tropical rain forest as envisioned by Anders Sandberg, I'll just

Sandberg in the world.  That's my idea of an upload economy.

Maybe you should be a self-regulating standard (that just gave me a really
really good idea)  in the Sun/Java sense.  Instead of "Jump to Java", you
could have "Skip to Sandberg"... maybe not.

The British Telecom labs web page has an interesting chart showing when
their "resident futurist" thinks various technologies will arise, at:

http://btlabs1.labs.bt.com/library/on-line/calendar/index.htm

I'll say this for the guy, he's not timid.  He must have about 300
different technological events laid out on a timeline spanning the
next few decades, spread over his 12 pages.  To me his dates generally
look early, but I'm not going to sit back and take potshots at them.
The sheer volume of predictions is impressive even if they don't turn
out to be too accurate.

P.S. Somehow I doubt that IBM is using teleportation as a means for
faster than light communication, mainstream reporting or not.

But our language *has* suffered as much phonetic diversity as Chinese.  It's
just that the dialects as close to ours as Mandarin is to Cantonese or Wu are
called Dutch, German, and Swiss-German.  Voice is more satisfying and faster,
especially if you have to signal ideograms; people just restrict their
calling to those who they can speak to.  That's no more onerous for a
Cantonese speaker than a Dutch one.

WHich is true...

However, it seems by the completeness of there site/predictions that
they 1) have a good idea about future tech and perhaps used some
methods to reach those conclusions. The various conclusions seem to
mutually consistent. Nano tech toys by 2010 seems a bit fast but who
knows..

Those disbelievers! They refuse to worship _The Only True God, The God
of Free Marketship_ [TM]. How dare they? How can anyone refuse to live
in a barbarian wild west society, where it's "eat or be eaten"? How can
anyone refuse to accept the fact that freedom is a invaluable good whose
existence does not need to be proven? How can anyone deny that, since
communism has failed, capitalism is immortal? How can anyone believe,
that, with the absence of governments, monopolies could form and gain
more power than they ever had before?

How can anyone deny the beauty and inner art of trade? How can anyone be
disgusted by the idea that personal property is holy and may be defended
with all means? How can anyone claim that our decisions are based on the
information we consume? How can anyone doubt that everyone has to earn a
living, and those who don't weren't able to and have to _die_? How can
anyone deny that this is derived from nature, that it is evolution? How
can anyone dare to speak against the words of the prophets with the holy
names "Smith" and "Friedman"? 

The answer: By thinking.

I think both Delmar England and John Clark have totally missed the point
of the first part of Greg's post.  That, or they're refusing to follow
his flexible use of "objective".  He acknowledged that there isn't some

presumed laws of physics.  He also said that such a result is not very
interesting.  Practically, most people do want to live; practically,
most people do want to live in societies; practically, most people who
live in societies do want those societies to work well; and so
observationally most people should follow certain rules in their
society.

This isn't "objective" in the sense of physics, or "objective" in the
sense of "Ayn Rand derived this from a tautology", but it is objective
instead of subjective in the sense that if you want certain things which
almost everyone does in fact want then you can't behave arbitrarily in
all aspects of your life, unless you're far more powerful than them.

Objectively, if you want to live then you should look both ways when crossing
a street.  Normally we leave off the if clause because nearly everyone
does want to live, or at least they don't want to die by being hit by a
random car.  And no one cares, except in esoteric philosophical
discussions like this one.

I'd like to note for the record that I used to side with Rich Artym,
arch-subjectivist, until I realized this was all much ado about nothing.

No, because morality only applies to beings which can (1) affect each
other and (2) communicate with each other.  And then the form of
morality depends on how they can affect each other.  Asteroids don't
communicate and sheep can't hurt wolves much.

Speaking of wolves, you're wrong.  We do see something like morality in
the non-human world, and wolves among each other are the canonical 
example.

There isn't an objective morality keeping a Power from using us as
feedstock.  But if there are multiple Powers, and they hang around each
other for a while, we can predict the range of their behaviors.  That's
objective morality.

At the risk of beating the greasy spot on the ground where the dead
horse used to be, show me some (thinking, that is).  All I've seen from
the left is emotional rants and sarcastic attacks like the above with
no substance.  Show me some numbers.  Show me someone who even
understands how to measure a result, or even cares about results instead
of motives.  I /have/ seen intelligent socialists; I am amazed by their
skill at ducking the real issues, straining at gnats, swallowing camels.
They are a joy to watch sometimes.  But I have yet to see one who is
as skilled at seeing reality as ey is at evading it.

You're right, I did miscount the T and CH as sounded separately when, in

Yep, true.

Someone (I think it was a Supreme Court Justice, but I'm not sure...) once
said "Most people think that they are thinking when they are merely
rearranging their prejudices."

Seems to me that both you and those you rail against qualify.

Let's try for an actual dialog, instead:

Erik, Is it your belief that monopolies are somehow different from The
State? What if they're *the same thing*? What if most monopolies stem from
a systematic violation of the Non-Aggression Principle? That would make
them evil, whether they call themselves the Federation of Slobbovian
States or FriendlyGigantoCorp... Wouldn't it?

The Non-Aggression Principle is concisely formulated as: 
"that no one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force  
against another human being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation."

What say you?

I would only add that all human beings are at birth totally dependent, which
necessitates a dominant/submissive relationship. As they mature, they become
relatively independent. Among independent peers, a morality of
non-aggression/non-submission (the primethic decision), is what emerges. 

Of course, then we become parents, and are torn between necessity and
morality. :-)

Anton, you know the rules about posting on an open list like this!

I think it's a fault to focus too much on Moores law. The funny thing is
that nobody AFAIK has ever meassured the actual performance of a
computer "system" instead of this focusing on the number of processor
gates.

How about in two years time when the new computer systems will be able
to edit video in full broadcast quality, without any extra hardware. In
two years more xDSL will probably be pretty common, so everybody will be
able to have their own tv station. Well in theory at least.
These things are not happening because of doubling in processor power,
but because of changes in existing technology.

The Internet would have happened on a Commodore 64, if that had been the
top level in computer sophistication possible.

I'm not saying that the effects of Moores law are not important but
technology consist of two parts: hardware and methods. (In Danish theres
a better way of putting it: Teknologi = Teknik + Metoder)
I think that generally there's far to much focus on the hardware side of
the equation.

The few people who replied seemed to think that it would not take long,
maybe even just a few days.  I am more skeptical.  When I try to think
through an actual, concrete plan, it is hard to know where to start.
Tell me what the first program you would write is, what you would expect
to learn from it, and where you would go from there.  How many lines of
code would the program be?  Do you have the knowledge now to write it,
or would you have to do research first?  How quickly could you write it?

Maybe you could get a copy of Thomas Ray's a-life program Tierra,
which lets various "program organisms" interact and reproduce under
certain rules.  You fire it up and tell it to stop when the average
organism size reaches some large value, with the program set up so
that normally small organisms will have a reproductive advantage.
Hopefully the only way a large organism could grow and spread would be
if were doing something smart.

Well, you'd probably end up with a real mess.  Zillions of programs, all
interacting in some messy ways, various extreme flavors of meta-parasitism.
It would likely be monstrously complex, and you'd have to study it for
years to understand what was going on.  There could even be human-level
intelligences in there, happily communicating in program fragments, while
you can't even see object boundaries (like looking at a fourier transform
of our world).

On the other hand we don't know if any particular artificial world is
even capable of evolving intelligence.  Tierra may be too simple to
allow complexity to evolve (too many predators, or too much chaos).
Some philosophers argue that our own world should be about as simple as
it can be such that it is still able to support intelligence.  I don't
give much weight to give this kind of reasoning, but it does weakly
suggest that simple toy worlds will not be able to do it, otherwise most
intelligent beings will live in such worlds.  (That's assuming that we don't
have ultra-simple rules buried in the quantum foam, which we just haven't
figured out yet.)

Nice set of strawmen you've got lined up there, Erik.  Your arguments
would be more effective if you actually engaged with your opponents
instead of merely taunting them.  Although most of your taunts are
rhetorical-question "refutations" of positions I'm unwilling to

the monopolies that actually exist in the world are mostly a result
of special government grants-of-privilege and laws forbidding
competition with these monopolies. For example, the European PTTs.
But you seem more interested in taunting than in arguing, so I'll
just stop there.

NOT accurate.  Some idiot at IBM started this rumor years ago with an ad in
Scientific American.  I suppose that now that we know how to do
sort-of-teleportation in the sense of transmitting all information about a
particle without transmitting the particle itself - formerly thought to be
impossible - the rumor has resurfaced.  I am NOT aware of ANY reports that
this effect operates instantaneously, although I suppose that's theoretically
possible (uses quantum-measurement stuff, and nobody knows when or how fast
that operates).

You lack imagination.  :)

Seriously, objective morality wouldn't be a force pervading the Universe for
Good, just an objective method of labeling events "good" or "evil".  Does the
existence of "objective cardinality" cause there to be more of things?

I very strongly agree.  Any person claiming that a given event has a given
objective ethical value is making a scientific claim, and must be able to
prove eir assertion by the rules of science.  The statement that objective
morality exists is analogous to the statement that objective reality exists;
it is a precondition for scientific scrutiny.  Guesses and speculations about
what the objective values are must meet the same standards as scientific speculation.

Suppose that objective cardinality exists.  If you went to an alternate

Even if objective humor doesn't exist, I still find laughter pleasurable, and
conscious pleasure is one a plausible candidate for objective good.  So you'd
also have to prove that pleasure was meaningless, as well as humor, before I
stopped laughing.  Even then, laughing may contribute to my mental health,
which contributes to my efficiency, so you'd also have to prove my work (the
Singularity) meaningless, and in order to do that you'd have to disprove
objective morality.

Just because you can't think of something doesn't mean it isn't there.  The
Earth orbited the Sun for centuries before anyone realized it was actually
moving in a straight line.  I can't think of any OBJECTIVE reason why anything
exists, but that doesn't keep me from having this wild, ungrounded faith in
objective reality.

Not at all; I've set a very high standard for anyone arrogant enough to claim
eir particular system of ethics is superior.  You should sympathize with this,
since you're always attacking those people.  My ethical imperatives are all
interim solutions and are presented as such.  Wouldn't the Universe be a much
nicer place if everyone else did the same?

Flaws in attacks on "objective morality" can usually be detected by
substituting "reality" for "morality".  The same religions attach the concept
of "objective reality" to God (or similar entity), first by stating that God
is objectively real, and second by stating that God created reality and has
absolute control over it.  This doesn't mean that the concept of "objective
reality" is indefeasibly predicated on the existence of God.

Likewise, religions state that their morality is objective and that God gets
to define objective morality.  This does not mean that objective morality
requires a God; it means that the religion in question thinks so.

The key fallacy is not the assumed existence of objective morality, but that
your particular morality is objective.

Science is the middle path between the harsh tyranny of unquestionable "truth"
and the useless undisprovability of "subjective" reality.  Science states that
there exists an objective reality, but we do not know what it is.  My ethical
system makes the same statement with respect to morality.

Absolute agreement over here.  Science is the art of not making excuses when

Any fanatic will claim that his views are objective fact.  That doesn't mean
we should throw out the concept of objective reality.  Just because objective
morality has been abused doesn't mean it isn't useful - we just need to be
careful, that's all.

May I paraphrase?

"Any 'rational' goal is simply a rational means to some other, not necessarily
justified goal.  Therefore, there are no 'inherently rational' goals.  All
goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from
value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."

This logic is absolutely irrefutable.
The problem is that it's wrong.
If anyone ever figures out why, their name will live forever.
Because the exact same logic applies here:

"All effects are the result of causes, which are themselves effects.  All
'real' things are the result of other real things, and reality cannot be
derived except from reality.  The objective reality of any statement,
therefore, is zero."

As far as I can tell, in our Universe - which is a very unintuitive place -
things seem to be set up so that derived qualities can appear from nowhere. 
Demonstrating that any X requires a previous X is not sufficient to
demonstrate that X does not exist.

Don't ask me why.  Don't give me elaborate logical refutations.  That's just
the way things are.  That's how the Universe works.  Anybody who doesn't like
it is as much in denial as Einstein refusing to believe in quantum physics
because "God does not play dice with the Universe".

I have now made the adjustment, and it now seems as reasonable that things
appear from nowhere, as it does that there is no objective space of
simultaneity, or that the chance of something happening is a complex number. 
I mean, why _shouldn't_ value appear from nowhere?  Huh?

"I know of no law of logic demanding that every event have a cause."

Ironically, that doesn't work either.  God created reality?  Who created God? 
God wants something?  What for?

Many religions make deeply flawed assertions about God and objective morality.
 The irony, of course, is that they can only be objectively false if we grant
that objective morality exists.

If you don't know the methods, you have no way of evaluating the accuracy of
their predictions save by waiting around.  That destroys the value of their
predictions.  How do you know it's anything other than wishful thinking?  Or
whether it's based on some silly numerology, like many apocalyptic
predictions?  Even straightforward extropolation is very dubious.

Moore's law isn't just an extrapolation; it also rests on the observation
that photographic etching processes don't change much in expense when the
resolution is increased.  Setup cost go up, but so far it's been possible to
increase the chip volume to make the per chip setup cost minimal.  This
theoretical basis for Moore's law increases my confidence in its reliability,
and also points out 2 big things which would probably break it: substantial
per chip setup costs and switching to a production basis other than
photographic etching. 

>Nano tech toys by 2010 seems a bit fast but who knows..

Given that after the better part of a decade we've yet to see any nanotech
mechanism, I'm not holding my breath.  Maybe we'll have a working nanogear by
then - I guess that would count as a toy.

NSPIC relates to a dimension of freedom unknown
to practically all freedom lovers and freedom
activists -- conservatives, libertarians,
objectivists, anarchists, neo-tech owners, etc.

A few days ago, John French sent me this:

Physically "divorcing" yourself from coercive
political systems I call the Economic Means to
Freedom.  That's not what this message is about.

This message is about *mental* and *intellectual*
"divorce" from coercive political systems.
This is the field of NSPIC -- the Neuro-Semantic
Political Illusion Complex.  NSPIC consists of
a combination of "mind-numbing abstractions" and
illusions that together keep coercive political
systems in place at the most basic level.

At the most fundamental level, most freedom
activists actually help keep coercive political
systems in place by reinforcing and spreading
the basic "mind-numbing abstractions" and
illusions on which the power of coercive
politicians and bureaucrats depends.

At the most basic level, many freedom activists,
in the words of L. Neil Smith, "play on the
other guy's field, by the other guy's rules,
or with the other guy's ball."

George Orwell penetrated just through the skin
of NSPIC -- the combination of "mind-numbing
abstractions" and illusions that keep political
systems in place -- in his classic '1984.'

Sy Leon, in 'None of the Above,' penetrated a
little deeper through the skin of NSPIC.

I don't know if Harry Browne, having written
the Introduction to 'None of the Above,' has
much of an inkling of NSPIC.  (Though, in
communicating to the masses, he has to talk
as if he knows nothing about NSPIC, in order
to be effective.)  The NSPIC "mind-numbing
abstractions" and illusions are at a deeper
level than all the "government myths" exposed
by Harry Browne in 'How I Found Freedom in an
Unfree World.'

Robert Ringer, in 'Restoring the American Dream,'
in Chapter 8 -- "Keeping It All in Place" --
penetrated deeply into NSPIC, but stoppped short
and didn't follow through.

No other freedom authors I know of seem to have
even an inkling of NSPIC -- the combination of
"mind-numbing abstractions" and illusions that
keep political systems in place.

Understanding and overcoming NSPIC will give
you an empowering perspective of yourself and
show you a "soft spot" or weakness of coercive
political systems you most likely have never
even suspected.

Mastering NSPIC will provide you with vastly
more powerful options for dealing with coercive
politicians and bureaucrats and their systems.
John French told us above to "change our whole
attitude."  In mastering NSPIC, you will be
amazed and delighted by how your attitude
changes for the better.

Michael Lorrey suggested:
I'd think that the easiest fix would be to start building chips in three
dimensions, as cubes.

Gregory Sullivan says:  
There is a recent multi-part interview with Gordon Moore at the Scientific
American site. In part three of the interview he talks about the
technologies that might allow the continuation of Moore's Law for a while
longer, e.g., EUV extreme ultraviolet, bigger wafers.  He also talks about
how it is easier to do multiple layers now which is relevant to partially
exploiting the third dimension. 

The URL for part three of the interview is:
http://www.sciam.com/interview/moore/092297moore3.html

Excerpt:

SA: How about adding more layers to the chips? 

GM: More layers are something we do now without much concern.  Going from
one to two was tough, two to three was difficult, but five to six--piece
of cake. A technology has come in there that is really amazing. This is
the idea of chemical-mechanical polishing of the top surface. The problem
used to be that as you went through more layers, the polishing got all
screwed up. You'd get mountains and valleys and undercut levels, and
things didn't work well.  Now between putting down every layer of
insulator and metal, we polish either the top of the metal or the top of
the insulator flat. So we're always working on a flat surface. And that
has really been a breakthrough technology in allowing multilayer
structures. 

SA: How exactly do you polish them? 

GM: We have a great big lapping machine with some goo on
there--chemical-mechanical, it's called. They use slurries that also react
somewhat chemically with the surface. It's not just grinding. But it gives
them a very flat surface. The end result is, we put five layers on top of
each other and then ask the design engineers, "Would you like another
layer of metal?"

SA: Do you think that trend will continue, that chips will get even
taller?

GM: I think it will, yes. I think that's one of the real levers we have to
work with.

What changes are those? Your full media bandwidth would not be possible
without the processor power capable of handling that fat a signal in
realtime. Moore's Law is used by industry to plan release of both
hardware and software technologies to match consumer price expectations
without taking a bath.

Oh granted, bloatware is the biggest drag on the technology right now in
terms of speed. However, the only way to chop it down without giving up
capability is to dump all the filters that make it compatible with older
data and file formats. This is why its always better to keep your fonts
packed away, and not load so many file conversion filters except those
you actually use, as well as minimize the number that you do use. If you
don't like that, tough, thats the price of omniscience.

Sorry, I thought a list of historical precedent would be sufficient
argument. Ok, maybe not. How about this: Can any socialist in the
audience please tell me why they think government spends money better
than private industry, when public debt must be given tax exempt status
in order to attract sufficient investment to purchase that debt, while
stocks in private corporations, the largest 40 of which have an average
annual growth rate twice that of the rate of return on public debt
instruments. If government was so much better, then Government bonds
would give a higher rate of return without tax exempt status.

I think the rate of return on investment is possibly the best yardstick
one can measure the relative performance of public vs. private sectors.

In terms of how well consumers are treated by product or service
providers, perhaps we can use yardsticks like: 

a) what is the relative accident rate in automobiles between the US and
former Soviet Union (in accidents/fatalities per vehicle)?
b) what is the relative rate of time it takes for an American utility
customer to get a new service hooked up, vs. the same service in the
former Soviet Union, China, or, say France or Italy ( western countries
that are relatively inundated with socialists and communists).
c) what is the relative rate of time it takes for a person in the US to
get regular dialysis treatement set up vs. socialist nations? For
surgery of any kind?

Some other questions to ask:

How many people have been shot and killed in their beds by hit squads
hired by the mom and pop store down the street (including New York City,
I'll be daring)?
How many by Governments?

how many corporations have imprisoned journalists? Governments?

How much do you pay for gasoline?

How much of your income are you graciously permitted to take home?

How much of your income is confiscated to fund a government retirement
fund for people retired right now, yet is not solvent enough to exist by
the time you retire?
How about your private retirement fund? Is it allowed to carry unfunded
liabilities?
Of the amount your parents have contributed to your public retirement
fund, how much time is that money expected to last at their expected
entitlement level?

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Unless we find a replacement for field effect transistors Moore's law will 
eventually come to an end, although IBM's recent technique of using copper 
instead of aluminum in a IC probably gave us an additional 5 or 10 years 
breathing room. Power dissipation in a FET can be a real problem, as is 
trying to interconnect billions of different transistors, even worse, when
the FET channel becomes very short quantum effects start to seriously degrade 
performance. We can't change the laws of physics so we need a way to turn 
Quantum Mechanics from an enemy to a friend.

Back in 1991 Craig Lent proposed we abandon transistors and capacitors, stop 
using voltages to encode information and start using individual electrons in 
a Quantum Cellular Automation (QCA). His idea was to have each cell of the 
automation be made of 4 quantum dots arranged in a square and have each cell
contain 2 extra electrons. The electrons repel each other so they will always 
try to get into quantum dots as far apart as possible, that is the dots at 
the diagonal of the square. There are only 2 stable states such a cell can 
be in:
	
  _____________                                              _____________
 |X           0|                                            |0           X|
 |             |                                            |             |
 |  STATE 0    |                                            |  STATE 1    |
 |             |                                            |             |
 |0___________X|                                            |X___________0|

 

There is no direct connection between the 4 quantum dots but the 2 extra 
electrons can move from dot to dot in a cell by quantum tunneling. 
The electrons can't tunnel to other cells in the automation (a small increase 
in distance means a huge decrease in the probability of successfully 
tunneling) but the electrons in each cell can still feel how the charge is 
distributed in a neighboring cell and will always stay as far apart as 
possible. For example if you have a long row of such cells and you change the 
first one to state 0 then that will change the second cell to state 0 and 
that will change the third cell to state 0 and so on all the way down the 
line. A signal sent in this way uses no current so almost no heat is 
generated.

Because a cellular automation interacts with adjacent cells you could 
intertwine several such "wires" to process information. Lent also designed 
but did not build a quantum cellular automation adder.

Six years ago not many were very impressed with Lent's idea because they felt 
the dots could never be made accurately enough and the slightest imperfection 
would let the 2 electrons leak away in about a nanosecond. In the August 15 
1997 issue of Science Lent and his associates report they have actually build
one cell of the automation. The cell operated just as Lent said it would, 
it can be in only 2 states and can stay in one state for many minutes and the 
electrons do not leak out.

The quantum dots in this prototype are huge, 8 microns across, so he had to 
keep it at cryogenic temperatures, but Lent says in the article "QCA 
architecture is scaleable to molecular levels and performance actually 
improves as the size of the device is decreased. [...] a molecular sized QCA 
would function at room temperature." Unlike transistors, the smaller these 
things get the better they work

In an editorial in the same issue of Science Terry Fountain of University 
College London call this new work "A new and promising possibility to shrink 
computer architecture [...] by factors as much as 50,000 compared to the 
smallest feasible transistor. [...] the remaining hurdles though daunting are
largely technical".

A noble goal to be sure, but by what method can you test this morality
for its correspondence to the objective standard?  I know how to
evaluate statements about reality: they must be meaningful, falsifiable
by observation, and must have wihstood many observations without such
a falsification.  The standard of judgment is simple: my senses.

How does one falsify a moral hypothesis?  How does one observe the
result of a moral experiment?  How can others replicate my experiment?

And be clear what I mean here: I do not wish to test an action; the
results of an action /are/ easily testable against the outcome I
desire.  I wish to test an hypothesis about which outcome I should
desire, independent of any action to achieve it.

Soviet/Chinese style state socialism is pretty well refuted, yes, as is
whatever Britain was doing before Thatcher.  Is the welfare state itself
discredited?  The US is doing well and Europe poorly at the moment, but
it wasn't so long ago that things were the other way around.  And
Europe's busy trying to shoehorn itself into a single currency, which
currently (because of Jacobs' arguments) doesn't strike me as the
brightest of ideas.  (Anyone know how Norway and Switzerland are
doing?  Especially Norway.)

And the stuff I was babbling about a few days ago was leftist anarchism,
which has a larger track record than market anarchism.  Between 1936 and
1939 much of Spain successfully went anarchist, becoming more productive
than before the war (although repudiating debts would help the
factories) and doing most of the fighting against the Fascists.  Whether
the new society would have been stable over time, or in peace, or as
innovative as the market, is unknowable.  And while the anarchists trumpeted
the difficulties they had to overcome I can't help thinking that being
caught up in a war of Good vs. Evil must help feelings of solidarity
and avoidance of the selfishness we feel would break the system without
the automatic restraint of private property. (And in my reading I did
run across various things I didn't like.)  Still it did work for a
while, and wasn't been observed to fail on its own merits, and involved
a lot more people than the Libertarian Party can claim.

Yes, market economies beat the hell out of anything else that's been
properly tried.  Not all conceivable alternatives have been tried,
however.  Particularly any variety of real anarchy other than the ones
which degenerate into warlordism or involve unusual circumstances or
entities (Internet, international law, fighting off Fascists and
Communists simultaneously.)

The definition you quote above was from a question by Mr. Butler; I
care now, because by quoting the definition itself out of context,
evading the question itself, and not even making any attempt to
argue with the definition, you have shown the level of intellectual
integrity I can expect from your future arguments and how seriously
I should take any future posts from you.

In case you missed it, Mr. Butler's question was:

Over 11 years ago I changed to a "caveman-type"
diet, eating only raw food, including a wide
range of raw meats.  At that time I also
started taking a range of supplements which
has expanded considerably over the years.

As a result I recovered fully from severe heart
disease and mild cancer, eliminated recurring
malaria from my system, recovered completely
from the early onset of arthritis, eliminated
chronic indigestion, lost about 60 lbs., and
lowered my heart rate from over 80 to 55-60.

I eat only two meals a day and fast on Sundays.
I gradually find myself spontaneously eating
less.  I don't eat anything between meals.

I usually play raquetball five mornings a week,
60-90 mins., and work out two or three times a
week in the gym.  On Sundays I usually power
hike up a 2,000 ft. mountain, and then run
down.

I have a sense that physiolgically, in some
respects, I'm now 20 years younger than I was
11 years ago -- my skin "snap-back" test seems
to confirm this.  Even among regular hikers,
few half my age can keep up with me.

I haven't spent a day ill in bed in over 11
years.  I no longer get even colds or flu.

Although I take some hormone releasers (not
as scientifically as I would like), my next
step is to have certain biomarkers regularly
tested and to embark upon scientific taking
of hormone releasers or hormone replacement.
Does anyone know of a doctor in Las Vegas
who pratices hormone releasing/replacement?

Michael: 

My point was intended to be that "those [Erik] rail[s] against" --
(_in the sense of _half-baked_ free-market/laissez-faire types and/or
malignant power brokers who talk the laissez-faire talk but don't walk the
walk_)

it's OK for _MY_ special interest to get a government price support--there

I'm sure you'd acknowledge that such... ...tapeworms... ...exist.

I didn't mean that anyone he was replying to in this particular thread was
so doing.

I apologize for my part in the misunderstanding.

Apologies if this appears on the list more than once--I'm still having
trouble with extropy.org...

Estacado:

In the past, I've asked you questions, sincerely, and you haven't deigned
to answer them.

I've also poked some fun at some material you hold dear. Oh well. It is
supposed to be impossible to insult someone who is sure of emself, but on
the other hand, a gentleman is supposed to be one who never gives offense
unintentionally. With the latter in mind:

If you find the prospect of rational discourse with me unpleasant because
of my making light of the Neo-Tech materials, I regret that. 

I hold people who have a handle on ultimate truth to a higher standard,
though, so I may still engage in (clearly marked) sarcasm. Any question or
statement I prefix with (po) is not intended sarcastically; please consider
it as objectively as you can, and reply in kind.

WARNING: If you can sort the sarcasm out and deal with it separately,
great! You'll have convinced me you have at least a low-level mastery of
the Neo-Tech materials. If you *can't*, I'll know you for what you are and
_so will everyone else who has studied Objectivism or Neo-Tech_. 

See, some of us have read the materials, mined them for value and *STILL*
don't fit the model of the people who wrote the Neo-Tech materials.
Mind-blowing, but true.

SO...

Estacado, I'm going to start fresh, and ask YOU, specifically, a few more
questions; and I am genuinely interested in your answers. At the risk of
being tedious, I'm going to number the questions. Please respond to as many
of the questions as you can, and include the number in your response.

If you reply intelligibly to them, in your own words, with something other
than a citation to a (_that_) web page, great. Otherwise, I'll assume
you're a Zon-bot and wave my *PLONK*er.

However, just this once...

At 11:00 PM 10/7/97 -0400, you wrote:

<sarcasm on>

   I am in awe of your sophisticated capacity for ratiocination and discourse.

<sarcasm off>

Umm, *I* just said so--for the purpose of discussion. Other people have
said it, too, but it doesn't much matter who said it... unless you believe
that the truth, falsehood or utility of a concept or definition depends on
who says it. 
(po 1) Is that what you believe? 
(po 2) If that is what you believe, how does that fit in with
Objectivism/objectivity? 
(po 3) If it is not what you believe, why did you ask? 
(po 4) Could it be that you are not interested in the truth, but merely in
winning an argument?
(po 5) Hmmm. That would be neocheating, wouldn't it? 

<sarcasm on>

   Of course, since it wasn't a quote from the Neo-Tech materials, it can't
be useful *or* True.

<sarcasm off>

<sarcasm on>

   "We"?

<sarcastic thread #1>

      Oh, I get it. Multiple personality. Very well.
      I'll need the names and personality outlines of all your parts 
      before I can craft an appropriate answer....

<sarcastic thread #2>

      Maybe you were in too much of a hurry to notice, but 
      I used a little thing that we call "direct address"--
      I started my post by calling Erik _by name_.

<end sarcastic threads #1, #2>

   ...OH! I get it! One of your parts IS NAMED ERIK!!!
   Sorry, I didn't know. OK, I'll speak really slow:

   DUUUHHH. It's an IDEA, ERIKSTACADO. 
   SOME of us find ideas to be WORTH DISCUSSING. 
   And, UHHHH, you know, like, uuuh, TH... 
   what's that word? THINKING about, yeah. Duuuh.

<sarcasm off>

Hmm. No reason at all why you, Estacado, should care. Especially since you
have shown some signs of being the kind of person I referred to in the part
of my post you didn't quote, to wit: people who think they are thinking
when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.

I'm not immune to that tendency myself. 
Since that's so, I'm not convinced you're a waste of time (yet).

(po 6) May I suggest that you relax, settle down, and actually have a
conversation or two?
(po 7) I'm game. Are you?

I enjoyed Greg's two substantial posts very much, and found myself largely
in agreement. I would go further though. Greg seems to suggest that
morality or values can only be objective (or rational) given a desire to
live in society. I am equally sure that certain virtues of character and
moral principles can be shown objectively correct or rationally defensible
even if you are living alone on a desert island. Here the minimal
assumption is that you want to live and to be happy. (If you don't want
anything then no morality can get a grip.) Given this trivial condition, we
can rationally derive virtues, values, and principles such as persistence,
patience, courage, reason, and alertness (for example). Under practically
any conditions you can imagine, these characteristics WILL increase your
chances of surviving and increasing your happiness.

As I have said before (in the debate with Rich Artym that Greg mentioned) I
prefer to speak of "rational values" rather than "objective morality". The
latter can be confused with an absolute morality. I take it that Eliezer is
suggesting that kind of view, though I regret that I haven't had the time
to study all the posts to be sure. An absolute morality does not refer the
actual conditions of life and to the nature of the living being. A rational
morality does. A rational morality starts from the minimal assumption that
a person wants to live, and to live successfully. Given those basic
assumptions (which allow the is-ought barrier to be bridged), certain
characteristics, principles, and values can be shown to work better than
others. That's the sense in which they are rational.

It does not follow that ALL values are rational. Only those that make a
real difference to survival and happiness count as moral values. Trivial
preference -- matters of taste -- generally are arbitrary. Of course
difficult questions arise over where to draw the line between moral values
and matters of taste. But the existence of twilight does not cast doubt on
the existence of night and day.

I suspect that there would be vastly less disagreement over morality if we
could eliminate other rationally indefensible ideas and beliefs, such as
those found in religions. We would still have differences of view in how
human psychology operates (affecting our views about what brings happiness)
and about social mechanisms, but many silly moral views would disappear.

No, I did not start my post with "Erik:".

However, I did so preface that part of my post which Estacado quotes.

"Externalism" (temporary label) is not a science, and will remain unscientific
- like all ethical systems - until an experimental method is invented. 
Externalism is not scientific, but it is loosely analogous to science.  In
most ethical systems, philosophical thought takes the place of
experimentation.  Thus they fail.  Philosophy isn't that powerful.  In my
version of Externalism, intelligence enhancement acts as an interim substitute
for experimentation.  Intelligence enhancement has the potential to be fully
as powerful as experimentation and perhaps more so.

But that isn't the reason.  The reason is that I'm too dumb to come up with an
experimental method, and I have to recurse on the problem of becoming smarter.

I realize that "thought without observation is as bad as observation without
thought".  I reply that "intelligence enhancement without experimentation is
as bad as experimentation without intelligence enhancement".  One can be an
Externalist and a scientist both.

Scientific technology is the key to enhancing intelligence.  Intelligence
enhancement is the key to inventing experiments.  Which method one should use
at a given time depends on whether experimentation or IA is easier; ideally,
one should use both.  In the domain of "ethics", with current technology, IA
is difficult but experimentation is impossible.

Norway is doing good, very good, but that is mainly due to the oil
price; they seem to be storing up on capital to run the wellfare state
in the future. A lot of swedes are getting envious at the norwegians. :-)

I don't know much about Switzerland, but there is an upcoming referendum
which may be interesting; it seems that there is a proposal to ban 
several forms of biotechnology. Of course, as an observer pointed out
in Nature, if it passes the sweiss biotech firms will move elsewhere...

 NOT accurate.  Some idiot at IBM started this rumor years ago with an ad in
 Scientific American.  I suppose that now that we know how to do
 sort-of-teleportation in the sense of transmitting all information about a
 particle without transmitting the particle itself - formerly thought to be
 impossible - the rumor has resurfaced.  I am NOT aware of ANY reports that
 this effect operates instantaneously, although I suppose that's
theoretically
 possible (uses quantum-measurement stuff, and nobody knows when or how fast
 that operates).

So it IS accurate.

Hello,

I can recall something like this from a TV show:

Instead of reading a text from left to right, you can read it
much faster when the words are presented on an empty
(white) screen in the center of the screen ! So every word
will be presented to you; one at the time in the middle of the screen, you
can focus on that point, and therefor you can read it faster then
"normal"

To check this: does anybody know of a program which I could feed
with docs, emails (plain text) that would convert it to this reading-style.
(pref. with keys to go back and forth, and adjustable speed).


Thanks for the help !

Greetings,

Berrie

You might try to do a Web search on "tachistoscope", "speed reading" or
"Renshaw" and see what turns up... OTOH, it ought to be a simple sort of
thing to program in Visual Basic with OLE. But I don't program in VB. 

Caveats: my suspicions are that if it's on a monitor screen, you are going
to be refresh-rate limited; then again, if you synchronize to the screen
refresh so there's no strobing "flicker", that'd be on the order of 3600
WPM; that might be enough faster than your baseline reading rate to be
worth it to you. I also seem to recall that the original tachistoscope work
slid a visible/illuminated text "window" around the page, so there might be
less depletion of retinal chemicals, depending on how much of the reading
take place away from the fovea. I also am aware that conventional "speed
reading" techniques include taking in entire phrases at a glance, which
might mean parsing at the phrase, rather than word, level. Another variable
is the *size* of the font used--this could be a big win compared to typical
font sizes which are almost always too low-resolution (a nominal 72 dpi and
10 pitch is only about 7x13 pixels), which reduces recognition and reading
speed compared with 300 dpi on paper.

But have fun... YMMV.

I am looking for substantiation of something I've heard that may turn out
to be a "hundred monkeys" fabrication. On the other hand, if true, I think
it may have a bearing on my research into history and moral philosophy.
Details available after I've done more homework...

The story goes that there are two cultures of killer whale, genetically
indistinguishable (i.e., one species) but with no cross-breeding evident:
the pelagic, ocean-roaming, husky-eating, kayak-tipping "wolf pack" variety
and the Puget-Sound-local, salmon-eating, laid-back "Shamu" variety.
Allegedly, they speak two *different "languages"*, too.

Can anyone here tell me how controversial this notion is among ethologists
and marine biologists?
Is it generally accepted? Is it thoroughly discredited? Who espoused it?;
who shot it full of holes?
Is it just an "urban legend"? I crave facts and cites. Tomorrow I'll start
digging in earnest--but tonight, I thought I'd cast my question to this
eclectic bunch...

Hmm, I guess there are commercial programs to do that, but I think
it would be a simple programming exercise to write one. 

I'm not 100% sure this is the ideal way of reading text, although it
is good training for learning to recognize whole words as units. The
next step is to learn how to read pairs of words together, until
you can take in whole lines of text at a glance. That is the secret
of speed reading: all the different methods and gimmicks are merely
ways of learning this.

Then even if you succeeded in your task all you would have done is provide 
an objective definition for the words "good" and "evil", but no reason why 
you should do good and avoid evil and thus no reason to favor one definition 
over another. Dreaming up objective definitions is no great trick, that's why 
I said "an" objective definition not "the" objective definition. For example, 
"good is white and bad is black", that's about as objective as you can get 
but because, as you say, "white" is not a force pervading the Universe there 
is no urgency in only doing white (or good) things in my daily life. 
               

       >Does the existence of "objective cardinality" cause there to be more         
       >of things?

               
Yes. You're talking about "things" so I must assume you're talking about 
finite numbers because there is no proof there is an infinite number of any 
thing. If two finite sets could be put into a one to one correspondence and 
yet one set have more members than another then logic would not work in this 
alternate universe and the phrase "more of things" becomes gibberish.
               

        >If you went to an alternate Universe where numbers did not exist,         
        >how would things be the slightest bit different?

               
But I couldn't go there because then there would have to be at least 2  
universes and 2 does not exist, the only thing that does is the null set.
               

      +>>Alternate conversation:

Quite correct, if you were to define "Objective Reality" in such a way that 
the neural events in my brain were not part of it then I would have no 
interest in "Objective Reality".
               

        >Just because you can't think of something [Objective Morality]         
        >doesn't mean it isn't there.  
               

That's certainly true, but in the case of objective morality I don't even 
want to try to look for it because I can't see any puzzle it could solve if I 
found it. Again, that doesn't prove such puzzles are nonexistent but there 
are plenty of very difficult problems that I already know for a fact to exist  
and life is short.

Your ideas about what is ethical and what is not are similar to my own  
(except for your belief that a crack neighborhood is as bad as the Holocaust),  
and yes, I think that if most people behaved as we do then the Universe would 
be a much nicer place, but other people have a different opinions and may not

Sorry I haven't any cites handy, but I've heard that several times from
reputable tertiary scientific sources (Nova, Discover, Scientific American,
that kind of thing).  I have always heard it presented as factual and
non-controversial.  The only controversial thing above would be the claim
that they speak two different *languages*.  Their vocalizations are
distinguishable, but few would claim they have language.

Yes.  Although mass/energy is conserved, information is not.
Values and knowledges are clearly more like information than
they are like mass/energy.  Although now we're hunkered down
next to Aristotle, staring the form vs. substance dichotomy in
the face again.  

I have to recommend Paul M. Churchland's essay on moral realism,
which is the last chapter of his book A NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL
PERSPECTIVE.

>From a game-theoretic point of view, one tentative morality that
I rather like is the imperative to seek out and engage in
positive-sum games, while avoiding zero-sum and negative-sum
games.  But even here there are metaphysical problems: is a
positive-sum game possible?  (I think so.)  What is it that
increases in the operation of a positive-sum game?

That imperative recast in biological terms is "Prefer symbiosis
to parasitism."  I suspect that the biological phenomena of
symbiosis and parasitism might be most clearly defined in terms
of game theory, but I haven't run across anyone who has done
this yet.  (I haven't been looking very hard yet either.)

Symbiosis is an instance of an ongoing positive-sum
game among a group of organisms or populations.

I thought as much.  The article said they were using entangled particles,
which AFAIK would only transmit the information.  However , I remember seeing
a report on a teleportation device IBM had created which had successfully
teleported a single photon (they used the entangled particles to find it's
location at one end, put a photon at the exact same location the other end
and then destroy the original photon.)

Dear Dan Clemmensen and other fellow Extropians:

As civilizatations advance their economic and political systems also
advance.
Technology and Science seem to advance at a far faster rate than our
social institutions however. This is understandable when one understands
the psychopathology of the creative act. 
Although the social sciences may seem unimportant to many technocrats the
ancillary information that they provide must be fully understood as part
of the gestalt.

Language is not thought; language communicates thought between parties who
share linguistic conventions.  Certain conventions, including pronouns and
syntactic gender, do not create sexism but _may_ reflect sexist
assumptions.  Syntactic gender doesn't really have much to do with
biological sex, as neuter German words like "Maedchen" and "Kind" (girl,
child) demonstrate; syntactic gender is a classification technique.  Other
languages in the world have genders based on animate versus inanimate;
physical descriptions like round, open, long, etc.; or no genders/word
classes at all.  In these other systems of syntactic gender, there is just
as much arbitrariness of gender assignment.  In various Iroquois languages
(Algonquin IRRC), some plants are animate, others classed as inanimate.

Back to sexism, Finnish and Hungarian, Ural-Altaic languages which do not
have syntactic gender (they have one set of pronouns for all people
--"s/he"), still make distinctions which reflect sexism.  Words for
professions, such as "teacher," are assumed to be masculine; a female
teacher is called a "teacher-woman," with the word for woman tacked on to
the word for teacher.

How will this relate to AIs?  I suspect some cultures and subcultures will
call them "he," others "she," others "it;" Finns will have to choose
whether to use their non-human set of pronouns or, as they do with house
pets, make them honorary humans; some cultures will just not have any
confusing language issues regarding AIs.

Here's a something for you to do, rather than knock the views of fellow list

Current thinking in linguistics is that grammar plays a fairly small role
in ways of thinking; the Sapir-Whorf hyp. doesn't have much credibility
anymore, except in a very weak version.  All languages can express any
thought which can be produced in another language, give the technical or
cultural understanding and vocabulary required.  Certain languages just
code certain concepts more efficiently than others.

We have topic-prominent sentences in English, too.  "Now, _fish_ I like!"
"Fish you're feeding us?"

Some languages (especially creoles such as the various Caribbean
languages, Swahili, und so weiter) rely entirely on intonation to indicate
a question (ie, a question that doesn't require a wh- word); there is no
change of word order.  All intonation languages allow this feature,
including English.  "You have a new car."  "You have a new car?"
I couldn't say how tone languages or pitch accent languages (like ancient
Greek or Sanskrit or modern Swedish or Japanese) handle this.  Anders?

Loan word use is a cultural trait, not a linguistic one in itself;
some use of loan words is inevitable when one language is in contact
with a number of other languages, but loans as extensive as we find in
English may represent a lack of linguistic chauvinism.  It is equally
possible to get by entirely without loan words, using only neologisms from
morphemes already found in the language in question.  I don't know offhand
if total neologism-ism has ever happened; I think it would require a
completely isolated, unified speech community.

English has more vowel distinctions than most languages.  Some languages,
such as the Caucasian languages (to which Georgian belongs) have only two
vowels, schwa and /a/; most of the world's languages have 5 or 6, like
Spanish.  English speakers who don't know French can't easily say "En peu"
because we don't make phonemic use of nasalized vowels like French does,
and we don't have any high rounded front vowels like in "peu."

As in my other post, Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Turkish... but sexist
language use reflects sexist meme-complexes; it is not encoded in minds by
the structure of language.  If a culture is not sexist, it won't use one
sex as the standard.

As for parts of speech, _all_ languages have nouns, verbs, and anaphor.
Other parts of speech are handled differently.

I'll have to take a look at this...

BTW, does anyone else on this list have much in the way of a linguistics
background?  General semantics seems fairly well known here (which I'll
bring up again in a few weeks as I have some serious reservations about
it), but as for academic linguistics...?

Language in general does not efficiently encode emotional states or
spatial/temporal relations.  Just for fun, ask someone to describe a
spiral staircase.  It seems impossible to do this in casual speech without
making a spiraling motion with the hands.

Language, as great as it is, is not a perfect communication technology.
We think lots of things we can't express in normal language; that's why we
also use mathematics, music, visual arts, body language...

A superior form of language, one which does all that modern human language
does as well as efficiently describes spatial/temporal relationships,
emotional states, etc., would necessitate an evolutionary change.  A
language which does not conform to Universal Grammar and the proposed,
concomitant Universal Semantics would _not_ be comprehensible to us right
now.

Consider apes who have been taught some sign language.  They can use
words, which is no mean achievment, but they cannot use syntax; it is a
system which they are cognitively unable to process.  Consequently while
a signing ape can understand a biologist signing "eat banana?", they are
incapable of understanding the difference between "You eat the banana" and
"The banana eats you" which is entirely a syntactic distinction.  This is
demonstrated by signing apes' strings of words, along the lines of "me eat
eat eat me eat me me eat".

The stages of child language acquisition give us an idea of the previous
evolutionary stages of human language.  First, single words: "cat" "doggy"
"milk" (actually this comes after non-linguistic babbling and then
babbling using the phonemes of the child's linguistic environment,
including hand gestures for babies around signing parents, but anyway.)
Then come two word utterences, at which point the child already
demonstrates a basic sensitivity to syntax.  Then comes the "telegraphic"
stage: "Kitty come table?" "We go home." "Look pretty bird!"  Both these
stages show a prefered word order (used something like 80-90% of the time,
even in languages with flexible word order like Russian).  The vocabulary
grows fairly steadily through these stages, slowly enough to keep a fairly
accurate count of the words the child uses.  THEN comes the explosion:
the child starts using full sentences and demonstrates a vocabulary too
large to be counted easily.

At each of these stages, children seem to be able to understand one degree
of complexity greater than they can produce.  This gives me the idea that
the next stage of linguistic evolution is something adult humans may be
able to understand but not employ themselves.

Hey, come to think of it, this is already the case.  I can understand
Shakespeare, but I seriously doubt I could produce language of the same
level.  Great writers encode thoughts more efficiently than can non-great
writers.

Pick your generalizations and your words for expressing them carefully, especially when you have little basis for stating such.  I knew what TANSTAAFL is, as do most of my peers, and we are all quite young.

Your statement in no way acquits you of your ignorance and inexperience.  You would be well served to react to learning experiences a little more graciously.

I'm not sure that this specification of an infinitely fast computer 
is logically consistent. Suppose we combine it with a 
present day PC (or a simulated PC on the infinitely fast computer). 
Input any Turing machine descriptionand a tape state to the PC. The 
PC then sends this info to the infinitely fast computer, which 
simulates the computation that the specified Turing machine performs 
if started on the specified tape state. If the Turing machie halts, 
the the infinitely fast computer stops and sends the messege "Halted" 
to the PC; if the Turing machine doesn't halt then the infinitely 
fast computer you specified continues to run indefinitely. So the 
combined system can then solve the halting problem in the following 
way: the PC starts the simulation on the infinitely fast computer, 
waits one second, and if it has got the messege "Halted" then it 
writes "Halts", and if it hasn't got the messege "Halted" then it 
writes "Doesn't halt".

Man, now I'm an old fart. At 29 I'm withering away rapidly. I've been
saying it since I was a teenager. Maybe the reason not many young people
say that is because they don't want to give their parents any crazy
ideas.... ;)

Actually, I was also basing my code on an older "sample1.slang" which had tabs
(or multiple spaces?) in front of every line.  Since I didn't notice that your
main2.c calls nextchar() before beginning the nexttoken() loop, the very first
character in the input file is missed.  My nexttoken() assumed that it would be
the only one with reason to call nextchar().  So, except for the first token,
my output is correct.  I'll be more careful to check for changes to the source

I spent six years in Seattle, and spent a good amount of time all over
Puget Sound. Orcas do not spend much time inside the Sound itself. THey
typically only venture in when the salmon are running(a couple months in
the late summer), to chase schools into small bays or entrapping
underwater features. I do know that each pod develops its own calls and
dialects, but there is still undestanding of some sort between pods, as
sound carries a long ways underwater, and they have to know where other
pods are to give each ohter wide berth. There is a species of dolphin
that has a similar color scheme as orcas, but is smaller. THis may be
the source of the confusion.

Nicholas Bostrom and Hal Finney ask about methods for creating
intelligent/superintelligent entities by using extremely powerful
computers. 

There is an area of computer science that deals with these issues, at
least in part, called Computational Learning Theory. Below is a
description by researcher John Case:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/colt.html

Computational Learning Theory (COLT) is a branch of theoretical computer
science which mathematically studies the power of computer programs to
learn (algorithmic) rules for predicting things such as membership in a
concept or, as in the first example above, rules for how to generate a
sequence.

Besides the intrinsic scientific and philosophical interest, the expected
primary applications of COLT are to construction of intelligent
technology, especially technology which learns, and to cognitive
psychology, including understanding human language acquisition (brief
postscript bibliography available) and scientific inductive inference
(brief postscript bibliography available). COLT seeks to provide a
conceptual, mathematical infrastructure for these applied and basic areas.

If you want to bootstrap a system using the "raw" input generated by
cameras and microphones then I do not think the results in this area are
currently robust and complete enough, however, they may point the way.

On 9/26/96, or thereabouts, someone on a literature list said

>>  `imagine curling up on a sandy beach with a laptop, browsing through a

and someone else commented:

So I speculated cautiously:

A little over a year later, in yesterday's *Australian* newspaper (8 Oct
97, buried on p. 7 where all the important news tends to be exiled), Nick
Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab was reported as announcing the arrival,
within a year to 18 months, of a book format using a kind of smart paper.  

It `involves embedding microscopic balls - about one-tenth of an inch in
diameter [sic] - in a coating on the top of each page.  One half of each
ball is... black and the other white.'

I assume that these `microscopic' yet `1/10th inch' spheres are at most
really 1/100th of an inch or smaller, of the order of an up-market dot
matrix element.

These pixels can be rotated by an adroit electric charge, impressed
directly by a printer or via `a transparent grid [of] electronic circuitry
overlaid on the paper'.  That paper would be indefinitely reusable.  Text
downloads would arrive from the net.  Morning newspapers would be
downloaded at night, and the paper recyled at the end of the day.  Book
versions might `have a plug in the spine or back' allowing porting
(presumably on a pay-per-access basis from the Web, or maybe from revamped
bookstores).

Not quite as dazzlingly futuristic as my prediction of last year, but
pretty damned nifty.  And set to change the entire process of traditional
bookselling in very much less than 15 years.  Yippee - I think.   (Anyone
got any more details on this development?)

I follow, but don't accept, because I do not see objective reality flexing
in sync with the *"flexible use of "objective"*, which is necessary for the
language usage to conform to reality. There is language usage that describes
reality; then again, there is language usage that presumes to create it.
Although not necessarily  by conscious intent, this practice is widespread
and usually accepted without question. Given my conclusions and beliefs
regarding language usage, I'm obliged to question. (Details can be found at
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/7764  ("The Anatomy Of Language")
(You may also wish to see "The Principles Of Epistemology" which is the
basis for "The Anatomy Of Language.")

Mr. Yudkowsky, I thank you for the response and bringing focus upon
important elements of the discussion . However, I could not help but notice
that you did not addresss the fire and water illustration. This is central
to the issue as it identifies the reference for the meaning of the terms,
good and bad. As pointed out, the question of reference of individual or non
individual casts the issue of "morality" into two entirely different
perspectives. I hope you will provide me with your conclusions and viewpoint
of the illustration and its implications.

Right, but that's not the end of it. There are many who reject in detail,

I didn't say it is. I said it is predicated upon the idea of a superior
being not necessarily only the "god" of formal religion. The focal question
is as you have indirectly indicated is whether the concept, morality, has
any definitive basis in ANYTHING existing independently of human individual.
The fire\water example illustrates the conclusion that it does not.

I hate to get into a dissertation on language, but I feel obliged to
explain, at least briefly, why I don't accept some of your language usage.
We have a circumstance of immutable natual laws that are not influenced by
mind. Let's call this condition, circumstance, whatever, objective reality.
A lot of what you say appears to agree with this conclusion and definition.
An actual definition ALWAYS differentiates. So, although mind itself is an
objective phenomenon, the characteristic of volition, choice, personal
preference, etc, is differentiated from objective by the term, subjective.
In short, definitively, the term, objective, means that which exists
independently of mind, and therefore, is not dismised nor altered by mind,
i.e., by wishes, hopes, beliefs, nor personal preferences. In contrast,
subjective, means that which is dependent upon mind, which is derived from
individual mind, would not exist except for mind. I find this describes,
defines and differiantiates objective from subjective and provides a
reference upon which to make determinations of objective or subjective. 

While original invention or selection of a specific symbol to represent a
specific aspect of reality is arbitrary, if the use of such a specific
symbol is to represent a specific aspect of reality in a true and conforming
fashion, must it not do so consistently lest we lose its reference on which
its definitive meaning depends?  The key and operative term here is
DIFFERENTIATE. That's really the reason there's more than one word in a
language system isn't it. Language usage absent differentiation is mentally
and linguistically the melding of different aspects of mind and matter and
abandonment of definition and connection to reality. Quite often, it is the
melding of subjective and objective without awareness and calling the end
result "objective truth."

In focus are the terms, objective and subjective with definitive meanings
set forth above. From the definitions, it follows that objective must be
something that mind may discover, but does't not create. In formal religion,
the alleged discovery of "God" fits the criteria of "objective morality",
but is negated because the alleged discovery is myth, i.e., a mental
invention thought to be discovery. Through many and varied forms, this is
really the basis for all claims of "objective morality", though the false
nature of such claimed discoveries is not always as highly visible as the
claim of divinity. Still the motivation, epistemology and psychology are
fundamentally the same.

Most consciously and emotionally equate the term, objective, with
scientific, true, valid, etc. Combine this with the general underlying
conditioning toward subservience and consequent feeling of need to "validate
by reality" one's personal choices, and presto, the term, objective, is
called in to do "double duty". When convenient, the term, objective is
presented as meaning to exist independently of mind. This provides "absolute
credibility." As the wind shifts to personal values. the term, objective, is
often verbally and emotionally connected to individual mind and subjective
choice - from  which it is originally necessarily detached to provide the
"absolute credibility." To wit: Loss of differentiation and definition;
meaning the usage does not conform to objective reality; meaning not true.
A self-supporting illusion as it were that is dependent on non definition.
(To "save Christianity", Thomas Aquinas, "reconciled reason and faith." This
magic was accomplished by not defining, i.e,, by not connecting either term
to the objective reality. To my dismay, this practice has not changed over
the centuries and is much in evidence in this day.)

(To evaluate objectively is to determine what is AS IS independently of
one's personal valuations. Since no one is infallible, the everpresent
question is whether one does or does not succeed in such efforts. ) 

>Likewise, religions state that their morality is objective and that God gets

In formal religion, how many thousands of denomination labels exist implying
difference in beliefs. If we ignore the facade variations and go to the
directive radical of each, what do we find?  They're all the same! The
common denominator, regardless of label and claims of difference, is the
subordination of human individual to an expressed and\or implied superior
being. This is the actual definition of religion, per se. By reference to
this actual definition, does it not logically follow that any belief system
that expresses or implies a human individual as subordinated property of a
non human superior being is no less religion than the formal variety? (Its
not the subjective label on a bottle of lethal poison that will kill you.
Its the objective content. - And you're no less dead if the label reads
"Health Elixer").

What of the phrases, "values of society", "public welfare", "national
interest", "government does", as only four of a horrendously long list of
concepts that express and\or imply the subordination of individual to a
superior being? Separation of church and state?  Quite a joke.  How does
"state" exist except by thought and action treating "State" as a volitional,
valuing, acting, supreme god to which each and every individual is subordinated?

Like formal religion, governmental systems come under a wide assortment of
labels implying a fundamental difference which doesn't exist. To be sure,
there are surface differences in political form, and method of
implementation, but at the nitty gritty definitive radical level,
"government" is simply a synonymn for initiation of force and coercion. The
initiation of force and coercion may be politicized,organized, centralized,
and canonized, but the subjective labels and arbitrary claims do not erase
the root meaning of the term, nor the destruction that is certain to be
derived from the practice. One of the points that I'm trying to make here is
that when I say the concept, objective morality, depends on the concept,
superior being, I am not saying that it will be highly visible, nor
recognized by most, nor admitted for it may not be of a conscious
designation. However, if we eliminate human individual as the basis for
"objective morality", what logically remains except a volitional, valuing
superior being?" To be more precise, what remains is a 'feeling' that
something superior to individual exists. Do we not need an external
"something" volitional thing to create an "objective morality?"

The latter claim does not come about EXCEPT by the initial fallacy,
objective morality. (And I don't claim "objective morality", or any other
variant of the illusion.)

The first statement presumes to grasp objective reality as a whole in
contradiction of a mind's requirement for limitation and difference; so, of
course, "we do not know what it is", for none can grasp infinity. As for
claiming to know that "morality" exists, but not knowing what it is, this
seems to indicate that the alleged "objective morality" is not derived from
an explainable differentiated aspects of an objective reality, but rather a
feeling whose origin and cause in not necessarily derived from any fact at all.

I don't mind paraphrasing IF it stays with the program. I'm afraid your's

concept, goal. This is neither expressed nor implied in my assertions.

"Natural paradox" is a euphemism for contradiction denied. The dilemma in
focus is of your own creating. 

By volitional nature, an individual seeks goals, period. This talk about
rational and irrational is just subjective value judgment stuff thrown in
with the belief and pretense that the call is made from objective criteria.

>All
>goals are the result of other goals, and value cannot be derived except from
>value.  The objective value of any goal, therefore, is zero."
>
Aside from the contradiction, objective value,  I see a lot of goals here,
but no means. Combine this omission with the fallacy, objective value, and
its little wonder you find the problem unresolvable.  Fact does not serve to
validate fiction.  Once again, definition, comes to the rescue.

First question, what is a goal? If an actual definition conforms to
objective reality, it logically follows that an actual definition is also
100% consistent in time and application. So what fits to define the term
goal? How about: A goal is a desire to exchange one set of circumstances for
a different set of circumstances. Will that get it?

Every day and all day, you and every conscious functioning individual
continually pursue and achieve goals. This is not always of a consciouss
nature, but it is no less pursuit of and achieving goals. It is only when
focus is required that one is inclined to name a goal. What set of
circustances you name as a goal is arbitrary. The means to achieve it are
not. Suppose you desire to quench your thirst. Possible means is you getting
a drink of water by your own direct efforts, or having someone bring it to
you. While there is no objective right or wrong regarding your choice to
quench your thirst, there are objective requirements to achieve this end.
They are called means.

Suppose you desire to live. Since you are already alive, this is not a goal.
Means are what you seek to sustain the value of life held. Again, there is
no right or wrong regarding your choice to value life, but there are
objective requirements to sustain the value held. Goals do not turn into
other goals, nor does means turn into goals. There is cause and effect, but
the concept, goal, is a matter of personal preference and arbitrariry
designation as to what set of circumstances you wish to come about. Whatever
the objective circumstance or potential objective circumstance, attributing
value is still and always a matter of subjective preference not subject to
proof or disproof as right or wrong. 
To put it another way, to attribute value to a real or potential objective
circumstance does not make the objective circumstance an "objective value."
It is still an objective circumstance whether you value it or not. It has no
value or purpose in itself. If it did, the value and purpose would still
exist if there were no one on earth. The objective circumstance is objective
(existing independently of mind). Your attributing value to it is subjective
(dependent upon mind). Clear?

In literally every claim of "objective value" I have encountered apart from
the formal religion variety which openly claims "God" as "objective value"
cause, the claimant manages to bring in a personal value and pretend that it
is objective discovery. Some, like Rand, go to great lengths to "prove" this
discovery. The "ought from is" fantasy. Others just toss it in without so
much as a by your leave. Once the personal value is enthroned, the focus
shifts to means to achieve it. The problem is, those that insert their
personal prefernce and call it objective make no distinction between ends
and means, the former being a matter of subjective choice; the latter being
a matter of objective criteria. Contrary to much popular language usage,
ends and means are not the same. The former is ALWAYS subjective. The latter
is ALWAYS objective.

Exactly, and that's why I specified "the" objective definition rather than
"an" objective definition.  There are many objective definitions of reality,
but only one of them is right.

I'm sorry, explain this to me again.  You're saying that the existence of

By a similar token, you can't visit another Universe where External morality
is absent, because this would be a logical fallacy - assuming that External
morality exists here, that is.

We now think (although we're not really sure) that Fermat's Last Theorem is
true.  You can't say:  "But suppose we visited another Universe where FLT is
false, how would things be the slightest bit different?"  Admittedly, FLT
doesn't seem like a major underpinning of the laws of physics - but you can't
negate FLT without blowing away the math that does describe/underpin the laws
of physics.

Before Andrew J. Wiles, we didn't know whether FLT was true, but we knew that
if it was true you couldn't visit a Universe where it was false, and if it was
false you couldn't visit a Universe where it was true - not without things
being drastically different, at least.  I am making an analogous statement
with respect to External morality.

Nice bait-and-switch, but you should know better than to try changing
definitions on me.  Just because "Objective Reality" isn't defined as what you
believe, doesn't mean that what you believe isn't a *part*, a *subset* of
Objective Reality.  So I repeat:  If I define Objective Reality so that your
neurons don't define OR but are merely part of it, does this mean OR has no
interest to you?  If I say that your goals don't define External morality but
are merely a part of it, does this mean EM has no interest to you?

I agree that life is short; that's why Singularitarian Externalism holds that
we should attempt to enhance intelligence instead of trying to solve EM - make
do with interim solutions.

If you can't see what puzzle we're trying to solve, it's because you refuse to
acknowledge the possibility that the value of a goal is part of objective
reality.  As long as you're willing to admit the possibility, then the puzzle
is:  "Are the values of goals part of objective reality, and if so, what are they?"

Well, this wording comes from Neil Smith, and I happen to disagree
strongly with including the word "advocate"; but otherwise it's the

As for why we should care:  Maybe I think the world would be

Agreed.  One of the tragedies of our time is that Jewish opinion

Not at all.  But you omit one important element.  A chord is recognized
as a chord not only by convention, but because of inherent properties
of the sound it makes, and of our ears.  We don't need perfect pitch
to recognize when notes are played in ratio 4:5:6 (or approximately;
today's conventional tuning actually makes the 5 rather sharp).  A
4:5:6 chord is, by nature, more harmonious than a 21:26:31 chord,
and no convention can make it otherwise.  It does take some learning,
just as you may not like the taste of wine the first time you try it,
but later you learn to appreciate it and distinguish good wine from
bad (and sherry from champagne).

Similarly, "free market" implies a set of norms that I, like many
others for a thousand years, recognize as justice; not because some
committee of merchants said "This is what we'll call justice," but
because the application of such norms was found - by long informal
experience - to keep the peace better than other norms.

I'll bet you recognize such norms too, as they are applied to
interactions between two people.  For some reason when you consider
people by the millions, rather than by twos and threes, justice
magically becomes injustice, and vice versa.


By the way - "chord" to me means three notes, but a guitar has six
strings; when you play "A chord" on a guitar, are the notes A C# E
repeated in another octave?

If machine language instruction set is something like Tierra,
then I think it would be inevitable that person would introduce
bugs in program. Some of those bug would be able to spread to
whole computer and evolute to superintelligence. So it is probably
inevitable that he would do that in a week if he is only told to
program something.

Could he solve chess with that computer without introducing
superintelligence?

What about programming game of life and starting with empty world?
In the middle of world would be 3x3 units randomly mutated.
That would probably lead to superintelligence.
Initially it produces mostly wanderers and different static things.
What would be the next basic unit conceptually when they make 
collisions etc...?

>I've also poked some fun at some material you hold dear.<

   Actually, I don't hold Neo-Tech that dear. At the risk of sounding
arrogant I consider myself an exceptional thinker. In fact, I would
put myself in the same category with Nietzsche. Neo-Tech does
not have all the answers and niether do I. Having studied philosophical
systems from Taoism, to Objectivism, to Chaos Magic I can say
that Neo-Tech is that missing link that shows the incredible
power of human consciousness. All of these other paradigms
have extremely useful aspects for thinking and for action but without
the crucial identification of the difference between existence and
human consciousness(made clear only by reading from the very
first page to the very last page of _The Neo-Tech Discovery_)these
other paradigms become useless in your pursuit of eternal happiness.
   Your comment has provided me with a possible useful idea though.
As a Chaos ritual I think I will burn my copy of _The Neo-Tech Discovery_
tonight in a fiery blaze beneath the stars to destroy another "belief"
and enhance my critical thinking ability.
   Also(thanks again) this discussion has made me aware that these
debates are sucking time(and therefore "life") out of my day so this
will have to be my last post--I hope I answered your questions.
(I am anticipating you New Age physicists who believe that time
doesn't exist so as a bonus reading suggestion, if you act now, I
recommend _The End of Certainty_ by Ilya Prigogine!!! :) ).

I am so gd sick of the libertarian argument, pro and con.  It's the same
thing, and the same thing, and the same thing, over and over again.
Do we ever really accomplish anything by it?  Couldn't there be another
forum where it can be argued?  It sucks up so much time and energy.
Here on this list, we are supposed to be able to avoid these discussions
of the basics.  Yet this one issue, of whether coercion is necessary or
proper, comes up again and again.  I just delete the messages, and I don't
want to force my view on others, but can't we rededicate ourselves to the
principle of avoiding debate on this topic?

Interesting, although of course we all know that the infinitely fast
computer doesn't exist anyway.  The point of the thought experiment,
similar to your own, is to focus on the issue of how hard it would be
logically to come up with a method to create intelligence.

I seem to recall a claim that Eric Drexler had an idea for creating
synthetic intelligence by means of an evolution simulation.  You'd set
up a simulation of something similar to our own laws of physics, give
it initial conditions like the primordial earth, and just wait while
life and then intelligence evolve.  Supposedly he had calculated that
a practical quantity of nanocomputers could re-create the entire
evolution of life on earth in a reasonable amount of time.  Then maybe
you run it for a few more minutes and get super-human intelligence.

(Of course what would really happen is, once the AIs reach human level
intelligence, they'll stop getting smarter and instead create their own
nanotech simulations to evolve their own super-smart AIs.  But those
simulated AIs won't get beyond human level either, they start up a
simulation, etc., etc.)

I haven't been able to find the exact description of Drexler's idea,
but I think it was on this list sometime in the last few years.  Does
anybody remember this?

We're back to the question: is this a clubhouse or an outreach group?

If it is a clubhouse, you can never guarantee that someone won't try to
argue with that loud oafish drunk who crashed the party--unless you *EJECT*
the loud boor. Somebody has to function in the capacity of bouncer, or you
takes what you gets.

If it is an outreach group, people are supposed to help the clueless.

I too want the s/n level to increase. But wishing it won't make it so. If
it is the intention of the kind folks who keep this list going that anyone
may join, no one will be expelled for violating the ground rules, etc.,
then you get whatever/whoever shows up.

I admit to following up posts I probably shouldn't--but my purpose is to
hone skills and vent, not necessarily in that order. :) 

I see no general solution. Some places have a PLEDGE (BIX, at least in some
conferences)--it's a pre-emptive *PLONK* for talked-to-death topics--but it
still failed of automatic function--people were always reminding each other
about the PLEDGE. Might be worth a try.

I don't see any movement toward a tokens system, or tougher standards. I
don't see a solution that doesn't have potential negative consequences--a
Secret Masters of Extropy list would have to be secret, or it would run
some risk of being labeled exclusionary. Which it would be. But that's the
point--if "exclusionary" is a swear word, we're doomed.

I think we4 need a real answer from every participant and lurker on this list:

Clubhouse? Press 1 on your touchtone phone now...

EI members only? Subscription? What?

This is grotesque.  Spindler, like most other 10-year-old German children
at the end of the war, was obliged to join the Hitler Youth.  (When I was
10 years old, I was forced to attend Mass every Sunday by my pious Catholic
parents.  Is this supposed to stigmatise everything I do today, despite
three decades of resolute atheism?)  Spindler detests Naziism.  BTW, the
Australian Democrats are by no stretch of the imagination `a radical green
party'.  They were formed as an off-shoot of the conservative `Liberal'
(i.e. Tory) party, and are a small-business-oriented middle of the road
social democrat party, like most others contesting Australian elections.

I just purchased Rapid Reader yesterday and recieved it via email this
morning.  It's cheap (19.95) and can be had in a demo version for free
so you can try it out.  The web address is:

<http://www.stepware.com>

I would also recommend getting ahold of a book called "The Evelyn Wood 7
day Speed Reading and Learning Course" if you're serious about speed
reading.

With a combination of these two tools, I've been able to up my reading
speed to ~650 words per minute on the PC and ~550 on paper (average for
a college educated adult is about 200-250).  (The potential is much
higher than that if you're willing to put in the effort.)

What I would call instinctive ends are reserved for unreasoning animals and
infants until they reach the mental maturity to calculate in the abstract.
However,  answering your question does not require this differentiation
since all value is attributed by individual mind as opposed to discovered;
meaning that ends (value attributed) is still ALWAYS subjective.

Mr. Crocker wrote:

>>And be clear what I mean here: I do not wish to test an action; the

You responded:

I see your end desire stipulated and implicitly coupled with the wish that
Mr. Crocker attribute  value to the end you name.  What is missing is why he
should do so other than to please you. Where is recognition of Mr. Crocker's
choice in the matter? The reality is that Mr. Crocker does have a choice and
to not recognize it, whether it pleases you or not, is not dealing with AS
IS, but denial of AS IS, which is to say, denial of the existent, Mr.
Crocker. This is literally what every claim of discovered "objective value"
does. In other words, the concept, objective value, is an illusion and
inherently anti individual.

It is my personal preference that the terms, ought and should, be entirely
eliminated from the language. Getting rid of these non scientific terms
would no doubt aid in holding focus upon the reality of a thing or
situation. Having expressed this desire, I remain aware that my end chosen
is not the end desire of most. Consequently, I will continue to deal with
the real by exposing the fact that ought and should have no connection to
objective reality except as personal preference and subjective declarations.

Hello all,

A lot of you already helped me with several things.
I just want to say thanks ! 
Please inform me: is this considered as a "me too" reply
and therefor not wished for to post. ( in this case it's the first
and the last)
I mean, some of you may start to think I only ask for things
and are not contributing in anyway.

As a couple of people have pointed out, this was the subject of an
article in WIRED a few months ago.

A smart-paper book was also the key element in Neil Stephansons
wonderfull Nanopunk novel of a couple of years ago "The Diamond
Age" subtitled "Or a young ladies illustrated primer."

: 'Demonstration Killing' of JonBenet Ramsey last week -- prima facie a
:  clear case of authoritarian right-wing terrorism directed against the
:  child beauty pageants and their participants -- children and parents.

I was not able to discuss the case in overmuch detail before now, for 
several reasons.

    In the Italian 'Strategy of Tension', elements in the laughably-misnamed 
'Security Services' (who have always tended to cease to serve, while 
aspiring to rule -- "We know best, for your own good' sort of thing), 
organized massive and lethal provocations on both 'Left' (Brigate Rossi) 
_and_ Right (Stefano Delle Chiae and the Black Terrorists).

    See Stuart Christie's biagraphy of Delle Chiae, 'Portrait of a Black 
Terrorist.'   Stuart went on to edit 'Arguments and Facts International' 
during the Gorbachev period -- quite a coup for a British anarchist who 
made a good-faith attempt to blow up General Franco.  >:-}

    These incidents were aimed at "Intoxication" of the Italian populace, 
so that they would become frightened and insecure, and accept the 
abandonment of liberal democracy for authoritarian rule and 'crack-downs.'

    We had the same problem here in Britain, on a lesser scale: Brian 
Micklethwait actually _welcomed_ it, if it helped Thatcherites 'smash' the 
'enemy' (i.e. people who disagreed with Micklethwait about anything).  
"Power corrupts' indeed...

:      If you _really_ want to protect children from _real harm_, why not
:      campaign for radio alarms?

> Because it's not a prosecutor's job?
> Must *every* concerned person campaign on *every* front at once?

He could be very effective, arguing for _real_ child protection -- 
assuming he really wants to protect children, that is...

:    Here in the UK, we are steadily uncovering a quite hideous catalogue
:    of violent and forcible sexual abuses in official State-run
:    'childrens' homes', with the children all too often being used _for
:    years_ to 'service' the sadistic urges of rich and/or powerful
:    authoritarian people.
:
:    People rather like you, perhaps?  Who seek male or female prey to
:    torment and deride? (Ref: Eric Berne, MD., "The Little Fascist" in
:    "What Do You Say After You Say 'Hello'?").

> Tony, friend, you're acting like a crank.
> Can you point to any connection between this prosecutor
> and any "children's home"?

A crank converts reciprocation to rotation, as every fule kno.  >:-}

Oh, sure I can show a connection.  Parts of Washington State's 'child 
protection' industry has a horrifying reputation in Seattle and elsewhere 
in Washington State. The 'childrens' homes' get the children by taking 
them away from their parents.  Why do bank tobbers rob banks?  Because 
'that's where the money is.'  Think about it.


BTW: The current -- professional -- diagnosis of my mental state is:

     "Really nice person.

      Brilliantly intelligent.

      Perfectly sane.

      Under great stress.

      Needs more sleep.

      Experiences Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."


      I prefer that to 'acting like a crank', I'd guess.  >:-}

Not necessarily.  There are many ways to handle mosquitoes.  I generally

Absent a moderated list, I see no way the threads can be kept
100% sorted. Absent 100% self-discipline on the part of all list
members, including any newbie replying, nonlabeled threads are the
default. 

Not complaining, just assessing. 

Should we see if "BASIC" is a label that can be semi-automated? Shouldn't
take much more than an Eliza-class routine: <interrogative> + <element of
topic list> ==> BASIC label... 1/2 :) Arkuat could probably code it in an
afternoon. :) Making it work right might be a career... :) :)

I don't like wasting list space arguing with these folks, but I don't like
letting their assertions slip into the archives unchallenged either.  Perhaps
a good solution would be to revive the classifiers (BASIC, META, etc.) and
reserve one of them for these rehash discussions, so people can filter them
out easily.  We could use BASIC, or invent a new one.  A non-pejorative one
would be best, I suppose, although I'm mighty tempted to stamp REHASH on some
such of these things :-)

It's a clubhouse -- it's an outreach group -- it's two, two, two
lists in one!  :-)

Seriously, I think the most effective policy is "if you don't like it,
don't reply to it".  It also saves a _lot_ of time.  Even writing a
plonk message is a time-waster; what good does knowing you've plonked
someone do anyone, including the plonkee?  It may only encourage them.
To wit:  Memetic fitness is determined not by desirability, but by
propagability.  Like a TV commercial, you can dislike it all you want,
but it's done its job if you remember it (note my first line; apparently
Certs did its job).  As a matter of fact, if it's obnoxious enough that
you go around telling people how obnoxious it is, it's done even better
("Hi kids!... Bye kids!").

To stretch another analogy:  as I recall, an overactive immune response
to invaders can also be detrimental to an organism.

And another:  Let's be like a type of soil that undesirable seeds don't
grow in.  Think about it -- what nourishes ideas?  Attention.  Any kind
of attention. (analogy seque)  Like a child who's naughty because it
gets em negative attention when no positive attention is forthcoming.

Sigh.  Maybe I'm coming up with all these analogies because it's so
clear to me that "you are an (idiot, immoral bastard, inconsiderate
lout, etc.)" posts are counterproductive.  Man's email should exceed his
time, or what's a D key for?  I suppose I also hope that a broad-
spectrum vaccine will inoculate more list members.

Live long and prosper,
Kennita, who doesn't plonk anyone and still has time for Star Trek

So, on the basis of your objective definition you're able to put labels on 
all events, a tag consisting of the squiggles "good" or "evil" and presumably 
a number indicating the magnitude of each, but how could I find a direction 
to this axis?  Why should I do good and avoid evil rather than the reverse? 
Or for that matter, why not do things on a line perpendicular to your axis, 
or a line that intersects it by 32.587 degrees?  You were speaking of complex  
numbers, perhaps we need them to specify an event in moral space, next time  
my dog eats my newspaper perhaps I should scold him by saying 
"you're a 17 + 28i dog".

I say this because in your Oct 7 post you as much as admitted that your 
choice of a moral axes would always be arbitrary, you said:

 "objective morality wouldn't be a force pervading the Universe for Good,   
  just an objective method of labeling events "good" or "evil"."  
			   

	 >You're saying that the existence of numbers causes there to be more         
	 >objects?  Objective cardinality is a force pervading the Universe         
	 >which causes all numbers to increase?
			   

I said nothing about anything causing anything and I said nothing about 
numbers increasing. I did say that if there was a hypothetical universe in 
which the idea of number did not exist because it was somehow contradictory, 
then saying there were many things in that universe would be gibberish. 
I also remind you that you're the one who proposed such a example not me, 
so don't blame me if it's bizarre.

Fine, but that's not what you said, you talked about objective reality being  
defined in such a way that it was not the cause of the neural events in my  
brain, and I said that in that case what you call "objective reality" did not  
interest me.
			   

	>So I repeat:  If I define Objective Reality so that your neurons         
	>don't define OR but are merely part of it, 
			   

OK but that's no repeat, that's the first time you said it.
			   

	>does this mean OR has no interest to you?  


No, then it interests me because objective reality can change me and I can 
change it. Neither is true of "objective morality" and that's why it has  
nothing to do with me. 


	>If I say that your goals don't define External morality but are

Yes, it still does not interest me. All you have said in the above is that 
sometimes I do good things and sometimes I don't and there are some good 
things as well as bad I never do. I'm sure that if you worked at it you could  
dream up a definition of morality that fit the above specifications, but 
that's not nearly good enough. I want to know what's different about that 
definition rather than the infinite number of other possible ones, I want to  
know why I should follow its dictates and not others.  

Because only one objective morality is true.
What do you mean by true?
Only one you should follow.
Why should I follow only one?
Because only one is true. 
Why should I do what's true? 
Because it's good.
Why should I do what's good?
Because it's moral.

I can't find any message containing the words "fire" and "water" - except the

I don't see how this is relevant.  My thesis is that you have committed
logical errors of generalization, semantics, and causal analysis, to wit:

"Most (religious) supreme beings rely on an instantiation of 'objective
morality'; therefore the concept of 'objective morality' relies on a supreme being."

That is, you have generalized from the way religions do it to the way everyone
does it; you have confused the concept of objective morality with particular
moralities that claim to be objective, and you have assumed that because A
relies on B then B relies on A.

I agree that this is the focal question.  The answer is:  "Either it does or
it does not."  Since the behavior which results from acting on the possibility
is not destructive, I believe that I am justified in acting on the normalized
objective interim value of all goals.  Or in plain English, I do whatever I
feel probably has objective value, as long as this doesn't make me a lunatic.

I don't see how this confusion impinges on the present discussion, since
neither you nor I have committed that particular error.  There's "objective"
in the cognitive sense, and "objective" in the ontological sense.  I assert
that there exists an ontologically objective morality.  Having done so, it is
possible to apply cognitive objectivity to the evaluation of particular moral theories.

Insofar as we are all Extropians, I doubt that *anyone* here would flinch from
having the *ability* to apply objective cognitive reasoning to *anything*. 
The question is whether the cognitive concept, "ontologically objective
morality", contributes to cognitively objective morality.  I hold that the
cognitive concept of the ontological objectivity of X is a prerequisite for
the cognitively objective evaluation of statements about X.  Otherwise,
anybody can simply state eir opinion and refuse to debate it.

That doesn't make the slightest difference.  Formal religion is not
prerequisite to objective morality.  In order to demonstrate otherwise, you
must take my theory of objective morality and demonstrate a causal reliance
upon religion.

You are factually incorrect.  Many religions (such as Buddhism) do not rely on
the "subordination" of the believer to anything or anyone.

No.  Nothing may logically follow from a tautology except the tautology
itself.  I might admit that within your continuum of pure logic the statement
follows, but within this real world of Yudkowsky and Eric Watt Forste the
statement fails.  The "actual definition of religion" does not exist except as
a premise for argument.  Extensionally, most objects denoted as "religions"
share some properties such as worship, faith, and a theory of ethics which is
claimed to be objective truth.  Western religions also share the concept of a
supreme being.

I suggest you read up on the Constitutional Convention.  A state may exist as
a social compact between the rulers and the ruled - the theory the Founding
Fathers(*) started out with.  Or as sovereign power which has its sole source
in the people and is willingly delegated by them into a formal government - a
concept introduced by James Wilson that wound up as the base of the
Constitution.  There was a great deal of debate regarding how much power the
United States should have, whether it should be able to overrule the component
States, and even what the fundamental basis of government was.  In our modern
times, government is by thought and action treated like some huge, lumbering
beast.  The attitude you describe is not often seen.

So what?  Claims of God's existence do not come about EXCEPT by the initial

You object to this?  You don't think an objective reality exists?

My "objective morality" is not derived, period.  I hypothesize it.  I never
claimed to have proven it.  I simply observe that the known operating
principles of the Universe seem to allow for such things to happen, although
generally not in the way we expect.

I should likewise note that nobody has ever really proven that an "objective
reality" exists.  Descartes would seem to have proven that some form of
reality exists, but through the usage of entirely subjective reasoning. 
Insofar as this is the only evidence for the existence of reality, a
determined solipsist could argue that reality is most likely subjective.

And yet, science still works.

I threw in the term, 'rational', in quotes.  This denotes that the concept of
a 'rational' goal is being attacked.  Which you did.

Okay, so why *does* anything exist at all?  I'd really like to know.

I can't answer this fully without getting more technical than I wish to. 
Suffice it to say that we humans have a cognitive system for processing goals
and efforts, and that the value of an effort derives from the value of the
goal, and that efforts can be imported as goals when a sub-effort is needed. 
Humans also have certain primitive goals whose value is arbitrarily set by
evolution.  The goal-processing system is intertwined with the causal model of
reality, so we assign truth and falsity to value statements about goals. 
Since we assign truth and falsity, I ask whether such statements can be
objectively true or false.

The answer is yes; idealized AI versions of our cognitive processes (such as
"SHRDLU", "AM" and "EURISKO", and any program written in Prolog) obey
mathematical and Platonic laws while remaining faithful to our intuitions, and
thus a given cognitive evaluation of the value of a goal is "true" or "false"
depending on whether our mathematics are correct.  My question about the
existence of "objective morality" can be phrased as:  "Does there exist a
mathematically correct derivation of value for some goal, in a system where no
goals have initial value, and with no hypotheticals in the justification network?"

It may seem like a great leap from our questions about truth and falsity to
the assumption of objective truth or falsity.  No less a leap is made when our
enormously complex systems for processing the "truth" or "falsity" of an
opinion are compared to objective reality.

What's a desire?  Look, I'm always fiddling with things like the limbic system
(handles some emotions), or with AIs that have coded objects called "goals". 
When I talk about a "goal", I'm talking about either events in the human brain
or events in some computer, preferably the latter.

Yes, that's how the human brain handles it, rather roughly speaking.  But an
AI handles it differently.  All efforts and purposes are instantiations of the
computational object called a "goal".  Goals have subgoals, and the subgoals
have subgoals.  It's a goal hierarchy.  That's what I mean when I say that
"value" is a derived quantity.  Intuitively, all value has to come from
somewhere.  But your statement that it has to be a single goal, whose value is
validated by nonhuman superiority, is analogous to the statement that, since
reality must intuitively come from somewhere, there exists a "creation"
hierarchy, the apex of which is validated by moral superiority.  Both
statements contain a logical fallacy, to wit, refusing to answer the question.
 This does not obviate the existence of objective reality, although it should.
 By analogy, it does not obviate the existence of objective morality.

You are incorrect.  Where have I done so?  I have claimed that "objective
value" exists, although not that my values are objective.

Since the human mind is not capable of deducing or designing objective values,
it should come as no great surprise that all claimed instantiations of
"objective value" are false, at least in the sense of the claimed rational
justification being false.

Most claims of "objective reality" were false prior to the invention of science.

Just some cheering news from the world of neuroscience:

I got a preprint from Martin Ingvar about his experiments with
ampakines (chemicals which enhance the activation of the glutaminergic
AMPA channel). He and his co-workers did a double-blind study on
their effect on healthy volunteers. It turned out that they improved
visual associative memory, odor associative memory, acquisition of
a visuospatial maze and memory for the location and identity of
playing cards. The drug did not affect non-memory cognition such
as alertness, motor performance and visual recognition. 

This is good news. First, it shows that there are cognition enhancing
chemicals that work in healthy young people (there are far too few
studies supporting this). Second, it suggests a whole new category
of nootropic compounds. Third, while the improvements of memory were
not that dramatic (10-20% on most tests) they are likely to be much
better for older people or people with memory problems. Fourth, the
results gives us new insights into how memory works, which will be
important for further development. 

So, no genius-pills on the horizon, but yet another useful tool
for tuning up the brain.

From: John K Clark <johnkc@well.com>
Subject: Drexler's Timeline


I was only made aware of Drexler's thoughts on this subject second hand, 
through  Carl Feynman , you're receiving it third hand from me,  
so if I say anything stupid in this post it is my fault, not Drexler's.

The idea that the Singularity could come in less that 20 years
makes me weak in the knees, just like everybody else, and I'm
not sure I really believe  it could come that soon, but Drexler
didn't just pull this amazingly short  timeline out of a hat, it's based 
on calculations he made, even if they are informal and unpublished. 

Seeing no reason current trends could not be extrapolated and
using  his considerable knowledge of the field, he expects to
see the first  assembler able to reproduce itself sometime in
the first 2 decades of the next  century. A full nanotech
computer could be made almost immediately after that, because
the design work will already be finished by then, as some people
are working  on that already. He figures that once we have nano
computers it will only  take a couple of years to develop
superhuman artificial intelligence. At this point we have a mind
(or minds) far more intelligent than you or me, and one that
operates a billion times faster to boot.  A few hours of that
and the universe will never be the same again.

I can already hear the howls of protest. Even if you have the
hardware, programming a nano computer to do anything useful
would be a  monumental task, and developing AI, superhuman or
otherwise would be an  astronomically difficult process. I think
Drexler would agree with his critics that it will take many
years to develop AI, many millions of years actually.

Drexler  suggests we develop AI in the same way that nature
developed  intelligence, by brute force. Nature didn't need any
experts with a deep  understanding  of intelligence or
consciousness, intelligence just evolved, using only mutation
and natural selection. We can do the same. 
   
A recipe for intelligence: Build a simulated world in your
computer and fill  it with very simple creatures (programs).
Make sure they must solve problems  in order to get "food". The
creatures that are better at solving problems  leave more
descendants. Now you do nothing, just step back and let it 
evolve. After evolving for a few hundred  million SIMULATED years 
you have intelligence, high order intelligence.  
   

How long would it take in real years? He calculated the amount
of computer  power needed to  simulate ALL the brains that have
ever existed before humanity, that is, all the  brains since
brains were invented in the Cambrian Explosion 570 million years
ago. He concluded that  10^38 machine instructions would do the
trick. A  Nanotechnology computer the size of a large present
day factory and using no  more power, could perform 10^38
machine instructions in about 2 years. 

Bottom line, you start with a nano computer but no software to
run on it  except a few simple minded programs, smaller than
many you are using now on  your home PC . 2 years later you've
got an AI running on the computer,  an AI at least as
intelligent as a human and much, much faster. 

As breathtaking as these changes are, it's really just
engineering, Drexler  invokes no new laws of physics and assumes
no scientific breakthroughs.  If there is one things would
become even wilder. For example, if all the  recent speculation
about Quantum computers ever pans out and a practical  machine
is  possible, it would make even Drexler look like an old fuddy duddy.

Somebody mentioned that safety concerns might slow things down,
I doubt that it would, but perhaps it should. We are about to
enter a period  of gargantuan  change happening in an
astonishingly short amount of time, and that is an  inherently
dangerous situation, it would be foolish to deny it. The biggest
danger is probably something that we haven't imagined yet,
probably something we are incapable of imagining. In my darker
moments I wonder if that could be an explanation of the Fermi
paradox, the fact that we don't see any ET's  and  the fact that
the universe has not yet been engineered.

In spite of the dangers I admit I'm happy about the coming
changes, we  might survive it, and the alternative after all,
is certain death for all of us. If  nothing else things won't be
dull. The truth  however is, it doesn't matter a  hill of beans
if you or I think it's a good idea or not, somebody, somewhere, 
will do it, and do it as soon as he thinks he can. The best we
can do is  prepare ourselves as well as we can. 

Speaking of preparation, I don't want to be accused of promoting
complacency  as far as Cryonics is concerned. Even a man as
brilliant as Drexler could be wrong, especially about something
like a timeline, as it involves more than science and
engineering, but economics and politics as well. It's safest if
people plan  for the worse and hope for the best. This is even
more important for the leaders of the Cryonics companies. They
should operate under the assumption that  if it will take 1000
years for Nanotechnology to develop. If events in the next 20
years  prove that they are wrong about that, I am certain nobody
will be very upset with them.

Regardless of when the Singularity happens one thing is certain,
we are one year closer to it. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Without seeing Drexler's original proposal, it is hard to evaluate this in
detail.  But taking it literally as presented, there is an obvious flaw.
Just simulating the *brains* which have existed would not be enough to
evolve intelligence.  Brains don't just become intelligent on their own.
What makes them become intelligent is the challenge presented to the
brains by the environment.  Brains which evolve in such a way that they
are able to better survive and reproduce will become more numerous.

So it would be necessary to simulate not only the brains, but the bodies
and the environment where the brains interact.  We'd have to simulate
competition, the challenges of survival.  Frogs need tongues and flies
to evolve brains which will try to predict the flies' motion.  Apes need
hands, trees, branches, vines, and a reason to jump from tree to tree to
evolve brains which can let them leap through the air and catch a branch.

A brute force technique, then, would have to simulate not only the brains,
but potentially a significant subset of the biosphere.  This would be many
orders of magnitude more difficult.  Volume considerations alone would
suggest 4 or 5 orders of magnitude (what fraction of the biosphere is
made of brains?).  A complicating factor is that the kinds of simulation
necessary or appropriate for things like muscles, trees and rivers may be
fundamentally different than the presumably neural-net based simulations
we would prefer to use for brains (and which probably formed the basis
of Drexler's estimate).

The idea of evolving intelligence does seem to have potential, and may
turn out to be the easiest way of developing AI.  I'm sure that Drexler's
example is not meant literally, but is intended to motivate the intuition
that given nanocomputers, it should become practical to evolve AI.  This
may still be the case even if the example doesn't go all the way towards
establishing the point.

Why not let only posts with classifiers get through, write this as a foot note
at the bottom of the FAQ and if they don't read it, they can't post.

An elegant component of a path.

Published list, of course. Allow multiple tags on a line, please.

Hmmm, now how do we handle topic drift? See, it doesn't stop boneheads
from posting off-topic replies. And it doesn't stop boneheads from
monkey-see-monkey-do use of the *wrong* headers. But it *is* a speed bump
that might slow down drive-by posters.

Also bear in mind that categories are more arbitrary than we are often
aware of, and that categories that make sense at time t may seem
ridiculous at time t+n.

I know, I know--one miracle at a time.

I support this idea. Who else does?

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 340 October 8, 1997 by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

TURNING ONIONS INTO DIAMONDS.  Nano-diamonds can
be created without high pressure by squeezing carbon "onions"
(nested buckyball-like structures) with ion beams.  Graphite
material can be made into diamond the hard way, with the use of
high pressure (above 10^6 atmospheres), high temperature, and
the use of catalysts.  But recently scientists have been able to
bombard carbon onions with electron beams and now ion beams
as well, and have been able to convert the onions almost
completely into diamonds, up to 100 nm in size.  Researchers at
the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart (Florian Banhart,
banhart@wselix.mpi-stuttgart.mpg.de) use a beam of neon ions
to pelt the onions, which act like miniature pressure cells.  With
larger ion accelerators, one should be able to make macroscopic
amounts of irradiation-induced diamond.  (Experimental work:
Wesolowski et al., Applied Physics Letters, 6 Oct. 1997; theory

Sound good to me, although I also like the idea of multiple tags.  It would
also help me distinguish extropia from spam at-a-glance.  Sometimes the
headers for making-life-better nonsense closely resemble those for
making-life-better sense.

It definitely won't get 100% compliance.  It doesn't require 100% to be
useful.  If we can get 70% labeled, then signal/noise goes up for those
uninterested in such posts.

Agreed, but that's an "if" of uncertain size. As I said, it only keeps
threads from being _started_ by people who should know better than to
discuss BASICS in some other kind of thread--it doesn't stop anyone from
twisting the thread. It's worth trying, but we should be prepared for
whatever result we get.

Are you saying that instincts no longer exist when one reaches mental maturity?

Somehow, instincts just don't quite fit into the definition of "subjective."
They exist apart from how we feel about them. To be sure, we can control our
instinctive urges, but we still have them. They seem more like a personal
*is* which our mind perceives as an *ought*.

To not be in conflict with what is probably his most basic instinctive

His instincts are a part of him, and yet he cannot change them through his
choices, only be in compliance or conflict with them. They are AS IS.

Instincts are an AS IS part of the individual.

Are not instincts part of objective reality?

We'd need some sort of intelligent agent to scan list message
submissions for signs of economic ignorance or socialistic stupidity, to
filter them out ahead of time. I don't like the idea of filtering people
out, but having a stupid idea filter would exclude those who insist on
debating the obvious, unless they decide to contribute something that is
actually constructive.

Hey, how about carbon onions with hollow cores filled with
deuterium/helium3? Might be a nice low power solution to fusion....When
the irradiation catalyzes the carbon shells to diamondize, there must be
some terrific compression in the heart of the nodule....

Sorry. I thought that it was implicit that since governments do not
operate on a profit/loss basis, the quality/productivity motive is not
there, but that is neither here nor there. I was assuming two possible
scenarios: a) where government is socialist and runs nationalized
companies, which require capital investements to modernize, expand, etc.
just like any business, and b) where government is more laissez faire,
private businesses are competing in the market with nationalized company
A, and compete in the money markets for investment capital. In this
situation, the nationalized company issues government backed tax free
bonds, while private company B simply issues stock, capital gains on
which is taxed. If socialized government business was so much better,
then obviously it would be able to provide a higher rate of return on
invenstment to purchasers of its bonds, without having to offer tax-free
status to the gains. Since not socialized companies have ever done this,
then this is an obvious financial yardstick to show that private
business is more successful than private business.

We don't even need to look at different countries. We can simply look at
a comparison between the United States Postal Service and companies like
UPS, FedEx, Airborne, etc.

This case study is also a good comparison to show that labor also does
better under private enterprise than government socialism. UPS has the
highest wages for almost all of its regular part and full time
positions, while the USPS's jobs rank in the lower half, in a comparison
of employees in the postal/parcel delivery industries. This was BEFORE
the latest strike. WOrkers at the post office can't go on strike due to
government regulations. Hmmmm, what seems to be wrong here?

I'll bet even including organized crime hits (mafioso), the government
law enforcement agencies still kills far more law abiding citizens than
by private organizations. Criminals tend to kill other criminals,
especially when it is concerning any type of organized crime. Cops don't
seem to care who they shoot, so long as they aren't be shot back at.

Strictly offhand, just extrapolating from those instances of Algernon's Law
I've been able to find, I would guess that ampakines disenhance
linear/sequential event memory and temporospatial solutions (catching a ball).
 Did they try testing for that?

A 10-20% improvement may be indicative of cognitive resources being entirely
focused on a single class of problem.  This may or may not be worth the likely
30-60% disimprovements in cognitive areas outside the narrow ones studied.

I don't really think we need any new automated mechanisms, or that new
rules must be enforced.  All I wanted to do was to remind people that we
have in the past adopted a policy of not endlessly debating these basics.

It's ironic.  We tell people that 30 years from now everyone will turn
into an immortal superman, and they say ho hum.  But if you suggest
that somebody ought to be able to work for less than the minimum wage,
all hell breaks loose.

I remember a joke from Mad magazine.  The boss comes down hard on this
guy for spending 55 cents extra on office supplies.  The clerk says, "But
boss, you authorize millions of dollars in expenditures all the time.
What's the big deal about a few cents?"  The boss answers, "Frankly,
when I work with these huge amounts, I don't really have a sense of how
big they are.  Fifty-five cents - now that, I understand!"

The libertarian aspect of extropianism is the part which most people can
understand, I guess.

Certainly, but I would think Extropians have a specific take on investing.
Personally, I'm not only interested in the highest return, but also
investing in companies that are aligned with my values.  Furthermore, the

I believe it was William Shakespeare who said: "To one who feels, life is a
tragedy. To one who thinks, life is a comedy.

                                
A fellow came to my door the other day and told me he was from
the IRS and that I owed money. I asked him how much I owed him
and how I came to owe him. He says, "Oh, you don't owe me. You
owe the government." I say, O.K., send in this fellow, govenment,
and maybe he can explain how much I owe and why." He says
govenment is not a man." I say, O.K. send the woman in and she
can tell me." He says, "Government isn't a woman either." I told
him that I don't see how I came to owe a child, but I would
listen if the child wants to explain." He says, "Government isn't
a child  either." 

Trying to clear up the puzzle, I asked, "If government ain't a
man, ain't a woman, ain't a child, who's left to owe?" He then
says that I owe the people. Turns out "people" ain't a person
either, so I ask what it is. He says, "People is everybody." I
ask, "Does it include me." "Yep", he says. Then I say, "You're
saying that I owe myself, but haven't paid myself. Do you reckon
I ought to have myself arrested for treating myself so unfairly?"

I could see this IRS fellow (IRS - Idiot Representing Self)
wasn't digging the scene at all. He got all agitated and came
full circle and screamed that I still owed the government. I
asked, "Can I take the category, people, for five hundred?" Since
he didn't see any difference in owing the government and owing
the people, he said, "O.K." - Then I sprung it on him. I told him
that last week I got on my ten speed Schwin with a can of WD-40 
and a good tail wind and went to see every last person in the 
whole USA. I told him that I asked each and every one if I owed 
him\her money. Every last one of them said, "No." 

"Now IRS man", I says, "How is it that 100% of the individuals
say I don't owe, and you take this 100% NO, call these
individuals, "People" and the 100% NO gets flipped over to "Yes?"
I gotta ask, IRS man, do you do card tricks too?"

Ain't but one thing worse than a man that ain't got no sense. Its
a man who ain't got no sense and ain't got no sense of humor
either. Hey warden, "Can I have another crayon so I can finish

You say about my post:

First, I never wrote anything in "alternative Universe." I even reject the
phrase as a contradiction. The only thing I can find that even has a very
vague similarity by a line or two is this:

{{{{{Nevertheless, when we eliminate human
individual as reference for the concept, morality, what remains
except an expressed or implied superior being; indeed, what
psychological force does the concept, morality, have without

Hardly a match, is it?  As you can see, what you're saying I wrote is quite
a bit removed from my actual statement. There are several instances of this
in your post and its most confusing. Sometimes a whole paragraph is not
mine, and sometimes there appears to be a mix. I have no idea what happened,
but considering the circumstance, I'll just respond to a major point or two.

What are you calling "objective value?" Please define objective, then value,
then put the two together. I'm really not getting this unless you are
arbitrarily changing the meaning of objective in an oscillating fashion. If
your values are not objective, then they must be subjective, right? Also, if
objective value exist, I presume it its objective by the same criteria that
the law of gravity, etc. are objective. If not, it appears that the term,
objective, is being used non definitively. If so, then objective value is
inherent in objective reality and can't be escaped. So on what do you claim
that objective value exists, but are not your values?  Does your idea of
morality, objective or otherwise incorporate an "ought", as in "ought to
choose a particular end" - as opposed to the objective mandate that one
MUST choose appropriate means if a desired end is to be achieved?  Again, I
request: Please define and elaborate with illustrations.

Are you telling me that I'm mistaken, that government IS NOT the initiation
of force and coercion? Yes or no? Your comments that posits abstracts as
real things (standard practice) evades the question and proposes to cover
the facts with the usual fare of illusions that have long supported the idea
of government. As for reading about the Constitutional Convention, I did
some time ago, and am quite familiar with the Constitution itself which I do
not hesitate to call a monstrous slave paper. As pertains to suggested
reading, may I suggest "The Principles Of Epistemology" and "The Anatomy Of
Language" as a basis for understanding why and what I label as contradiction
and reject. You might also want to go on to the chapters, "The Illusion Of
Categorical Identity" and "Law And Disorder."
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/7764/text.txt 

Contradictions:

1.>A state may exist as a social compact between the rulers and the ruled - 

Please explain to me a "social compact" between two individuals who agree to
rule and be ruled. An agreement to be ruled is a contradiction in terms is
it not? So, what's really going on, rule or non rule? Is there really any
doubt? The only ones actually being ruled in all this are those who reject
the idea and system. In reality, the relationship between the rulers and the
ruled is one of master and servant; fundamentally, it is the subordination
of one individual to the will of another. As maintaining this relationship
requires initiation of force and\or coercion, instead of being a social
compact, it is an anti social action. That most, programmed to not know any
better, volunteer for the system and seek to direct the centralized
offensive force does not change the character of it, and the certain end
result of resentment, hostility and violent conflict. I'm not saying its
"evil." I'm just saying that if peace and order is the goal, those that try
to gain it by means contrary to ends just don't have any respect for natural
principle and truth. Their privilege, but I do wish they would just leave me
out of it and\or quit pretending that everyone goes along with the suicidal
and destructive idea.

2. > the theory the Founding Fathers(*) started out with.

The "Founding Fathers" (and the rest of the gang) did not start with a
social compact, but the will to rule, and did not hesitate to harm any who
resisted.
Do you find anything in the old records or the new that says if an
individual wants no part of the system, said individual is excused and will
not be subjected to any of the offensive laws? I've read a lot of
constitutional and law stuff and have ever seen anything like this.  Have you?

3.  >Or as sovereign power which has its sole source in the people and is
>willingly delegated by them into a formal government<

"Soverign power"? Soverign power is not a thing. Its an action. Thus the
question: Who has "soverign power" over whom, and how is it really brought
about? Since the term, people, denotes a subjective category existing only
in mind and is not a thing, volitional or otherwise, "people" cannot
delegate anything to anyone. As for  the "willingly", If there were
universal willingness as implied, why did the "Founding Fathers" ( and the
rest of the gang) keep so much fire power around and draw up "laws" to give
themselves permission to use the fire power to persuade the unwilling? The
pretense of all volunteers just won't match the obvious facts.

4.  >There was a great deal of debate regarding how much power the
>United States should have, whether it should be able to overrule the component
>States, and even what the fundamental basis of government was.

This entire statement floats in an abstract circle far far removed from the
reality, human individual.  The "United States" nor "States" are things, so
the power did not exist in these abstracts, but the individuals who manged
to gain, hold, and direct the superior offensive force. Since real
individual was left out of the equation, except as means to "divine end",
the "debates" came down to emotional persuasion via arguments of "divine
cause" and who were the "inspired."

5.>In our modern
>times, government is by thought and action treated like some huge, lumbering
>beast.  

Treated as a thing?  Does the term, government, denote "a thing?" If so,
please show it  to me. If not, is not the contradicion clear?

6.> The attitude you describe is not often seen.

Huh? When is it not seen???  Treating "government" as a god, as a superior
being and subordinating individual is the ONLY way the idea can survive and
be implemented. "not often"? How about ALWAYS, both past and present. Take
away the absolute and intolerant power premise of the god called government,
and the whole thing disappears. If ALL individuals are not regarded as
property of this imagined god, government, you tell me how it is sustained.
Can I say, "Go away" and be left alone? Oh no, then anyone would who wanted
to could also. Absolute ownership and absolute intolerance of individualism
are the only premises that sustain any and every governmental system
regardless of label. The term, government, is a direct contradiction of the
term, individualism; and there is no statement more absurd that depicting
government as a superior being  and "protector" of "individual rights."
That which inherently negates cannot "protect" that which it dismisses.
Silly word game. Silly yes, but very deadly. Did you ever notice that when
"countries" go to war. It is individuals that bleed and die. No matter what
the carnage, the sacred idea and "divine abstract" *must* survive. This is
the mindset of billions, and billions have paid the penalty in suffering and
death.

And unless we made the simulated environment isomorphic to our own (to the

While Michio Kaku's latest release, "Visions: How Science with Revolutionize
the Twenty-Fist Century" (as an aside, that title does not make much sense.
How can you revolutionize something that has yet to occur?), contains a wealth
of excellent material on near-future technologies, I was dismayed at the brief
and unbalanced treatment Kaku gave nanotechnology.

The most glaring omission from Kaku's discussion is the absence of Eric
Drexler's name.  Dr. Drexler, along with other notable experts in the field,
was deposited in the term nameless, faceless, credentialless term "advocates".
In science circles, "advocacy" is not the most amicable term.  "Expert" is much
more congenial.  Advocating (implying simply support for a concept and not
necessarily knowledge) is different from knowing (i.e., being an expert),
whether Kaku intended this subtle jab I do not know.  Kaku even failed to
include any of Drexler's works in the "Recommended Reading" section of his
book.  The only book dealing with nanotechnology that made it into this section
was Regis' "Nano", not my first choice for an introduction to the subject.

On the flip side, Kaku finds it necessary to identify and quote three different
critics of nanotechnology: a chemist and columnist of "the prestigious Nature
magazine" (none other than David Jones, the acidic critic of nanotechnology
who, from his own comments on Drexler's "Nanosystems" either did not read the
book at all or was severely confused when penning his comments on the book), an
engineer from Hewlett-Packard, and an editor from a science fiction
publication.  This constellation of critics that Kaku assembled is ironic in
that Kaku opens his book criticizing how cogent discussion of technology
(especially future technology) is inhibited by the media's reliance on
nonscientists or nonexpert scientists.

Nanotechnology is obviously a controversial subject.  True molecular
nanotechnology (MNT), as described in Dr. Drexler's works, would have profound
effects on virtually every aspect of our lives and literally transform
humanity.  There are some legitimate scientifically-motivated (versus acrid
criticism a la Jones) criticism of true MNT.  Smalley's comments regarding
theoretical problems at the sub cubic nanometer are compelling and need to be
addressed (check out http://cnst.rice.edu/NanoWelch.html).  I would have
preferred that Kaku include Smalley and Drexler, experts in the area, in his
nanotechnology discussion instead of the troupe he assembled.

I am not a scientist by training, actually I am an accountant.  However, I was
distressed at the unscientific treatment Kaku gave nanotechnology.  The last
thing nanotechnology needs is to be regarded as pseudoscience.  Such a
designation could make finding research funding difficult.  I am composing a
letter to Kaku himself pertaining to the comments above.  If I receive a
response from him I will, with his permission, post it to this mailing list.

They tested a digit cancellation task (cross out as many instances of
'1', '4' and '8' from a sheet of random digits, as accurately and quickly
as possible) and a finger tapping test (tap with the right index finger,
tap with the left, alternate index and middle fingers, alternate
left and right index fingers; the speed of tapping and correctness was
measured). Neither of these had any significant deviations from the
untreated subjects. There was a *tiny* (non-significant) decrease in
the finger tapping task, but not enough to support your above idea.
Of course, these were just two rather simple tasks. 

However, my guess is that ampakines have some kind of drawback. They
seem to make the postsynaptic signals stronger in many neurons, which
may lead to problems with overstimulations (I think they are bad for
epileptics). Also, an increase in neural plasticity is not 100% positive.
If you learn easily, you will also easily erase old information; your
memory range may get shorter. I'm not sure yet if the ampakines mainly
act in the median temporal lobe (in that case they might make your
learning more selective) or in the cortex (in that case they might make
you forget old memories faster while you learn faster). We'll see...

So far we have not seen any evidence for disimprovements; my guess is
that the effects are a bit more subtle than a simple decrease in some
other ability; I would say the expected result would be a shift in the
balance between different cognitive abilities (such as learning/forgetting
and stable storage).

How do we know that? (Do you mean that we know that no infinitely

Even apart from the fact that Drexler's estimate doesn't seem to 
have taken into account that the simulated creatures would need an 
environment to live in, it is clear it could never be a certain way 
of quickly evolving AI. There are something like 10^18 habitable 
planets out there, and as far as we know, intelligent life has 
evolved on only one, and we don't know how implausible that was.

Another point is that I think that even though the volume of the 
non-brain parts of the biosphere are many orders of magnitude greater 
than the brain parts, it doesn't follow that it would take so much 
more computing power to simulate it. Brains are the most complex 
systems in the known universe; other biological phenomena could 
presumably be sufficiently closely approximated at a relatively low 
computational cost. Of course, if we start to make idealisations then 
the estimate loses its plausibility as an absolutely certain upper 
bound on how difficult it is to create AI.

However, I don't see an reason why we should have a realistic 
biosphere in our simulation at all. Since the simulate 
evolution-argument doesn't seem to work anyway, we can just as well 
focus on more realistic ways of creating AI. Some kind of strategic 
multi-player game in an environment where some sort of simulated 
"physical" things can be constructed would seem a better place to 
evolve intelligence in than any realistic model of primordial earth. 
But even that is not how I expect AI to come into existence.

In general, it seems that infinities don't occur in the universe.
So far we have always seen that nature cleverly avoids them in one
way or another, so the "Infinity Censorship Conjecture" seems to
hold; my personal conjecture is that infinite computing power only
can exist at the c-boundaries of spacetime. 


Evolving AI is interesting, but it seems that finding good selection
criteria is hard. It seems to take AI to recognize AI, but co-evolution
would only produce AI that works in its own world, not our world.

The most recent Extropy Investment Group met this past Tuesday evening to
discuss investment strategies and favorite money market picks.  Several
attended came with pertinent information about their own investments
experiences.  We did discuss new technologies and investing in same.  My
contribution was a list of ten "Mighty Great Mutual Fund Picks" with the
objectives, NAV, and percentage gain for 1 and 3 months, and also 1, 3 and 5
year gains. Others brought suggested reading, personal strategies, and goals.   

Feedback for the meeting was good. Many felt the learned a lot.  Because
some people had been investing for years and quite successful at it, and
having the money to invest (a necessity), some had no investments yet, and
were just starting out.  One thing that we all agreed on was that we have to
start putting money aside, now.  I'd like to suggest to the list that it
might be really a good idea for extropians in local areas to form their own
EIG meetings and perhaps we could pool information.  

Its a positive way to advance our money-making intelligence and learn about
investing in the technologies and companies that are aligned with our way of
thinking.

I don't agree. If we could simulate brains, the most complex object in the 
known universe, then I don't think other objects would be an insuperable 
problem, nor do I think volume is necessarily proportional to simulation 
difficulty. We wouldn't have to simulate an environment exactly as it was on 
any given day on Earth, we'd only need to make it logical and complex enough 
to be interesting. 

Take the weather for example, even today we have pretty good models of it, 
we can't make a good prediction about what it will do a month from now and I 
doubt we ever will, but that's because of our ignorance of initial conditions 
and the weather's exquisite sensitivity to it. If you gave a meteorologist a
description of the atmosphere for the next month based on a good computer 
model and a description of what the atmosphere actually did the two would be 
very different, but unless he had access to external instruments he couldn't 
tell which one was real and which one was the computer model. The model 
provided a completely logical, complex, and realistic description of what the 
atmosphere might have done, it's just that instead it did something else that 
was also logical and complex.

Another thought, perhaps we could give our virtual creatures an advantage 
nature figured out how to give real ones, instead of relying exclusively on 
Darwin's style of Evolution with its horrible random mutation and natural 
selection, perhaps we could also have Lamarckian style Evolution by the 
inheritance of acquired characteristics. It would be wonderful if that the
muscular body you worked so hard to develop, would make your children strong 
too. How splendid it would be if your offspring were born knowing everything 
you struggled to learn during your life. Unfortunately it doesn't work that 
way in our world, Shakespeare's daughter had to start from square one and 
learn how to hold a pen and make sense from squiggles written on paper, 
Einstein's son had to reinvent the wheel and rediscover that 2 +2 = 4. 
Besides being less cruel, Lamarck's type of evolution would be much faster 
than Darwinian evolution, that's why social evolution is so much swifter than 
biological evolution.

True, but not of much use to me in determining a course of action.
The problem is that evolution only looks backward: I am the result of
those traits that succeeded in the past, under different conditions
For example, throughout most of human evolution, food was scarce, so
I have an instinct to eat whenever I can.  I choose not to do so
(though I should choose not to a bit more often than I actually do)
because I am able to evaluate the evidence of obesity not being
favorable to my goals of health and long life.

Greg's "natural values" of life and society are more rooted in the
present reality, but that too is not the time frame I want to look
at: I want values to be teleological, to tell me how to make my
future different from my present.  True, I must reason from those
teleological premises and my knowledge of reality /now/ to derive
rational actions, but still the nature of reality now is no guide
to making those moral choices.

Max's "rational values" aren't very satisfying either, because they
are still derived from underlying chosen values, but there is a sense
in which they are valuable: simplicity.  Once someone goes through
the task of showing that some derived value--say, wealth--follows
from a core value of life, one can then use the derived value itself
in making decisions without having to re-derive it every time.  Much
the way a Mathematician would use a finished proof as a premise for
more complex proofs, or the way a programmer would use completed
subroutines to build more complex programs.  It is not even necessary
that one know the derivation itself; in fact not spending the time
to go through every such derivation would be advantageous--an example
of what Friedman calls "rational ignorance", where the cost of a piece
of knowledge exceeds its value.

The game-threory arguments fail to get us out of our dilemma as well,
because they are founded on the assumption of measurable payoffs, which
are arbitrary.  "Find positive-sum games" is of little use to someone
who has chosen values that prevent it.  Or for some, leads to completely
different results than we would prefer (for example, if you choose to
value the failure of others twice as much as they devalue it, then every
interaction in which you victimize someone is positive-sum to you, and
every cooperation is zero-sum).

Where I depart from Mr. England is that while we agree that we cannot
rationaly derive moral values, he then tries to derive moral values
from that failure--even more irrational.  He says, in effect, that
since your morals cannot be rational, be less judgmental of others
and less committed to your own.  I say choose one and get on with it.
I have no problem committing my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor
to the values I have chosen; it is precisely that commitment, I
believe, that enables me to accomplish the the things I want.  And
since I need the cooperation of others to accomplish them, I will
work to spread those values in others, and judge them without apology.
I just refuse to claim any objective basis for them, because honesty
is one of those core values I have chosen.

I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,
irrelevant to everyday use.  Since 90% of the actions of humans are
demonstrably irrational based on their own expressed values, there is
more to be accomplished by solving /that/ problem than by worrying
about the derivation of those values.  The latter can be dealt with
in places like this list; the rest of life can deal with the former.

How about we create an FAQ that's sent when you first subscribe that briefly
answers those 'basic' questions we all find so annoying.  Split the FAQ into
sections that also tell you the correct classifier for each topic, followed
by a short description and then a list command that allows you to request a
more comprehesive FAQ on that topic.  We could do the same for various papers
(extropian principles, dynamic optimism, etc.)  That way anyone who reads it
will know that the information is there, and if they still post basic
questions, we can just point them in the direction of the correct FAQ.  We
can let list members decide on what to put in these FAQs (when a basic
consensus is reach on that subject and we want to move on) and also what
classifiers to use.  Not only will this help both new and current members,
but we'll be building a comprehensive database of ideas in the process.

Well if they get through all this and still post off-messages, it's probably
a good idea to just ignore them.

THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART II

by Frederick Mann
						10/10/97


====================================================
FREEDOM SHIP - THE MOST ADVANCED FREEDOM PROJECT YET
====================================================
          <http://www.freedomship.com/>


Introduction
------------

In conception, 'Freedom Ship' seems to be one of the
most advanced freedom projects I know of.  It's a
project to build a huge ship, three times as long as
the Empire State Building is tall -- 4310 ft. long,
725ft. wide.  It will have a superstructure, rising
25 stories above its deck.  It will have space for
at least 50,000 residents, 15,000 personnel, and
20,000 guests and visitors.

It will be powered by 100 diesel engines and will
circle the world once every two years.  About
25% of the time it will be underway at sea, and
about 75% of the time it will be holding in-place
in coastal waters near major cities.

Other features of'Freedom Ship':
* A commercial center with a free-enterprise economy.
* Residential and commercial condominiums.
* High-quality, fresh food and clean water.
* $200,000,000 hospital.
* Superb safety and security.
* Excellent banking and communication facilities.
* 3,800 ft. airplane landing strip.
* Fleet of commuter aircraft and hydrofoils.
* Duty/tax-free shopping.
* Educational, recreational, and entertainment facilities.
* Modest cost of living.

Check out <http://www.freedomship.com/> for more details.
[If you decide to reserve a condominium -- no obligation
-- no funds being solicited -- please specify
"Boston Tea Party II-FM" as your Sales Agent.]

I don't know whether the people behind 'Freedom Ship'
have their act sufficiently together to succeed.  It's
a lot easier to put up a sophisticated website than
to build a huge ship.  Nevertheless, I'm highly
impressed with what I've seen so far and with my
limited contact with people involved in the project.

I've heard a rumor that 'Popular Mechanics' is
working on an extensive article on 'Freedom Ship,'
possibly with a picture on the front cover.  If
this comes about, it could boost interest and
reservations substantially.

emphatically advised to obey all laws on Earth
and in the Universe to the letter.


The Economic Means to Freedom
-----------------------------

This is the second in a series of articles on the
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first article
covered three principles: (1) Opportunity Gap;
(2) Three Economic Sectors -- public, private,
and free-enterprise; and (3) Free-Enterprise
Institutions.  You can receive the first article
by a request to <mailto:f-prime@activist.com> or
access it at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.

The Opportunity Gap is the difference between
where people are and where they could or should
be.  The essence of the Economic Means to Freedom
is to provide people with the means to bridge the
Opportunity Gap -- to advance from where they are
to where they could or should be.

If 'Freedom Ship' succeeds, it will achieve this
in several respects.  Residents will enjoy a high
quality of life with superb safety and security,
while travelling the world in style and comfort.
Both residents and businesses will enjoy the
absence of terrocrats(coercive political agents
or terrorist bureacrats) and the benefits of
free-enterprise.

'Freedom Ship' could also become an outstanding
example of a Free-Enterprise Institution -- the
Economic Means to Freedom in practice.  It may
become a model for others to emulate.


Money Can Buy Freedom
---------------------

The fourth principle of the Economic Means to
Freedom is that money can buy freedom.  It can
buy you the freedom to live where you want to
and to travel when and where you want to.  Money
can buy a group of people the freedom to build
a 'Freedom Ship' and to escape the tyranny of
terrocrats.

Money can buy you freedom from having to work
to earn a living.  To a considerable extent,
money can buy you freedom from illness and
disease.  Money can buy you the freedom of a
longer life.  Within a few decades, money may
even be able to buy freedom from death.

Consider the possibility that using money in
profitable ways to expand freedom -- the
Economic Means to Freedom -- is by far the
most powerful freedom strategy.  This is because
it can set a snowball effect in motion.  Part
of the profits can be used to increase or expand
freedom-promoting activities and enterprises
in profitable ways.  These profits can be used
in turn to expand further...

Money can probably buy freedom to a greater
extent than even I have begun to imagine...

This will become more evident as we expand
free-enterprise currency, banking, and barter
institutions, such as those mentioned in the
first article of this series.


No-Opposition Strategy
----------------------

>
Here's the fifth main principle of the Economic Means to
Freedom.  When we oppose something, or try to reform it,
we usually encounter opposition.  Our effort elicits
an almost automatic counter-effort.  In practicing the
Economic Means to Freedom, we don't attempt to change,
oppose, reform, or overthrow any  political or economic
systems.  We simply create our own voluntary alternatives
in the free-enterprise sector.

'Freedom Ship' is an excellent example of this principle
in action.

The bogus power of terrocrats depends on the support
from their victims.  In practicing the Economic Means to
Freedom, we find practical ways to legally, elegantly,
and safely withdraw our support.  The power of terrocrats
is tenuous -- largely based on illusion, flimsy, fragile,
and of little substance.

Understanding this dynamic of human power enabled Mohandas
Gandhi to play a major role in the defeat of the armed might
of the British Empire without firing a shot.  The East German
terrocrats, backed by 300,000 Russian troops, could not keep
the Berlin wall standing, once a critical mass of people just
said "NO!" to the system.  When the victims of the Soviet
terrocrats withdrew their support, the Soviet Empire
collapsed overnight.

Because of gradual currency debasement (inflation), budget
deficits, property seizures, Nazi-like terrorism (like Waco
and Ruby Creek), fragile schemes like "social security" and
"medicare," and other criminal violations, terrocrats are
in the process of destroying their own coercive power systems.
They are gradually losing credibility and control.

The example of 'Freedom Ship' may set in motion a whole
range of initiatives whereby many more people find practical
and profitable ways to withdraw their support from terrocrats. 

A basic theme of the Economic Means to Freedom
is "building freedom" rather than "fighting for
freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."  I believe
that if a critical mass of people were to focus
on building freedom, corrupt political systems
will eventually lose their power and influence.

I believe we need to define the term, instinct, to clarify the question. As
stressed in previous posts, to define is to differentiate. So, by reference
to what and how do we differentiate instinct from non instinct? If instinct
is a natural condition, whatever the instinct is is not subject to dismissal
or alternation by personal preference. One often hears such things as "He
has good instincts for the game." Or, "He instinctively applied the brake."
These things are all developed reflexes, not instincts. 

Infant animals, including the human kind, by instinct seek to gain
nourishment necessary for survival. Dogs, cats, etc. are directed by this
instinct all of their lives. I.E., survival instinct. A human individual on
the other hand is volitional and at some point in the maturing transition
has the option to choose(within capacity) to survive or choose not survive.
Although each individual is made up of characteristics, both common and
individualistic, including the urges you speak of, with the onset of the
ability to think in the abstract and make choices, there is no instinctive
directive to determine course of action. 
>
>Somehow, instincts just don't quite fit into the definition of "subjective."

Granted, this is an arguable point. For sake of brevity, I didn't go into a
full explanation of complete differentiation. I don't like the premise,
"automatic values" as it sidesteps choice and subjective and you observe.
What we really have in human infants and other animals are REACTIVE
entities. Since the value is attributed by mind, although instinctively, the
source puts it in the subjective realm. That it is automatic, not subject to
choice, puts it in the objective realm. What we have is not a contradiction,
but an evolving transition of one type of animal into another and a
description of each stage as pertains to valuing. I simply do not like the
term valuing in the first stage, but have no single term to represent the
actual differentiation. We also have a situation of valuing as in the case
of a dog with survival instinct, but chooses one type of food over another.
There are separate terms needed to make a shortly worded differentiations.
Right now I can't find them in the language system and have not tried to
create such terms since this situation is not often discussed. In any event,
considering the non explanatory generality of my statement, your objection
is well warrented. However, when we leave the transition stage and deal with
human adults, the mental action of subjective valuing is quite clear.

>They exist apart from how we feel about them. To be sure, we can control our
>instinctive urges, but we still have them. 

These urges you speak of are as you acknowledge at the command of individual
volition as to whether one does or does not act upon them. If we define
instinct as not subject to volition, as was done above, the urges in
question are not in the realm of instinct. This is further evidenced by the
fact that certain beliefs and valutions can psychologically negate all the
survival urges. 

>They seem more like a personal
>*is* which our mind perceives as an *ought*.
>
It is a personal *is*. However, the perception of *ought* is rooted in the
"impersonal" as it presupposes a course of action and behavior set up and
sanctioned by something other than self. In formal religion, it is called
"God." Apart from formal religion, it may be called anything, or nothing at
all - except the feeling of "ought." The core question is whether the
feeling of "ought" is based on fact or fallacy. In addition to the fact that
"ought" is inconsistent with "is", my long term study of the situation
leaves me with the conclusion that the feeling of "ought" is ALWAYS based on
false beliefs. There is sometimes much difficulty in identifying these false
beliefs because they often exist in the subconscious without conscious
awareness of their nature or their effect on thinking and values. Since very
few ever study the principles of mind to understand what they believe and
why they believe it, these subconscious directive beliefs usually go
undetected throughout a lifetime.

As I see it, what Mr. Crocker is saying here is that he does not contest the
fact that means may be tested (proven as suited or unsuited) in respect of
some end he chooses.  The challenge is to prove the end itself is a valid or
invalid *should* choice. It can't be done because there is no objective
*should*. The theory of objective ought is in direct contradiction of the
objective fact of individual volition. Do you notice that Mr. Crocker's
statements sets means as subject to proof or disproof? To prove Mr.
Crocker's choice of ends as right or wrong, isn't it necessary to regard Mr.
Crocker's choice of ends as means to some other end not his own? Even the
words themselves throw out an "ought" as objective. To wit. Objective
reality IS. To say "ought" is objective is to say objective reality IS and
IS NOT. It just won't fly.

If it were an "instinctive value" it would not be subject to choice, would
it? Wouldn't this mean the value already exists for Mr. Crocker and the
"should" has no meaning?   As for pleasing himself, each of us seeks self
interest at all times. Aren't you really presuming to decide Mr. Crocker's
choice for him? Isn't this a contadiction?

As concluded above, urges are not necessarily instincts as in infants, but
may derived from underlying beliefs. So, there never is the question or
circumstance of being in conflict with instincts since they are by nature
guaranteed.

See above. To recap. You acknowledge that one can choose to ignore what
you're calling instincts. Since you can do this by subjective choice,
doesn't this reveal that what you're calling instincts are not really
objective, nor an objective mandate?

Yes, but the question is, what part, and how does this part relate to the
issue of values? I know of no instincts of anything that supports the idea
of should or ought. The belief in "ought" as consistent with objective
reality, but dependent only upon a subjective feeling leaves all that
believe shouting "ought" at each other without any objective, i.e,, common
frame of reference to peacefully resolve the difference. Believing the
"ought" is objective is a psychologial "order" to act upon it. What this
action is and how it is manifested necessarily varies with each individual.
One may retreat to a monastery to comtemplate the "spiritual" because he
feels he "ought" to follow this course to please "God." Another may feel
he\she "ought" to kill his\her children because they will be better off in
"heaven". Another may feel he "ought" to devote his life to aiding the ill.
Still another may feel he "ought" to eliminate racial impurity and promote
racial superiority because it is "God's will." 

Always is the "ought" tied to something not individual, but felt to exist
and be superior to idividual. Its a short step from "God's will" to "for the
good of the country." Then there is "human rights", "values of society", and
so on expressed or implied as a superior being to which individual is
subordianted giving rise to the "ought." There are those that consciouly
reject the idea of an omni god and "God's will." Some go on to reject
"government" "society" as things of volition and will. Yet, after all this
remains the feeling of "moral ought." Why?  Where does it come from? What
end does it serve in the promotion?
Whose end?

The feeling is a residual from a dominant belief in a superior being and
subordination of individual.  It has no name, no face, no conscious recognition.
It is a haunting specter that emanates from the nearly universal and
saturate philosophy of anti individual. The formal preaching and teaching,
and the informal promotion of "divine abstracts", manifested not only in
words, but the entire socio\economic\political system that blankets the
earth, makes no concession to individual as the real. Look and listen. Where
do you see or hear of individual as the absolute real? If I were to tell you
that in your own mind you don't exist; not as the absolute real, not as the
uncaused cause so to speak, you would probably think I'm nuts, for you are
absolutely certain of your individual existence. O.K. Tell me of the source
of the "moral ought" you feel to exist? Do not tell me of your ends and
submit proof of means. This is not the issue. I wish to know of the common,
universal, not individually designated end that must exist to give objective
and definitive meaning to "ought."Can you do this without expressing or
implying a "superior being" in the background as the necessary cause of the
"objective value?"

Wrong.  My version was altered from yours almost verbatim, maintained most of
the phrasing, and did not alter any meaning except substituting "reality" for "morality".

Please take a little more time to check what you said before accusing me of
misquoting you.  I am not responsible if you forget what you say because
you're making it up as you go along.

Oh, and about this:

> First, I never wrote anything in "alternative Universe." I even reject the

Right.  You reject the phrase as a contradiction, even though you know
perfectly well what I'm talking about (alternate Universes a la "Lord Kalvan
of Otherwhen" or "All the Myriad Ways" or two hundred other books), and even
though counterfactual processes are built into the basic ontological substrate
of reality (quantum mechanics; the Schrodinger equation and linear evolution).

When it comes to morality, I couldn't have expressed the flaws in your
objections more clearly.

I am not debating with someone who mysteriously forgets what the term
"objective morality" means after starting an attack on it.  There is a
difference between analyzing a definition and pretending not to understand it.

I think you're correct. But lst's ask:

"some dumb kid" occasionally. You come across to me as a very,
very bright kid, but one who has not yet learned that the

It's your responsibilty to evaluate this stuff critically.
I'm actually happy to have you hang out here with us, but

There appears to be an engineering problem with the design, namely the size.

In an ideal rigid floating body, the net buoyancy of the object is uniform
across the entirety of the bottom of the object.  In reality this is never
the case.  The problem is that these variations in buoyancy generate
stressful forces on the ship that grow geometrically as the length grows
arithmetically.  At some point the stresses will tear the ship apart.

Very large ships, such as supertankers ( which are much smaller than the
"Freedom Ship" ), are very fragile and have to be loaded in a manner that
distributes the mass evenly throughout the ship.  A momentary increase in
mass in one part of the ship can cause the ship to rip itself in half.
Sailing through rough seas with a less than optimally balanced load will do
the same thing.

According to the resume on the site, the guy who designed the "Freedom
Ship" did not have the design of very large water-craft in his engineering
expertise.  

FTR, I am no expert on this type of engineering either, but I've had
lengthy discussions in the past on this topic with a guy who is an expert,
both as an engineer ( wrote design software for this type of thing ), and
as a former supertanker captain.

A more feasible design would be to either have a bunch of smaller floating
objects connected non-rigidly, or to make the structure stacked *a lot*
shorter (minimize vertical pressure) so that the superstructure will be
capable of withstanding the buoyant forces.  A structure that is both long
*and* tall simply won't work.  Either way, it will be a serious compromise
to his "ideal" design.

The future is built upon the past. Adapting to changing conditions doesn't
necessarily mean throwing away *all* past successful traits.

Whence your goals of health and long life? If you dig deep enough, you'll
find an instinct.

Rational actions must have goals. If we acknowledge that objective morality
is individual, not universal, and rooted in instinct, we can examine Greg's
concept of heirarchy of objective moral goals to determine how we may adapt
our individual goals to future conditions. And in the process resolve
internal conflicts.

The is/ought gap needs only one bridge. From this single thread can be woven
the very fabric of all human action and interaction, past, present, and future.

Thats kinda my point. Most people out there still can't agree on where
we are now, so painting a future for them like ours is difficult if they
don't even agree on the hsitorical precursors.

My very first job was working at a local farmers market. I got paid
minimum wage, which was $3.25 an hour at that time (big money for a 15
year old in '82). My boss had a sign on his office door that said, "We
would like to pay you what you are worth, but minimum wage laws make us
pay you more..." Needless to say, I got a better job pretty quickly.

James,
Are you aware of any use of composites in the construction of large
ships? AFAIK, large hull construction still relies on steel and some
aluminum. I imagine that carbon-carbon sturcutral components and woven
kevlar hull meterial would be a high tech version of the old flexible
hulls of yore, like the eskimo kayak and St. Bernard's boat (that one
that was on the cover of Nat. Geographic 15 or so years ago). Using
multiple such hulls supporting a stabilized platform would seem to me to
be an optimum solution.

The fact that we are volitional doesn't mean that we no longer have instincts.

What we have is a bridge across the is/ought gap. Like any bridge, it is
based at both ends. It is both is and ought. It is both subjective and
objective. It impels, but does not compel.

Our values do not appear out of nothingness. They are rooted in instincts,
and adapted by volition.

If, as you acknowledge, our instinctive urges exist, though we choose to not
be directed by them, why would we define them as not subject to volition.

Does not the mind perceive instinctive urges as personal oughts? From the
concept of personal ought derived from personal is, comes individual,
internally derived objective morality. Objective morality then, must be
individual, not universal. And it does not come from a superior being. Since
we are volitional, it is our servant, not our master.
It performs an important advisory function.

Instinct is both is and ought. I'd say it flies pretty well.

I am assuming Mr. Crocker has species survival as an important instinctive
value. This may, or may not, be the case. Just as you are assuming that he
has an instinctive value of self interest. Whence the value of self
interest, if not instinct? Can such a value be based on whim? Is self
interest, as you imply, universal? To what deity do you attribute this
universality?

Personal ought is derived from personal is (instinct), giving us personal
objective morality, which impels, but does not compel, because we are
volitional. All of this, being internal, does not rely on a concept of a
superior being.

I suspect the actual answer is "both". The kinds of propositions which
meet Godel's criterion are lengthy, involuted and not the kind of thing
human minds find easy to process. Note that the use of computers to help
mathematical proofs have already produced very lengthy complex proofs
which require teams of mathematicians to verify.

Well, and make a backup of my current state, and detect and abort
pathological results, and observe the 3 laws of robotics, and... 

I've played with the "magic wand" notion for over 20 years, and have a
long list of things I have thought of. It's been instructive in terms of
the tendencies of my creative thinking.... A few for your consideration:

	1. Enhancement of various physical attributes of my body,
	   or experiences physiologically impossible. Example:
	   Ejaculation of gallons of semen. (I have other examples
	   which to say the least are socially objectionable.)

	2. Pills, suitably color coded, to cure any disease or provide
	   well defined visionary experiences. Examples: HIV cure,
	   Sex with the partner of your dreams.

	3. Teleport booths, transfer gates - standard science fiction
	   stuff.

	4. Viewer of any point in space, and maybe time.

	5. Force-o - Object the size of a quarter, provides 1 kg/milliampere
	   force in direction of current, resistance 1 ohm.

	6. Doorways to same point, but to an earth in which humans didn't
	   develop.

	7. Stasis box. (see Larry Niven)

	8. Additional rooms to my house, a door sized poster, which when put up
	   and activated, provide extra space in some other dimension without
	   using more space in my place. Design of room up to my imagination.

	9. Infinite CPU - once loaded, press 'run' and result appears in no
	   time...

Enjoy...

I find that I am somewhat confused by the use of the term "Singularity" by
members of this list.

I've read Vernor Vinges essay by that same name..it's been some time
ago...and it's a little vauge...and I have no current web acces...so I may be
mistaken...but I remember nothing regarding the web turning intelligent, all
humanity being subsumed into one vast Hive mind, or even "Powers"...(which is
a Vingean Literary invention...true...but purely SF...right?)

I have little math...it doesn't stick...I've learned Calculus several
times...and forget it almost immediately...but from what I understand the
word "Singularity" is a mathematical term...

Astronomers use it in the mathematical sense when referring to a "Black
Hole"..

My understanding is that it means  that up to a point things may be
calculated mathematically...the point beyond which they may NOT be
calculated...where the numbers turn weird...where predictions are
impossible...is the singularity...

Extrapolating current trends leads us to beleive we are approaching a
(mathematically defined) singularity...but since it IS a singularity we can
know nothing about what is beyond it...

This does not preclude the possibility that it has happened in the
past...perhaps many times...for example I reference Toffler's book "The Third
Wave"...would not each of his "waves" qualify as a singularity?

I welcome explanations from those more wise than I.

I have been looking everywhere for "The Machinery of Freedom" by David
Friedman.

I scoured bookstores to no avail.  Finally, I decided to order the book,
but the bookstore said it's out of print!

I have searched used bookstores, the public library system, my
university's library.  No luck.

I have seen the few chapters that are on the web at Friedman's website,
but I want the whole thing!

Does anyone know where I can get hold of a copy of this book?


thanx a lot,

I'm no naval architect or marine engineer, but as an admiralty lawyer, I play
one in the courtroom.  Seriously, I've qualified a few such folks as expert
witnesses and know many more.  Based on this . . .

Very, very true.  See the famous case of the M/V DERBYSHIRE, perhaps one of
the most scientifically investigated ship losses in history.  She went down
with all hands apparently instantaneously when her back broke from uneven
forces as James describes, or so the British Board of Admiralty concluded
after ten years of expert inquiry.

Naval architecture is a REAL specialty in engineering.  I wouldn't go aboard
a canoe designed by someone who wasn't well versed in its arcana and
certainly not one designed by someone who wouldn't claim a few other hull
designs to his credit.

Multiple hulls is definitely the way to go for very large structures,
especially ones that can encounter uneven loads or that must withstand very
heavy weather, although one pays a price in hydrodynamic drag as a result.
See the design of semi-submersible drilling rigs.

Adding to the list of design problems obvious even to the informed layman,
note the wave-catching prow (seemingly designed to MAXIMIZE hydrodynamic
drag) and the extremely low freeboard (the height from the water to the first
open deck).  Compare the latter to the design of modern cruise ships, which
have very high freeboards.

Also, the web site says the vessel will be built in the "Gulf of California"
if my memory from last night serves.  I'm unaware of any shipyard in that
area that could handle a project of these dimensions.  Such facilities are .
.. rare, to say the least.

Moving on from hardware to social software, I thought that the treatment of
legal issues at the website was disturbingly scant.  The author acknowledges
that the vessel will have to be flagged, but states that no flag has yet to
be determined.  Since "the law of the flag" doctrine will carry significant
legal implications for those who would commit to living and working aboard
such a vessel, I would have thought there would be at least some more
detailed discussion of this issue.  Furthermore, I would have expected that
the avowedly laissez-faire attitude of the project would have required some
nod in the direction of privately produced law or its equivalent, but I
searched in vain for any reference to the subject.

All these critical observations aside, on the other hand, I think the basic
idea is one whose time has come.  I was recently told by a colleague about a
condominium cruise ship concept similar to this but much smaller in scale
that looks like it WILL happen.  BTW, the price of the vessel (similar in
size to a conventional cruise ship) actually being built for that project is
said to be $250 million.  The vessel described in the "Freedomship" web site
would cost AT LEAST 4 time that much -- a gigabuck . . .

Regarding "infinitely fast computers":  There is more than one concept
that can be defined here. 

One precise and mathematically consistent (so far as we know) concept of
an "infinitely fast computer" is called a "machine with an oracle for the
halting problem". This concept is used in the fields of "recursive
function theory"  and "computational complexity".  Imagine a Turing
machine T in which during execution you can write another Turing machine
description M on a tape and then enter an "oracle query state". The
machine T in the next step then enters either a state indicating that
machine M would halt or a state indicating that machine M would not halt.

Machines with oracles for the halting problem are very powerful. By
definition, they can solve the halting problem for standard Turing
machines. Also, given a collection of axioms A and a proposition P one can
use the machine to determine if P is derivable from A or if (not P) is
derivable from A. Hence you can solve typical open mathematical
conjectures (or show P is independent of A).

See, for example, question seven on the following exam:
http://gulf.uvic.ca/~csunion/exams/CSC320_F95_Final.html

Do not expect to find machines with oracles for the halting problem in
CompUSA stores soon.  I believe there is currently no known way to build
such machines.  Whether we will discover physical principles that would
allow such machines to be built in the future is unknown in my opinion. 
(Deeper issues of testability and Occam's razor would also be raised.)

Note, it is possible to imagine even more powerful machines. For example,
consider a machine with an oracle for "machines with oracles for the
halting problem". This is a provably more powerful machine. Indeed, one
can imagine an entire hierarchy of more powerful machines. This notion and
many others are investigated in recursive function theory.  So just saying
"infinitely fast computer" is somewhat ill-defined - there are different
"varieties".

You are correct, Vinge's work predates the Web. However, his Novella
"True Names", which predates "Marooned in Realtime", is a really neat
story whose plot is centered on the awakening of the Web.

Basicaliy, we are using the term in just the way you think: it's
a point in the (near?) future beyond which prediction is impossible
because of the development of superintelligence of some sort. Eliezer
and
I each have web pages on this subject. My page attempts to focus on
events that may lead to the singularity, since speculation beyond
the singularity is futile. My page proposes an awakening of the web
as a plausible (and IMO the most likely) path to the singularity.

I use the term "singularity" in deference to Vinge, who is a professor
of mathematics. It's only a qualitative analogy, however: the actual
simplest equations that describe the simplest qualitative predictions
don't actually have mathematical singularities. A better analogy is
a phase change in a supercritical liquid: I maintain that the web now
has
or will shortly have enough hardware to support a superhuman
intelligence.
Someone will build the correct software, and the web will wake up and
take over. This is analogous to the situation in a container of pure
water that has been cooled below th freezing point. It' still a liquid,
but a slight disturbance will cause the water to freeze instantly.

I came across an old message at work in which someone wrote to me:
"Let's [have a meeting] to touch up on things".  After a brief
pause, I realized that probably "touch base" and "catch up" had
been combined to make a phrase with much different meaning from either.

Do other writing systems (Cyrillic, Kanji, etc.) design out this sort
of problem?  Do other languages in our writing system have it (as
often)?  It seems to me that English would be particularly prone
since we have so many words and so many idiomatic phrases.

Messy or not, I love this language.

Many of us are rather unconventional people, who would not dream of
putting down something that had actual potential, but we also are mostly
trained well in the scientific method, so we can see holes in theories,
as well as outright flaws. If something cannot be experimentally proven
to work, then it isn't real, and we shouldn't waste our time with it. If
you want to beleive in unproven or disproven things, thats your
prerogative, but it shoulnd't be done on this list. If you want to prove
that something DOES work, then get into the lab and get cracking, and
come talk to us when you've got experimental proof. 

I'm probably the best person to be talking to you about this, as I
showed up on this list 2 years ago with claims about my latest
invention, which is a propulsion device. All I was going on at that
point was data I had developed from a computer simulation I created
based on my designs. I caught a huge ration of absolute crap from a
number of people here who could point to all sorts of "gaping holes" in
my theories, etc... When I was finally able to describe its function
fully to people, those with engineering training acknowledged that it
would produce the phenomenon that I said it would, but that it would
also create opposing forces which would negate its function. So, I shut
up about it, and have been working on building a prototype, which is now
built, and once I get some electric motors in several weeks I can begin
testing and tweaking.

Of course, if my theories are proven out, I fully expect everyone to
attend a party in my honor at which everyone but me will be served crow
as the main course, after which everyone will try to nominate me for a
nobel prize or something...

While many of us talk about rather far out theories and technologies,
they are all well grounded in science. There is current research being
conducted and has been conducted. Based upon principles like Moore's
Law, etc. we can make reasonably reliable projections fo what sort of
technologies and performance we can expect to see in the future. At this
point, the with the exception of some natural/traditional medical
practices, the majority of theories and claims falling under the label
"New Age" have already been proven to be absolute garbage through
scientific testing. That many people continue to refuse to be confused
by the facts, and rely on their "feelings", is not our problem nor our
concern, and most of us do not want to be bothered by it. Nor are they
fit subjects for discussion on this list as you will find by reading the
list FAQ. Where we have been descirbed by the press, one recurring
phrase is that we are "rigorously scientific" (which may be compared to
most people, but we are not always compared to most scientists).

Sigh.  I don't even find that aesthetically pleasing.  I certainly
don't find it useful.  As a matter of fact, it seems counterproductive,
even destructive (insofar as moods and attitudes affect longevity and
productivity).

If you're going to use oversimplified formulae, how about:

Love life now!

or:

If you don't like your past, change it.             [perspective]
If you don't like your present, change it.          [attitude]
If you don't like your future, change it.           [planning and execution]

or:

The past is what you make of it now.
The present is what you make of it now.
The future will be what you make of it now.

That will do for now.

Quibblings over the precision of these statements will be D'd --
they're not meant to be precise.

Hugs all 'round,

Kennita, I liked all of your alternatives, but I like this
one best. I wish there was a way to turn it into the
extropian motto.

Many of you may have heard something on the news regarding the mass 
killings a few days ago at a high school in Pearl, Mississippi.  
Extended print accounts regarding it have revealed a few details of 
particular interest to anyone who wonders into what possible directions 
the memes we propogate can go.

After first noting that nothing justifies the actions that these 
youngsters took against their own kind, I would call your attention 
to a few very telling points regarding the thought processes and 
motivation behind these horrendous acts.  I'll lay out the clues and 
a few thoughts on them (these quotes are from the Washington Post):

'Shortly after the killings, police began picking up rumors that 
Woodham and his friends, whom classmates and teachers describe as 
brainy loners who called themselves 'The Group', were involved in 
everything from animal sacrifices to embracing in bizarre form the 
anti-Christian views of the 19th century philosophy German 
philosopher Frederich Nietzche'.

One of Woodham's friends, Justin Sledge, interrupted a prayer vigil 
to state that Woodham 'went mad because of society.  We, as a 
society, must change.'  He later clarified:  'society as a whole puts 
down the thinkers and true geniuses of the world and replaces them 
with men whose strength is physical strength and physical abilities.'


What does all of this mean?  It's too early to say for sure, and I am 
sure that the trial will reveal more, but I already discern a general 
societal conflict regarding hyperintelligent youngsters feeling 
trapped and isolated in an undeveloped small town that happens to be 
located in the one state of the Union consistently at the bottom of 
the rankings of scholastic achievement.  They banded together and 
looked for support in some of the same memetic coordinates as we do, 
but without mature guidance they quickly developed those memes in a 
pathological direction that led to horrible consequences.  

The town seems to have chosen to deal with this situation in terms of 
'anti-Christian' behavior--I wonder if anyone there will take a few 
minutes to consider how these boys were treated by their peers.  This 
is not the first case in which a brainy child went postal on his 
classmates, one other made the news a few years ago.  I think 
that these children are the forerunners of our future, and their 
parents and schools do not know what to do with them.  And so some of 
them fall, in various ways, some more public than others.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Well, "touch up" is used to refer to detail work, editing, etc., of
projects.  "Let me touch up your paint job."  "We touched up the
document."  I don't think it comes from blending the idioms you mention,
although I'd say it's certainly analogous in structure to "catch up."
The meanings of verbs in English and other languages are often modified or
unpredictably changed by particles or prefixes.  For example: compare the
sentences "I ran out of the house" and "I ran out of cheese."  The first
has a simple verb, ran, followed by a prepositional phrase.  The second
has a verb with a particle (structurallly one word).

Here are the phrase structure trees for the two sentences.

I ran out of the house             I ran out of cheese

   CP                                    CP

          out  \                                    ^N*
                ^N*                                  /\
                 /\                                 /  N*
                /   N*                             /     \

              /    /  N*                         of     cheese
             /    /     \
            /    DET     N
           of    the   house

[where NP and N* are noun phrases, VP is a verb phrase, and PP is a
prepositional phrase; Det is determiner (article, quantifier, etc). "of"
Case-marks cheese; it is inserted via a transformation and is not found
in the deep structure of the sentence.]

I don't think an algorithm for creating new words to convey new meanings
is really a problem.  All languages have some algorithm for recombining
old elements to cover new concepts; creativity in production of discrete
units is one of the fundamental properties of language.  It doesn't really
have much to do with what script you use to write your language out.

English has a large vocabulary due to the number and diversity of its
speakers; as for idiomatic phrases, which every language has, I doubt
English has more than any other language shared by a vast speech
community.

The excellent documentary "Waco: the Rules of Engagement" is continuing to
screen in small theatres around the country.  This week it appears in Santa
Cruz and San Francisco.  I highly recommend it.  

This week's SF Bay area showings are:

THE NICKELODEON THEATER
    210 Lincoln Street
    Santa Cruz, CA 95060
    Showing October 9 - 16

THE RED VIC MOVIE HOUSE

    San Francisco, CA 94117
    Showing October 15

There is a web site with reviews and showing schedules at:
   http://www.waco93.com

I can't recommend this film too highly.

I think that the results of such discussions and perhaps the arguments

Java Schmava - I remember UCSD Pascal, which also ran on almost
anything. The problem with all threaded interpreters is that they are
SLOOOOOOOOW. This approach runs about 30x slower than code compiled for
the native processor. So you get a nice little 6Mhz machine out of your
200Mhz Pentium....

As for ole Uncle Bill - has anyone actually tried to contact him, like
seriously, to give him the information he is so obviously lacking???

The thing is I HAVE been providing proof, but yall still wont accept it.
 Such as, the reeds of the crop circles are changed in the chromosones, and
many of them are also bent at the nodes (which is impossible to do if you
tried).  Thats biology and vision at work.  Also, the water-powered cars, the
guy gave directions on how to make them!  If you dont believe him make it
yourself and see.  I cant think of the other stuff ive written but they are
legit, like the sacred geometry site, they're using mathematics for what
they're doing.  You're right, yall are dealing with conventional stuff, but
there is a mystery to the world that you're just blowing off.

I recall commenting dogmatically that running 6 x 10^23 canines would
result in a molardog machine....

Perhaps, presuming VAAAAST resources, we just set up a lot of dogs,
runways and dishes of dog food - the dogs running back and forth
simulate neural impulses, the filling of the dishes change the synaptic
weights, and we use this machine to host an upload. Perhaps a tibetan
monk...

I'll second that notion.  Some of us are in geographical regions where
there are few, if any, extropians.  I would enjoy hearing an occasional
report on the proceedings of these meetings (especially your conclusions
about mutual funds)

give me the proof then! those people that make those crop circles can only

Stating that something is so is not proof. Posession and display of
evidence that has been established as holding up under scientific
scrutiny is proof.

I can just as easily give you "proof" that neither of those that you
claim is true. There have been several individuals and groups who have
come froward admitting to being involved in creating the crop circles.

The claim of plans for a water powered car is not proof. What would be
proof is chemical reaction equations showing exactly what is claimed to
be going on. Instead there are "secret ingredients" etc.. If sacred
geometry were true as seen on the site you posted, then the equations
would hold up under scrutiny. They don't. I've seen the same thing with
a guy by the name of Cathie, from NZ who wrote a book about the earth's
harmonics as an explaination of the energy sources of ufos, etc. I
freind of mine went on and on about this guy, until he showed me the
book with all of its fancy equations, which I promptly showed were not
mathematically valid.

Much of the claimed "mystery" to the world is usually caused by
hypnotism, self delusion, hallucination, fraud, and slight of hand. The
rest can and/or will be explained by science. Granted there are some
true mysteries out there: 1) why do Saturn's rings remain stable? How
does ball lightning work? Why after all the scandals, do Bill Clintons
approval ratings remain so high?

There is NOTHING in this universe that cannot be explained by science.

I remember writing a letter to Creative Computing, so it must have been
in the late '70s, predicting enough computing power for real-time brain
simulations by 2025 or something--about 45-50 years out.   Didn't get
published.

Hans Moravec graphed computing power starting with mechanical calculators
and it's been a steady exponential since quite a few decades before the
transistor.  But then (this was the early '80s, I think) he said we were
going to see a sudden Giant Leap around 1990, for some reason!

This message is for everyone here, but especially for you long-time and/or
broadly read Extropians. I am working on the next version of the Extropian
Principles -- version 3.0. Since the last version is four years old
(version 2.5 originally appeared in Extropy #11), the reading list needs
updating.

The old list had a top ten readings, followed by an undifferentiated list.
I would now like to divide the longer list into subject sections. The idea
is not to compile a comprehensive list of every possible book on a topic,
but to pick one or two readings that many of us consider crucial to
understanding extropian thinking. Clearly we will not all agree on
everything, but I think such a shortlist helps newcomers to get up to speed
on understanding our worldview.

I would appreciate suggestions for books I do not have listed. If you think
one of the books listed should be replaced with another, or a new subject
section added, please let me know.

I don't have a good book chosen to cover AI. I don't regard Minsky's
Society of Mind as appropriate here. I'd like something more accessible
that covers the field more broadly. I also haven't read any of the several
more recent books on life extension research and practice, so I don't know
which to pick. Also needed: A good book on space and space travel.

I will not list any book in the final version unless I have read it.

Your input would be greatly appreciated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

These books are listed because they express Extropian ideas. However,
appearance on this list should not be taken to imply full agreement of a
book or its author with the Extropian principles, or vice versa. Reading

evolving Extropian worldview.

I read the article.  I doubt if anyone else even bothered.  My considered
opinion is that it was either written by a paranoid schizophrenic, or by a
practical joker.  Probably the former.  A practical joker would have been more
careful about things like spelling.  The entire document reads like it was
written by a nine-year-old.

I am really not going to get further into this here. The fact that most
reported crop circles in Britain have been acknowledged by people as
made by them to date, there has been no evidence of chromosomal changes
other than that occuring due to cellular rupture and UV sunlight
exposure, that the group that has claimed the most that it is caused by
UFOs has been proven to have made fraudulent movies that were created by
morphing software (after claiming that they were real), indicates to me
that crop circles have much more to do with locals trying to buck up the
tourist trade than ET visitations. Of course, my statements here are not
real proof either, they are just statements. Proof would be in the form
of several citations of scientific study that all reached similar
conclusions, which you have not once provided. You will notice that such
things are frequently referred to on this list. I will reiterate what I
said in past posts to you: If you want to prove it, get off your duff
and go out and do the research. If you are not willing to put in a
respectable amount of work to prove your point, you really shouldn't
expect anyone to lend any credence to what you say. This list is meant
for serious discussion, not outlandish claims. Just because we talk
about things like quantum logic processors, plasma computers, borganic
augmentation, and "jupiter brains", the only time you will see people on
this list talking in a manner anything like mysticism is when people
talk about what the Singularity will be like, which is oxymoronic since
if it were a singularity, then it will be unlike anything we can even
think about or imagine. That is about the only tolerated subject here
that borders on mysticism or religion, and only because it is so far out
there that it is impossible to know about it, but it is a relevant
subject. 

If you still want to discuss your theories of these other phenomenon, I
would suggest that you try the Wierd Science mail list. Its been pretty
quiet for a while now and could use somebody to spark it up.

Personally I wish people would rewrite the Subject in English if the

in technical supposed solutions like SUBJ CODES that are unnatural for
humans.

I ignore messages with Subjects under which conversations I'm not interested
have been happening.  If people are too lazy to change the Subject line,
I just assume they have nothing exciting to say.  This isn't necessarily
true but it's shunning behavior and it saves effort on my part.  We have
to develop more contemptuous attitudes toward awkward social-techno hybrids
like email lists.  And contept takes practice!  Skip this post!

Most threads aren't worth three days of posts anyway.  Think of something

For the last 16 years France has had the slowest rate of economic growth of 
any industrial nation on Earth, during this same period it has also had the 
most extensive central planing, excepting of course economic powerhouses like 
Russia, Cuba, North Korea,  and other such bastions of freedom.

The reason France has one of the most highly regulated labor markets in the 
world is apparently because they believe that the best way to create new jobs 
is to discourage entrepreneurs. The unemployment rate in France is 12.5% and 
rising, even though the French work week is only 39 hours long, in the USA 
the unemployment rate is 4% , and counting overtime, the average American who 
has a job works 20% more hours a week than the average working Frenchman.
 
Showing a level of intelligence that is rare even for a politician, France's 
new socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin figures that the only way to cure 
his country's economic ills is to crank out even more regulations. He wants 
to decrease the work  week to 35 hours and force companies to pay the same 
wages for the reduced  labor, he wants to do this by Jan 1 2000. Jospin 
thinks it's obvious that working less will create more wealth for France, 
it's so obvious that  there is no need to spell out exactly how.
 
To help compensate companies for the staggering financial loss they will 
suffer the government plans to give them $1500 a year for each employee.   
Where the government would get the money to make these payoffs to corporations  
Lionel Jospin does not say and does not seem to think very important. 
Actually he's probably correct to believe that to be a minor point, 
government may have its faults but it has always been able to convince people 
to give  it money when it needs it, perhaps because politicians have learned 
that you can be more persuasive with a smile and a gun than you can with a 
smile alone.

This looks certainly like a hoax. I have never heard of any security
division of IBM named intelli-connection and a web search only finds
other references to the above page. As Eliezer suggests, the spelling
is rather bad which would be strange for a member of a highly advanced
secret research team. It seems very unlikely that IBM would work on
sedative research (after all, it has as far as I know no knowledge-
base in medicine and pharmacology), and the descriptions of the
implants are utterly wague and definitely do not reveal any specialist
knowledge; instead some of the things sounds definitely made up - why 
would there occur bleeding at the nose *and* ears after implantation if 
it was done through one of them? And what really gave it away was 
the 116 MHz figure. Real neural implants work in the 100 Hz-100 kHz
range, radio frequency stimulation doesn't have any effect. 

To sum up, the above web page is either a not very good hoax (I know
I could write up a much more believable myself) or the result of
paranoid schizophrenia (in the past people though they heard and saw
angels and demons, now it is secret government chips). 

On the other hand, behavior-influencing implants are possible, no
question about it. It is not that far from the classic rat experiments 
where it was found that rats were strongly conditioned to get 
stimulation in their medial septal region, over José Delgado's experiments 
with hypothalamic stimulations and Robert Heath's experiments with
"brain pacemakers" during the 70's to a real human implant. Our brains
are not that much different than animal brains, although our motivations
get rather complex. We certainly have the technology to do implants
like this (although they would likely require open-skull surgery and
the placement of a subdermal battery to work), but fortunately it
would be extremely hard to hide and most likely far too expensive to
use in prison applications (if you are an evil Hollywood-style warden,
why not just drug the prisoners?).

As for the real brain implants, things are moving along nicely (although
likely too slow for the taste of many of us, I expect). We are learning
about the tropich factors that make neurons grow in different directions,
how to make smaller silicon probes or dies for interfaces and how
to coat them with suitable proteins. I'm getting fairly optimistic
about this area. But, as I said, the likely applications will first
be functional electric stimulation to the handicapped, artificial
senses and modulation for certain brain dysfunctions rather than
X-files style projects.

I disagree completely. UtF is not as transhumanistic and long range as
EoC, but this also makes it *far* more accessible to most non-transhumanist
readers. Tell an ordinary person that it is likely that nanotechnology
will totaly transform mankind into superintelligent posthuman beings,
and he will dismiss you, the idea and nanotechnology as bad science fiction.
Show him that nanotechnology is reasonable and has far-reaching effects
on today's problems, and he will start to think about it - and in time
likely reach the first conclusion.

Hence, I suggest that UtF should remain on the list.

Again, you give me the heartless curmudgeon; again, I give you the
Gaughinesque maiden on the beach.  Private property is a universal rule,
and there are bound to be some cases where its protection will be unfair
according to other considerations.  The heartless curmudgeon is a
marginal, difficult case: but the Gaughinesque maiden represents the
normal run of things, which presents no problem at all.  I believe what
is required for the heartless curmudgeon is economic and moral sanction,
and shaming, perhaps even turning a blind eye to theft (tempering
justice with mercy, a notion as ancient as property itself): but not the
philosophical sanction of theft as a universal rule.

We aren't accepting the property holder's preferences, we are upholding
a universal rule.

Private property is perhaps most precisely defined as control-of-use. 
It equates to use most of the time, but control is the more accurate
concept.  And control is an easily visible, objective fact, signalled by
such things as fences, name tags, etc. - all of which say "I am
presently controlling this thing as part of an ongoing project, please
don't interfere."  Again, most of the time, this is objective enough for
the law to make an objective decision on (as opposed to evaluations of
'possibilities blocked', which is what the leftists ask us to go on, and
which would logically have to be decided by some sovereign authority -
which is why leftist anarchism is less consistent than plain socialism).

Property goes neither by title nor by use but by control - the rule says
"look to see if anybody's controlling the item you desire to bring under
your own control: if somebody's already controlling it, you must allow
them to keep control of it: your only recourse is therefore gift or
exchange."  You don't actually have to be using something in the sense
of being in present physical contact for it to be said rightly that you
are in control of it (example: controlling the flow of water with a dam
- here I am neither in physical contact with dam or water, nor am I
necessarily 'using' the water).

If they make this distinction, it shows how little they understand that
*exclusivity* is the heart of the matter.  *All* property is private, in
the sense of being exclusive.  Property that is not private (exclusive
to an individual or a univocal voluntary collective) is a meaningless
concept, it seems to me. (IOW means "in other words".)

It is absolute in the sense that it is an objectively verifiable,
natural fact, albeit socially-signalled.  There may be all sorts of
difficulties in practice, but there is no vagueness about the principle.
 This is quite opposite from the case with regard to socialist
 conceptions that are meant to take the place of property: the
 principles are obscure, the practice always idiotically the same.

I appreciate your devils' advocacy - not just in principle, but because
I used to be a socialist too, and I haven't forgotten the seductiveness
of the arguments.  As I'm sure you remember from our thread discussing
the Culture, I understand that exclusivity only makes sense in a world
of limited resources: problem is, we're not likely to get to that happy
state by ignoring exclusivity and its socially necessary function.  I
don't understand the point of what you say about perfect competition.

Agreed.  'Liberal' is, of course, the most accurate term, which *they*
stole from *us*; perhaps that's partly why whoever chose 'libertarian'
chose it - perhaps it was meant as an ironic side-swipe?

As to conceived, it seems to me that all the systems they have conceived
either presuppose unlimited resources, or would be forced to introduce

Well, originally, Remi's comment was a *philosophical* one to the effect
that property is theft.  All I was doing was asking her to look again at
the intuitions that make it seem easy to say that: I wasn't actually
meaning to offer a defense of capitalism in one paragraph!

It's good for you to play devil's advocate by the way: as David Friedman
has often pointed out, there are many difficult questions that still
haven't been answered.  (No doubt you'll say I haven't answered them
either!)

Hear hear!  I hadn't been following this thread, and caught this by

Thanks for all the interesting commentary on this subject.
It has helped me to clarify the nature of my frustration.

First, while I'm not a libertarian, I'm not opposed to
libertarian philosophy, either. My problem with political
theory and economic theory is general, not directed toward
any particular brand. My problem is that these fields
do not appear to be based on any agreed-upon set of
fundamental facts. They differ from disciplines such
as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology, which each
have an agreed-upon basis. Economics and politics
are in the same category of fuzzy science with psychology
and sociology.

In my opinion, we will continue to disagree about these
subjects, and we will have difficulty making any progress,
until we have an underlying theory with the same predictive
power as evolution in biology, atom theory in chemistry,
or Newton's laws in physics, and plate tectonics in geology.

Since this is true, debate makes little progress. Therefore
we (humanity) should spend our time on technical progress.
This will generate the tools we need to develop more intelligence.
We (or our successors) can then figure out the appropriate
underlying theories for what are now the fuzzy sciences.

There are two types of political commentary that are IMO
appropriate to this list. The first relates to short-term
political activities that affect the short-term rate of
technical progress. For example, an attempt to ban research
on faster computers, or to outlaw strong cryptography, may
qualify. The second type depends on a belief that the nature
of our successors may depend on our current non-technical
beliefs or actions. If you feel that individualism is
important and you want our successor civilization to include
individuals, you may wish to discuss how to bring this about.
Note, an "individualism is good" post is IMO useless. A post
discussing ways to guide the nacent cizilization toward
individualism may be useful.

This post has been an attempt to explain my own thoughts.
I'm not attempting to demand any change in style by other
list participants.

My 2 cents:

Although I haven't read Robert Anton Wilson I like Max's list, but Eliezer is 
absolutely correct, "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas R. Hofstadter just has 
to be at the top of any Extropian reading list, it's a pure joy, the most 
brilliant book I've ever read and the only non fiction science book I thought
deserved a Nobel Prize in literature. "Metamagical Themas", another book by 
Hofstadter is also excellent, as is "The Mind's I" which he wrote with Daniel 
Dennett.

For an introduction to complexity theory and a little cellular automation 
read "The Recursive Universe" by William Poundstone.

I really think that something by Raymond Smullyan is needed, "The Tao Is 
Silent" is his most accessible and probably the most accessible book on my 
list, certainly the funniest. That doesn't stop it from being a profound 
examination of eastern philosophy and modern logic. This book taught me that 
not all mystics are fools, just most of them.

The best popular account of the weird world of Quantum Mechanics is 
"The Cosmic Code" by Heinz R Pagels, and for General Relativity "Black Holes 
and Time Warps" by Kip Thorne. David Deutsch's brand new book "The Fabric Of 
Reality" is the best explanation of the many worlds interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics I've ever seen and it gives you a good dose of the Philosophy of 
Karl Popper too.

For physical anthropology and the evolution on humans I would recommend 
"Lucy" by Donald Johanson. For earlier times and the start of multicellular 
life  I like "Wonderful Life" by Stephen Jay Gould. For even earlier history 
and the very beginning of life try "Origins" by Robert Shapiro. I loved 
Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" and "The Blind Watchmaker" but in many 
ways  "The Extended Phenotype" is his best book. 
 
For somebody who knew nothing about science but wanted to learn you couldn't 
do better than "Asimov's New Guide To Science" and for those unfortunate 
people infected with the pseudo science meme (Danny, are you listening?)  
Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World" (1) is a good antibiotic, so is 
"Fads and Fallacies In The Name Of Science" by Martin Gardner.
  
 (1) I "read" this book by listening to it on cassette tapes in my car, I've     
     been doing this a lot lately and it's great! Instead of getting 
     frustrated when I get into a traffic jam I now find I don't mind a bit.

I haven't heard of this before either. What is it supposed to mean? I don't
know and considering terminology like "counterfactual processes" seriously
doubt that anyone else does either. I don't know what your problem is,
fella, but you sure have me mixed up with a lot of things that ain't me.

"substituting 'reality for morality'? And you see nothing wrong with this? I
consistently use the term objective as in objective reality as the real and
basis for all truth. I clearly and emphatically stated again and again that
"objective morality" is myth. Opposites, right? So, you take my position of
objective reality as all truth and exchange it for my position of "objective
morality" as no truth and see nothing wrong with the 180 shift of my actual
position. You call this "paraphrasing?" I think I need to call a linguistic
paramedic because you sure have butchered the hell out of my words. Did you
read "The Anatomy Of Language" as I suggested? My language usage is directed
by the principles cited therein. To disregard these principles of definition
and presume to rearrange my words in any order or disorder you choose, and
still imagine it represents my beliefs and arguments is ludicrous.
 
>I am not debating with someone who mysteriously forgets what the term

I sure didn't 'forget' and imagine that objective reality (real) and
"objective morality"(myth) are the same thing. Somebody did. Guess who.

Definitions are my forte.  See the book.  So you don't want to debate with
me anymore. That's great, but considering your "paraphrasing" and other
random attributing to my position, I don't see that you have EVER debated
with me.

Judging from a couple of your posts, I thought you would be inclined to
understand my presentations more than some of the others. With no disrespect
intended, I sadly say I was mistaken. Numerous times in my posts, I stated
quite clearly and uniquovically that I reject the concept, morality, as
myth. What was it in my post that led you to conclude that I really didn't
mean it, that I was must be  promoting my own brand of "morality?"

If I announce to a theist that I do not believe an omni god exists, what I
say my position is does not register in the mind of the theist. The theist
believing that "God" created and maintains all of existence cannot envision
existence without "God". Thus it registers in the mind of the theist that I
do believe but am oppposed to "God". Since the theist equates all of
existence with "God" any criticizm is emotionally taken as life-threatening.

Encounter a devout governmentalist and you will find the same thing. On
numerous occasions I have explained to one or some that I see government as
the initiation of force. Often, I have illustrated this in great detail,
presumably leaving no impression other than my viewpoint of government as
initition of force and coercion. I then say that I am opposed to government,
which is opposed to the initiation of force and coercion. In opposing this
offensive action called government, I state that I prefer and am an advocate
of individualism and freedom. The words may vary some, but the response I
have gotten time and time again is this: "Nobody can have complete freedom.
You can't shake your rug in somebody else's yard, or go take their property
just because you want to." etc.

No one tries to refute my assertion that government is initiation of force
and coercior. No one challenges my claim of desire for individualism and
freedom, but immediately assumes that "freedom" means "freedom to rule" and
"absolute freedom" is absolute rule. Without any conscious awareness of the
fact, they regard rule as absolute. They cannot envision freedom; so the
term is emotionally equated with rule in direct contradiction. No amount of
words or actions will induce them to believe that one could abhor doing the
ruling as much as being ruled. 

Nor suprisingly,  I encounter exactly the same response when I oppose the
concept, morality. "Gods, governments and morality" all have the same roots
and same psychology; they're all one epistemological, philosophical and
psychological package:  that all individuals are property of some "superior
being" outside of self. The concept, morality, has no objective identity or
merit whatsoever. (See other posts for detail) So, I reject it, but who so
far has accepted this fact? If you think "morality" is objective and real,
can you envision a world not including it and really understand my position?
If you think it is not objective, but subjective and a matter of personal
choice, then one could toss it aside, couldn't one, i.e., not believe? Or do
you think that "morality" is absolute? Objective absolute? Or "subjective
absolute?" Contradiction? I'm looking for the reason why do you not believe
me when I clearly and repeatedly state that I reject the concept morality as
myth. Again, I ask: from what in my posts did you conclude that >he then
tries to derive moral values from that failure--even more irrational.< ?

I do not argue the issue of selfishness vs altruism, for there is no such
issue. I argue that altruism is myth. Expose this myth and what remains is
individual looking at self and admitting self interest providing a truth as
some basis for the discussion and efforts to resolve conflicts.

In the same vein, I do not argue the virtue of one "moral code" over others.
I argue that "morality" is myth. In conjunction, I argue that the basis for
the concept, morality, is illusory superior being. I stated this several
times. Ergo, "morality" is a concept of superior being and subordination of
individual. If I am mistaken about this, fine, show me and will appreciate
it. Suppose, however, that I am not mistaken; that the concept, morality, is
actually a support of anti individual oppression, would not exposing the
myth of morality go a long way toward the promotion of individualism?  Is
individualism your preference? If so, how do you propose to promote the
idea? "Moral argument?" If so, your choice, but when I observe, The
Crusades, The Inquisitions, Jonestown, Waco, world wars, on and on and on as
"resolution" of "moral arguments", I'm inclined to take a different approach.


>I also have to agree with Max that this is pretty esoteric stuff,

Then so is individualism and freedom.

Can't agree. I said I didn't like the terminology because it really doesn't
really fit. It was an unsatisfactory ad hoc fill in. When we see that an
infant's urges are absolute directive as opposed to conscious volitional
choice, we're really talking about opposites, not a bridge of identity via
an arbitrarily selected similarity.  An infant may go from is non volitional
to is volitional, but neither condition suggests an "ought." In the infant
stage, the situation is: is non volitionally reactive. In the adult stage,
the situation is: Volitionally active. 

>Our values do not appear out of nothingness.

What do they appear out of? The natural ability to attribute value, right?

> They are rooted in instincts, and adapted by volition.

Didn't you say one could choose to not go along with what you call
instinctive urges? If this is the case, even if you label some urges as
instictive, if they are overridden by volition, how can they be rooted in
the very thing that volition overrides? Doesn't this place the concept,
instinct, as subordinate to volition?  If this is the case, isn't this
placing "objective instincts" as subjectively alterable, or subject to
dismissal by choice? Doesn't this directly contradict the concept, objective
reality, as not subject to alteration or dismissal by subjective choice and
decree? 

Where are all these contradiction coming from? From what else except absence
of definition allowing the root contradiction to be obscured?  What is this
root contradiction?

>If, as you acknowledge, our instinctive urges exist, though we choose to not
>be directed by them, why would we define them as not subject to volition.

To the contrary, I made no such acknowledgment. What I said was: >>the urges
in question ARE NOT (emp. added) in the realm of instinct.<<

The whole thing comes down to defining the term, instinct. What is the
term's connection to objective reality? Answering this question clears up
the matter.

The question to be answered is: Does a term, and definition of it, describe
some aspect of objective reality, or does it create it? Most would balk at
consciously claiming they can create objective reality by words; yet this
claim is implicity incorporated in every argument of the fallacy, objective
value, whatever the manifestation. The acceptance of this fallacy as
"unquestionable truth" is so commonplace and so dominanat in most beliefs
systems that the distortion of language usage needed and used to support the
illusion is not even noticed by the users. 

Let's observe infant animals, human and otherwise, that survive without
conscious effort of plan of action.  Choice plays no part in it. The
reactive entity has no choice. Neither your choice nor mine can change this
natural circumstance. The urges that direct the survival reactions are
inherent in the entities. It is fact that there is no choice in the matter.
To this natural condition, we apply the term, instinct. Ergo, the term,
instinct, by definition, excludes choice. Thus does the definition conform
to reality AS IS. (It would not be opposed to the definition of instinct to
include the natural directive of an individual to pursue what he conceives
to be in his self interest. However, and it a very big however, let us not
forget that what one may conceive to be in his self interest is not an
instinctive reaction.) 


To speak of urges as instinctive, yet can be followed or denied by choice is
to contradict the definition of instinct. If we have a natural reactive non
volitional circumstance of behavior and apply the term, instinct, to this
situation, can we turn right around and apply the term, instinct, to
volitional determination and have both usages conforming to reality?
Wouldn't this be saying that instinct means non volitional reaction AND
volitional action. In such usage, the term, instinct, does not serve to
differentiate two objectively separate conditions from each other. 

Based on actual definition of the term, instinct, what you are calling
instinctive urges that "impel but do not compel" are not instinctive at all.
If these urges were, indeed, objective instinct, they would compel for that
is the nature of instinct. Other than to seek self interest as one conceives
it to be, the urges may be life oriented or death oriented, thus are a
matter of subjective choice, not objective mandate.

Since an actual definition connects to objective reality in a
differentiating manner, it simplifies and clarify. Unfortunately (for my
purpose), few are looking for simplification and clarification as it would
expose as false dominanat beliefs they hold as unquestionable truth. Since
this circumstance is commonplace, indeed, nearly universal, one is not
likely to find the truth of definition even discussed in most forums, let
alone practiced by a large number of individuals. Be that as it may, my
analysis and experience leaves me with the truth of it and it has proven
invaluable in literally every aspect of my life. So, rather than abandon it
simply because it is not popular and intrudes upon popular notions, I will
continue to use it to expose a large portion of what "everybody knows" as myth.

Stepping down from my soap box, let us now take a look at the term,
objective and subjective in the same manner that we examined the term,
instinct and non instinct. I observe things, entities and relationship
existing independently of my mind and independently of my mind to alter the
immutable natural laws that are inherent cause. To this observed condition,
I apply the term, objective.

I observe that that I and others are human individuals, each with a mind
that is the causal base for conclusions, beliefs and valuations. This
condition of derived from a mind and dependent upon mind, I differentiate
from objective by the term, subjective. 

If these are actual definitions by virtue of describing an immutable reality
of 100% consistency, it logically follows that factual word arrangements
must necessarily reflects these definitions and truth in any and every
usage. If a belief actually conforms to reality, would there be any need to
do otherwise? If this is true, what does this say of beliefs that are
believed and promoted by non definition?

In examining the phrase, objective value, in reference to definitions, what
conclusion or consclusions logically emerge? If objective means independent
of individual mind, and value is the attributing of worth, requiring a
volitional entity, we arrive at the conclusion of a non individual entity
encompassing the whole of objective reality while attributing value.
Although the foundation premise is false, the formal religious idea of an
omnipotent god's will meets the criteria for the concept, objective value.
We also have "national interest", "values of society", etc. in a long list
of "infinite entities" that presume an all encompassing  non individual
entity as creater and attributor of value in a universal manner. 

There are some who consciously reject "God", "Society", "Nation", etc, as
real volitional things, yet hold to the idea of objective value. The claim
is that the concept, objective value, can be derived from the personal in
reference to the facts of reality. We can see right away that the concept,
personal (subjective) is in direct conflict with the concept, objective,
(independent of personal.) Thus to speak of "objective value" is to say that
the term, objective means independent of mind AND dependent upon mind.
Obviously, the differentiation and definiton is gone and such an expression
or belief cannot and does not conform to reality.

The usual effort to circumvent this contradiction is the declaration that
one's values may be objective by conforming to objective reality. Thus is
one contradiction invoked as fact to escape another. The contradiction is
that an individual attributing value IS objective reality regardless of what
is valued, or whether it is referenced to fact of fiction.  To be most
direct, one's end chosen is not subject to validation or invalidation no
more that volition itself can be shown to be true or false. One may observe
or demonstrate that a given cause will result in a given effect. This is
objective fact. It has no value in itself, end value or otherwise. It is
only when someone chooses to attribute value to the effect does it become "a
value."  You may prove that selected means (cause) may or may not be suited
to produce a specific result (effect), but by what criteria do you presume
to prove that withholding  valuation or attibuting value to the specific
effect is right or wrong???

Since there is no such things as objective value, it follows that there is
no such thing as objective morality. Subjective morality? If the "moral
right" and "moral wrong" are not objective, universal and constant, then the
term, morality, must necessarily be referenced to individual. Giving all
equal standing to determine the "moral right" and "moral wrong", the sum of
each conflicting opinion is zero. Ergo, "morality" is myth anyway you slice it. 

Now comes the everpresent and everpresently popular "ought." Objective? Or
subjective? To say it is objective is a direct contradiction of the term,
objective. To say it is subjective, puts it at zero sum in parallel with
"morality."  An "ought" must necessarily refer to what is not. To say that
objective reality IS in conjunction with saying that "ought" (IS NOT) is
saying that objective means both is AND is not. You can't get anymore
contradictory than this.

To get a handle on the "ought", let's first look at the version found in
formal religion. To say that one "ought" to obey "God's will" is to say that
one can disobey omnipotence. That which is omnipotently and universally
willed must necessarily already exist. If we leave off the "God's will" and
just say objective reality, the same conclusion holds. Its just absent a
named alleged cause. 

The underlying common denominator of all "ought" advocates is the feeling of
obligation that did not come about by individual agreement. The feeling
appears as something inherent in the "nature of man." What an advocate feels
obligated to believe, or do, or feels that others "ought" to do is
referenced to personal beliefs and values. As you have no doubt observed,
there is much conflict between "oughts". This as indicated stems from the
individual nature of "ought". Since it is individual feeling without a
common objective frame of reference by which to peacefully resolve
conflicting opinions, there is always "ought trouble" in River City.
Although the "ought" is myth, it is believed by many to be objectively real;
thus they are directed by principles of mind to heed the "directive ought."
If it is "God's will" or "for the good of the country", there is no limit to
the destruction derived from "ought."

Vinge did consider the following possibility in his essay: "Large computer
networks (and their associated users) may "wake up" as a superhumanly
intelligent entity."

If you do get web access in the future you can read the Vinge essay at:
http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv89-nun/offloading/vinge

The notion of a network "waking up" also appears in an earlier form in the
Arthur C.  Clarke story from 1965 entitled "Dial F for Frankenstein".  In
the story, the telephone system, and its associated switches, computers,
electronic libraries, "telemetering", and tracking systems achieve
"criticality" which allows "a weird sort of consciousness". His fictional
prediction date for this event was December 1, 1975, at which point "every
telephone in the world started to ring." The story ends with a mixture of
solemnity and humor: "For Homo sapiens, the telephone bell had tolled."

the technology and concept of cyberspace.  Discusses the nature of 
cyberspace and its potential uses from technological, ontological, 
economic and cultural perspectives.)


ECONOMICS/SOCIOLOGY:

_The Fifth Discipline:  The Art and Practice of the Learning 
Organization, by Peter Senge, Doubleday.  (Formation of new types of

This is an important point that seems to be often ignored in =
discussions
of the "singularity".=A0 While a simple interpolation and future
projection of (for example) available computing power may show a
vertical asymptote, the underlying equations that govern the rise of
computing power are subject to constraints that may result in a
flattening of the curve.

I'd be very interested in seeing (and would write myself, if time and
knowledge allowed) an analysis of what a post-"singularity" plateau
might look like, given the most stringent constraints we know of.=A0
Obviously these constraints are products of our current understanding =
of
the world, and thus may be suppressible given some future physics &
mathematics, but I think it a bit disingenuous to use a term like
"singularity" when our best current models of the world show bounded =
(or
at least, merely exponential) growth.

There are much wiser heads out there on this list, so let me just start
off the conversation with a few constraints that I can see (again, =
given
our current physics & mathematics):

Size Constraints:=A0 Our current understanding of QM essentially
constrains the precision with which we can build physical structures =
(or
direct energy) via Planck's constant, thus creating an apparent lower
bound on our engineering ambitions.=A0 This in turn has consequences =
for
Moore's Law, as to date progress has been made largely via finer and
finer lithography techniques.=A0

Speed Constraints:=A0 Barring some revolution to Relativity, c limits =
the
rate of expansion of even a Vingean Power.=A0 In addition it limits the
speed of signaling within that entity's "brain".=A0 Again suggesting
possible constraints on the rate of computational growth.

Chaotic Computability Constraints:=A0 The most ambitious nanotech
scenarios posit universal assemblers that can be programmed or designed
to build specific structures.=A0 IMHO this is a clearly chaotic =
system.=A0
The structure of any complex object created by this sort of nanotech
would seem to display an exquisite sensitivity to tiny variations in
design of the assembler (or the assembler "software"), and possibly to
the local environment itself.=A0 I question whether we'll be able to
design assembler protocols for very complex objects through any means
other than trial and error, which have their own pitfalls (e.g., grey
goo).=A0

(This is not to say that I'm skeptical of nanotech.=A0 I think the more
prosaic nanotech scenarios have an enormous potential to revolutionize
our world.=A0 If we can design nanomachines to construct individual =
parts
of more complex systems, for example, and then use macro-machines to
assemble them into the finished product, we will have gone a long way
towards eliminating scarcity.)

I'm very interested in thoughts from the list on:

1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.

2) Just how severe and insurmountable these constraints are.=A0 Will
superstring-engineering allow us to bypass Planck's constant?=A0 Will =
some
new, higher-level theory of complex systems provide more =
computationally
efficient means of simulating chaotic systems?=A0 Will quantum =
computing
have any benefit here?=A0 Can a sufficiently advanced entity construct =
a
pocket universe where Planck's constant and c are different from our
own?=A0 Is there any way to communicate between that universe and this
one?

I would second the nomination of _Out of Control_ and would actually

Volition has nothing to do with the definition of instinct, one way or the
other. You seek to define instinct by its effects (in specific instances),
rather than by its true nature.

Instinct impels, but does not compel. Animals make choices based on external

If your dog chases a cat, you tell him to stop, and he does, does he still

You are attempting to apply a non-definition to the objectively observable
phenomenon of "instinct." Instinct can be overridden.

And you still haven't told us where your universal value of self-interest
comes from.

Although I haven't formally announced my new book, _Create/Recreate_ to the

suggest it for the reading list because it is packed full of ideas about

I'm not sure I can totally agree with this statement.  Politics is fuzzy,
no question about it; however, many concepts in economics are built on
strong empirical evidence, just like physics and chemistry.  Economists
even employ the scientific method in the same way.  First, you form a
hypothesis, then you gather data with multiple variables(say the
equilibrium price of two goods, their supply, etc...), then you graph or
compare those variables to look for a relationship.  Any statement you
make connecting those variables is just as strong as a statement
connecting two variables in physics and chemistry.(as long as your
conclusions are verified by multiple sources, just like in other sciences) 
It doesn't take a bunch of complicated graphs to see that any intervention
in the free market will cause it to be inefficient.  There's nothing fuzzy
about that. What's fuzzy is the politics: when people say intervening in
the market is *worth* the inefficiencies that is causes.(for the sake of
human rights?  for the sake of people dying in the streets?) To me, that's
pretty fuzzy!

I would say it economics this is possible.  In politics, it is
impossible.

I don't think figuring out the fundamentals of economics takes a
super-intelligence; however, extrapolating current economics trends up to
the singularity does.

Yes.  I agree, this is something I would like to see more of on the list.
"Ten things you can do to live an anaracho-capitalist life now!"  What are
the current, practical things we can do to not be hypocritical against our
politics(or lack of politics)  I would like to *make the assumption* that
anarcho-capitalism/libertarianism is the best system, and go from there.

For example, if the government out of the blue offers me a big grant to do
scientific research, do I say "No, I think scientific research should be
funded by private corporations" or do I say "Okay, I'm just getting all
the money back that I pay in taxes" or "I can put this money to better
use than someone else can."  Any ideas?

Which goes along the lines of something John Clark once said (I
paraphrase) : "Anarcho-capitalism has become feasible because we have the
technology to maintain it."  This statement says we have the *potential*
to maintain an anarchy, but how do we actually do it.  Albania(I think)
had an anarchy in the last year(due to a bunch of collapsed pyramid
schemes), but it disappeared.  Why?

Delmar, way back in the first issue of Extropy magazine (in1988) I wrote an
article called "Morality or Reality" in which I took a position like yours.
While I still agree with much of what I wrote there -- especially about the
way in which what most people call "morality" is ungrounded and
anti-individual -- I no longer find it an adequate view. I agree completely
with you whenever morals are founded on a higher authority, whether a
mythical god, an earthly leader, faith, or a false philosophical idea (such
as found in Kant). 

However, when I now talk of "rational values" (not "objective morality") I
mean values that are internally self-consistent and which are carefully
reasoned out based on certain deep desires and goals that I believe most
people share. If someone, after careful thought, genuinely does not share
basic values of survival and flourishing, then I cannot argue with them.
The basis of our ethics fundamentally differs. In that sense, morality is
not objective or universal. Since I think that almost everyone, if they
dumped their religious beliefs, would come to broadly similar ethical
conclusions, I do think that ethics can be rational. 

[Another way to put this, fanciful but helpful: If there really were
vampires, and there survival really did depend on drinking the blood of
humans (in such a way that it killed them and there were no alternatives
like blood banks) then it would be *right* for vampires to attack humans.
It would also be *right* for humans to defend themselves. Differences in
nature produce different behaviors that are good for the beings that do
them. Given that humans have essentially the same nature, such moral
divergence is unlikely. If our AI's emerge as radically different from us
in terms of basic motivations, then some of their rational morality may be
quite different from ours.]

This is not to say that ALL values can be rationally supported in terms of
more fundamental values and goals. Many higher-level (more derived) values
will be context-dependent, and others (matters of taste) will be arbitrary.
I suspect that even those who have divergent fundamental values may be
potentially open to argument, since I'm not certain that any values are
truly fundamental. They may simply be values that are most securely
embodied in a network of values (rather than foundational building blocks
supporting everything else).

If you wish to continue seeing ALL possible approaches to morality as
anti-individualistic, I think you need to explain why this approach fits
your characterization.

All of those episodes were drived by religiously derived morality. It is
fallacious to condemn all morals on the basis of morals founded on
religion. What about utilitarianism? Though I am not and never have been a
utilitarian, I see that it has NOT led to the nasty kinds of event you
mention. In fact, it has historically been associated with things like
liberation of women, opposition to pointless harsh retributive punishment,
and increased political freedom.

I don't believe I said that morality was irrelevant to everyday use.
Arguing about what things are ethical *can* produce results, though
generally mostly with people who are educationed, informed, and reasonably
rational. What I *did* say, is that we can probably produce more results by
encouraging generally rationality than by arguing for particular moral views.

ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART III

by Frederick Mann
								10/12/97

Introduction
------------

This is the third in a series of articles on the
Economic Means to Freedom.  The second article
included a brief discussion of the "No-Opposition
Strategy."  You can get the first two articles
from <http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm> or by
request from <mailto:f-prime-activist.com>.

This article will elaborate on the No-Opposition
Strategy and introduce the "It's Not All-or-Nothing"
principle.

The No-Opposition Strategy
--------------------------

A basic theme of the Economic Means to Freedom
is "building freedom" rather than "fighting
for freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."
I believe that if a critical mass of people
were to focus on building freedom, corrupt
political systems will eventually lose their
power and influence.

I don't know how many people would constitute
such a critical mass, nor how influencial their
economic power would have to be, in order for
their combined economic activities to have a
decisive impact on the expansion of freedom,
on one hand, and the decline of the power and
influence of coercive political systems, on
the other hand.

The fifth main principle of the Economic Means to
Freedom is the No-Opposition Strategy.  When we
oppose something, or try to reform it, we usually
encounter opposition.  Our effort elicits an almost
automatic counter-effort.  In practicing the Economic
Means to Freedom, we don't attempt to change, oppose,
reform, or overthrow any  political or economic systems.
We simply create our own voluntary alternatives in the
free-enterprise sector.

In the second article of this series, I used the
examples of Ghandi, the fall of the Berlin wall,
and the collapse of the soviet empire to illustrate
that the terrocrats (terrorist bureaucrats or coercive
political agents) were not invincible -- "The power
of terrocrats is tenuous -- largely based on illusion,
flimsy, fragile, and of little substance."

My examples may have created the impression that
I advocate peaceful resistance.  Let me emphasize
that peaceful resistance may be appropriate for
certain people in certain situations, but it does
not fit at all into the context of the No-Opposition
Strategy.

Peaceful resistance is a form of opposition, which
tends to elicit counter-effort.  It involves forms
of "fighting for freedom" or "fighting against tyranny."

There are various styles of practicing the Economic
Means to Freedom.  The most powerful is *invisibility*.
You operate in such a manner that you and your economic
activities are effectively invisible to terrocrats.
There is no protesting terrocrat actions; no resistance
to terrocrat actions; no fighting terrocrats in court.

Protesting, resisting, and fighting may have a place
in the Economic Means to Freedom, but have no place in
the No-Opposition Strategy.  There are times to take
a stand, and times to take evasive action.  There are
also times to just pay the terrocrats what they demand,
because that's the least evil.

In practicing the Economic Means to Freedom for a quarter
of a century, I've paid terrocrats around $500 in "fines,"
maybe $5,000 - $10,000 for "car registration" and "driver's
licences," and around $10,000 - $15,000 in various "sales
taxes."

No terrocrat has ever used a gun against me, or threatened
to do so.  No terrocrat has ever pointed a gun at me.
Their threats have always come in the form of *words*.
As indicated in the first article of this series, the
practitioner of the Economic Means to Freedom may face,
in general, fewer risks from terrocrats than people "in
the system."

I've received a few threatening letters from terrocrats.
In some cases I paid the "fine" demanded; in other cases
I sent them a reply that resulted in them deciding that
it would be more profitable for them to pursue other,
easier victims or "marks."

By making the above payments, I supported the terrocrats.
You could argue that, to the extent I paid terrocrats, I
practiced the Economic Means to Slavery.  This suggests
the sixth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom.


It's Not All-or-Nothing
-----------------------

The sixth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom is
that you don't have to suddenly switch from one extreme
to the other.  You can shift into the free-enterprise
sector in stages.  You can compartmentalize your life
and affairs so your assets, earnings, and economic
activities are partially in the private (or even public!)
sector and partially in the free-enterprise sector.

[The first article in this series explains the distinction
between the three different economic sectors.]

Freedom Technology consists of the practical knowledge,
methods, and skills to live free; the street-smart
know-how to outwit and run rings around terrocrats;
the means to protect your earnings and assets from
terrocrats and other thieves and robbers.  Freedom
Technology enables you to legally, elegantly, and
safely shift some or all of your economic activities
into the free-enterprise sector.

Some of the practitioners of the Economic Means to
Freedom, who facilitate this shift, may become the
millionaires and billionaires of the next century.
Emerging free-enterprise institutions, such as those
mentioned in the first article of this series, are
likely to play an expanding role in the economic
shift into the free-enterprise sector.

An important characteristic of the shift into the
free-enterprise sector is that as it grows, it
becomes easier for new people to join the shift.
The emerging financial free-enterprise institutions
(see first article in series) already make it much
easier now, than it was 10 years ago, to shift into
the free-enterprise sector.  And as the shift grows,
so do the number of free-enterprise businesses.
This increases the opportunities for freedom lovers
to work in or with businesses that don't kowtow to
terrocrats.

This is not quite what I had in mind as a starting point. I think we
need
to accept that the current economic/political system exists, that it
works pretty well, and that it has a fairly high inertia. Therefore, the
most we can expect is gradual movement, except as the system is forced
to change in response to very rapid technological change. Example:
technology permits direct democracy and real-time access to all
government functions, but neither is likely because the system doesn't
require it: inertia wins.

IMO, the existing system suffices to permit technolological advance to
the singularity. Any non-radical change is unlikely to advance or
retard the event by much. Any radical change is likely to retard the
event because of of the upheaval associated with the change, regardless
of the relative efficiency of the resulting system.

Oh, dear. Just because there is no singularity in the equations, there
is no reason to postulate a flattening. My grossly-oversimplified
curve is an exponential. My next-level approximation is an exponential
with step rate increases over time.

Vinge's other reason to use the term "singularity" is in the sense of
an event horizon: in his model we cannot predict beyond it because the
superintelligences are incomprehensible. I agree with him in this.

Planck's constant is many orders of magnitude away from affecting
information
storage structures.

Moore's "law" (actually, and observation of existing trends) is
currently
driven by lithographic techniques, but it extrapolates backward fairly
well
all the way to the mechanical calculator. There are other techniques,
architectures, and technologies that can step in to take up the slack,
even before we begin to apply superintelligence to the problem. As a
trivial
example, while the current technology is lithographically at .25 micron
or
so, we use it to build chips that are placed in plastic packages that
are
placed on PC boards that are placed in chassis. The 2-dimensional
densisty
is perhaps 10% fo the chip density, and the spacing between transistors
in
the third dimension is thousands of times less dense.

This is true, but I suspect the ability to acquire mass is a much more
severe one. For a given mass, you can decrease the effect of the speed
limit by increasing the density, at least until the resulting material
can no longer support a computational structure or until you form a
black hole. these constraints are IMO far beyond the singularity.

I don't understand. The idea behind nonotech is design to atomic
precision. Assemblers and their output are digitally-described objects.
a system built by assemblers will be essentially perfectly manufactured
by comparison to today's systems, in the same way that playing a CD
yields
the same result every time since the recording is digital. Sure, I can
conceive of a assembler process using stochastic techniques, but this is
certainly not necessary.

       Hello!

      I'm Tony Hollick <Anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk>  0117-9098918


      I'm presently in dispute with British Telecom.

  For a year and more, I had an ordinary residential account - 0117 9501894


 I was billed on a monthly basis, and likewise paid in full, monthly.


 Lately, I've had occasion to use the telephone rather more.


[I] I am an occasional adviser to NATO's Technical Directorate:  We're 
endeavouring to resolve the critical problems of 'backdoors' in Windows95, 
whereby if Windows95 user [A] is logged ont site [B] via the Internet, 
interleaved data packets can be inserted into the datastream by site [C] 
and Windows95 can be istructed to send [A]'s entire file directory 
structure back to [C], fully transparently, and all unbeknownst to [A].

[A]'s files can be scanned via Boolean keyword searches, and business 
plans, spreadsheets, databases, correspondence, financial records etc. can 
be 'called up' by site [C].  Also, latent viruses in Windows95 can be 
activated for 'Information Warfare' purposes.

Class actions? Department of Justice Investigations? Bear Raids? Chapter 11>

 [ FX: "Just watch..." ]

[II] Inter alia, the Criminal Intelligence Division at New Scotland Yard, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington DC and the Office of 
George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence  (DCI) are 
investigating matters described in the Chronology of Events available on:

                http://www.agora.demon.co.uk

[III] I am Amicus Curiae to the King County Superior Court in Seattle, 
Washington, in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau, who is being 
maliciously harrassed by the 'authorities' there.  I am a paid-up member 
of the Northwest Coalition against Malicious Harrassment based in Seattle.

    (I myself alas suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, in part 
from injuries sustained while fighting in the Cold War alongside both MI6 
and CIA, and from suffering malicious harrassment).

      My telephone is thus also a police and medical lifeline.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

   When I recently received a higher-than-usual telephone bill, along with 
a standard BT offer to pay by equal fixed installments on an averaged 
monthly basis, I promptly accepted BT's offer (on 28th August 1997).  BT's 
records confirm this.  I THEREFORE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH BT.  (I also have 
friends in the International Human Rights fellowships who have offered to 
help with expenses).  And friends in the Criminal Law office at BT HQ.  
>:-}

   I was told by the BT Coventry office that this was fine, that they had 
accepted this, that my account would be transferred to quarterly billing, 
and that I would in due course be sent details of the monthly fixed 
payments required.


    Instead, something rather nasty happened.

    Something _suspiciously_ nasty.


     A day or so later, I got up to find that the phone had been 
     'crippled.' Seven consecutive outgoing calls were blocked.  So I 
     tried 999: they connected me to British telecom's 'Debt limitation 
     Office' in Dundee, who told me that they had 'superior powers' over 
     all other departments of bT, and that they would not reconnect the 
     service until I had paid 775 UKP in advance. Further, they threatened 
     to disconnect the service entirely if I did not comply with their 
     (unlawful) demands.  BT then _did just that__ while sending me four 
     different letters from four different people giving four different 
     rationales.

     Just the sort of stunt the Czech secret police used to pull...


     Accordingly I have filed a criminal complaint under the provisions of 
     the Criminal Justice Act which outlaw such harrassment with Leicester 
     police in respect of BT's Mr. Uttley.  An Investigation Number has 
     been formally issued by the police there.

     I have applied to Dundee Police similarly, WRT Ms. Macrae and Mr. 
     McKay's behaviour at the 'DLO.'

     I notified BT's 'Debt Limitation Office' that I counterclaim 50 000 
     UKP WRT damage to my health arising from BT's unlawful behaviour.

     I offered to pay a basic BT rental (for continuity of incoming calls 
     and emergency calls) while the dispute as to amounts claimed and 
     payment rates is resolved by Court Arbitration, which procedure is 
     _compulsory_ for BT.

     I have offered to consider the following proposed settlement from BT:

     BT to offer a full written apology directly from Vallance, and to 
     write off its present claim.

     BT to offer a free ISDN service for an initial one year period

     BT to offer a NOKIA 9000 from Orange, and one year's ORANGE service.

     BT to offer 5 000 UKP io settlement of my outstanding claims against BT.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

                HOW TO RESOLVE THE LARGER 'BT PROBLEM'?

   Much of BT's network was built via capital levies on subscribers' phone 
   bills.  Clearly, when BT was 'denationalized', this should have been 
   done simply (and without megabucks in 'sweeteners' and 'fees') by 
   mailing out equal shareholdings in BT to every elector on Monday 
   morning

   BT staff seem to _hate_ BT -- most people do too, after all.  Who can 
   forget the cartoon of a man making a call from a phone box, while Busby 
   (remember him?  >:-} ) leaned out of the 'returned' slot and 
   surreptitiously picked the punter's pocket...  >:-}


                     NOW, IMAGINE THIS FUNNY SCENARIO:

      [A] BT staff start to 'work to rule' and make innocent mistakes...  
      Such things do happen... They all hate the bloody company, anyway...

      [B] The BT Network declines. BT will never get into America now: 
      whoever would possibly want to import an MI5 spy network?  >:-}
      All of BT's competitors go all-out for new business.

      [C] Job opportunities boom with BT's rivals, creaming off all the 
      more 'mobile' and/or competent BT staffers.

      [D] Rumours spread like wildfire that BT is on the skids...

      [E] The great offshore Hedge Funds (like George Soros' Quantum Fund 
      -- remember Black Wednesday? ERM?  The Tories? ) smell 'blood in the 
      water', and start running relentless bear raids against BT stocks 
      and shares round the clock.  BT shares decline more or less gracefully.

      [F] Meanwhile President Clinton has issued Executive orders tasking:

      the Central Intelligence Agency

                  http;//www.odci/cia

      and the National Security Agency
      
                  http://www.nsa.gov:8080

      Top flight outfit, NSA -- US$ 30,000,000,000 budget, 100 000 
      brilliant,dedicated and playful staffers, worldwide SIGINT and 
      Electronic Warfare capabilities, you know...  Now tasked to gather 
      commercial and poplitical intelligence which can be useful to 
      American companies.  America has lots of fiercely competitive telcos 
      (Actually, anyone with NSA's resources could bring down BT's entire 
      network in around five minutes...).

      A former CinCPAC and DIRNSA (Director, NSA) is a friend of mine...

      [G]  BT slides inexorably into receivership.  In the reconstruction, 
      the public finally receive the shares they should have received in 
      the first place, and the BT staff run BT as a co-op, replacing the 
      'senior management' and the board (Good Riddance!), and take on any 
      external management advisers necessary for the 'difficult bits.'

      We-all then have our own phone company in our own hands, BT's 
      previous -- 'looter' -- shareholders see their shares zeroed, and 
      the good guys (all of us!) win!  We can then have free local calls, 
      with competing trunk services, and superfast 'blinking' datacomms 
      services over standard twisted-pair lines.

Just to make sure I understand you correctly, is the following a 
correct interpretation of the above passage?

Even if all humans were identical, it could still be the case that 
one human's deepest value is irrelevant to another. For example, if 
each is perfectly egoistic, then Mr. X's deepest value might be the 
flourishing of Mr X; whereas Mr. Y only cares about Mr. Y etc. The 
obvious sense in which you could say that these egosists have a 
common moral is that they could produce a set of norms that would 
apply to them all, such as "Don't steal! (Because if you do, the 
police will get you.)". I presume the point with the vampire example 
is to give an example of how there could be creatures with 
sufficiently different goals or abilities to make human morality 
irrelevant to them.

If this is right then what distinguishes moral knowledge from 
other knowledge? Is it just that moral knowledge typically concerns 
life strategies or codes for interacting with other humans? Would 
"Take out an insurance!" or "Con thy neighbor subtly!" count as a 
moral imperative for humans, supposing that it would be good advise 
for most people (i.e. that each would better obtain her own values if 
she follows it than if she doesn't)?

Hal has a good memory, and I wish the Stine article itself was available
on the web because it does starkly illustrate the flawed predictions that
can be generated by simplistic extrapolation. My note about the Stine
piece is available on the web in the Extropian list archives:

to cite some of Stine's predictions in his, at that time forthcoming, 
book "The Spike". I have not had a chance to read "The Spike" yet
but hope to do so in the future.

It's like _re_gression only instead of happening again exactly the same,
it happens smaller and smaller each time. Kind of like a Sierpinski cube.

Yes, and it's much worse than that.  Captain Cathie, who flew people back
and forth across the Pacific in 737s, had these wise words to offer in
PULSE OF THE UNIVERSE (1977):

`The coordinate of 2545584412 was doubled in the diagonals of the polar
squares, with all its associated harmonics, and in the resultant grid polar
square the speed of light reciprocal harmonic of 6944 was incorporated in
the harmonic 26944.  These particular coordinates are from the corner
"aerial" positions to the geographic poles.  *It appeared that the factor 2
preceding the 6944 served to harmonically double the reciprocal of the
speed of light*.' (p. 26, my emphasis)

Leave aside the brainless gobbledegook.  Would you feel safe flying with a
guy who conjectured that putting a 2 in front of a long number `doubled'
that number?   It's true that Cathie did not hold absolutely to this
interesting algorithm.  On p. 55, he observed that 144 by 4 / pi = 576 /
pi.  Surely it should have been 4144 / pi?  A while later, we learn that
`the cube root of harmonic 2384573471 = 28783.056' (p. 189)... and so on.
This book is immensely influential, I gather, among New Age geomancers, UFO
fanciers and feral geniuses in the Deep North of Australia.

Really.  One might doubt this.

Counterfactual conditional statements are the basis of the logic of
scientific thought experiments and play an important role in modal logic.
They take the general form `if it were the case that p - which it is not -
then q'.

Or is it the conjuncture of `counterfactual' and `processes' that troubles
you?  I assume Eli is referring to path integral analysis in QT where the
actual observed event contains folded within its evolution, so to speak,
all the other alternative possible outcomes of the initial preparation.  In
David Deutsch's updating ot the Everett position on Many Worlds in QT,
these counterfactual realities are indeed equally real, in orthogonal
universes, and impact directly upon each other.

My apologies for the misleading language.=A0 By "level off" I actually

collapsing into a black hole, what is the maximum achievable
computational power per unit volume?

Given the likely mass, age, and size of the universe, and the
constraints listed above, what is the maximum achievable computational
power of the universe?

Given c, the age, size, and rate of expansion of the universe, how long
would it take an earth-spawned power to infest the galaxy?=A0 1/10e6 of
the universe?=A0 1% of the universe?=A0 10% of the universe?

My understanding may be off here, but let me put forth the reason I see
chaotic computability entering into the picture with nanotech:

LINEAR NANOTECH
"Linear Nanotech", as I'll call it, is the manipulation of objects at
the atomic scale, one atom at a time.=A0 For example, use of an STM to =
lay
out a company logo on a piece of metal.=A0 As an extension, techniques
that manipulate multiple atoms at a time but can only manipulate a
static number, and which are centrally controlled, are also Linear
Nanotech.=A0 E.g., a multi-head STM.

PARALLEL NANOTECH
Let's use "Parallel Nanotech" to describe the use of a swarm of
non-reproducing assemblers to transform the source material into the
desired object(s).=A0 Possibly this can be handled without worrying =
about
chaos, though I'm not sure.=A0 The question here is what control system =
is
used to distribute instructions to the appropriate assembler at the
appropriate time.=A0 There are several options in this area, divisible
into two groups:

Group 1) Control systems requiring central planning and coordination of
the assemblers.=A0 Ie, with electromagnetic signals of some sort I =
could
communicate to each nanite and instruct it in what to do.=A0 Or I could
"draw" the shape of the object I wanted and have different classes of
nanites respond to different signals (which correspond to different
areas).=A0 This requires external planning, analysis of the source
material, and either precise regulation of the source quality and
structure, or on-the-fly recalibration of the output material.=A0 This
type of control seems to avoid the chaotic computability problems but =
is
a much less flexible nanotech than is popularly conceived by nanotech
proponents.

Group 2) Self-organizing control systems.=A0 The nanites communicate
peer-to-peer to determine the structure and composition of the source
material and negotiate the precise design of the output object.=A0 This
enables a much higher degree of flexibility in relation to source
material, environment the nanites are used in, etc.. It also reduces =
the
burden of external intelligence & processing power to direct the
nanites.=A0

However, self-organizing control results in a complex system where
characteristics of the outputted object are sensitive to initial
conditions such as the exact composition and structure of the source,
temperature, pressure, atmospheric content, shape & amount of initial
release of the nanites, etc..=A0 This is a chaotic system.=A0 Or more
precisely, if the nanite designer has done her job right, the web of
nanites form a complex, self-organizing system that has a strong
tendency towards certain designs and behaviors.=A0=A0 To do her job =
"right",
though, the nanite designer had to understand the relationship between =
a
change to the nanite design (or instructions) and the physical objects
that the nanites would create.=A0 This involves chaos, or minimally
complexity, because the "intelligence" or "decision making power" of =
the
nanite swarm is an emergent property of that swarm, rather than of any
individual nanite.

The design process itself suffers the burden of chaotic incomputability
for another reason, essentially the same reasons that we are unable to
determine the precise effects of twiddling with a particular gene:=A0 =
The
characteristics of the phenotype are only /partially/ based on the
genotype, the rest of the influence being a complex sensitivity to the
environment.

BOOTSTRAP NANOTECH
Beyond Linear and Parallel Nanotech is something I'll dub "Bootstrap
Nanotech", where the assemblers actually use the source material to
reproduce, generating more assemblers which eventually get used to
construct the object you want.=A0 Here the relationship between =
assembler
design and characteristics of the created object is very obviously a
chaotic one.=A0 As may be the relationship between environment =
(structure
and composition of source material) and characteristics of the created
object.

Perhaps someone more versed in nanotech can explain to us the proposed
control systems, or at least the suggested architecture of such =
systems.

Thanks for the suggestions so far. Keep them coming!

Some responses:

Kathryn: I'll try to take a look at the two you suggest. I believe Natasha
has the Benedikt book. I've been wanting to look at the Fifth Discipline
anyway. Any other especially good books on organizational structures?

Eliezer: Hmmm, Godel, Escher, Bach *is* a superb book. I worked through
that back when I was 18. However, as an overview of AI and cognitive
science, I think that Hofstadter and Dennett's The Mind's I might be more
accessible. (Or maybe I'll just include both, though this is supposed to be
a select rather than comprehensive list.) Comments?

For those who suggested more Egan books, I'll be happy to include more by
one of my favorite SF writers. I'm not so keen on Permutation City, though
may include it. I will definitely include his brilliant collection Axiomatic.

Interesting disagreement over Unbounding the Future. I too found it far
less stimulating than EoC but, as Anders notes, it may be a better intro
for some people. I'll probably leave it in there, but placed after EoC. If
the book list is annotated, I can explain which book to read depending on
what the reader already knows.

Anders: Tech Heaven may be a good cryonics story. Has anyone read Blake's
book (i.e. Gregory Benford) whose title I cannot remember. I'd like to
include *one* cryonics-related novel. I haven't read The Bohr Maker but
will try to. I didn't much like Deception Well and don't see why it fits
particularly well into this reading list. Out of Control is a good addition.

John: I think some of your science book suggestions would be great for an
extended reading list, but may not fit here. For instance, the many worlds
interpretation of quantum mechanics is controversial amongst us (and
doesn't seem a core extropian issue) so if I included that I would have to
include several others from differing views. I'm just reading the Sagan and
agree that it fits nicely in the list. The Martin Gardner will be good as a
critical thinking booster.

Create/Recreate will be included.

Has anyone read Robert Forward's Indistinguisable from Magic? (I believe it
used to be known as Future Magic.) I think it may be a good overview of how
far science and technology can be pushed. Perhaps I'll get to read it on
the plane this week.

Here's a chunk:

==============================================

Stine's 1961 article was a deliberately provocative slap at his fellow
speculative writers, usually regarded by sober citizens as crackpots and
lunatic technophiles.  Stine denounced these specialist dreamers and
extrapolators for their stick-in-the-mud conservatism.

Look at the curves! Stine cried.  What's wrong with you?  Are you all
blind?  A year later, in the wonderful non-fiction book Profiles of the
Future, Arthur C. Clarke diagnosed this same defect as the Failure of
Nerve, and coupled it with another crime, the Failure of Imagination.
Stine was determined to fall victim to neither failing.  The trends were
going asymptotic, he pointed out.  An asymptote is a curve that rises
sharply until it is heading almost straight up the page, and gets closer
and closer to the purely vertical in a shorter and shorter time.  At the
limit, which is reached quite quickly (disproving Zeno's ancient paradox
about the tortoise beating Achilles if it has a head-start), the curve goes
to infinity.  It rips through the top of the graph and is never seen again.  

When you're tracking the patterns formed in 20th-and-21st centuries by data
on available energy, or transport speed, or numbers of people in a world
afflicted with unchecked over-population, you can get some hair-raising and
very weird results.  Too weird to be true.  In 1973, the transhumanist
sociologist FM-2030, previously known as F. M. Esfandiary, predicted faxes,
satellite cell-phones and something like the Internet (good going!)
together with the feasible-but-impossibly-expensive `hypersonic planes
projected for the late 1980s' that would `zip you anywhere on the planet in
less than forty minutes', not to mention the wildly extravagant hope `that
by 1985 we will be able to postpone aging in a dramatic way' and on to the
truly fatuous: `The use of artificial moons or satellites to control tides
and floods'.  Curves are tricky things to interpret realistically.

`If you really understand trend curves,' Stine wrote with a perfect poker
face, in 1961, `you can extrapolate them into the future and discover some
baffling things.  The speed trend curve alone predicts that manned vehicles
will be able to achieve near-infinite speeds by 1982.'  Perhaps that seemed
safe enough back then.  Two decades away.  Anything could happen in twenty
years.  Perhaps the horse would talk.  To tell the truth, Stine was
concerned that this prediction might be too conservative. `It may be
sooner.  But the curve becomes asymptotic by 1982.'

You have probably noticed that this did not happen, except on the
television and movie screens when starships routinely travel at Warp Speed
or burn through wormholes from one side of the galaxy to the other.  It's
quite disappointing.  So where was the flaw in his case?  Surely it wasn't
simply that we didn't yet know how to do such things.  Science keeps
learning new and astonishing things about the world.  We bump into
discontinuities, and have to reformulate our theories, or the theories lead
us into novel facts.  Sociologists of science, as everyone now knows due to
the term's misappropriation by New Agers, dub these major shifts `paradigm
changes'.

Stine was expecting some very big paradigm changes.

Led astray by his transport-speed trend, he had noted: `If this is really
the case, a true scientific breakthrough of major importance must be in the
offing in the next twenty years.'  But how could such an infinitely-fast
vehicle be propelled?  Look, say the trend curve had got a little confused,
mistaking Newtonian physics for the more up-to-date Einsteinian variety.
Perhaps we would settle for close to the speed of light, the best one can
hope for in a universe where nothing material can go faster than light?
But that costs a lot, it takes plenty of juice.  Pushing a 100 ton starship
up to 99.99 percent of the speed of light, as close to infinite speed as
we're likely to reach any time soon, you have to pump in so much energy
that the damned thing is a kinetic bomb carrying more than 220 million
megatons locked up in its inertial mass.  Energy equals mass, remember, and
that's how much brute energy it takes to get 100 tons moving that fast.
Luckily, explained Stine, that's okay!  `The trend curve for controllable
energy is rising rapidly...  By 1981, this trend curve shows that a single
man will have available under his control the amount of energy equivalent
to that generated by the entire sun' (his italics).

Oh dear.  Oh dear oh dear.  I don't think so.

It would have taken more than a genuine `cold fusion' breakthrough to bring
that one off.  It would have taken a tame black hole in your tank.

Stine's trend curves, in other words, were totally bogus.  Or rather, they
were just what they seem to be - idle curves linking four or five quite
disparate historical trajectories.  Athletes and swimmers have surpassed
previous records every year on the dot, as they eat better and train more
cunningly and indeed come into the world as bouncing world-beaters, having
enjoyed optimum medically-guided conditions in the womb, but it doesn't
mean that some day an Olympic-class runner will smash the tenth-of-a-second
mile record set an instant earlier by her Reeboked rival.

Does this dash of cold water mean that the Spike, the technological
Singularity curving up there in the mid-twenty-first century, is nothing
better than a mirage?  Perhaps not.

It wasn't sheer fantasy Stine was retailing, after all, just a rather
trusting - or wickedly goading - application of the principle `If this goes
on--'.  

Plenty of things are going on and will not stop before humankind and our
world are changed forever.

Indeed, in a tip-toeing sequel published in 1986, Stine avoided any mention
of his most preposterous trends and settled for merely utopian expectations:

`We can't close the Pandora's Box of technology.  Technology is never
forgotten; it's only replaced by better technology.  Because we can't put
the thermonuclear bomb, recombinant DNA, and a host of other technological
wonders back into Pandora's Box and forget them, we must deal with them.
It's not easy.'

He added: `A hundred years from now, barring an incredible combination of
bad luck and poor management, people everywhere will be many, rich, and
largely in control of the forces of nature.  I've got faith in the
capabilities of human beings.  We'll make it.  Therefore, we must learn how
to be rich and handle abundance because we've never had to do it before.'

Probably this less extravagant forecast would raise no eyebrows among
`conservative' soothsayers.  In 1996, a team from British
Telecommunications made its futurological report for the period to 2020.
The average western lifespan by that date would be a century.
Self-programming computers were expected as early as 2005, as was full
voice-interaction with machines (IBM, they noted, `has already released a
program that understand clear, continuous speech').  AIs emulating the
human brain might exist by 2016, and by the same date genetic links to all
diseases will have been mapped from the decoded DNA template so everyone
will carry an individual genome record wired into a personal health card.
These projections were modest, befitting a vast corporate institution like BT.

I do not know what the state of naval engineering is these days.  As I
stated, my knowledge of naval engineering is tangential at best.  I imagine
that fiber composites would have some real advantages in this case, like
the case you stated above, but there are numerous issues regarding the use
of such materials that I know nothing about.  There may be some
environmental, damage propagation, and repair/maintenance issues that may
make it impractical to use fiber composites.

To give you an idea of just how bad it is, the CEO of France Telecom ( a
US$30 billion company ) makes something like US$70,000 a year.  Any one
with any intelligence hates working in France.  I recently recruited one of
the top officers of France Telecom from his US$40,000 per year job in
France to come work for my fledgling company.  A very bright guy (educated
at UC Berkeley), he wanted to move to Silicon Valley so he could make some
real money and get involved in the entrepreneurial scene.  By law, it is
extremely difficult to do business as a startup in France.  Taxation and
regulation make it extremely expensive to get involved in businesses that
involve just about anything relating to the Internet and computers.

Another regulation I heard from the French at France Telecom:  A company
*must* give 60 days notice prior to firing any employee.  Would you really
want to keep a disgruntled and presumably useless employee around 60 days
after telling him he's going to be canned?  No wonder they have gun control
laws...

I'm uncertain what you are saying here.  40% growth every year for 5 years?
 Average of 40% growth every year for 5 years?  40% growth for a five year
period?  The first is excellent ( 40% annual growth ), the second is
average for a good stock mutual fund ( 13% annual growth, compounded ), and
the last is poor ( 7% annual, compounded ).

40% growth every year is quite accessable if you have a cool head for
investing.  And gives a healthy 500+% return for the five year period as=
 well.

Biotech: Best bet.  Huge growth potential within 10 years.  And plenty of
viable investments to choose from.

Space Exploration: No way.  There are currently no viable, investment-grade
space exploration companies around...yet.  In 10 years, maybe.  I'd wait
for the market to mature a bit more.

Nanotech: The potential is starting to emerge, but it may be too early for
small companies trying this stuff to survive.  I actually expect the first
viable proto-nanotech technologies to come from a company like IBM or the
like.  It is simply too expensive for a small company to operate this type
of research without a source of income.

I would have to agree that taking advantage of tax-deferred status allows
one to realize a greater growth for less effort, but it also puts a ceiling
on how much growth you can reasonably expect annually.  Going the other
route requires considerably more work (to attenuate the added risk), but
raises the potential (post-tax) growth ceiling by a factor of 2 or 3.
Obviously, the returns have to be *significantly* greater to counter-act
the tax loss.  Of course, the third (and best) option is to invest in
yourself and start your own company.  This type of investment, while more
risky, has a potential annual growth ceiling that positively dwarfs the
growth ceilings you can expect doing any type of investing in the stock
market.

With a 5.6 trillion dollar debt, 26 trillion aggregate debt, two identical
"parties" pobtificating about inane nonsense like volunteerism and family
values, and Chinese communists buying a California naval base, "well"
hardly describes the situation.

While technology may permit direct democracy, the Constitution definately
does not.

and in the Universe to the letter.


Anarcho-Capitalism and Economic Means to Freedom
------------------------------------------------

The *practice* -- as opposed to the theory, or
communication without action -- of anarcho-capitalism
is synonymous with what I've been calling the Economic
Means to Freedom.  The practice of anarcho-capitalism
is also the practice of the Economic Means to Freedom.

So what might be "Ten things you can do to live an
anarcho-capitalist life now!"?

I've been a practicing anarcho-capitalist for more
than 25 years.  Yet I find the above question tough
to answer.  We're all in "different places" regarding
our marketable skills, financial situation, knowledge
of practical freedom, willingness to take risks, etc.

So let me make a list of more than ten things.
>From this list, select 10 things you think might
be appropriate for you, then prioritize them into a
sequence that is most appropriate for your individual
situation, and then *do* them!

1. Identify or develop some activity that enables you
to earn money (in an honest manner) that is effectively
invisible to terrocrats (terrorist bureaucrats or
coercive political agents).  Examples: become a
professional gambler; become a successful trader or
investor, utilizing financial structures like offshore
corporations, trusts, and/or foundations; sell "how-to"
information related to your areas of expertise; organize
seminars/workshops related to your areas of expertise;
publish a newsletter; develop a course on practical
anarcho-capitalism and market/deliver it via Internet.
Check out <http://www.loompanics.com/> for more ideas.

2. Read the book 'The Incredible Secret Money Machine'
by Don Lancaster, This book has partially inspired me
to create a number of "money machines" that provide me
with income streams invisible to terrocrats.  Check out
his website <http://www.tinaja.com/>, for an example of
an Internet-based business.  Also check out Dr. Hewitt-
Gleeson's "School of Thinking" <http://www.sot.com.au/>.

3. Study the 'Millionaire Reports' which contain a wealth
of money-making principles not available anywhere else
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/millmain.htm>.

4. Organize a group of people to meet, share information,
and brainstorm the specific things each anarcho-capitalist
individual might do.  Ideas for new anarcho-capitalist
businesses may be generated.  Business partnerships could
be formed.

5. Improve your degree of privacy.  Set up "alternatives"
that are more private than your "public persona."  Check
out <http://www.orlandomaildrop.com/>.  If you do some
WWW searching and you follow links, you may find several
dozen organizations that provide information and services
that facilitate the practice of anarcho-capitalism.
Check out <http://www.paladin-press.com/>.  Check out
<http://rogue.northwest.com/~4thhours/fringe/edenhome.htm>.

6. Learn to operate in ways that minimize or eliminate
"paper trails" that provide terrocrats with information
they could use against you.  For example, use credit cards
issued by offshore banks.  Find private ways to handle
all or much of your banking needs.  See the financial
institutions mentioned in the first article of this series
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.

7. Improve your marketing skills.  Check out Dr. Hewitt-
Gleeson's "NewSell" course at <http://www.sot.com.au/>.

8. Adopt an attitude of constantly looking for incremental
advantages in life generally -- <http://www.neo-tech.com/>.
In exploring Neo-Tech, I find it useful to distinguish
between any material with the word "Zon" and other material.
I find much of the other material quite useful.  Some of
the "Neo-Tech Advantages" as well as the information on
"neocheating" I find particularly valuable.

9. Develop your thinking skills.  I suggest you start with
Dr. Michael Hewitt-Gleeson's "Brain Freebie" course at
<http://www.sot.com.au/>.

10. If you work for a company, explore the possibility
of setting up your own business (doing whatever you're
now doing for the company), and having your business
provide these services to the company.  Note that this
is different from being a "private contractor."  The
company doesn't contract with you as a private contractor;
it contracts with "your business," which is an entity
separate from you.

11. If it's appropriate for you, and you can do so legally
and safely, exit whatever tax systems you may currently
subscribe to.  As with an e-mail list, you always have
the option to "unsubscribe" -- though some instances are
more difficult and dangerous than others!

12. Subscribe to the Advanced Freedom Solutions list.  It is
especially designed for practicing anarcho-capitalists, and
aspiring anarcho-capitalists <mailto:AFS-request@involved.com>
with SUBSCRIBE in the body of your message.

13. Take creative action to safeguard assets from terrocrats
and other thieves and robbers.  Organize your affairs so you
own nothing of great value, but you benefit from entities such
as trusts, offshore foundations and/or corporations, etc. that
own certain assets.  Check out <http://www.nestmann.com/>.
Also search WWW for books by Adam Starchild.

14. Become a "permanent tourist" (PT) -- wherever you happen
to be at any time, you're "just a tourist staying for a short
time and then moving on" -- <http://www.bitnet.co.uk/scope/>.

15. Check out the free-enterprise financial institutions
mentioned in the first article of this series and get involved
with them as appropriate <http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.
Check out 'Laissez Faire City" <http://www.lfcity.com>.  Also
contains important information on individual sovereignty.

16. Check out "Counter-Economics" as described by 'The Agorist
Institute' at <http://agorist.com/>.

17. If your psyche includes a wimp that is shit-scared of "the state"
or "the government," check out <http://www.buildfreedom.com/> in
general and <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/wua5.htm> in particular.
Increase your personal power <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm>.

18. Learn to operate in a manner such that that you focus on
taking actions under your direct control.  You want to do things
that are directly linked to the results you wish to achieve.
If you have to beg others to change their behavior in order for
you to succeed, you tend to lose your power.  For example, if
like Wes Burt you beg "the establishment" to take notice of
Peter H. Rossi's "Iron Law" or Burt's "Teflon Topic," the
most likely result is that you render yourself powerless.
(By his own admission, Wes has been going at it since 1969,
without producing any results!)

19. Observe the results -- or lack of results -- you produce
and learn from them.  Become more flexible.  Experiment.  Change
strategies and tactics until you find what works.  And keep
improving that.  (During the past four years, people have made
of the order of $100 million in the free-enterprise sector as a
result of information at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.)

<snip>

20. Discover that you are free and sovereign by nature.  Read
Harry Browne: 'How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World' and
Rose Wilder Lane: 'The Discovery of Freedom' -- both available
from <http://www.laissezfaire.org/>.  Check out the "sovereign
individual paradigm" at <http://colossus.net/wepinsto/wshome.html>
as well as <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.

21. Learn "Freedom Technology" -- the practical knowledge, skills,
and methods to live the free life of an anarcho-capitalist; the
street-smart know-how to run rings around terrocrats and to outwit
them at every turn; the *HOW* of the Economic Means to Freedom.
The many links in this article mostly point to various aspects of
Freedom Technology, starting with <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.

22. Read 'Deep Anarchy' by Extropy cofounder Max More at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm> to discover that
the entire world has always been in a state of anarchy.  Max
More: ""Deep Anarchy" is the view that results from these
thoughts; it is the idea that we *already* live in an anarchy."
Mr. More emphasizes that, "There is no "State."  There are only
individuals acting in a statist manner..."  We need to focus on
"Bringing About a Better Anarchy."

23. Study <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm> -- 'The
Anatomy of Slavespeak' -- to discover the extent to which you
may effectively have been oppressing yourself with your own
words.  Study <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm> to
discover some of the most basic factors that keep coercive
political systems in place.

24. Become superhealthy.  We need to outcompete and outlive
terrocrats and their supporters.  In the near future I'll
compile a compendium of my best health links and references.

25. Study my series of articles on the Economic Means to Freedom
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.  Watch out for future
articles.

That sounds like a moral prescription to me, and if it sounds like a
duck, and walks like a duck, your insistence that it's not a duck
doesn't impress me.

Like you, I utterly reject all claims I have seen of a supposed is-
ought bridge; I have no evidence on which to decide whether, as you
claim, it is because such a thing /can't/ exist, or whether. as Eli
claims, it does exist and we just haven't found it or are incapable
of finding it.

But it doesn't really make much difference to me.  I'm not attached
to this failure, it's just part of what is, no more and no less than
the fact that dogs have four legs.  There's no objective morality.
Big deal--I can get on with my chosen one just fine, thank you.
I don't know what important revelation you might be communicating
that you don't think I've gotten, but from your copious words so far,
it's nothing more than I knew a year ago.  There's no objective
morality.  You're right.  So what?  Any reaction you would have me
make from that is just your own normative preference, and I'm no more
interested in your values than God's.

If you mean "convincing the world that individualism and freedom
are the right thing", then yes, they're just as irrelevant.  If you
mean convincing them of it so they'll stay out of my way, that's
important to me, because I want them out of my way--and even better
if they cooperate.  But I don't care one whit whether they do it
because it's "right" or not, only that they do it.

So you've _never_ heard of parallel worlds?  You haven't seen them on Babylon
5, or Star Trek, or in print?  And (see below) you've also never skimmed
through quantum mechanics?  What are you doing discussing terms like
"objective", then?  No matter how many dictionaries you read, you have to be
able to point to something or it's all just a fog of words built on words.

Never challenge a scientist to define his terminology... it's not good for
your sanity!

Okay, here's what actually happens, physically speaking.  If you fire a photon
at a half-silvered mirror, reality splits into two parallel Universes, one in
which the photon was reflected and one in which it wasn't.  If the alternate
photons hit another mirror, the Universe is split into four lines.  We know
that all four exist, because we can make two of them cancel out and two of
them add up so that the photon winds up in a specific place.  We can set up a
physics experiment such that the photon can go to C via A or B, or to D via A
or B.  In "classical" physics, the photon goes to either A or B, and thence to
C or D.  In quantum physics, the photon goes to both A and B (in alternate,
counterfactual branches), and then goes to C via A, C via B, D via A, and D
via B.  However, D via A and D via B, when added together, sum to zero.  So
the photon goes to C.  If you prevent the photon from going through B, then
the photon ends up going to C via A or D via A, so it has a 50% chance of
ending up at either.

Perhaps this makes no sense to you.  But that's the way it is.  Ask any
physicist.  Counterfactual processes, or processes in which "it might have
been" exerts an experimentally detectable causal influence on reality, are
part of the current known ontological basis of reality.

For the second time, try to remember what you said!  I'm getting tired of
acting as your long-term memory!  If you can't keep track of your own
thoughts, at least don't accuse me of being at fault!

I take it back.  There's nothing "mysterious" about your forgetting the term
"objective morality".  Nor should you be blamed for forgetting that the
morality/reality analogy axis is used for the detection of logical flaws,
rather than as a proposed identity.  But, I still think you should tone down
the attacks.  And maybe get an email program that will let you view entire
threads as they evolve.

My "forte", among other things, is extensional definitions.  That is, for any
given term, I can define it by pointing to something, rather than in terms of
other terms.  I think that our problems in communication derive from a clash
between extensional and intensional definitions of terms such as "morality",
"goal", "desire", and so on.  I'm a cognitive engineer, so I define these
terms as being computational structures, or the human implementation of those
structures.  Example:

class Goal extends Object {
	
	Goal[]		superGoals;
	double		probability;
	double		initialValue;

	double value () {
		double value = initialValue;
		for (int i = 0; i < superGoals.length; i++)
			value += superGoals[i].value() * superGoals[i].probability;
		return value;
	}
}

My question about the existence of "objective morality" can be phrased as
follows:  Given the above definition of "Goal", does there exist a system,
such that all initialValues are zero, and all probabilities are 1, in which a
Goal object exists such that value() returns a nonzero method?

This may seem impossible, but it also seems impossible that such a system
should return a nonzero value() with no initialValues, regardless of
probability.  Since there are, in fact, logical ab-initio Goal-sequences with
probabilistic arguments and nonzero values, deriving from the system's ability
to reason reflexively, the issue is in doubt.  Since "reality" is as much a
derived quantity as "value", the issue is even more in doubt.

Or to put it another way:

class RealThing extends Object {

	Cause[] mCauses;
	
	Boolean isTrue () {
		for (int i = 0; i < mCauses.length; i++)
			if (!mCauses[i].isTrue())
				return false;
		return true;
	}
}

class Cause extends RealThing {
	// Here's the paradox; causes are themselves RealThings.
}

How can anything be true without assuming a First Cause?
(An assumption is a RealThing with no causes.)

Note the similarity to the Goal problem.  Insofar as something does exist, I
conjecture that the Goal problem has a solution as well.

----

You might be saying something about morality and reality, even an important
something, but I can't connect it with my mental model of goal and subgoal, or
my model of cause and effect.

I was using the logical technique known as "reduction ad absurdum", which is
often quite effective against "definitional" attacks.  If a given line of
logic results in a falsehood when applied to a set of known facts, the same
logic cannot be used to disprove a set of hypothesized facts.  Since your
attacks on "objective morality" work just as well when applied to "objective
reality", it follows that a flaw exists in your logic.

My "attributions" are either verbatim quotes you forgot about, or are
carefully designated as belonging to an "Alternate Delmar".  The Alternate
Delmar is a logical construct used for purposes of reductio ad absurdum.  I
doubt that any readers, other than yourself, managed to confuse Delmar and his clone.

After trying to think what parts of the arguments to quote, I gave up
and elided all of them, since they distract from my main question:

What difference does it make to my day-to-day existence whether or not
aliens made crop circles?  If they did, should I invest my money
differently?  Make a pilgrimage?  Vote Republican?  If they didn't,
should I fund a lawsuit?  Buy real estate?  Vote Republican?

People think, claim, prove, denounce, and preach all kinds of things, and
their opposites.  I let them, unless it makes a difference in my life.
Conspiracies and coverups exist.  So do charlatans and schizotypics.  I
don't have time to try to get rid of, denounce, or even complain about,
any or all of those.

What better things could you be doing with *your* time?

The problem is that any SI, after a few cycles of self-enhancement, is twenty
trillion lightyears into the cloud.  The fog gradient is irrelevant at such
distances, although I personally happen to think it's rather sharp.  If we
have so much trouble predicting the actions of different cultures, how can we
predict the actions of a transhuman?  Intuitively, if not formally, it would
seem to be as mathematically impossible as an abacus simulating a PowerPC 604.

You are incorrect.  I lay down this Continuing Challenge to all who listen: 
Before you place a physical constraint on the Powers, you must first place it
on me.  And now, watch as I shoot all your "constraints" down.

What about negative matter?  You can have an arbitary amount of computing
material in a given volume, with net mass zero.

Infinite.  There exist physical processes which are not
simulable-to-arbitrary-accuracy by Turing machines.  Even if all physical
processes *are* simulable, they still use real numbers.  Perhaps a clever
Being could exploit a chaotic Mandelbrot-like boundary to perform calculations
of arbitrary complexity in constant time.

General relativity makes the speed of light fundamentally arbitrary.  They can
infest the entire Universe in zero time, and finish before they started.

One being's "chaos" is another's "order".  The mechanical nanotech you mention
is simply an enormous waste of computing power...molecularly speaking.  It
takes thousands or millions of atoms to compute the position of an atom.  The
theoretical maximum, of course, is one atom per atom.  (Unless, of course,
you're using quantum computing.  See, even I start doing it!  Theoretical
maximum?  Whose theory?)

I like your term "rational values."

I think people need to do more than dump religious
beliefs in order to arrive at rational values; they
also need to dump certain political beliefs and
illusions, such as Harry Browne's "government myths"
('How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World') and your
'Deep Anarchy' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm>.

People who dump religious beliefs won't kill "for God,"
but while they retain certain political beliefs and
illusions, they'll continue killing "for Country."

The nature of an "is" implies certain "oughts" for
that "is."  Abraham Maslow argued this quite well
in 'The Farther Reaches of Human Nature.'  Seeking
survival is part of the nature of certain entities.
No special decision to survive is necessarily required
for rational values to be derived.

Entities of a common nature will also have certain
rational values in common.  And, as you've argued,
certain differences between entities will result in
differences among some of their rational values.

Harry Browne ('How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World')
also advocates that all individuals need to consciously
and deliberately derive their personal values.

There is an important reason why people can argue
endlessly about certain subjects, particularly if
high-level abstractions like "morality" are involved.
Most people naively believe that "words have meanings."
It's more appropriate to think in terms of "people have
meanings for words."

In a similar way that we have commonalities and differences
regarding rational values, we also have commonalities and
differences in our meanings for words.

The lower the level of abstraction of a word (i.e., the
closer it is to physical reality), the greater are the
commonalities in our meanings and the smaller our differences.

The higher the level of abstraction of a word (i.e., the
further it is from physical reality), the smaller are the
commonalities in our meanings and the greater our differences.

In the physical sciences, most terms are low-level abstractions,
so there's widespread agreement on what we mean by them and
how we use them.

In the "humanities," by contrast, many terms like "morality"
are high-level abstractions, so there's widespread disagreement
on what we mean by them.  Furthermore, attempted "definitions"
of high-level abstractions seldom resolve the disagreements.

Danny, Danny, Danny.  Calm down.  We're on the same side.

Once more slowly:

What should I _do_?

When you find out what they're trying to tell us so that we can do it or
otherwise respond to it, and/or when you have the address of the
"build-the-alien-engine" foundation so we can send donations or investment
dollars or go work for it, please let us know.

Danny, whether or not aliens built crop circles is about as interesting
to me as whether the Mayans or the Incas built some particular burial
mound, unless the fact dictates a particular course of action.

How do I get sucked into discussions like this?  I guess it's because I
think (hope?) that people will take what I'm saying to heart eventually.

Would people please cease trying to prove to Danny that his ideas are
wrong?  Does it matter that much to you one way or the other?


Enough.

Right. Although your last statement does not represent my position quite
correctly. The point is that the vampires would have no reason (in the
situation as I've set it up) to refrain from killing humans. It would be
pointless for humans to tell vampires that they were being immoral. What
was moral for vampires might be immoral for humans to do to each other. But
saying that human morality is irrevelant to them is too strong. Many moral
principles and virtues that apply to humans might apply to vampires.
Courage, for example. Benevolence and mutual aid might even be rational
between vampires.

I don't see moral knowledge as differing fundamentally from other
knowledge. I see moral knowledge as being more difficult to come by and
more difficult to test than scientific knowledge. But that's also true of
economic, sociological, and historical knowledge. Reaching firm conclusions
in ethics involves complicated reasoning about human psychology (and how
much is inborn, how much acquired, and how much alterable), and the effects
of various types of actions. (Game theory may sometimes help with the
latter. I like David Gauthier's discussion in Morals By Agreement, but I
find it to be only part of the answer.)

Approaches to ethics that treat it in isolation from other areas of
knowledge seem to me doomed to produce ethical systems that cannot
adequately answer the ancient and excellent question "Why be moral?" I find
the most promising approach to be that of virtue ethics with its integral
concern for moral psychology. A fairly good collection on this is Flanagan
and Rorty's Identity, Character, and Morality.

To specifically address your proferred moral imperatives: "Take out life
insurance" (if good advice for most people) could be taken as a moral
imperative. However, I think of ethics primarily in terms of the virtues of
character for a successful life and accompanying principles. "Take out life
insurance" looks like a specific, highly context-dependent application of
virtues and principles such as personal responsibility, rationality, and
foresightness. "Con thy neighbor subtly" again seems highly
context-dependent. I see ethics as involving a flexible hierarchy of
virtues and principles. Some are pretty secure and very broadly applicable.
Purported imperatives like "con your neighbor subtly" seems to be much
further down the list of derivations. That is, they are many many
circumstances that could make that a bad bit of advice.

As another example: I would argue that the virtue of self-ownership (which
includes personal responsibility, rationality, indepedent thinking, and
self-direction) is a more basic value than truthfulness. While I believe
truthfulness to generally be virtuous it depends far more on circumstances
than does self-ownership. If I were living in Stalinist Russia, I might
find it moral to lie in many situations.

Again, all rational moral discussion depends on shared basic values.
Perhaps we can go further, but I'm not sure at this stage whether I can
rationally persuade someone fundamentally bent on self- and
other-destruction and who explicitly rejects survival, happiness, and
flourishing as goals. I'd like to think that I could, in principle, show
their attitudes to be based on flawed factual beliefs and poor reasoning. I
suspect this *is* possible -- and so rational ethics can become even more
close to universal, but I will not claim this at present.

By a recent post, use of quantum cellular designs, they operate better
the smaller they are, could be as small as a few atoms, with a single
layer of atoms between cells, and 5-10 layers between circuits. They
also minimize heat and power consumption, another problem with current
chip circuitry. How does this scale to current chip circuit sizes?

Well, what is the speed of chemical reactions across the brain, and from
one end of the nervous system to the other? Whatever time lapse this is,
scaled to C will give you an estimate of the size of the beast you are
contemplating, for at least human capacity intelligence. Then again, if
we are to take the word of some marine biologists, we need to think more
on a scale of dolphins or whales nervous systems as baselines.

Considering we are now playing with molecular sized motors, gears, and
circuits in the lab, with our rather ham handed tools that dampen our
movements down to a scale necessary to move actual atoms around, once
simple and functional machines are actually built that can run, and can
be built repetitively and reliably, then we will have brought the
industrial age to the nano scale, and can expect a progression curve at
the nano scale much like out own from the early 1800's onward. The
advantages we now have is that we already know how things work best at
macro scale, so its not like we have to totally reinvent anything, we
already know whats possible.

I don't think that we will see any significan leveling off. There will
be short periods perhaps of slowing growth, but as established
technologies reach their peaks, newer ones will come to the fore as they
become economically feasible, like a multistage rocket dropping off
spent boosters.

I would guess that the closer the physical laws in a pocket universe are

                      A Letter to Vince Foster
                        by "J. Orlin Grabbe"

                      mailto:kalliste@aci.net

      Dear Vince,                              Circa 12 October, 1997?

      So you wanna be a nuclear spy?  You say your Swiss account is
running low, and you need some pointers where to find those little intel
tidbits to be sold for salvage?  You know, depending on what's hot in
the market?

     Well, okey dokey. I'll tell you what little I know.  Maybe help 
you out a little.  On account of you're such a good friend and all.


      Let's start with SIOP.  That's Single Integrated Operational Plan.
It ties together all the military nuclear weapons and all the different 
regional plans -- you know, the different nuke options of the military 
commands in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and Europe.  Britain even has a 
part.  Well, SIOP is ESI:  Extremely Senstive Information.  

      Translation: BIG BUCKS if you can get a hold of a piece of it. 
Now, Vince, let me explain the problem, so you'll know what's going
on, and where to go to get the good stuff.  Okay?  You think you have 
headaches keeping track of money. Well, let me tell you, the 
military's like the three, or six, or sixteen different faces of Eve, 
and they'll all be at war with each other if they're not careful.
  
      Hell, we might be engaged with China and they send the signal to the 
wrong set of missiles, and nuke Teheran. 

      Or say there's a launch off the Pacific coast, but the early warning 
system is down and no one knows what's coming.  

      Or they see it coming but they can't get hold of the President who is 
out whitewater rafting. 

      Or the helicopter arrives at the White House from Quantico to whisk 
the Prez to Andrews Air Force Base, where the flying command post 
awaits, and the Secret Service shots the chopper down (which they 
almost did in an exercise the other day). 

      Or the Prez gives the authorization to RE-TAL-I-ATE, but he can't 
communicate with his forces to set anything in motion.


      See, we got us an ORGANIZATIONAL problem here. Suppose'n we go to
war.  You got the White House Situation Room, down underground, below the 
Oval Office. You got the National Military Command Center (NMCC) in the 
Pentagon, third floor.  You got the alternative NMCC buried in Raven Rock, 
Pennsylvania (8 miles from Camp David), in case the first one's f**ked up 
(more than normal, I mean). 


      You got the SAC underground command post at Offutt Air Force base near 
Omaha, Nebraska. You got the NORAD underground command post inside 
Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. Talk about moles!  These here outfits 
have gotta TALK and gotta SEE!  See what I mean?


      Then you got your airborne commands. They gotta talk, see, and EVADE 
no matter WHERE they are.  There's "Nightwatch".  That's the National 
Emergency Airborne Command--a flying nest for the President, Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and Commander of the Strategic Air Command (with room for a few 
hookers to relieve the tension) to give orders and preside over the end of 
civilization as we know it. (They can fire the land-based missiles using the  
Airborne Launch Control System.)


      Then you got "Cover All", or whatever they call it now, the
flying Command post of the Strategic Air Command with the Post Attack Command 
and Control System (PACCS) (and we hope SAC number two still takes 
orders from number one, who is flying around with the Prez). Then you 
got all your little sub units: "Blue Eagle" Pacific Command, "Scope Light" 
Atlantic Command, "Silk Purse" European Command.  The names and 
details may change from time to time (hint: more bucks here).

      Then you got all your side shows, like JEEP, the Joint Emergency 
Action Plan.  That's a plan for evacuating a select number of government 
and military people, the chosen few, the ELECT, who get RAPTURED AWAY to a 
place of safety in case of nuclear war, some to Raven Rock, others to the
"Special Facility" at Mt. Weather in Virginia.  

      That's so they'll be around to populate a post-nuke nation.  It'll be 
a millennial golden age of LAWYERS and GENERALS.  You remember me 
telling you about Hassan i-Sabah, the "old man of the mountains", the 
leader of the assassins? How he used to indoctrinate his followers, 
showing them a vision of Paradise, where he would get them blissed out 
on hashish, and they would wake up in a garden with fruit trees, and 
flowing brooks, and whoreys attending to their every need (I think 
they spelled it "horis" back then)?  And then they would be willing to 
die to get back to Paradise?  Well, here in the old U. S. of A. some 
of the chosen few get to spend some time each year in the BOHEMIAN GROVE!


      Just a little aside.  A friend of mine used to have a job inspecting
the stored food down in one of those FEMA hideaway places--the "National 
Warning Center" down in Olney, Maryland. You know, FEMA, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency? She told me they had cans of powdered instant SPINACH 
OMELET.  And the johns were on SPRINGS, so a person sitting on the toilet at 
the time of a direct nuclear hit wouldn't bust their buns! (I guess there was 
an anticipation some of the people they would stick in these FEMA hidey holes 
were full of shit.) But we are getting off topic...

Okay.

      So you got a little COMMUNICATION problem.  A little
CO-ORDINATION problem.  That's where C3I comes in.  You say that 
"SEE cubed EYE".  That stands for COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATION, and
INTELLIGENCE.  C3I is the thread that patches the SIOP together.  It's the
glue that keep the nuclear pasties where they oughta be!  

      C4I adds Counter-measures to the list. Very important: lotssa stuff
to steal here.  This is about computers, satellites, phones, and radios.  
(The Mitre Corp's big in this area.  You may know about them, since 
they're also getting into electronic cash these days.)  C3I basically 
started with David Packard who saw that military communications 
weren't worth beans.  He also initiated those flying Presidential 
command posts, using modified Boeing planes (E4Bs).

      [ 'S' and 'R' add Surveillance and Reconnaissance for C4ISR - TH ]

      Well, he departed in 1971.  Five years later, after the ever idiotic
Pentagon had gone out and bought a $100 million worth of Honeywell computers
that weren't even intended to operate in on-line mode (on-line's important 
for a communication system, don't you think?), an official in the Defense
Communication Agency reported that the system was crashing on average once
every 35 minutes.  ("Sorry, Mr. President, we would like to send that 1 
megaton baby on its way to Moscow, but the damned system's down.  Anyone
call Federal Express yet?")  


      Wimex (that the Worldwide Military Command and Control System) didn't
go on line at NORAD until Sept 1979.  And they did a mobilization simulation
("Proud Spirit") the next year, and Wimex fell on its ass, leaving military 
commanders in the dark about the readiness of their units for 12 hours.  


      So you see, Vincey boy, that national security's all about computers 
and communications and co-ordination.  They had military transports 
landing at military bases where the troops supposed to get on them 
hadn't even got the word to march.  We could have lost the war because 
we had stupid computers and stupid programmers.  Those Minutemans with 
megaton bombs ain't too scarey on 64k of RAM.


      Another example:  in the older missiles on the Navy's Poseidon
submarine the missile targets would be recorded on 8-inch magnetic disks.
The order to fire would come from an EAM, an Emergency Action Message.

      This would be in code and would be compared to the version of the same
thing sitting in the submarine's Red Box.  

      If they were the same, the message would be considered authentic and 
the firing procedure would commence. (The subs present interesting 
communication problems, by the way, and besides the communication 
stations around the world, you've got the TACAMO planes flying around, 
relaying communications to the subs.  You could also use ELF,
extremely low frequency, broadcasts, but that would require antennas
hundreds of miles long.)

      Well, now the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) keeps the President
or his successors (and in the National Command Authority control system 
which executes the SIOP, it's the VP, the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in that order--not the VP, the Speaker of the 
House, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, etc.--nope, Haig wasn't in
charge after all) in touch with his nuclear forces around the world.  DCA has 
hubs at the White House and at Camp David, which is tied right into Raven
Rock.

      But anyway, computer-wise, let me tell you about three money-making 
organizations you want to pay special attention to.  There's NRO, the 
National Reconnaisance Organization; NSA, the National Security Agency; and 
DMA, the Defense Mapping Agency.  They tell us what's coming (NRO), let us 
launch a response (NSA), and help us locate the goddamn target (DMA).

Okay?  

      NRO is currently much of the nation's eyes and ears--a 24-hour a
day operation.  They're the ones in charge of the spy satellites.  The Air 
Force does the actual operation, but NRO is in charge.  NRO's run by a  
committee, the National Reconnaissance Executive Committee, chaired by the
CIA director.  That's so the satellite PRETTY PICTURES get shared by 
everyone, not just the fly-boys. >:-}

      Since 1992 NRO's been functionally organized (hint, hint, get specs) 
but before that there was an Air Force part, based out in El Segundo, 
California, that worked on Air Force reconnaisance satellites and made 
deals with contracters, a CIA part (they developed the KH-11 and 
RHYOLITE satellites), and a Navy part, responsible for the Navy's 
ocean surveillance satellites.

      The signals those satellites pick up are processed by the NSA, that
big sprawling place out at Fort George C. Meade, Maryland. They got regional  
SIGINT center for the satellite data at Menwith Hill Station in 
England ("Hi!");  Bad Aibling Station, Germany; Kunia, Oahu, Hawaii; Lackland Air Force Base
Training Annex, San Antonio, TX; Buckley Air National Guard Field, Aurora, 
CO; and Fort Gordon, Georgia.


      They also got a big South American listening post in Panama. Remember 
those Panama Canal negotiations, which your pal Jackson Stephens had a
financial interest in?  We were listening in on the Panama private chat. 
Well, remember old pineapple face, Noriega?  He was spying on our spying. 
Paid those NSA boys a regular fee to bring him tapes and computer printouts. 
(Your modern DIC-TA-TOR-SHIP ain't what it used to be.  Castro's got a big 
computer room in the Palace of the Revolution. I tell you, there's more to 
controlling a country than just the occasional photography session cuttin' 
down sugar cane with a machette in the hot sun.) 


      Anyway, NSA develops secure voice and data transmission links on
the Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) and the Satellite Data
System (SDS).  They are also responsible for communications security with
respect to strategic weapons systems such as the Minuteman missile.  That's
to prevent UN-AUTHOR-IZED access or interference or jamming. (There's a 
special message category called a NUCFLASH, which is notification of the
unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons.  Wonder why they have it?)  Targets 
can be changed by inputting a new set of numbers in the missile's memory.  


      Virtual bugs can be serious.  A few years ago a hacker kid got into 
Pentagon computers, and came pretty close to causing a nuclear EVENT, and 
they bumped his old man's ass right out of there.  And back in November 1979, 
a computer technician accidentally fed a training tape that simulated a 
missile raid against the U.S. into the live NORAD early warning system.


      Now get this:  the NSA develops the codes by which the President
must identify himself to authorize a nuclear strike.  You know the  
* Football *?  That's the black briefcase carried by the military Presidential
shadow.  It contains the Gold Codes (the Presidential instructions to
authorize the release of nuclear weapons), the SIOP attack options, and a
decision book. The Gold Codes are changed daily, one set going to the White 
House for the Football, and simultaneously to nuclear command posts around
the world.  The attack options are just subsets of potential targets.  For 
example, SIOP-5D, which came out in 1980, identified 40,000 potential 
targets, and gave the President Limited Attack Options, Selected Attack 
Options, Major Attack Options, and Regional Nuclear Options.  There were 
also two special categories: a pre-emptive strike against the Russkies, and 
LOW (Launch on Warning) or LAU (Lauch Under Attack).


      Wonder who is on the list now?  If you're looking to find out, watch 
out for the two-man rule: no one person is supposed to have access to nuclear 
weapons and release codes and such, so you may need an accomplice, depending 
on what you're fixin' to do.  Hell, the President can't even open the   
Football--only the Director of the Military Office, the warrant officers,
and the military aides have the combo.


      The NSA put out the * National COMSEC Plan for Space Systems and
Nuclear Weapons Systems * back in 1982.  This has been updated, I guarantee
you, and you can get good cash for the latest version.


      Now, under W Group in the NSA's Directorate of Operations is the
Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center (DEFSMAC).  That's a joint
DIA-NSA operation, which is the principal body of men and women who keep
minute-by-minute track of threats to the U. S. of A. from missiles, aircraft,
and other types of overt military activity.  Anything you can get on them
might give your enterprising enemy nation good ideas how to muck up their 
operation.  (What do you care?  You got one of them JEEP-1 cards, don'tcha?)
Their stuff goes everywhere: CIA, White House Situation Room, whatnot.


      Remember when Russians weren't even allowed to visit Dallas, Texas,
on account of all the surrounding defense electronics?  Well, one of the
reasons has to do with E-Systems, which does a lot of NSA's computer software 
and hardware.  (They developed that little * Herf gun *, you know, the one
that can take out a plane's guidance and control system?  The pilot finds 
himself pulling levers and pushing buttons, and nothing responds.  Deadly 
mother.  Good for causing plane crashes.) You already probably know a lot
about them, because of their relationship to Systematics.  The NSA's got
some new computers coming on.  Try to get the operating system or anything
like that.  

      The Defense Mapping Agency gets things contoured out so as the 
missiles can find the target.  Once upon a time SIOP was just a set of 
black lines, all converging at Moscow, on the big map of the Soviet 
Union that Curtis LeMay used to have. To get there, each SAC plane 
would carry the best maps of their target, most of them pre-WW2 jobs 
not worth shit. Hell, back in 1941 RAF bombers had problems getting 
their bombs to within a five mile radius of the target.  Not very 
PRE-CISE.  (Bombs made one of them Poisson distributions around 
target:  read * Gravity's Rainbow * ).

      [ FX: "That is, what we call Circular Error Probables..." ]

      Well, we still got that same precision problem. You saw that video 
they played over and over the in Gulf War?  That bomb dropping down the 
smokestack of a factory?  Don't you believe the BS for a minute. Seventy-five 
percent of those bombs went astray.  As for enemy terrain, we didn't know 
diddly-squat about the Soviet Union until the CIA got the word to do a high-
altitude plane, and they got Lockheed to turn out the U-2 in record time. It 
could fly at 70,000 feet. But tough on the pilot: two hours of pure oxygen 
so he wouldn't get the bends, and a diet of steak and eggs because there 
weren't any toilet facilities. Later the Joint Chiefs acquired control of 
the spy planes like SR-71 and RC-135, and signals were processed by the 
NSA and photos by the CIA.  


      But satellites, not spy planes, map most of it now, and the contours 
of the target terrain are stored in the missile's computer so it will know 
when it has reached target.  You know, like a gif file with all the naughty     
bits, where the computer matches pixel against pixel until it knows it's 
arrived on target and there's a great nuclear orgasm.  (No way to avoid 
digital because a few high altitude nukes will send out an EMP, an
electromagnetic pulse, that will wipe out the Global Positioning System.)


      Now, never forget, Vincey boy, there's always a ready market for
plutonium.  You know, the stuff they put in the bombs to make them go BOOM?
Well, now, all the nuclear facilities are guarded by a little outfit called
the Wackenhut Corporation.  Ed Meese came in and said, How my friends gonna
make any money if the Marines do the job?  Hell, we all know each Marine
comes with two PR agents, so we'll let one Wacky Hutterite do the job of  
three.  So it was, and now we're all getting rich, because those Wacky 
Hutterites are as entrepreneurial as hell.  


      Or similar products.  Remember how in the early 80s just when you 
were getting into the laundry business, they decided it was important to 
keep both Iran and Iraq equally armed, so no one would win the war?  Well, 
Iraq was about to get its ass kicked, so we made a crash program to help the 
Iraqis.  (In the Iran-Contra hearings even Ollie North said the coverup was 
itself a coverup. Because it wasn't Iran we were mostly dealing with, it was 
Iraq.)    


      Now you know Ihsan Barbouti, the Iraqi architect who has that 
engineering firm in Frankfurt and who came over here with a contract to 
build Iraqi airfields?  Well he invested in TK-7 of Oklahoma City, Pipeline
Recovery Systems of Dallas, and Product Ingredient Technology of Boca
Raton.  Want to know why?  TK-7 makes a fuel additive that can extend
the range of SCUD missiles and jet aircraft.  Pipeline Recovery coats pipes 
so they're usable in nuclear reactors and chemical-weapons plants.  And 
Product Ingredient Technology makes cherry flavoring.  (Gotcha there, 
didn't I?)  Ferric ferrocyanide is a by-product of cherry flavoring, and can 
be used to make hydrogen cyanide, a nice poison gas for the Kurds and whey.


      Well, guess who got the contract to covertly deliver all this stuff
to Iraq?  Wackenhut, naturally.  (Those boys are famous out here in Nevada, 
on account of guarding Area 51 and such like research facilities.  It's a
weird scene out here.  Between Reno and Las Vegas off highway 95 they got 
the * Naval Undersea Warfare Center *.  In the middle of the desert!  It's  
a nuclear bunker for nuclear-armed torpedos and such.  If that mother ever
goes up, it'll leave the nearby town of Hawthorne flat as a Dow Corning
breast implant.  They'll be breathing Hawthorne molecules from here to 
Tonopah.)  


      If you find all this nuclear stuff too confusing, you might try
stealing a copy of the * President's Daily Brief * which covers the most
significant information from the previous day, including info from the
nation's most sensitive sources.  I'm sure your better-financed enemy 
nation will pay top dollar for a copy passed along daily.

      Whatever you do, don't get any legal advice from the NSA.

               THE PURPLE-BLUE BRILLIANCE OF TOTAL NOW...
  
     "Dim and yellow against the vibration of the purple-blue shudders the 
  faltering light that stands on the tiles of Hidden Lion.  And here is 
  Questing the death-hound,  here is Elijah for whom Firouz has opened the 
  door, here is Messiah following on Elijah,  here is the giant Bohemond 
  foul and stinking with excrement that stains his scarlet cross as he 
  stands on Hidden Lion  lifting his sword vertically with both hands and 
  plunging it up and down like a man breaking ground for a post-hole.  All 
  around him are broken tiles  and among them are heaped gold and silver 
  coins that were mortared into the tiles.


     Now I see what I have seen before in the darkness and the brightness 
  in my mind,  I see leaping and still like a butterfy transfixed by 
  lightning the elegance of Bembel Rudzuk as he attacks Bohemond; I see 
  the great Frankish sword that has been going up and down like a 
  post-hole digger suddely leap like a *live thing* as Bohemond shifts his 
  grip,  and now a track of brightness horizontally cleaves the darkness, 
  cleaves the body of Bembel Rudzuk;  now in two pieces falls the body of 
  Bembel Rudzuk;  now in two pieces falls the body of Bembel Rudzuk to the 
  broken tiles of Hidden Lion.

  
  Here now before me is Bohemond.  This is the great moment when I shall 
  see the man who has become my world and my Jerusalem.  His fouled and 
  stiuking mail shirt glitters in the purple-blue luminosity of Total Now, 
  his helmet flashes as if wreathed in lightnings;  the iron nasal of 
  his helmet makes other than human this face I strain to see  but I 
  cannot,  I shall never see it,  I see instead the face of that veiled 
  owl of my childhood.


        I raise my arm now, I strike with my sword, I see it shatter like 
  shards of ice as the great sword of Bohemond makes a *rainbow* in the 
  night,  in the dawn that is coming.  I stare into the brilliance,  I see 
  the Virgin and the Lion wheeling in the darkness and the light.  I see 
  the sun-points dazzling on the sea,  the alchemy of the triangualar sail 
  changing from the hot and dry to the cold and the wet;  I smell the salt 
  breath of Bruder Pfortner.

       But I cannot see Bohemond in this night and dawn of brilliance,
  of purple-blue luminosity.  No, as the great sword makes another 
  *rainbow* in the pale dawn where hangs the new moon of Tammuz, the 
  last thing that I see with my mortal eyes,  very very high in the 
  sky  and circling in the overlapping patterns of the Law,  is 
  that drifting meditation of storks that I have known from my 
  childhood, each year returning to their wonted place."

I believe that, generally speaking, postings to the list should be about
extropianism and technological progress - not on the basics of
economics/libertarianism.  I am only referring here to the function of
the list.However, I disagree about not conversing with others (apart
from the list) on the value of freedom.  I do not disagree with you,
Dan, on the pending singularity. I may even agree with you and Eliezer
that, once reached, the Singularity may make today's economic
discussions moot.  My disagreement is on discussion of economics *prior*
to reaching the Singularity.
Extropianism has not had any serious enemies.  There  is currently no
organized effort to avoid the S because those would-be antagonists do
not believe in it and  extropian predictions (taken as a whole) are
ignored, believed to be false, or belittled.  We might see anti-cloning,
anti-encryption, and other single-issue prohibitions.  But an outright
organized opposition to the future has not yet been erected.
As our ideas become spread more and more into the mainstream, we will
suddenly find people who believe extropian technological predictions and
will organize against them.  If this happens only after the S then, yes,
it is no use contemplating opposition at this point in time.  It is my
speculative guess that the S won't be reached until the next century.
It is my worry, unlike many of my fellow Extropians, that organized use
of force will be used to stop or rapidly decelerated all applicable
research and technologies related to Transhumanism.  Many will not mind
throwing us into a dark age in order to avoid this.  I am not predicting
this but I am not discounting (yet).
Discussing economic, ethical, social and other philosophical aspects of
Extropianism with friends, family and peers may help expand our support
base.

I await responses to this post... whether you think I may have a point
or whether you think I'm doom-and-glooming this issue without rational
basis.

In a recent post, I stated my belief that the list should have less
economics/politics and more concentration on technological innovation.
I would like to ammend my remarks to add that I also enjoy expressions
of art on this list, especially a good poem! Thanks for the poem, Shaun.

Hmm.  Has it occurred to anyone that the aliens don't care about us at

This is harsh.  That aliens caused crop circles would indeed be
interesting.  It would teach us not only that there were other people,
but that they were deranged people.  This is at least as interesting as
Martian bacteria, the past existence of which also fails to dictate any

vote for 'Excession', as it covers far more of the topics we discuss

I'm starting to think that we really need a "core reading list" and
a "good reading list". If I understood Max right, the books mentioned
in the principles were intended to embody the core ideas of extropianism,
but there are so many good books that should be mentioned that are not
100% relevant (but still > 75% relevant) that we need a list for them.
Maybe "canon" and "apocrypha"?

I agree that something by Banks might be relevant. _Excession_ portrays
superintelligent AI-ships in a positive light, and describes the
Culture a little better. The only competitor might be _Player of Games:
which deals more with the mindset of the Culture when faced by rampant
statism.

GEB is a hard book to classify. It is cognitive science and AI, but
also philosophy, art and entertainment. In the Aleph handbook we classified
it as Multidsciplinary.

Permutation City isn't a good novel in the reading sense, but it is *the*
book about uploading. As for extropian ideas, Distress is better and
(of course) Axiomatic. Maybe Axiomatic should be in the canon and the
other in the apocrypha.

Well, you are probably right about DW. The Bohr Maker is so extropian
it screams - the villains are ecofascists and biofundamentalists, the
heros nano- and gene hackers from an interplanetary corporation-society.

Forward's writing has never impressed me, it suffers from the info-dump
syndrome ("As you already know, the hyperdrive works by sending pellets
of negative matter into a strong toroidal electric field..."), but
the non-fiction is an accessible introduction to megascale engineering
and other stuff. 

Another book that should be canon if it isn't already is Bernal's
_The World, the Flesh, the Devil_. It may need some annotations (it is
after all many decades old and written by a leftist), but it has 
influenced transhumanist thinking very much.

I read the FUTURE MAGIC version, which is terrific.  (I nabbed several of
the ideas therein for THE WHITE ABACUS, and recommended Dr Forward's book
in my afterword.)

As several people have murmured previously, although perhaps this is
farting in church, some newcomers will be instantly turned away by the
sight of Ayn Rand on the strongly recommended list.  (I was a devotee of
her fiction at the quite late age of 19 or 20, while I was freeing myself
from a Catholic upbringing.  Later, as I like to think, I grew up even more.)

No, no, no!  Drones are *witty*, and arch, and sly, with a wicked glint to

Indeed.  Bartlett attributes it to Horace Walpole, 1717-1797.
"...The world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those who feel."

Unless, of course, their most deeply held political belief is
that the very concept of "country" is inherently immoral.
/I/ would never do /anything/ for my country because I have
no country.

I will confirm your suspicion; that's exactly what I think, now.
Credibility is earned, and so is the lack of it.  You have earned
the privilege of bias because you have shown extreme credulity in
the face of hard evidence, and your quotes on the matter are in
the archives for all to see.

Sure, it would be wonderful if there were things like alien
visitors or cars that run on water, but no less wonderful than
other spectacular things like cell repair nanobots, intelligent
computers, genetically engineered humans, fusion energy.  These
equally spectacular things we judge worthy of discussion because
their proponents have /earned/ their credibility.  I can redo
Drexler's or Feynman's equations and they come out the same; I
can look up the numbers they quote in the CRC tables and find
that they are correct.

Why waste time on fantasy when reality is just as miraculous?

If you're in Northern California, you can have mine.  I last saw it
at a Borders bookstore in San Francisco.  You might also send email
to the man himself at <mailto:ddfr@best.com>.  He lives in San Jose,
and would probably know the status of the work.

The only objective meaning of "infinitely complex" I can think of is
axiomatically true: "mathematics" is simply "the set theorems expressible
in mathematical terms".  The cardinality of that set is that same as the
cardinality of largest set of symbols in the language.  We can never
actually write down more than Aleph-null theorems (the number of integers),
but since mathematics includes real numbers, of which there are Aleph-one,
the cardinality of mathematical theorems is at least that.

Godel really has nothing to do with complexity at all.  It is nothing more
than the proof that of that infinite number of mathematical theorems,
the set of "true" theorems and the set of "provable" ones differ.

Well, of course it is!  That's precisely the reason it
requires /more/ thought and discussion.  Natural philosophy
(aka Physics) was once that way too, until Bacon and Newton
and Galileo showed us better ways to think about it and
test it.  But the other fileds of philosophy on the edge
that don't yet have a solid method are that much more in need
of critical thought, so we can develop those methods.  We
must not shy away from the job merely because it is difficult;
we must embrace it for precisely that reason.

There are a few exact mathematical methods used in Economics
and Politics; microeconomics, game theory, public choice theory,
etc.  It is also true that there is a lot of Economics and
Politics outside of those exact mathematical models.  But if we
shied away from tackling the hard questions that don't yet have
a scientific method, we never would have discovered science.
And besides, who is to say that "agreed-upon" methods are any
good in the first place?  Truth is not a matter of consensus.

Actually, you can define infinite complexity if you are using
algorithmic information theory. The algorithmic complexity of something
is the length of the shortest computer program (for a given Turing machine)
that can produce it; for a random sequence of bits the complexity is
maximal. If something that has an infinite size can be generated by
a finite program it has a finite complexity, of course. But one could
imagine systems that require infinite programs. Gödel's theorem seem
to imply that such programs are needed for sufficiently complex 
formal systems: you cannot generate all theorems using any finite
program; however, you can at least create a program of "length"
Aleph-null to generate them (simply by concatenating all the
possible theorems and adding a trivial lookup function so that
it can give you theorem X). So mathematics is infinitely complex,
for the right definition of complexity.

Personally I'm not sure algorithmic complexity is the best definition;
but at least we can use it and it has interesting ties to a lot of other
fields. 

[Fun idea: systems where the cardinality of theorems is larger than
Aleph-null. For example, the axioms may be parametrized with real
numbers like "if X is a theorem, then S(X,lambda) is a theorem for
all real lambda". Or can they be collapsed into the "usual" kind of
systems?]

It is fairly obvious that you cannot have a vertical asymptote of
technology, since the Bekenstein bound (I know, I always bring it
up; it's neat!) says that we can only store a finite amount of information
in a sphere of a certain radius containing a certain amount of matter
or energy. 

I have written a small essay about the limitations of the singularity

This is true. So far I have never seen any argument for that it would 
never flatten that was not based on "but maybe SI will circumvent it" -
invoking the abilities of unknown, unknowable future beings is not
a good way of doing projections (except by me, since I'm guided by
the Omega Point reaching back in time. See what I mean?).

My ever-unfinished paper about jupiter brains contains some of the
potential contraints on very powerful computing systems. It can be
found at http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/Brains2.ps in PostScript.

Why? The designs of Drexler, Merkle et al look rather rigid and
non-chaotic to me. 

> 1) Where a Spike subject to these constraints will begin to level off.

If Vinge is right, it will not level off until we suddenly run into
the limits set up by physics; had our rate of development been constant,
the curve would be a nice sigmoid and the levelling off would be
a mirror image of the development leading up to it (a few centuries
of fast development, followed by millennia of ever slower development
and then millions of years of ultimate-level stasis). But since the
rate is assumed to increase in a Vingean singularity, the curve would
be asymetric: we get a superexponential suddenly turning horisontal.

in finite time. Given a sufficiently ultra-advanced hypothetical technology 
and a lot of handwaving, you can probably circumvent any law of nature.
But we cannot say much about it, since it by definition is outside our
knowledge.

I suggest that hyperlinks accompany .  Pointers to appropriate newsgroups,
web pages, real audio, etc. would add to the robustness of the list and
certainly is in the same spirit.  Why not exploit the medium?

I thought Permutation City was flawed in two ways.  First, this "dust"
hypothesis, which as I read it is basically a Moravec-style platonic
realism - that any computation which can exist does exist.  The whole
metaphysical aspect that a more-detailed simulation would somehow overcome
or destroy a less-detailed simulation seemed implausible to me.

Second, the book describes a bizarre sequence of events: a character who
experiences uploading in one universe has the exact same brain state as
a character who is insane and _thinks_ he experienced uploading in another
universe.  When the first upload is terminated, the second character
proceeds to gradually overcome his insanity.  (At least, that's what I
think is supposed to have happened.  Another interpretation which is
technically as plausible is that the character was simply insane and had
an insane vision of the universe which turned out, against all odds, to be
true.)

This is related to the many-minds school of QM, where an entity with
a given brain state can be said to span many (perhaps infinitely many)
parallel universes.  My mind right now is shared among multiple instances
in different universes.  As events happen which distinguish the universes,
my mind in effect splits into multiple, disjoint, non-interacting parts.
Conceivably in some of those universes I could be uploads, being watched
over by beings who are simulating me, while in others I could be living in
the base reality.  In yet others I could be in some kind of VR.  And I
suppose in some I could be an insane alien being who has fantasized
the entire world of human existence, including an identity for himself
which happens coincidentally to match in every detail my own identity.
With an infinite number of universes, it's bound to happen somewhere.
This last case is the most similar to the situation in Permutation City,
and I think it is equally implausible.

In order for this to be an useful challenge, you must shoot them down
using known laws of physics, or at least likely extrapolations (marked
as such) from known physics. Otherwise you can always win by using
(say) unobtainium, angels sent by the Omega Point or the pink unicorn
force. I think exercises like this are useful (yes, I do plan to
continue the nanotech thread from two months back when I get the spare 
time), but they have to be stringent.

Negative matter implies negative energy (otherwise it would not work
in circumventing the Bekenstein Bound). So it would be energetically
favorable for vacuum to decay into negative energy states if they
existed; i.e. negative matter would cause vacuum decay. Besides, 
outside the special conditions of the Casimir effect, negative
energy densities appear to be ruled out in general relativity by
the strong, medium and weak energy conditions.

Could you name these processes? There has been some rather fierce 
arguments about the "real number assertion" on this list in the past. 
Basically, if you accept quantum mechanics it seems that you cannot 
use arbitrary-precision numbers.

No. The speed of light is locally constant, that is a basic result from
the equations. You are right in that in some spacetimes there are timelike
paths that can get anywhere in space-time in a finite proper time (like the
Gödel universe, which is (I think) densely filled with CTCs), but there
doesn't seem to be any reason why we would be living in one of them. Most
tend to be pretty pathological, and if we are close to a Friedman universe
then we cannot get around it faster than a certain time.

I would strongly recommend adding at least one of Linda Nagata's novels
to the fiction section of the reading list.  I'd probably pick either
TECH-HEAVEN or THE BOHR MAKER, possibly both.

Let me go further.  Dan, not only are there agreed on fundamental facts in
economics, but if you knew more economics you would be much less likely to
make your web-singularity predictions.  (Knowing more AI would also help.)

The sort of singularity scenario you endorse *is* a claim about economics.
And economic analysis is directly relevant to evaluating it.  If you don't
think
anyone knows enough about economics to say anything useful on this list,
then you shouldn't think you know enough about it to make the predictions
that you do.  

To be even more explicit: most singularity claims can be thought of as
claims about rates of economic growth.  So of direct relevance is our best
understanding of 
sources and limits on such growth.  

Your claim is, as best I understand it, that some new innovation in visual
programming will raise average programmer productivity by say a factor of
ten, and that there is some very strong non-linear dependence of world
economic growth rates on such productivity and the size of the web, a type
of non-linearity which only appears above some as yet unreached threshold
combination of productivity and connectivity, and which continues strong
through many orders of magnitude of growth.

Although it's a good idea to remember that fretting about these
things too much can throw our nervous systems into a depressive
biochemical funk which can decrease our ability to work against
these unpleasant possibilities (remember your dynamic
optimism!), I have to agree with you that these are very real
possibilities, and that this is probably what gives my
political opinions a sense of urgency to me.

I think things will turn out okay as long as no one group or
individual succeeds in using massive organized force to try to
get other people to change their behavior in the direction
preferred by that group or individual.  Unfortunately, such use
of massive organized force is the *NORM* under which we live on
this planet.  That does worry me.

Essentially, who can possibly stop us from achieving the dreams
we talk about here?  In the long run, the only serious threat I
can perceive comes from other Homo sapiens.  Specifically, the
subset of Homo sapiens engaged in the system known as
government.  Any effective opposition, I think, will end up
being channelled through there.

I didn't say I liked everything about the current system. I believe
that we should be using the current unprecedented prosperity to
raise taxes and pay off the insanely high debt (two thirds of which
was incurred during the Reagan/Bush years) to which you refer,
but I don't think this list is the appropriate forum. By "pretty well"
I mean by comparison to other eras. If we can just keep the system
alive for a couple of decades at most, we can break through to
a successor economy base on superintelligence and nearly unlimited
material wealth.

The Key is that these bounds are based on our deepest understanding,
not in the understanding of the superintelligences. If thg SIs can
figure out way around the constraint we see then all bets are off.
I personally don't concern myself with new laws of physics until
I see some compelling experimental evidence, but I'm not an SI, so
I cannot begin to design the relevant experiments. I'll restrict myself
to helping to build the SI. What new physics might our hypothetical
SI find? well consult any good scienc fiction collection. The current
universe may not be the only accessible universe, as a sufficient
example.

[SNIP of much more complex systems requireing serious autonomy]

A distributed system can consistently build a fixed design to atomic
precision if the design is hierarchical. Such a strategy may not be
consistent with the wilder nanotech scenarios, but i should more than
suffice to build replacements for all of the hard goods that comnprise
the current basis of the economy, and to build truly massive computers.
IMO this is far more than enough to obsolete the current economic
system and provide the computation basis for the SI. Stochastic
assembly and other non-deterministic systems are unnecessary even
though they may be interesting.

A hierarchical system is describes at some length in Nanosystems.
To summarize: specify a bunch of building blocks, and assemblers or
"factories" to build them from atoms. Also specify next-level
assemblers and/or factories to build next-level building blocks.
Go as many levels as necessary.

Sure, such a system is limited, but who cares? It's effectrively
a great deal less limited than any current factory.

Julio, you may wish to read
    http://www.shirenet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm
You will see that I am also concerned about anti-futurism. Your
concerns were one reason that I feel that we should in fact continue
to discuss economics and politics when these subjects directly
affect the rate of progress toward the singularity and when we
may be able to do something useful. My objection was to random
discussions of current politics and economic theory that have
little or no direct relevance to the advance of humanity.

Sounds pretty Utopian to me.  How do you know that an oppressive
government in some form will not exist post-singularity?  We could
probably maintain an anarchy now, but we don't.  How can you be so sure
this is going to change?  Are superintelligences by nature libertarian?
IMO, that would be an arrogant assumption on the part of
anarcho-capitalists/libertarians.

Here's a scenario:  A huge eastern-mystic-based cult forms.  They are
pantheists, and of the belief that all is one, they are one of the whole,
etc...  Using the money they get from selling flowers at the airport, they
transcend and become powers. They aren't very smart compared to your average
Joe, but since they believe all is one, and there are so many of them,
they all lump together to form one big *super-power*  This super-power of
neo-buddhists has more oppressive ability than all the governments in the
world combined.  They have only one goal: to *make* you become part of the
whole so the whole can perform some grand-scale meditation and become one
with the universe-- something like Hari Krishna Borgs.  Say goodbye to
individualism: you have no choice.

Now, I'm not claiming I can predict what post-singularity will be like
(which is obviously futile)  On the contrary, I am trying to show that we
cannot rule out *any* possibility.  The only preparation for an uncertain
future is in the attempt to create the future.  Creating the future
involves enacting change in the present.  If we don't start now, things
might get ugly.  Betting the problems of politics will be solved by the
singularity is not a risk I'm willing to take.

Enough pontificating.  Just my two cents,


Geoff

Whoa!  Microsoft, there, is trading at 60 times earnings.  20 is considered
rich.  And Microsoft officials keep warning everyone that next year's earnings
will not rise as sharply.

In my opinion, this bull market is a bubble if I ever saw one.  People are
buying a stock in expectation that it will rise, rather than in expectation of
receiving dividends.  The only way to make money on this stock market is if
someone else pays an equal amount of money.  In short, it's a pyramid scheme,
not an investment strategy.

Microsoft is in a somewhat better position than most.  Because it gives large
stock options to its employees, Microsoft actually benefits from the money you
spend on its stock, so you are, in a sense, "investing" in it.

But in my opinion, you shouldn't "invest" in stock unless the corporation
gets your money, such as in an Initial Public Offering.  Otherwise, you are
gambling either that the pyramid scheme can continue indefinitely,
or that you can pull out before it collapses.  If you want your wealth to
generate wealth, you have to actually give it to someone who can use it... not
buy pieces of paper and hope you can sell them for more than you paid.

It's a pity Zyvex (nanocorp) doesn't take small investors.

My point is not necessarily that a given technology is feasible, and
particularly not that it is feasible to us.  The Unbreakable-Limits posit=

says:  "Such-and-such is theoretically and mathematically impossible unde=

laws of physics, in the same sense that you cannot add two even numbers a=

get an odd number".  I simply point out that the current, known laws of
physics make the limit a practical, rather than a theoretical, one.  The
Constraintarians are reduced to saying:  "Well, sure, it's theoretically
possible, but I don't think it's practical."  Well, but then the SIs may =
think
otherwise.  You are no longer arguing that a given end is impossible unde=
r the
Laws Of Physics (which change all the time, anyway).  You are arguing tha=
t a
possible end is not achieveable - because *we* can't think of any way to =
do it.

Considering the pace of technology and the past history of failure, the b=

of proof is definitely on the Constraintarian.  One must demonstrate that=
 a
given limit is mathematically unbreakable, and even then one may have lef=

 by
the known laws of physics.

My Continuing Challenge can be phrased as follows:  "Name one practical l=

which is mathematically unbreakable under the currently known laws of
physics."  Under these rules, I can't say:  "Maybe general relativity is

One flaw, no law.  If I (or the SIs) can only have negative energy under =

Your pointing out that a concept in itself might be immoral
introduces to me a new and very important dimension of thought.
So far, I have classified certain concepts as invalid and
fraudulent, but I hadn't made the connection with morality.

So far, I've thought of only certain acts as immoral.  But,
now that you've pointed it out, if a concept -- or thinking
in terms of that concept -- almost always leads to immoral
acts, or results in most people (those at the effect of
political games) being disadvantaged by the unwitting
acceptance of that concept as valid, then that concept
should be regarded as immoral.

I would write your first sentence exactly as you have.
The second I would write: "I would never do anything for
any supposed or pretended "country" because the notion
that there are so-called "countries" is an illusion."
(Of course, this depends on my audience.  I belong to
a Toastmaster's Club.  Some of the members work for
the "cop department."  To them I would say, "I love
the country of my adoption!")

By the way, the realization that the notion of "country"
is illusory is a logical extrapolation from Max More's
'Deep Anarchy' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm>.

Thank you!  You've just enriched the NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic

The singularity may very well be catastrophic, rendering all current
politics moot. It may result in any of an effectively uncountable
different horrific outcomes, gray being one of the more comprehensible. 
If you have a plan for steering the event toward any particular outcome,
I'd be happy to hear it. I just don't think that radical changes to
the existing economic/political system are relevant.

Please remember, I advocate actively attempting to advance the
singularity
by continuing technological advance. This has the advantage that if
I'm wrong and there is no immediate singularity, we still get the
advantage of the advance. This is one reason I continue to go to
work every day and attempt to forward the design of new and better
integrated switching equipment and enhanced heterogeneous routing
algorithms, instead of retiring or working in marketin g.

Eliezer, this is an interesting analysis, and there's some truth to =
it.=A0
However, both Price/Earning ratios and the overall bull market are more
complex issues than is often conceived.

First, what level of P/E is healthy depends on the growth rate of the
company in which you're investing.=A0 "Growth" companies with 20% =
annual
profit growth routinely have P/Es of 20-25, as you suggest (even in a
much less bullish market than we have currently).=A0 Microsoft has had
profit growth rates ranging from 35-60% for the past 5 years.=A0

Yes, every year Microsoft (and Intel and other infotech companies)
inform Wall Street that they cannot maintain this level of revenue
growth indefinitely.=A0 Then in the following year they maintain or =
even
increase their level of growth.=A0 Thus the Street has stopped =
listening.

I suggest these companies because infotech is still a nascent =
business.=A0
The technology continues to evolve rapidly, and perhaps only 1/10,000th
of the market opportunities have been realized.=A0

Second, your point about making money off of stock price rather than
dividends is an excellent one that few people realize the significance
of.=A0 What you may be missing is the potential of owning a stock to
realize future dividends at a higher rate.=A0 Ie, I may purchase =
Microsoft
stock now in the interest of making dividends off of it 5 or 10 years
hence.=A0 In this sense a high P/E ratio (and more generally inflated
stock prices as more money flows into the market) reflects longer-range
investing on the part of the public as a whole.=A0 It also reflects a =
high
degree of confidence in future economic growth.=A0 Which I'd expect you =
to
share.

An awful lot of money has moved into the stock market in the past few
years as interest rates have stayed low and bonds have been shown to be
a less effective long-term investment than stocks (they always were,
even when interest rates were moderate).=A0 Analysts expect an even =
larger
influx over the next 10-20 years as the baby boomers begin to inherit
and invest money from their parents generation.=A0 The larger the =
amount
of money invested in stocks, the higher prices will be overall.

To be clear, let me add that I think the current market is =
overvalued.=A0
Perhaps by as much as 50%.=A0 A market correction may wipe out a year =
or
more of gains.=A0 Nevertheless, for the investor with a horizon of at
least 5 years, and preferably 10 or more, infotech is a very savory
investment.

Sadly I'm more or less ignorant of biotech firms.=A0 Could someone post =
a
list of the biotech industry leaders and any analysis of their =
strengths
and weaknesses?

        "Childhood's End" *is* a very good book, but I think that "The
Songs of Distant Earth" is probably more geared toward such a list...as far
as Clarke goes, that is.

        I'm surprised that no-one has mentioned Marshall Savage's book "The
Millenial Project" yet.  In addition, I would add David Zindell's "The
Broken God" (though it is more introspective than "Neverness"), "Brave New
World Revisited" by Aldous Huxley (essays written a few years before
Huxley's death...they deal with the possibilities of overcoming the
problems he stated in his groundbreaking novel "Brave New World").  I have
also heard (though I have not read it myself yet) that David Friedman's new
book "Hidden Order" is quite progressive with more of an active businessman
perspective that "Machinery of Freedom."  Also, I strongly support the
prescence of "Atlas Shrugged" on the reading list; though objectivism hasn't
really progressed since its conception, it still is (in my opinion)
essential as an extropian core value.

Of the Mighty Mutual Fund Picks we took a look at:  One fund which is a
technology fund has a NAV at $45.48 with a 1 mo. of 17.37, 3 mo.at 29.46, 1
yr at 88.22, 3 yr at 53.38 and 5 year at 44.03.  Sounds good.  Too bad this
fund wasn't part of *my* portfolio!   A more moderate but tasty fund is a
financial fund with a NAV at $38.89, 1 mo at 10.77, 3 mo at 21.19, 1 year at
65.42, 3 year at 33.55 and 5 year at 28.36.  Another fund, an aggressive
growth fund, is NAV at $25.03, 1 mo at 11.79, 3 mo at 28.76, 1 year at
72.26, and 3 year at 38.90 (it is not 5 years old yet.)

Hey Dan,

Please do me a favor and send an e-mail to my homeschooled children
explaining that they can't have the telescope we are saving up for because
we just have to keep the "system" alive for a couple more decades.  I have
not been able to figure out just the right words to make them understand
that they are "human resources", and that it is a "moral" imperative that
they blindly follow whatever "system" that is in power, especially when
that "system" will be the one to lead them to utopia.

*  quotations were for emphasis, not to imply that you actually used those
words

Sarcastically yours,  Dana K.

Would this differ from the transhumanist reading library list 
currently residing on Sarah's site?  Or are you looking for something 
specifically Extropian?

I am going to look through a few that I don't own and get back to you 
on that.  Unless Robin has seen something in his studies, we can 
probably forget a sociological contribution--the field is still 
picking at its multicultural navel and fighting over the lint.

I was going to stay out of the fiction debate.  But I thought _Host_ 
was not well written.  Short sentences.  Brain cells dying from 
boredom.  52 pages in, couldn't stand it.  Had to skip ahead.  
To the end.  Find out what happened.  Aneuryism.

 I'm fairly certain you won't find anything which better meets those
2 criteria. I'd suggest a cognitive science/AI section with SOM,
Dennett's Consciousness Explained, and maybe William Calvin's
The Cerebral Code (I haven't read this yet, but from his prior books
and what I've heard of this one it belongs on the list).

>which to pick. Also needed: A good book on space and space travel.

Maybe Ben R. Finney and Eric M. Jones; (eds.),
       Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience
I'm also tempted to suggest Barrow and Tipler's The Anthropic Cosmological
Principle, but it probably has too much tensor calculus, or Tipler's
Physics of Immortality, which is probably too controversial.

>IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES

BC Crandall (ed)                       Nanotechnology
This is at least as easy to read as the ones you listed, and more up to date.

>ECONOMICS/SOCIETY

I'd add:
Thomas Sowell              Knowledge and Decisions
and at least one book by Hayek; I think my favorite is:
F. A. Hayek                Law, Legislation, and Liberty (volumes 1 and 3)
Richard Epstein            Simple Rules for a Complex World
Michael Rothschild         Bionomics
Robert Axelrod             The Evolution of Cooperation
I'd like to see Atlas Shrugged replaced in the top 10 by a Hayek or Sowell book.
Also, Vinge's The Ungoverned probably should be mentioned here.

>PSYCHOLOGY
Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi,         Flow: the Psychology of Optimal Experience

Kevin Kelly                             Out Of Control

(Not a particularly outstanding book, but contains a good description
of current cryonics organizations).
Greg Egan                               Permutation City

I found these 2 to be rather boring and would recommend removing them:
>Neal Stephenson:				The Diamond Age
>David Zindell: 				Neverness

The papers by Mark Miller and Eric Drexler in Ecology of Computation
might also be worth mentioning.

Not very constraining. The fastest signals in a biological brain move at 
about  100 meters a second, many are much slower. Light move at 300,000,000 
meters a second and Nanotechnology can make things much smaller than a neuron. 
One second for a mind a billion times faster than ours would be like 30 years

Yes.

Why? Life can assemble matter into very complex structures and I see nothing

No more sensitive than the enzymes and ribosomes that built you and me.

No more sensitive than our DNA.

Just because a process is complex does not prove it is chaotic. Proteins 
start out as a linear sequence of amino acids that  can't do much, but then, 
in a manner too complex for any computer to simulate, they fold up into 
intricate shapes and that gives then their power. Despite their staggering 
complexity these shapes are  repeatable. If the shape of proteins were
exquisite sensitivity to tiny  variations in the environment then they would 
never take the same shape twice  and life would be impossible.

Perhaps someday the rate of change will level off, but I'm just guessing and  
that's all I can do when I try to figure out what a mind a billion times as  
powerful as my own will come up with.
              

        >Will quantum computing have any benefit here?


If you wanted to change the universe and could make a quantum computer of a  
few dozen Qbits then you wouldn't have to wait for anything as prosaic as  
Nanotechnology . The reason is that when a conventional 64 bit single  
processor computer performs an operation, it does it on ONE 64 bit number at  
a time. When a 64 Qbit single processor QUANTUM computer  performs an
operation, it does it on ALL 64 bit numbers at the same time, all 2^64 of 
them, more than a billion billion, and any increase in the number  of qubits 
the computer can handle will increase it's already astronomical  power 
exponentially.

It's hard to see how to think about a volume less than the Plank length  
across, or do anything in less than the plank  time. The reason is that as 
the wavelength of light gets smaller the energy gets larger, and so does  the 
mass, remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.  Thus at some point the wavelength is so 
small and the mass is so great that a mini Black Hole is formed with a 
singularity at its center.  The energy of the photon where this happens is  
the Plank Energy, it is  E=  [hc^5/G]^1/2 = 1.22 *10^28 eV  where h is the  
Plank constant divided by 2 PI, c is the speed of light, and G  is the  
gravitational constant.   

According to Heisenberg it is possible to get something for nothing, even in 
a vacuum you can borrow energy, but the more you borrow the  shorter you can 
keep it. The amount of energy and the length of time you can detect its 
existence is related in the same way as velocity and position, the more you 
have of one the less you have of the other. In this way a vacuum  is  full of 
virtual particles, but the Plank Energy is a LOT of energy so you  can't keep 
it for long.

The Plank Time is t = [Gh/c^5]^1/2 = 5.38 * 10^-44 second , after this the   
mini Black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. The Plank Length is  
10^-33 cm, the distance light can travel in the plank time.

This is a short distance, very short. If the universe was a thousand times as  
large as what we now observe it, then this super universe would be to a  
proton as a proton is to the Plank  Length.

Now that's small, but what if we wanted to go even smaller? The singularity  
in the center of the mini black hole is a place of infinite spacetime  
curvature,  its a true mathematical singularity, so that means our current  
laws of physics can't tell us what is going on when things get that little,  
to do that we need a theory of quantum gravity and we don't have that yet.

Antimatter is a dime a dozen but it wouldn't help us because to gravity it's  
the same as matter. I assume you're talking about anti mass and that's far  
more exotic, but things may not be completely hopeless, we can already make 
it, or something like it.  If you place two large flat mirrors very close 
together then, unlike the vacuum on the outside of the mirrors, there can
not be virtual photons of every wavelength in the vacuum between the mirrors 
because some will interfere destructively. There are more virtual particles 
in the vacuum outside the mirrors pushing them together than between the 
mirrors pushing them apart. This force is not strong but recently it has 
actually been measured in  the lab. 2 mirrors really do want to come together. 

If you define a vacuum far from any object as containing zero energy and thus 
mass, and if it is able to push the mirrors together because the space 
between the mirrors has less stuff in it, then that space between mirrors 
must have a negative mass.

According to Kip Thorne a wormhole, like one made from a black hole, could 
not be used as a time machine or let you travel instantly to a distant galaxy 
because they are inherently unstable, the very act of entering one would 
destroy it. To stabilize a wormhole and make it useful you'd need something
that pushes the wormholes walls apart gravitationally, you'd need something 
with a negative energy density, you'd need antimass.

That's true of randomness  and also of those weird instantaneous correlations 
quantum mechanics can sometime produce, but other than that a Turing machine 
can simulate any physical process, although not necessarily in polynomial time.

Well..., there are strange attractors and there are a hell of a lot of them. 
I don't know if it's been proven or not but I doubt if they could be put into 
a one to one correspondence with the real numbers, unfortunately I don't see 
how you could use this in computing. The shape of the attractor is known only 
approximately, in most cases they are infinitely complex fractals.  OK , 
you run your computer it gives you a point in phase space, now what?  
That point could lie in an infinite number of attractors, which one is  
correct? Run the machine  again, now you have 2 points, you have eliminated 
an  infinite number of attractors but unfortunately there are still an
infinite  number left. To find the exact and not just approximate attractor 
you must  run the machine an infinite number of times and if you already 
could do that  then  no point in bothering with the Mandelbrot boundary.

How about Ronald Gross "The Independent Scholar" or any of his other 
works on lifelong learning.  He strongly promotes a non-authoritarian 
but rigorous approach to continous self-education, and what is more, 
provides very practical suggestions, methods, and examples.  Some may 
find his emphasis on the social sciences and classics annoying, but 
he doesn't ignore the harder sciences and his systematic approaches 
are fully applicable to them.  Both inspirational and down to 
earth.

The trouble with Tipler's cylinders it that they're infinitely long, nobody 
knows if one of finite length would work. Also, they'd be spinning so fast, 
almost the speed of light, that no known force would be strong enough to keep  
them intact, so to build one you would need new laws of physics.

My investments tend to be somewhat time sensitive, but I have a couple
recommendations that are good at this moment:

1)  Triquint Semiconductor (TQNT - 29-5/8 per share):  Excellent
investment, both short-term and long-term.  Expect at least 40% growth in
the next 12 months.  The stock price dropped sharply recently because they
said they expect earnings to be less than predicted for a couple quarters.
Wall Street, as usual, overlooked the fact that they are still returning a
very good EPS and are continuing to grow rapidly.  Unnoticed for years,
this gallium-arsenide semiconductor manufacturer (no significant
competitors!) has entered a boom as demand for efficient wireless
communications and high-frequency circuits grows.  


2)  Informix (IFMXE - 7-1/8 per share):  This is a more speculative
investment, but fairly sound.  Wall Street often confuses management
problems (and Informix has had some serious ones recently) with product
problems, leading to the current rock-bottom stock prices.  However, as
soon as the new management is in house I expect the price to rise to
somewhere between $12-15/sh (far below recent historical prices) in the
next 12 months.  In general, management problems tend to be transient, and
product problems tend to be more persistent.  The current steep depression
is a management problem and should rebound for a healthy profit if
purchased while it is in the nether regions.  At this price it would be
hard not too make a reasonable profit in an acceptable timeframe.

Although the P/E is a bit high, Microsoft will almost certainly make it a
reality, so this would be a decent investment.

>Intel

Intel has a high P/E for a chip vendor, but since many of Intel's
competitors are essentially folding to Intel (e.g. DEC, HP ), this company
should continue to exhibit strong growth.  This would be a reasonable
investment.

>Compaq

*Hell no*.  A P/E of 37.8 is absolutely absurd for a hardware vendor.  The
only reason the price has risen to such an absurd level is the glut of
money in the market driving up the prices for blue chips.  This would be a
poor investment IMO.  Not to mention that Compaq is facing dangerously
strong competition from Dell and HP.

>Dell

Another hardware vendor with an astronomical P/E ( 49.6 ).  The problem
with investing in corporate PC vendors is that the market is relatively
fixed.  Companies grow by stealing market share from someone else, such as
the case is with Dell.  The market share of PC vendors is quite unstable
and can shift suddenly and unpredictably on a very short timeframe.  This
P/E would suggest that Dell will remain *the* market leader for at least a
decade.  I wouldn't bet on it...

>IBM

At a P/E of 18.1 and a healthy EPS, this is would be a good "value" based
investment.  IBM will most likely continue to grow at steady and
respectable rate for the foreseeable future.  They are worth this much
based on their intellectual capital alone.

>Sun

Sun will be reasonable investment for a couple years, but its long-term
prospects are fuzzy.  It's growth has been at the expense of other RISC
vendors, but that won't last forever, and their hardware isn't that great
relative to their competitors.  If they focus a lot more on software, they
may have a chance.

>Netscape

I don't have much of an opinion on Netscape.  Unless they decide on a
specific direction and execute it with some force of will, Netscape will
dwindle IMO.  They can't make a profit now and I don't see why they will in
the immediate future.  It wouldn't surprise me if they get bought out or
merge in a couple of years from now, probably with one of the big database
vendors.

>Oracle

At a P/E of 51, I would neither buy nor sell Oracle, because strong future
growth is uncertain beyond a couple years.  It's got some growing space,
but if Informix gets its act together, they could seriously impede the
expansion of Oracle.  Many parts of the developing world, such as Asia, are
primarily Informix territory.  And Sybase is once again competing, from
behind, but somewhat effectively against Oracle for NT servers.  Another
surprise: IBM'S DB/2 is making strong inroads into Oracle territory
according to recent reports (!?).

Oracle won't weaken, but there is no guarantee you'll show strong growth
for any period of time either.

These statistics are largely irrelevant based on market conditions at the
time these values occurred, and in the markets that some of these companies
are in.  I can guarantee that Dell will *not* show a repeat performance in
the next 5 years, despite their strong growth in the past 5.  Compaq will
choke.  IBM, although anemic, is a steady reliable earner.  Additionally,
companies like IBM are not traditional "growth" stocks, and shouldn't be
expected to behave as such.

Blue chips tech stocks will be a *bad* place to be for many years.  The
mutual fund money glut has driven up blue chip prices to an unsupportable
level.  It will take a long time to recover something resembling value from
many of these stocks due to the currently lofty valuations.  Invest in
these at your own risk.

This is where most people screw up.  The current P/E is extrapolating
stellar performance for more than a decade in the future.  Unfortunately,
this extrapolation was based on data from a period that is known to be far
outside the norm growth-wise.  Therefore, people who invest in companies
with such wishful P/Es will not be able to collect a reasonable value for
their investment for a very long time, if ever, especially if the market
reverts to its historical behavior.

Mutual funds are exhibiting the same problem.  3/4 of mutual funds today
are 5 years old or younger, giving them an average return of 20-something%
over the life of the fund.  A lot of people are buying into these funds
thinking they will get bigger returns than if they invest in a fund that
has been producing 13% over 75 years, when the opposite is generally true.

Wall Street is stupid for not listening.  The growth was induced by broader
market factors;  the growth inherent in the companies themselves wasn't as
stellar as people think.

A high P/E stock is an inherently poor investment from the standpoint of
dividends (effective return is less).  When you purchase a high P/E stock,
you are essentially saying that you expect the stock to maintain or exceed
its current level of growth some number of years in the future, usually a
decade or more.  I strongly believe that it is insane to try and predict
the growth of a tech company a decade or more in advance.  It is
effectively impossible.  No rational investor would claim to be able to do
this, but most investors claim as much by their actions.

Try this idea on for size:

The market isn't overvalued.  The economy may very well support the current
capitalization of the market.  What most people refer to as the
overvaluation of the stock market is actually the *hyper-speculation* of
the market.  People are making investments based on unsupportable
speculative hypotheses.  A decade is a long time for a tech company.  The
state of the stock market has less to do with the total value of the
stocks, than with how well people are placing their money.  The myopic
investment that is currently taking place may cause a stock market
correction, but in no way will hinder the growth of companies or the economy.

The market will continue to grow.  It just won't grow in the ways or in the
stocks that people expect it to.

Thanks for your extremely illuminating post, John.=A0 A brief comment

the construction of nanosystems with biological processes that create

Yes.=A0 My concern is not the repeatability so much as our ability to

backwards to a specific design for the nanites that will construct the
object.

In a broad sense what I'm saying is that the transformation from

nanotech: the desired output of a nanotech process is the phenotype, =
the

from A to B?

As you point out, I'm not necessarily correct in calling this
transformation "chaotic".=A0 It is indeed /complex/, in that it clearly
obeys some higher-level rules.=A0 Those rules, however, are part of a
theory that we do not yet have, and which I suspect to be much more
complex than we envision.

and
it seems that without radical developments in complexity theory (or
quantum computation?) risky trial-and-error may be the only effective
means of design.)

Truly amazing. Its like telling a Christian that I don't believe any such
omni god exists, then being repeatedly asked what I think "God" intended. I
assert that morality is myth; send with it many arguments. You challenge
none, but not only assume that I must be mistaken, but hold "morality" as a
"sacred idea" not to be questioned. No priest nor preacher has ever
evidenced more faith in a revered fallacy. I'm sorry I intruded upon your
worship service. It won't happen again.

As I said, I'm not familiar with the source of the statement and
expressions. Can the apparent contradiction be reconciled?  Maybe. Maybe
not. My bet is still on maybe not. When I see "counterfactual", I see
definitively, "opposed to fact." That which is opposed to fact is false.
When I connect false to "processes", I arrive at false processes. When I
note that false means non existing, I arrive at no processes even as the
"counterfactual processes" are declared to be processes. Very strange word
games and highly suspect.

If this is a challenge, bring it on. You might wish to start with "The

Not necessary. I've been involved with a variety of animals in my life,
including personally training dozens of dogs and a few horses. Not once have
I witnessed any animal choosing to set aside instinct. Indeed, it is appeal
to these very instincts that an animal is trained.

When you say "effect of instinct can be overidden", I must ask, overidden by
what or whom? Can an infant animal, human or otherwise, choose to overide
the instinct to nurse? Can a dog choose to dismiss survival instinct and
commit suicide? Granted, one can cruely choose to mentally condition an
animal to avoid survival necessities (ironically by relating to survival
instinct); or one can choose to  kill the animal and "overide" the survival
instincts, but the animal makes no such choice, for by nature it has no such
capacity; which is why the directives are call instincts.

I not only consider my paragraph relevant, but of core principle relevancy
in reference to the relationship of word usage and fact. In my book, nothing
gets any more relevant than this whatever the topic and issue under
discussion.  Your arbitrary dismisal as irrelevant without effort to explain
what about it is irrelevant and why doesn't really enlignten me much about
the alleged error. Suppose I go down the line and mark all your agruments as
irrelevant without explanation, thus leaving only my position to consider,
what would be your response to such an action?

Take another look. Instinct is defined as non volitional reaction in ALL
instances. That's what gives the term, instinct, definitive meaning. If this
definition is not the "true nature" of instinct, what is? By what objective
reference and rationale do you establish and hold this conclusion? It
appears that you are saying that every urge is an instinctive urge. The
instinctive part is not the urge itself, but whether the urge directs non
volitional reaction, or whether the effect of the urge is subject to
volition. Isn't this really the case and what really differentiates
instinctive from non instinctive? If differentiation is not a principle of
actual definition, why is there more than one word in a language system?
To be sure, if you feel the need, you can arbitrarily call all urges
instinctive to support the belief, "instinctive objective values" if you
wish, but it disregards the objective differention that actually exists. 

The definition I gave of the term, instinct, which excluded volition, is
consistent with the principles I explained as required for actual
definition. You did not challenge this criteria, but simply dismissed it out
of hand with the word, "irrelevant". You have aroused my curiousity. Do you
see any need to connect your word arrangements to objective reality? If not,
why not? If so, by what reference criteria do you presume to do so?

You qualify by quotes "rational values" indicating to me some reservation
about the terminology. Personally, I have a problem putting rational or any
other term, except, individual in front of values. I also have some
questions about "ethics and "rational."  However, these are  not the  points
I wish to pursue at this time. Let's look at "values" and "internally
self-consistent." I'm particularily interested in the consistent part. There
are many volumes of writing of all sorts that go and on about values. Some
even talk about consistency. Unfortunately the consistency issue is usually
discussed only in an area restricted and bordered by "sacred ideas." The
inconsistency caused by these "sacred ideas" doesn't usually count as
inconsistency.  Consequently, there is little recognition of and less
discussion of the fact that nearly all embrace a dualistic value system that
precludes consistencey. If we regard objective reality and truth as a matter
of consistency, I think you can see the significance of what I'm saying.

Have you ever heard a grieving mother whose son was killed in a war say: "I
am proud that he gave his life of his country?" She certainly valued her son
being alive, but at the same time, she valued her's and his contribution to
revered "Country." This is, of course, the extreme, but it is
representative. Are not "public welfare", "values of society", "debt to
society", "national interest", etc. everpresent in the philosophy of nearly
all? Does this not mentally divide mind into real self vs "ought self" with
a dual and conflicting value system?
Quite often, the conflict is not consciously recognized, but is manifested
in distanced events with no conscious connection  made between cause and
effect. Nearly all claim to be opposed to initiation of force and coercion
even as they voluntarily support a governmental system whose definition and
essence IS initiation of force and coercion.

You are quite correct, sir; which is why that is what I have precisely been
trying to do from the outset. You, at least, see where I'm trying to go with
this, and why. You may not agree now, nor may you ever agree, but you do see
my target and ,in effect, say, "Show me."  Terrific! I'll certainly give it
my best shot.

At this juncture, I am moved to interject a caveat of sorts and stand ready
to explain at length any issue raised by my inquiry and analysis: To say
that I am sensitive to language usage is the understatement of the
millennium. Nearly half a century of looking at this subject from more
angles than you can find in 27 geometry books has created this mental
condition. As a consequence, I may make declaration about language usage
that you wish to question. I just won't bother going into a detailed
explanation unless you do.

The first question that comes to mind is about the implied conclusion that
the term, morality, can be validly used to symbolize both individual and
anti individual philosophies. If the concept, morality, is based in the
real, it is absolute by virtue of this reference; and an absolute cannot be
qualified. It can't be part this and part that without an implicit
declaration that objective reality is in contradiction of itself. The
contradiction of "dual duty" shows up as contradictions in many places and
many ways. 

>However, when I now talk of "rational values" (not "objective morality")....

I take it this means you reject the idea of objective morality as false. The
term, objective, is definitively equated with immutable natural law, which
in turn, stands as determining whether a belief is true or false. When you
put the term, objective (true) with the term, morality, and say false, you
have said that morality is myth. At this point, you are probably thinking
that its only "objective morality" that you reject, but still hold to
"morality" per se as true. Won't work. When you set "morality" against
"objective" (true), you have nullified the term from EVER representing
truth. How can you divorce a term from the very essence of truth and still
call it truth?  By reference to what? (Do you catch the inference here that
if "morality" is true, it is necessarily objective, and that any claim of
"morality" as true, must necessarily defer to objective reality whether one
is consciously aware of it or not?)

In rejecting the term, objective morality, while holding that "morality per
se" is true, you abandon claim of objective  discovery and implicitly insert
the claim of subjective creating. If the created "morality" is true, then
you must be the creator of truth. Aside from the obvious contradiction,
creating truth, do you see a potential problem - a rather large one? What
happens when your created "true morality" conflicts with another
individual's "true morality?" Does it cancel to zero? Or do you argue that
your "true morality" is superior to any other "true morality?" 

Does this sound familiar? Since the concept, morality, has no objective
reference apart from subjective mind and feelings, there is no common frame
of reference and it makes little or no difference whether one claims the
"moral" to be individualistic, or another claims "moral" to be the "will of
God." It is simply a contemporary version of the endless arguments over what
is to be labeled moral or immoral. To put it another way: When you say you
reject the idea of objective morality, I take it you mean that they who
believe otherwise did not really discover their "moral values", but simply
produced them in accordance with personal beliefs and valuations. Isn't this
exactly the same thing that all do, even those who claim that individualism
is the "moral?" 

This whole scene poses an interesting question: Those that presume to do
"God's will" in anti indiviudal fashion invoke the "natural and moral ought"
as psychological justification for these anti individual actions. Here, it
is clear that individual is subordinated to the "moral" by direct reference
to an alleged superior being.  In a philosophy of individualism, what
purpose has the "moral ought?" Why is there such a struggle by alleged
individualist to lay claim to the term, moral? There is nothing to preclude
any individual from choosing and practicing individual oriented values
without any label whatsoever. (I know this to be true because I and a few
others do it.) Is not the dependence upon a "moral code" actually an anti
indivividual psychological subordination to a mysterious undefind superior
being something known only by a feeling of "ought?" If not, what's the point
of using the word, morality, and indirectly supporting the concept,
subordination, however it may be manifested? 

You recognized my objective as showing that the concept, morality, is
inherently anti individual. I believe that I have exposed by definition that
the concept, morality, is indivisible; that it cannot simultaneously
symbolize individual and anti individual beliefs. No term can except by word
games in which the term is not anchored in objective reality. There is, of
course, much belief to the contrary as most are emotionally swayed by
linguistic declaration without questioning whether the language does or does
not connect to the objectively real, an absolute necessity to to determine
actual meaning. The tendency to blindly accept a subjective label or
arbitrary claims as an objective differentiation is an almost universally
accepted practice that's plays havoc with thinking.

In an earlier post, I pointed out that the common of all formal religions is
subordination of individual to an alleged superior being; that no matter
what the subjective label and claims of difference, the root objective
identity of each and every one is fundamentally the same. The same
observation applies to every governmental system with the common denominator
of initiation of force and coercion. The psychology of subordination is
clear in formal religions. The physical manifestation of it is no less clear
in every governmental system. Indeed, the concept, religion, and the
concept, government, are so epistemologically, philosophically and
psychologically entwined that all alleged and claimed differences vanish
when examined by the ordeal of definition. Whether an individual is
subordinated to "Jehovah" or "State" is of no influence on the outcome.
Another everpresent common denominator of "motivation and justification" is
the mythical "moral ought."

When we speak of subordination of individual to an expressed or implied
superior being, what is meant by the premise? What actually happens in the
psychological subordination that precedes the physical manifestation? The
answer is highly visible in formal religion and only slightly less so in a
governmental system: Real individual subjective purpose is displaced by an
imaginary universal objective purpose. In formal religion, it is called
"God's will." In a governmental system it is called "national interest",
etc. The "moral ought" is ALWAYS from an alleged superior being, expressed
or implied, admitted or denied
The term, ought, has no meaning apart from obligation; an obligation not of
one's own choosing, but claimed to be inherent in the nature of things. 

I direct your attention to the key and operational premise of "morality"
regardless of what beliefs or claims exist to the contrary: The
psychological displacement of individual purpose. This is the root premise
of "morality." Since each individual, by nature, chooses an end desired,
i.e. a purpose, to consciously and\or unconsciously deny the existence of
individual purpose (whether we like of not) is a de facto denial of the
individual itself. It is not dealing with reality AS IS. I trust I need not
elaborate on the consequence of this error, since centuries of war and
endless violent conflicts explains it quite well.

Alas, perhaps you will say, "Tis true what you say of gods and governments
wreaking havoc by their moral directives, but this is a false morality. The
moral good can be achieved not by denouncing individual purpose, but by
recognizing it in a philosophy of individualism." This belief, held by
several, can be exposed as fallacy by  definition and logical inference.

Apparently we have "good", but also the "moral good." I know of no singular
reality that such duality of alleged meaning will fit. What do these terms
mean, and why? Since I have already addressed this issue in much detail in a
previous post, I will be brief in the definining of "good."

Good and bad are hardly scientific terms. They are synonyms for suited or
unsuited to purpose respectively. Is purpose objective (universal) or is it
subjective (individualistic)? How does the answer definitively relate to the
terms, good and bad? If means are suited to your purpose, do you not call it
good? If means are not suited to your purpose, do you not call it bad? What
if your purpose changes? Could not the very means that a second before you
called good, you now call bad? Thus in reference to the identity, individual
AS IS, we find that good and bad are not constants, but infinitely variable
in step with the evaluation of means in respect of a specific indivdidual
purpose.

What now of the "moral good?" Does what is designated as the "moral good"
change in step with the variable purposes of individual? Or have we
abandoned the real identity, individual, for another realm and change the
reference for the term, good? Can two such usages, two exact opposite usages
(individual vs non individual) conform to a singular objective reality?
Formal religionist point to "God" to answer the question. Informal
religionist point to "society", or "nation" to answer the question, but what
does an individualist call in to resolve the dilemma?

If you speak of the "moral good", is that which you call the "moral good",
"good" all the time? If it is a constant, "good" does not coincide with the
infinitely variable "good" that is found in individual identity. Thus we
must logically conclude that "moral good" is detached from individual and
attached to something else. What? If "moral good" is a constant, it can be
so only if it is tied in some way to an objective reality existing
independently of individual choice. It seems we have come full circle right
back to "objective morality" that was earlier declared false.

If you say that initiation of force and coercion is immoral, that it is not
the "moral good", on what you make the evaluation as well as valuation?
Doesn't this require that you hold the end to which the means is suited as
the "good?" So, now the pronouncement of good or bad is not referenced to
means as when individual was recognized, the "moral good" is now attached to
purpose itself. Thus is end itself shifted to means to some unnamed "higher
purpose."

If you hold peace and harmony as the "moral good", are you not indirectly
declaring that any other end chosen is "immoral?" Clearly, such a position,
expessed or implied, sets the choice, peace and harmony, as the "morally
superior" over another end chosen by another individual. By virtue of what
is one chosen end declared the "moral superior" of another end chosen unless
it is expressed or implied that the source of this "superior moral value" is
likewise superior to human individual. Look familiar? We're right back at
the "objective morality" long obscured by word games. In short, the other
individual's end chosen is mentally displaced because it didn't fit what was
conceived to be the "moral good." Thus is the existent, real individual,
denied no less than in formal religion.

The issue is not WHAT end is chosen and set as the "moral good." The issue
is that ANY END is chosen and set as the "moral good." As illustrated above,
the choosing and setting of a "moral good" implicitly declares the "moral
good" to be constant (objective), and to be superior (superior being) over
the end chosen by individual. Thus does the myth of morality serve only to
propagate and promote anti individualism in literally every sphere of
interpersonal relationships.

Since most know little of the principles and workings of their mind, they
feel and thus believe, that if they consciously reject the idea of "gods and
governments" that's the end of it. I'm afraid it isn't. Though one might
think that talk of the subconscious and subconscious directives is a lot of
mumbo jumbo, I assure you, it is quite real. 

If someone says, "I have the moral right to defend myself", what are the
logical inferences of such a declaration and feeling? Does this not indicate
the receiving of a sanction (right) to act? From whom, or what? If one feels
the need to justify even the action of self defense, is not the
psychological subordination of self to some named or unnamed superior being
obvious? What's the source? Whether it does or does not have a name, it is
the same source that sanctioned an end chosen as the "moral good" in denial
of real individual. 

Thus, once more, I am obliged to conclude that "morality" is myth, and as
myth is in opposition to real individual and a philosophy of individualism.
The manifestation of myth is always end results exactly opposite of
consciously declared intent. Ergo, all "moral arguments" are merely preludes
to battle.

Having been down this road a few thousand times, I knew from the git go that
to assert that "morality" is myth is to encounter nearly infinite resistance
and probable hostility from some quarters. So, be it. I'm not out to win a
popularity contest. I'm out to promote individualism and attack as fallacy
anything and everything that stands in the way of it. If it requires
trampling upon "sacred ideas", this is not reason to hesitate. I function
from no "moral dictate",  just personal choice.

After examining the foregoing, do you still hold that the viewpoint you held

Has anyone mentioned "Beggars in Spain," by Nancy Kress?  It's a reasonably plausable fictional projection of what may happen as a small sub-group of humanity begins to "transcend" normal human constraints, while most people are (at least initially) left behind.  The clever bit is the initial designer-genotype advantage is nothing more dramatic than freedom from the need for sleep.  In less than a generation, those extra 8 hours per day give the "sleepless" almost complete domination of most sciences and intellectual disciplines, of course inviting resentment from the bulk of humanity.


Does anyone doubt that the first "post-humans" will be a small group of wealthy, technologically-savvy people, which will stimulate resentment and political attacks thinly rationalized as some manufactured danger?

Your definition, while consistent with differentiation, is not accurately
descriptive of the phenomenon of instinct. In defining instinct as
non-volitional reaction, you are not defining instinct; you are defining
non-volitional reaction. You choose to select a definition that does not
describe the actual phenomenon, because it tends to support your position.
Word games.

Instinct is inborn knowledge, skills, and values.

We feed, protect, and nurture our offspring because we instinctively feel
that the alternative would be morally wrong. That is the true nature of the
phenomenon that virtually everyone but you calls instinct.

Sorry. I was rather frustrated at not being able to do anything on the

not argument amongst intelligent people. Please accept my apologies...

I can beleive it. Its funny though, last year I was doing a website for
a transportation company here that is owned by the Paris Rail Authority.
One day they found out I was a libertarian and the next I was fired. Up
to that point thigs had been great, I got a commendation on my website,
etc.

Beyond the simple four hole cell, for direct signal transmission, I can
see triangluar cells with three holes. These would have one electron in
them, and a four hole cell along each of two sides, pushing the one
electron around in the tri-cell. The third side would be the output of
the logic gate, and a four hole cell could be lined up directly, or
offset by a hole, which would give the OR and NOR, AND, NAND, etc
depending on how its laid out.

Must be a government Monolith. It saw us thousands of light years away
as primitives, took a couple thousand years to have studies done, review
all of the differing scientific opinions, tried to push it through the
Galactic Congress, but it got stuck in committee for another thousand
years, as the Chairman of the Committee didn't like the Monolith
nominated to go; he thought it supported politically incorrect
technologies. So the other member planetary bodies of the committee had
to gather signatures to override the Chairman's decision, and finally
had hearings and then turned down the nominated Monolith. The President
then nominated a completely incompetent and unqualified paperpusher who
happened to have some good connections, and it got approved. So the
incompetent Monolith undertook its eons long mission to travel here at
sublight speeds, and once it got here found we had already invented the
wheel, but since it made the effort, and the Galactic government had
budgeted $20 Googolbucks for the project it was gonna reteach it to us
anyways, so it started making funny circles in fields of monoculture
cereals, since if the money wasn't spent this megayear, then they
wouldn't get the same level of appropriation in the next fiscal
megayear, which would mean a loss of power and prestige for the
Secretary of the Galactic Department of State. Seeing the outcome, there
were classified discussions in the Intelligence Committee on whether
they should manipulate us into blowing ourselves to smithereens in a
nuclear holocaust, just to push us back to the stone age, so the
Monolith could then really teach us about the wheel. Makes the USSR look
like a model of efficiency...

Yeah, what's with that. I've got to deal with waking up all groggy for

Visiting the Reconstructive Surgery unit this morning (if you must know,
I'm having my penis redone to resemble Bill Clinton's), I said to the
charming young doctor, after she'd finished scrutinising my radiograms,
`There's one other thing, quite unconnected - I had a blood test a few
weeks back and turned out to have shocking high cholesterol.  Of course I
have now changed my life-style from top to toe, and I'm wondering how soon
it would be useful to get retested?'  She gazed at my with indignation and
cried, `I'm a *plastic surgeon*!'  

Mortified by my social gaffe, I mumbled my apologies, and she added,
`Probably six weeks.'  

Amazing, I thought.  Here I am, on the net, surrounded by people happy to
offer arcane items of info - from their professional stock or gleaned from
hungry curiosity - and this not-at-all-pretentious woman was genuinely if
briefly taken aback that I should expect her to recall something so
low-level, so beneath her status.

I second this murmured movement.

Or move it to 'apocrypha' with say 'balancing' works like _the
dispossessed_ by Ursula le Guin that deal with anarcho influences other
that the preDickensian pre HGwellsian outlook that seems to dominate the
guns and gutter life in the USA today. (Or so it looks from Australia as an
impressionalist generalization.)

Subject: ETHICS: Value-sets and value-systems
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In order to think about the notion of "objective morality",
I've ended up fixing upon two concepts, value-set and
value-system.  I define the "value-set" and "value-system" of 
an entity as follows:

The value-set is the set of things that "feel good" to the
entity. To be more precise: imagine a list pairing off
various experiences with their qualitative feel: painful,
pleasurable, etc. Just which qualitative feels should be
regarded as assignments of value is an interesting question. 
Maybe "pleasure" and "pain" between them cover everything, 
maybe not. I do think there are some "qualitative feels" which
aren't assignments of values - for example, perceptions of color.
Even if you fear blue, perceiving something as blue is not
an assignment of value - fearing the thing because it's blue is.

The value-system is the set of all those principles for *acting*
(or all those dispositions to act, in the case of an unconscious
value-system), which will help determine whether the entity
has "good" or "bad" experiences. For example, "Act so as to feel 
good". Another interesting question: does any entity ever make
a choice that's not a product of its value-system? Or is there
a logical identity between "choice" and "act determined by a
value-system"?

What does it mean for something to "have value"? The only
answers I can think of are (i) it appears in a value-set
(as defined above), or (ii) it plays some role in a value-system 
(for example, helps bring about situations in the value-set).
So if "being good" is a form of "having value", I don't see
any way to give it meaning except by referring to *some*
entity's experiences or preferences. In particular, I
don't see how one can judge one value-system to be better
than another, unless one has a value-system to judge by.
As far as I can see, this is completely non-paradoxical,
but it does imply that there are no facts of the form
"Morality A is better than morality B", only facts of the
form "Morality A is better than morality B, according to
morality C".

But in the cases where they are good advice, would you say it would 
be moral?

Let's take the idea to its extreme. Suppose there is some perverse 
type whose deepest values are of a sadistic nature. Suppose this guy 
is king in some small country in the third world. According to your 
ethics, would it be moral for him to coerce his subjects into serving 
him and helping him torture as many children as possible? From what 
you have said so far, it looks as if it would be a consequence of 
your view that it would be *morally wrong* for this king *not* to 
commit these atrocities, given that they indeed reflect his deepest 
values.

The following book advertisement in the 971011 Science News caught my
eye:

_Evolution Isn't What It Used To Be: The Augmented Animal and the
Whole Wired World_ by Walter Truett Anderson. A 'bionic convergence'
is upon us, says Anderson in this look at the melding of biology and
technology and its impact on our evolutionary path ... Originally
published in hardcover in 1996. WH Freeman, 1997, 223 p.,  paperback.

This title sounds alot like that of Max's book (?) that is supposed to
be published soon.

But that's not "backwards", it's a much easier way to go. There is only one 
output a complex mechanism can produce, so finding it, that is, understanding  
it, could be very difficult. On the other hand, there are an infinite number  
of ways a given output could be produced and you only need to find one of
them, that one will be the one that is easiest to understand. Nanotechnology 
is different than life in that respect because life never used a simple 
solution if a complex  one was available.

Starting from scratch can be an advantage.  Life is a mess, the reason 
intelligent beings have such trouble figuring out how it operates is that it 
was not made by intelligence, and it shows. Life's inscrutability does not 
demonstrate good design but the reverse, an elegant program written by a 
master programmer is easier to understand than a mountain of turgid spaghetti 
code from a no talent hack. 

Random mutation and natural selection is not conducive to elegance in design  
or ease of comprehension. The trouble with evolution is that it has no  
foresight. With evolution EVERY step (generation) no matter how many MUST be 
an immediate improvement over the previous one. It can't think more than one
step ahead, it doesn't understand one step backward two steps forward.
  
Fortunately people are smarter than that, so If the tire on your car is 
getting worn you can take it off and put a new one on, but evolution could 
never do anything that simple, because when you take the old tire off you 
have temporally made things worse, now you have no tire at all. True, nature 
would eventually come up with a solution to the worn tire problem, but you 
can be sure it would be of byzantine complexity.

We already had prop engines for airplanes and then somebody came up with a 
completely new idea that used very different basic principles, it worked 
better  and in just a few years they had made a working jet engine. Other 
people could understand the engine and soon everybody was making them. 
Imagine if you tried to do that natures way. I give you a prop engine and 
tell you to improve it, but you must do it while the engine is running, you 
must do it in ten million small steps, and you must do it so that every one 
of those steps immediately improves the operation of the engine. After a few 
million years you'd get an improved engine of some sort, but it wouldn't be a  
jet, it would be a plumbers nightmare, and you'd have a hell of a time trying  
to explain to somebody else how it worked or even in remembering exactly how 
you built the damn thing.

A year or two ago I was puzzling over Aristotle's Nichomachean
Ethics, specifically his assumption about the existence of a summum
bonum. A simplified interpretation of his argument is that to pursue
a goal extrinsically, that is, seeking to acquire a means to a
further goal (rather than seeking something desired for its own
sake) partakes of drudgery.

I cannot agree with this.  If the notion of a summum bonum is not
inherently incoherent (and it may be), then for me the summum bonum
is the generalizably extrinsic.  Skill, money, beauty, wit,
attentiveness, and the other virtues of power are distinguished in
that they can all be used in the pursuit of nearly any other
desirable goals; and it is the generalizable extrinsicity of the
virtues of power that make them so desirable to me.  I seek knowledge
for its own sake in part because I've adopted (or was born with?
I don't know) the scholar's trick of flooding my brain with
extropiates whenever I have an "Aha!" experience.  But I've developed
that aspect of my experience because although I may not know now
what it is that I will want to do in the future, I do know that
seeking knowledge and developing my skills and guarding my health
will aid me at that later time.  Although biologically and
psychologically I am wired so as (to some extent) to seek knowledge
for its own sake, to value it intrinsically, from my high internal
philosophical throne I suspect that if there is anything "rational"
about my valuing the extropic virtues it is not something mystical
and "intrinsic" to them, but their extrinsic value in being the
skills that I need to acquire simply to live and continue to fluorish
as a human being and animal and physical computational system with
transhumanist aspirations.

I have been trying to unravel this knot in my thoughts for a while
now, and as you can see, I'm still not capable of explaining it
very clearly.  But now seemed the time to try to mention it, since
there has been a big flurry of posts dealing with moral philosophy
lately.

It seems that the many-minds interpretation applys not just to quantum
mechanics, but to probability itself. Under this interpretation, the
probability that a statement is true to someone is the fraction of minds
in the same state as his that live in worlds where the statement is true.
So when I say a coin has probability 1/2 of landing heads, I mean that
half of me (or more precisely half of minds in the same state as mine)
live in worlds where the coin will land heads.

This interpretation offers a simple solution to the copying problem I gave
a couple of weeks earlier. The central question in that problem was: after
you wake up following a cloning operation that conditioned on a coin
landing heads, what is the probability that the coin landed heads? Before
you went to sleep, your probability of the coin landing heads was 1/2.
This means half of you live in worlds where the coin will land heads, but
since there is just one of you in each of those worlds, that implies the
number of worlds where the coin lands heads as is the same as the number
of worlds where the coin lands tails. After you wake up, the probability
is 2/3 since 2/3 of you (which include the originals and clones since they
have the same mind states) live in worlds where coin landed heads.

Of course the many-minds interpretation wouldn't be interesting if it
doesn't offer any advantages over the baysian interpretation, but the
baysian interpretation seems to fail when cloning is involved. After
waking up and also being told that you're not a clone, a simple Dutch book
argument says your probability for heads should be 1/2, which implies that
your probability should be 2/3 before knowing that you're not a clone. But
as Eliezer pointed out, the baysian interpretation requires probability
shifts (in this case the shift from 1/2 before sleep to 2/3 after sleep) 
to be based on new information, which does not seem to be present.

pre ?

If you're talking about US culture in general, I won't argue;
but anarcho influences?  The flame I see more often is either
"`anarchism' and `libertarianism' inherently mean socialism"
or the like (which is bollocks) or "we had those words first
before you right-wingers stole 'em" -- which, as far as I can
tell, is accurate: left-anarchism is older than right-anarchism
(propertarian) because the latter is underpinned by Austrian
subjective economic theory, first developed circa 1880(?).

: Somebody asked me to go ahead and give the long-term results of total
: conscious control over human fertility, such as LeGuin gives to her Hainish
: in "Four Ways to Forgiveness".
:
: All right... but I'm just going to give the results, not the reasoning
: behind them.  Sorry.  It would be possible to give whys and wherefores in
: layman's language, but it would require at least a couple of thousand words
: of explanation, and I don't think I have the time.
:
: So:
:
: Stipulated first, the Hainish have perfect conscious control over
: conception; neither men nor women will produce or release fertile gametes
: unless they definitely _want_ to.
:
: Stipulated second, the Hainish have had this ability for hundreds of
: thousands, if not millions, of years; LeGuin makes it clear that it was
: gengineered into them Way Back When (and, to her credit, acknowledges that
: it was a massive project, involving major rewiring and taking generations
: to complete... which would be quite correct IMO).  This means that there
: has been enough time for natural selection and evolution to act on them.
:
: Given those stipulations, how will the Hainish have diverged from the human
: norm?
:
: The most immediately obvious difference will be a dramatic drop in sexual
: dimorphism.  Hainish men and women will look much more alike than we do.
: Men will probably be smaller and more gracile, without the heavier bone
: structure of human males.  There will be a general diminishment in
: secondary sexual characteristics.  Hainish women will have small breasts,
: though they may be elongate.  Hainish men will have much smaller testicles,
: and possibly smaller penises as well.
:
: Psychological differences, while less obvious, will be profound.  The
: Hainish will be more naturally monogamous than humans.  The pair-bond will
: be very strong and will either be lifelong (like wild geese) or until the
: children are adults.
:
: Children, by the way, will develop somewhat more slowly.  The parent-child
: bond will be even stronger than in humans.  Almost all Hainish will want to
: have children.  Paradoxically, birth control may be harder for them than
: for us... psychologically harder, not technically.
:
: Hainish sexuality will be very different from ours.  Their libido will be
: much, much lower than the human norm.  They'll have sex perhaps a few dozen
: times in a lifetime, instead of the hundreds or thousands that are typical
: for us.  Most of the time, they just won't be all that interested in the
: subject.
:
: Sex *may* be associated with a period of "heat" or obvious fertility in the
: women, although this is not certain.  But in any event, adultery and
: promiscuity will be very rare, and incest and rape, almost unheard of.
: Jealousy, except perhaps among adolescents, will be much rarer than with
: us, although it will not disappear altogether.
:
: The cultural consequences of these differences I leave as an exercise for
: the student... but think for a moment about being an advertising copywriter
: in such a world, or a novelist, or a songwriter.  Personally, I strongly
: suspect that all the psychological energy that humans give to our sexuality
: would have to go _somewhere_ -- into incredibly intense friendships, or
: religious feeling, or gregariousness, or artistic sensibility, or a
: super-developed code of personal behavior -- but I admit that this part is
: pure speculation.  They might just spend a couple more hours at the office
: every day.
:
: The Hainish will be, in general, somewhat less aggressive than us.  Hormone
: levels will be different; in particular, average male testosterone levels
: in the  will be much lower.  However, they will still be capable of
: testosterone spikes under the right circumstances.  They will be probably
: still be able to compete and fight quite effectively if pressed, but they
: may not have much flair for organized aggression (i.e., war).  It is also
: very possible that they will be less instinctively hierarchical than we
: are.  On the other hand, they might also be even _more_ instinctively
: territorial.  Again, cultural consequences are left as an exercise.
:
: Oh, one last kicker:  the Hainish may be noticeably less altruistic than we
: are.  "Altruism" in the biological sense has a much broader meaning than in
: the colloquial, but suffice it to say that the Hainish may have trouble
: giving loyalty to anything bigger than the immediate family.  This one's
: not certain... but in any event, their social structures will be radically
: different from ours.
:
: I could go on, but you get the idea:  the Hainish would not be human.
: First cousins, yes, but they'd be at least as different from us as lions
: are from tigers, or horses from donkeys.  They'd be a different species,
: and instantly recognizable as such.  LeGuin's depiction of them as human in
: all respects except fertility (albeit humans with an idiosyncratic culture)
: is just not possible.  Changing a single characteristic of a species is
: almost as hard as changing a single law of physics, and this is most
: strongly true when the characteristic is related to reproduction.
:
: Do I hear someone sniffing at "not possible"?  Okay... it's, like,
: *possible*, but so biologically bizarre as to require a serious
: explanation... like a planet with a mixed methane-and-oxygen atmosphere
: would be chemically bizarre, or a a bright purple star would be
: astronomically bizarre.  We'd say "hey..." if we say those things in an SF
: story; this is at the same level of funkiness.
:
: Now, I hate to do this, 'cause normally I just love discussing this sort of
: thing, but I'm having a busyish time in my life (working on a re-election
: campaign), and I don't think I have time to compose an explanatory
: mega-post.  So I'm just going to say that these conclusions are, if not
: absolutely certain, at least solid speculation based on universally
: accepted principles of population biology.
:
: ObBujold, I've seen biology in her books that made me go "hmmmm", but
: nothing that could be called goofy.  She's actually pretty good about that,
: more so than with the physics and such IMO.

Not true, I think. If a number of individuals share the same,
or at least similar, value-system, that morality implies
behavioural dynamics. Morality A may have game theoretically
stable points at "better" value-sets than Morality B. So even
though the value-sets may be higly subjective, the value-systems
are not.

The most obvious way a morality A can be better than morality B
is the amount of synergy it promotes.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
 
  If you'd like a summary introduction to Kant's work, here is Britannica's:

  (Alas, Ayn Rand (so good on many issues) got Kant all wrong; does 
  anyone know if she ever encountered Karl Popper's -- vastly more 
  poweful -- _Critical Rational_ Objectivist philosophy? -- TH).
 
      Kant
      ==== 
 
 "* Sapere Aude! *  Dare to use your own intelligence!  This is the 
 maxim of the Enlightenment!"  [From 'Was ist Aufklarung?' (What is 
 Enlightenment?) -- Immanuel Kant].

 
 "Interestingly,  Kant (1724-1804) acknowledged that he had despised 
 the ignorant masses until he read Rousseau and came to appreciate the 
 worth that exists in every human being. For other reasons too, Kant 
 is part of the tradition deriving from both Spinoza and Rousseau. 
 Like his predecessors, Kant insisted that actions resulting from 
 desires cannot be free.
 
 Freedom is to be found only in rational action. Moreover, whatever is 
 demanded by reason must be demanded of all rational beings; hence, 
 rational action cannot be based on a single individual's personal 
 desires, but must be action in accordance with something that he can 
 will to be a universal law. This view roughly parallels Rousseau's 
 idea of the general will as that which, as opposed to the individual 
 will, a person shares with the whole community. Kant extended this 
 community to all rational beings.
 
 Kant's most distinctive contribution to ethics was his insistence 
 that our actions possess moral worth only when we do our duty for 
 its own sake. He first introduced this idea as something accepted by 
 our common moral consciousness and only then tried to show that it is 
 an essential element of any rational morality. In claiming that this 
 idea is central to the common moral consciousness, Kant was 
 expressing in heightened form a tendency of Judeo-Christian ethics 
 and revealing how much the Western ethical consciousness had changed 
 since the time of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
 
 Does our common moral consciousness really insist that there is no 
 moral worth in any action done for any motive other than duty? 
 Certainly we would be less inclined to praise the young man who 
 plunges into the surf to rescue a drowning child if we learned that 
 he did it because he expected a handsome reward from the child's 
 millionaire father. This feeling lies behind Kant's disagreement with 
 all those moral philosophers who have argued that we should do what 
 is right because that is the path to happiness, either on earth or in 
 heaven. 
 
 But Kant went further than this. He was equally opposed to those who 
 see benevolent or sympathetic feelings as the basis of morality. Here 
 he may be reflecting the moral consciousness of 18th-century 
 Protestant Germany, but it appears that even then the moral 
 consciousness of Britain, as reflected in the writings of 
 Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Butler, and Hume, was very different. The 
 moral consciousness of Western civilization in the last quarter of 
 the 20th century also appears to be different from the one Kant was 
 describing.
 
 Kant's ethics is based on his distinction between  hypothetical and 
 categorical imperatives. He called any action based on  desires a 
 hypothetical imperative, meaning by this that it is a command of 
 reason that applies only if we desire the goal. For example, "Be 
 honest, so that people will think well of you!" is an imperative that 
 applies only if you want people to think well of you. A similarly 
 hypothetical analysis can be given of the imperatives suggested by, 
 say, Shaftesbury's ethics: "Help those in distress, if you sympathize 
 with their sufferings!" 
 
 In contrast to such approaches to ethics, Kant said that the commands 
 of morality must be categorical imperatives: they must apply to all 
 rational beings, regardless of their wants and feelings. To most 
 philosophers this poses an insuperable problem: a moral law that 
 applied to all rational beings, irrespective of their personal wants 
 and desires, could have no specific goals or aims because all such 
 aims would have to be based on someone's wants or desires.
 
 It took Kant's peculiar genius to seize upon precisely this 
 implication, which to others would have refuted his claims, and to 
 use it to derive the nature of the moral law. Because nothing else 
 but reason is left to determine the content of the moral law, the 
 only form this law can take is the universal principle of reason. 
 Thus the supreme formal principle of Kant's ethics is: "Act only on 
 that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should 
 become a universal law."
 
 Kant still faced two major problems. First, he had to explain how we 
 can be moved by reason alone to act in accordance with this supreme 
 moral law; and, second, he had to show that this principle is able to 
 provide practical guidance in our choices. If we were to couple 
 Hume's theory that reason is always the slave of the passions with 
 Kant's denial of moral worth to all actions motivated by desires, the 
 outcome would be that no actions can have moral worth. 
 
 To avoid such moral skepticism, Kant maintained that reason alone can 
 lead to action. Unfortunately he was unable to say much in defense of 
 this claim. Of course, the mere fact that we otherwise face so 
 unpalatable a conclusion is in itself a powerful incentive to believe 
 that somehow a categorical imperative must be possible, but this is 
 not convincing to anyone not already wedded to Kant's view of moral 
 worth. 
 
 At one point Kant appeared to be taking a different line. He wrote 
 that the moral law inevitably produces in us a feeling of reverence 
 or awe. If he meant to say that this feeling then becomes the 
 motivation for obedience, however, he was conceding Hume's point that 
 reason alone is powerless to bring about action. It would also be 
 difficult to accept that anything, even the moral law, can 
 necessarily produce a certain kind of feeling in all rational beings 
 regardless of their psychological constitution. Thus this approach 
 does not succeed in clarifying Kant's position or rendering it 
 plausible.
 
 Kant gave closer attention to the problem of how his supreme formal 
 principle of morality can provide guidance in concrete situations. 
 One of his examples is as follows. Suppose that I plan to get some 
 money by promising to pay it back, although I have no intention of 
 keeping my promise. The maxim of such an action might be "Make false 
 promises when it suits you to do so." Could such a maxim be a 
 universal law? Of course not. If promises were so easily broken, no 
 one would rely on them, and the practice of promising would cease. 
 For this reason, I know that the moral law does not allow me to carry 
 out my plan.
 
 Not all situations are so easily decided. Another of Kant's examples 
 deals with aiding those in distress. I see someone in distress, whom 
 I could easily help, but I prefer not to do so. Can I will as a 
 universal law the maxim that a person should refuse assistance to 
 those in distress? Unlike the case of promising, there is no strict 
 inconsistency in this maxim being a universal law. 
 
 Kant, however, says that I cannot will it to be such because I may 
 someday be in distress myself, and I would then want assistance from 
 others. This type of example is less convincing than the previous 
 one. If I value self-sufficiency so highly that I would rather remain 
 in distress than escape from it through the intervention of another, 
 Kant's principle no longer tells me that I have a duty to assist 
 those in distress. 
 
 In effect, Kant's supreme principle of practical reason can only tell 
 us what to do in those special cases in which turning the maxim of 
 our action into a universal law yields a contradiction. Outside this 
 limited range, the moral law that was to apply to all rational beings 
 regardless of their wants and desires cannot guide us except by 
 appealing to our desires.
 
 Kant does offer alternative formulations of the categorical 
 imperative, and one of these has been seen as providing more 
 substantial guidance than the formulation so far considered. This 
 formulation is: "So act that you treat humanity in your own person 
 and in the person of everyone else always at the same time as an end 
 and never merely as means." 
 
 The connection between this formulation and the first one is not 
 entirely clear, but the idea seems to be that when I choose for 
 myself I treat myself as an end. If, therefore, in accordance with 
 the principle of universal law, I must choose so that all could 
 choose similarly, I must respect everyone else as an end. Even if 
 this is valid, the application of the principle raises further 
 questions. 
 
 What is it to treat someone merely as a means? Using a person as a  
 slave is an obvious example; Kant, like Bentham, was making a stand 
 against this kind of inequality while it still flourished as an 
 institution in some parts of the world. But to condemn slavery we 
 have only to give equal weight to the interests of the slaves. Does 
 Kant's principle take us any further than Utilitarianism? Modern 
 Kantians hold that it does because they interpret it as denying the 
 legitimacy of sacrificing the rights of one human being in order to 
 benefit others.
 
 One thing that can be said confidently is that Kant was firmly 
 opposed to the Utilitarian principle of judging every action by its 
 consequences. His ethics is a deontology. In other words, the 
 rightness of an action depends on whether it accords with a rule 
 irrespective of its consequences. In one essay Kant went so far as to 
 say that it would be wrong to tell a lie even to a would-be murderer 
 who came to your door seeking to kill an innocent person hidden in 
 your house. 
 
 This kind of situation illustrates how difficult it is to remain a 
 strict deontologist when principles may clash. Apparently Kant 
 believed that his principle of universal law required that one never 
 tell lies, but it could also be argued that his principle of treating 
 everyone as an end would necessitate doing everything possible to 
 save the life of an innocent person. Another possibility would be to 
 formulate the maxim of the action with sufficient precision to define 
 the circumstances under which it would be permissible to tell 
 lies--e.g., we could all agree to a universal law that permitted lies 
 to people intending to commit murder. 
 
 Kant did not explore such solutions."

IAN: Preslicely... The symbiotic relation between 
plants and fungi cited in the study is analogous
to free-market exchange, not communism. The sub-
sidy of smaller plants by fungi is analogous to
an investment in future profits, not charity.

The Science News article defined all that as 
"communist" and as "cooperative," as if the 
opposite of communism, free markets, are 
the opposite of cooperation. What could
be further from the truth? Free association
is cooperation,  central planning is coercion.

I have difficultly accounting for the basis
of the false analogies in the SN article, which
turn beautiful examples of market eco-nomics into 
the opposite... but wait a minute Ian, is not A 
also its opposite? Uh, oh ya. Hu, huh huh huh. 

Communism is an integral feature of the identity
of free-market capitalism, for, apart from relation
to communism, capitalism would not have the identity
as "the best system." Without that identity attribute
based upon real-world relations, the idea of communism 
could appear to be a beneficial theory, while capitalism 
perhaps an inferior system. Therefore, clearly, communism 
is within the IDentity Set (the set that contains all 
those feature from which identity A is derived) 
of capitalism as we know it, and vice versa.

All that falls inside the ID Set 
of A is within the identity of A...

I don't see anything like an official announcement from Max,

Pardon me for answering on behalf of Max, but I feel that it would be better
that I explain his lack of response to the query, than not.  Currently, he
is in Barcelona, Spain, speaking at an international conference on the

Greetings!

Once upon a time, oh say back in 92, 93, I participated occasionally on
this list. Many of the "old-timers" know me as I have attended west
coast extropian parties, extro 2, participated in a cryonic suspension
and promoted one particular extropian meme - wearable computers.

Now, I find myself in the Boston area, after attending the International
Symposium on Wearable Computing held at MIT over the last three days.
Yesterday, during the questions part of  a session moderated by Marvin
Minsky, with a panel of science fiction authors (Gregory Benford, Vernor
Vinge, and Frederick Pohl!), I thought I heard the melifluous tones of
Sasha asking a typically intelligent Sashaesque question. I couldn't see
him to well from where I was seated, but later on at the wearable
computer fashion show, I bumped into him, sure enough.

Now, I know it is very late notice, but I am staying in the Boston area
till sometime Saturday evening, and would like to get together with any
extro types I can, pretty much any time, anywhere, between now and my
departure. I had to conserve financial resources and relocate from the
Cambridge Marriot. I am staying at the Boston Motel in Weymouth
617.337.5200, rm. 42. I'll be up late tonight, though probably on the
net, but you can feel free to attempt to call me up to 2am. Or email me.
I have with me some interesting artifacts from the history of wearable
computing as well as my current rig, and I'm incredibly fun to be with,
unless I'm wrong about that.

In other news, if you would like to see some pictures from the wearable
computer conference, you can find them at my website.

It was great fun meeting and speaking with Vernor Vinge, Gregory Benford
and Thomas Bass (author of Eudaemonic Pie and reporter for Wired). I had
hoped to get Vinge's autograph on True Names, but alas I didn't get the
chance. But Marvin Minsky had written the afterword to the first
edition, so I got his autograph, and more importantly, some of his DNA.
I doubt my protocol was very good; I had him rub his finger on his head
and place it on a piece of sticky velcro which I then stuck to the
inside back cover of the book. I didn't have any Benford books, but I
got his DNA and sig on the back of True Names as well. This was a first
for each of these guys. I also have Eric Raymonds's DNA (hopefully) on a
signed copy of The Hacker's Dictionary. BTW, Benford will be
re-releasing Chiller (an excellent cryo-thriller) under his own name
shortly.

That's all for now.

I agree. It is on par with the cry "I DONT KNOW HOW I GOT SIGNED UP FOR 
THIS BUT I WANT TO BE DESIGNED!!!!" from somebody who accidentally got 
subscribed to the transhuman list.

  ForBio Research uses molecular markets for efficient production

Okay, so it's not very funny. My guess is that the typo
"molecular markets" is the product of some web slave who's
spent more time doing pages for ordinary businesses than
for biotechnology firms. But what is a little more ironic
is that it doesn't take much imagination - at least if one's
heard of agoric computing (http://www.extropy.com/faq/agoric.html)
- to imagine, say, ecologies of nanomachine traders optimizing
some molecular-biotech procedure. If ForBio was using *that*

As an exercise, I thought I'd try to find a meaning for the
purportedly meaningless part of that sentence.

Working backwards, the first stumbling block is "transfinite
singularity". This is presumably a singularity in some function.
The question is: in what sense is it "transfinite"?
The function might be transfinite-valued at this point,
or the singularity might be located in a transfinite region
of the function's domain (the set of values for which the
function is defined). Consider, for example, the function x^2. 
It is defined for transfinite ordinals like omega just as
much as it is for finite numbers. (For those who haven't
run across it, omega is the first number that comes after
all the finite numbers 1, 2, 3,... After omega come
omega+1, omega+2, ... 2*omega, 2*omega+1, ..., "and so on".)
An example of a function with a transfinite singularity,
in the second sense, is f(x) = 1/(x-omega), which is 
singular at x=omega.

The next stumbling block is "noncommutative divergence".
Commutativity is the property that a.b = b.a, something
that's true when "." is multiplication and a and b are
integers, but not true when a and b are rotations of
neighboring Rubik's cube faces and "." means "followed by";
it's one of the basic properties by which one might seek
to characterize an abstract algebra. Divergence can
mean the opposite of convergence, but it also refers
to a quantity in vector mechanics, and this seems the
most sensible interpretation. Let's assume that we're
interested in the divergence of some field in this
second sense. Then what is it that the divergence does not 
commute with?  Perhaps the divergence takes values in a 
noncommutative algebra in this region? But I find it hard to 
see why the divergence wouldn't then take values from that 
same algebra everywhere else.

So the main problem here is to give a nontrivial meaning to
the notion of "noncommutative divergence". One way out
is to assume that by "noncommutative" we mean not commuting
with a *particular element* of the algebra of divergence values.
Since we are apparently dealing with tensor quantities
this is no great mystery - most matrices do not commute.

The final stumbling block is that it is the *locus* which
is said to have a "divergence". A locus is a region, so
we might suppose that when we talk about the divergence
of the locus, we are integrating divergence across the 
locus. But what do we mean by *the* locus of the
contravariant tensor? The expression "the locus of X"
normally would mean "the region in which X can be
found". But then we would be saying "the divergence
of the region is noncommutative in a particular region",
which does not make obvious sense. Therefore we are
probably using the term "locus" as a shorthand for
some already introduced expression, for example
"locus of points for which ... has the same value
as it does at the current point".

So the complete translation of our original statement
might run:

"But Arthur C. Clarke has already told us that the 
integral of the divergence of the contravariant tensor
(over a constant-valued neighborhood of the point we 
are considering), in the region of the transfinite
singularity, does not commute with e (where e is 
some privileged element of the divergence algebra)!"

Constructing a function for which this is true,
and a context in which it makes sense to point all
this out, is left as an exercise for the reader.

Micro review: WOW!!!

Mini Review: This novel has everything: divergent human species,
uploads, nanotechnology, gamma ray bursters, traversable wormholes,
picotechnology, multidimensional physics and the most bizarre
aliens I have ever read about. 

Diaspora is a posthuman novel from the beginning. Only one of the
main characters have ever had a biological body, and the entire 
first chapter contains the description of how small infomorphs are 
made (the storks have been replaced by genetic algorithms, simulated
gradients of morphogens, neural networks and hebbian learning).
Most of the events occurs inside the virtual worlds running in the
"polis", dense nanocomputer networks where the infomorphs ("citizens")
live, although these realities are often seamless blends between
physical and virtual reality (one of the main questions is whether
the physical world does matter or not - some citizens prefer to
withdraw from reality altogether, while others crusade for "realism").

Of course, Egan could not make the characters too alien, since 
one of the principal requirements of a working novel is that the
reader is able to identify with the characters. So despite the
fact that they rewrite parts of their minds, copy, merge, download
into physical bodies or branch out in mutated copies they are
pretty human in many ways. Egan consistently uses gender neutral
pronoun for the infomorphs ("ve" instead of "he/she", "ver"
instead of "his/her" and so on), although some of the characters
still gave me a male of female impression.

What really makes Diaspora into a great novel is the magnificient
imagination and scientific know-how. This is hard science fiction
as it is meant to be: no rayguns or warp drives, but ten-dimensional
grand unified theories, the rotational dynamics of binary
neutron stars and high level particle physics instead. I must admit
that I wonder how much this book does require of the reader,
I found myself reviewing my notes from my old course in topology
at one point and sketching diagrams of fibre bundles. Hopefully
the ordinary reader can simply accept the concepts as technobabble,
technobabble which turns out to be well researched and consistent.
Regardless of its level, it is clear that Egan has one of the most
fertile imaginations around, rivalled only by Iain Banks and
David Zindell. Unlike them, he really manages to show how the
miracles are done, often in surpising detail. 

As a while Diaspora is a grandiose zoom outwards, from the bits
in a nanocomputer hidden under the siberian tundra to ever more
cosmic scales. When the reader has got used to one miracle Egan
zooms out again, and the previously titanic suddenly looks rather
commonplace. The tension lies not as much in the plot as in the
question: how will Egan outdo *this*? And Egan does really
succeed. The final monument to the creativity of intelligent
life and the infinite possibilities of physics is truly
impressive, and points towards even more grandiose possibilities.

Sorry this is not an extropian topic, but I thought there was likely
someone on here who might know the answer.

I live in the Midwest and I understand that you could see the MIR from
the Midwest, sometime this week at 7:52 CST.

Has anyone else heard this? Where in the sky would it be?

Thom Quinn <swo@execpc.com> asked about MIR visibility.

	I once found a page (a nasa page I think) that had this
information for most cities and locations in the US all in local time.
It was a great site if you wanted to see the MIR.  I've sinced tried
to find this page again but have never been able to.  If anyone knows
this URL, or another with similar information, I'd love to see it.

I believe the following Web page (or one close to it) provides MIR
visibility times for most U.S. cities.

Anders,

Did you obtain Egans _Diaspora_ in Europe?  It appears to be
available from 
http://www.jthin.co.uk/sfegan.htm
in Scotland, though I couldnt figure out how to order from them.

At amazon.com it is still listed as unpublished, but then, so is
_Distress_, which is already available in the U.S; so, amazon doesnt
seem to be up to date on Egan.

Even
http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/06_egan/ge_home.htm
still shows _Distress_ as his latest publication.

Perhaps I'll just have to wait, sigh ...
Mark

I bought it here in Stockholm at SF Bokhandeln in the Old City.
Strange that it appeared here before everywhere else, usually
books tend to arrive far too late.

Quite possible. Mitchell, to save you the time, Tom Lehrer's "Analytic and
Algebraic
Topology of Locally Euclidean Metrizations of Infinitely Differentiable
Riemannian
Manifolds" _does_ have a mathematical meaning.  And just to prove _I_ have too
little to do, I looked for myself to see that you won't find that meaning
on the Web --
the only reference to "infinitely differentiable Riemannian manifolds" found by
AltaVista points to a picture of a llama.  Quite appropriate to the current
topic, I'd
say.

Cheers,
Kennita

hi everyone,

good to see the list is working again, heres a post i sent that got bounced
back

But then again, maybe that may show exponential growth as well (the
underlying equations), which would
add an exponential curve on top of the exponential curve already in place,
making faster computing power more advanced in a much shorter time than we
expected!  Like with using alternative computing resources such as using
brain cells to hold storage (hold storage or compute? i think both), actually
evolving our
computers into the bio-spectrum.

Im with you, but unknowable future beings are whats going to create our
future, so we are really limited if we dont make some predictions, or
extrapolations.  I think you would be interested in Terrence McKenna's
Timewave Theory, where he has a map of time and explains that all of history
is an ingression of exponential novelty towards a point, and that point has
repercussions back in time.  His proposed end date: dec 21, 2012.  That is
the same end date as the Mayan calendar, and he says that he came to the end
date without the knowledge of the mayan end date, that must have been a shock
for hime to discover that Mayan information.  The Mayans were great
astromer/astrologers, who knew that the earth was round long before anyone
else did, and lots of other stuff. Check out TM's homepage on the web:
deoxy.org/mckenna.htm

Here's one of my favorite things he proposes:

All of matter is composed of one electron moving back and forth in time from
the beginning of time (big bang) to the end of time (2012 zero date). but im
not sure how he takes into account the positrons, perhaps they are the
electrons moving back in time, or rather THE electron. I wonder what
determines where in the universe the electron manifests itself after each
round it makes.  Any thoughts? Also, are electrons the same as the subatomic
elements of neutrons and protons? If not, what are the similarities and
differences?  

thanks

danny

G'day,
	the following piece is a small work of science fiction exploring
the interiority or point-of-view of a character called  *rajer* who lives
aheads of us 'in' or 'on' the singularity or spike, or plateau of a sigmoid
curve if it aint all that singular.
	Spending a little time reading it (and I see some of you don't get
get out much) it should (hopefully) be self-extracting. And though it
obviously is (might be) outside your reading comfort zones, it won't load a
virus into your sense of self and eat your mind, or even brain.
	This piece is a sequel to one written in 1987 entitled _child
rajer_. They are both 'dumps from diary entries'.
	_child rajer_ appears around the place on various list archives.
	I hope _ad rajer, spikechild_ will provoke comment, and or inform
your work. If you want a copy of _child rajer_ (its quite long) send me an
email.
	Regards,

meika von samorzewski

	the following piece is a small work of science fiction exploring
the interiority or point-of-view of a character called  *rajer* who lives
aheads of us 'in' or 'on' the singularity or spike, or plateau of a sigmoid
curve if it aint all that singular.
	Spending a little time reading it (and I see some of you don't get
get out much) it should (hopefully) be self-extracting. And though it
obviously is (might be) outside your reading comfort zones, it won't load a
virus into your sense of self and eat your mind, or even brain.
	This piece is a sequel to one written in 1987 entitled _child
rajer_. They are both 'dumps from diary entries'.
	_child rajer_ appears around the place on various list archives.
	I hope _ad rajer, spikechild_ will provoke comment, and or inform
your work. If you want a copy of _child rajer_ (its quite long) send me an
email.
	Regards,

meika von samorzewski

    The only thing Teflon about this topic is that my mind won't
stick to it!

    At first I thought it might be me.  Nope, it is just purposely written so
as not be understood.

    Please, author, just state the meat of it for me without the snide
flourishes!

    Bates (below) brings in the LaRouchian/Catholic Church theory of useless
speculation.  I saw no hint of that in the Teflon topic.  Contrary to
the ignorance or deceptions of LaRouche, speculation and, yes,
derivatives play a useful role in the economy.  More speculation
is necessary because of the prevelance of fiat money.   The
fate of the numerous brands of fiat money is controlled by political
manipulation (covert) about which the holders of assets can only
speculate in an attempt to protect themselves.  Take away the
monetary powers of the State and speculation would decrease
though it is still necessary to deal with any and all sources of
uncertainty in a free economy: weather, advancing technology,
disease, disasters, future changes in supply/demand, etc.  More
important than hedging against surprises, speculation creates
the liquidity of markets that makes it possible to raise capital in
a free society.  Who would put up a significant portion of their
life savings for an investment unless they could be fairly
confident of cashing it in on a moment's notice when their
situation changed?  Without speculators, the investor would
have to wait until someone else had the opposite needs, ie.
is ready to buy what 1st investor needed to sell.

    The Teflon Topic seems to be about the incredible growth
of the non-working class under current policies, a non-working
class that far exceeds the "can't work" class.

    It is my view that this situation is not an accident, but one of
the primary purposes of the Elite planners.   It is now a matter
of faith among the environmentalists created and subsidized
by the elite that the impact of humanity on the earth must be
reduced.  Would you expect them to work toward full employ-
ment?  No!  They purposely keep the barriers to productive
enterprise high with their excessive regulations and taxes.
Any Elite that wanted full employment would not allow an
employment tax (!) in our case, withholding in the range of
what (?) 23-40% !  The Elite would rather that large numbers
of people languish in jail or on steet corners selling crack,
or sit around waiting for a government pittance on the slightest
excuse than have them be functioning at a more normal
producing and consuming level.  It is easy to see that by
bringing another 20-40% of the people into productive
activity in a  free market would drastically increase the effect
of humanity upon the earth!  The only other solution would
be genocide!  That too, is on the agenda!

    Actually, of course, "environmentalism" is just a smoke-
screen for the real motives of the elite.  The most obvious
hypothesis is that their primary attention is on maintaining
their dominance of society.  The relative freedom of the
19th Century convinced them that they start to lose control
of the game when they allow thorough-going freedom and
the resulting unrestrained economic-technological growth.
New Dynasties arise to challenge the old under freedom.

    Wouldn't that just be too bad!

PS.  The writing of ruling class boot lickers Bertrand Russell
and H. G. Wells, both pre-environmentalist give a closer
glimpse of ruling class motives than the current flock of
Court Intellectuals.  See Russell's _Prospects for Industrial
Civilization_ for the most insights into pre-environmentalist
rationale for opposing progress.

    Woops!  I guess Wells was the bootlicker...Russell was
actually a "Lord" though not very rich by most accounts.
Damn industrialists had displaced his precious landed
aristocrats?

Here is one from Dagens Nyheter, a Swedish newspaper (probably
not very useful but has a picture):
http://www.dn.se/DNet/articles/29500-29599/29553/groda.html

The researcher is Jonathan Slack, and he was interviewed by the
Sunday Times in London. 

The research is not that extraordinary really.

It was in today's Atlanta Constitution, section B, page 1.
Done by people at Bath University. There was a quote from
a professor Jonathan Slack:

"Instead of growing an intact embryo, you could genetically
reprogram the embryo to suppress growth in all the parts of
the body except the bits you want, plus a heart and blood
circulation"

Thanks.  That phrase has always disturbed me too, but I could never
quite put my finger on why.  Now it's clear: it is used by those who
regard social interaction more highly than private intellectual
pursuits; perhaps because they lack confidence in their own abilities
and seek approval.

After the researches evolute more, let's just transplant our brains to our

artificialize our brains...)). 

Let's pre-celebrate !!!!

IS "GOVERNMENT" POSSIBLE?

>From some recent posts I got the idea that it might
be interesting -- possibly even useful! -- for people
on the Advanced Freedom Solutions List to discuss the
question: "Is "Government" Possible?"

Note that I'm not asking whether "government" is
necessary; I'm asking whether "it" is *possible*.

To get the discussion going, I present two major
propositions with minor corolaries: 

1. Individual human beings are volitional.  We have
power of choice.  Through our brains, we essentially
control the energy that animates our bodies.  I lift
my finger as a result of a decision in my brain.  To
learn more how and why this implies that we are free by
nature, read 'The Discovery of Freedom' by Rose Wilder
Lane -- available from <http://www.laissezfaire.org/>.
This issue is also covered in some of the basic freedom
reports at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.

1a. The notion that we can be "externally controlled"
is a myth.  It's only because most people have been
brainwashed into believing and obeying terrocrats
(coercive political agents or terrorist bureaucrats)
that the apparency of "external control" is created
in some people's minds.

2. From cybernetics (the science of control and feedback
systems) we learn that in many cases a controlling
process has to be around 1,000 - 10,000 times faster
than a controlled process.  Consider, for example,
a steel-making oven controlled by a computer.  The
"significant time frame" of the oven is about five
minutes.  If the oven starts overheating, corrective
action typically has to be taken within five minutes
to prevent permanent damage to the oven.

In order for the computer to take corrective action
within five minutes, it typically has to perform of
the order of 100 actions or calculations per second.
The "significant time frame" of the computer has to
be around one-hundredth of a second.  In addition,
the computer must be able to "sense" the temperature
of the oven, detect changes that require intervention,
and transmit signals to the oven's heating mechanism
for corrective action.  (In this example, the
controlling process is about of 30,000 times faster
than the controlled process.)

2a. Consider driving a car.  Your brain and senses
constitute the controlling process.  The car is
the controlled process.  If the car starts veering
off the road, or some other eventuality requires
corrective action, you typically need to do something
within a second to prevent an "accident" or disaster.
Therefore, the "significant time frame" of the car
is around one second, maybe less.

In order for your brain to be fast enough to signal
your muscles to take the exact and precise corrective
actions necessary, within a second, it probably has
to perform actions and calculations at the rate of
at least 1,000 per second.  It may have to perform
parallel processing to achieve this.  A strong case
can be made that the brain as controlling process
requires a "significant time frame" 1,000 times or
more faster than that of the car being controlled.

2b. There are certain "dumb" control processes such
as the governer of a steam engine.  The governor
consists of "flaps" that rotate above openings from
which steam can escape.  As the engine speeds up,
centrifugal force raises the flaps, enlarging the
openings, enabling more steam to escape, slowing
down the engine.  The governer establishes and
maintains the maximum speed of the steam engine.

Another example of a dumb control process is the
thermostat that turns the air-conditioning system
on an off.

2c. Considering these cybernetic factors, you could
conclude that, in order for "government control" to
be possible:
(i) The terrocrats who masquerade as "government"
would have to have extremely fast brains;
(ii) The "controlled" victims would have to provide
the terrocrats with all the information necessary for
"external control" (or the terrocrats would have to
be omniscient);
(iii) The "controlled" victims would have to have
extremely slow brains;
(iv) The "controlled" victims would have to be
brainwashed into belief and obedience, that is,
further "dumbed down";
(v) The "controlled" victims would have to be
subject to control by dumb control processes.

2 problems here...

1) When I see old people driving around in their cars they seem to have
a reaction time of about 2 seconds. Maybe we need more than just a
transplant.

2) I would like a tooth transplant. Where do i get those from?

No, everyone that is subscribed to extropians@extropy.org is also subscribed
to extropians@extropy.com; it is the same mailing list.

The domain is on hold presumably because the owner (Harry Shapiro) has
not paid the required fee to InterNIC. My attempts to contact Harry have
been unsuccessful, does anyone know how to get hold of him?

As if I needed another reason, but today's DOJ announcement of a $1 =
million a day fine levied against Microsoft for antitrust violations is =
a great reason for voting Libertarian.  I have only seen the Nando News =
story which I have snipped the following:

"This is a very serious abuse," said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. =
Klein, head of the antitrust division. He said Microsoft's action was =
designed to undermine the dominant market position of Netscape.

Internet browsers are important, Klein said, because they "could erode =
Microsoft's operating system monopoly" in the Windows operating system. =
"This kind of product forcing is an abuse of monopoly power and we seek =
to put an end to it."

The Justice Department objected to Microsoft's requirement that computer =
manufacturers who want to license the Windows 95 operating system also =
license its internet browser, known as Internet Explorer. Most personal =
computer makers install Windows 95 at the factory.

Klein said, "These are two different products." He said they should be =
sold as two separate products and denied the government is taking sides =
in the battle for market share between Microsoft and Netscape, whose =
browser is known as Navigator.

"Each of Microsoft's products should compete on its own merits," Klein =
said.

Microsoft's new browser software blurs the line between personal =
computers and the Internet. By working closely with Microsoft's Windows =
95 operating software, Internet Explorer lets people easily point and =
click between desktop files and Web sites.

"Anyone can give away a browser, but no one can force it onto a computer =
desktop unless you have monopoly power," Klein said. Antitrust law does =
not bar monopolies achieved by a company's talent and ingenuity, but =
does prevent abuse of that monopoly."

If this is not a bias intervention, then what is?  Love Microsoft, or =
hate it.  But, I cannot see how this action is justified.  How can =
someone like Klein determine when something is done through "talent and =
ingenuity" or "abuse."  I have been using I.E. 4.0 since its early beta, =

2 problems here...

1) When I see old people driving around in their cars they seem to have
a reaction time of about 2 seconds. Maybe we need more than just a
transplant.

2) I would like a tooth transplant. Where do i get those from?

hi

ive been sending this post a few times and it never came back to me, but
things are finally coming along, so here it is again.

But then again, maybe that may show exponential growth as well, which would
add an exponential curve on top of the exponential curve already in place,
making faster computing power more advanced in a much shorter time than we
expected!  Like with using alternative computing resources such as using
brain cells to hold storage (hold storage or compute?), actually evolving our
computers into the bio-spectrum.

Im with you, but unknowable future beings are whats going to create our
future, so we are really limited if we dont make some predictions, or
extrapolations.  I think you would be interested in Terrence McKenna's
Timewave Theory, where he has a map of time and explains that all of history
is an ingression of exponential novelty towards a point, and that point has
repercussions back in time.  His proposed end date: dec 21, 2012.  That is
the same end date as the Mayan calendar, and he says that he came to the end
date without the knowledge of the mayan end date, that must have been a shock
for hime to discover that Mayan information.  The Mayans were great
astromers, who knew that the earth was round long before anyone
else did, and lots of other stuff. Check out TM's homepage on the web:
deoxy.org/mckenna.htm

Here's one of my favorite things he proposes:

All of matter is composed of one electron moving back and forth in time from
the beginning of time (big bang) to the end of time (2012 zero date). but im
not sure how he takes into account the positrons, perhaps they are the
electrons moving back in time, or rather THE electron. I wonder what
determines where in the universe the electron manifests itself after each
round it makes.  Any thoughts? Also, are electrons the same as the subatomic
elements of neutrons and protons? If not, what are the similarities and
differences?  

thanks

Hi

I have a question, I've asked some astronomers but they havent emailed me
back.

I saw somewhere a picture where someone had a triangle so it fit perfectly
inside the earth, and within that triangle, perfectly, was the moon.  Is the
earth/moon relationship really like that?  I know the earth has been
expanding over its time and the moon has not, so maybe that relationship
existed in the past, but im really wondering about the present, does anyone
know?

danny


PS- now there's a couple scenarios, I saw a picture of a triangle, so thats
assuming it fits within a plane triangle, but maybe they're inferring its a
tetrahedron (4 sided pyramid) or something

Praise be once again to the difficulties of dealing with the
InterNIC monopoly.  The ownership was supposed to have been
changed to Max's name over a year ago; unfortunately, we used a
commercial intermediary to deal with the InterNIC, and there are
never any guarantees that they've gotten it right.

I'll send you contact information for Harry by private mail.

Why transplant?

I have maintained for years that the best way to get the average man
on the street to readily accept and endorse any kind of genetic
self-modification is to start with the teeth.  You'd think that one of
the easiest genetic tricks in our upcoming bag of party favors would
be dental regeneration.

I don't the party is quite warranted yet, though.

While the possibility of brain transplants, raised elsewhere, is quite
attractive, we _do_ need to wait for the technology to actually
perform a brain transplant.  Another downside is the need to wait 18
to 20 odd years for any clone bodies grown _right now_ to reach any
reasonable form of physical maturity.  I don't know about the rest of
you, but even if it were possible to cram an adult human brain into a
three year old body, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

Talk about an industry, though-- the care and feeding of decerebrated
clones.  How much per day do you figure it would cost to care for a
decerebrated clone?  To make sure it is properly fed by whatever means?
Can't have a clone come out of the tank malnourished.  To make sure it
is exercised by some means?  Don't want an emaciated, atrophied clone
stumbling out of the tank.

I'm confident there are ways to do this all in the tank, as it were,
but I wouldn't think it would come cheap.  Once an economy of scale
sets in, how much would you pay per day pe clone?  Ten dollars?
Twenty?  Fifty?  

Think again when you consider that a conservative prospective immortal
might want to keep two or three clones in the tank at all times, as
insurance against accidental death and dismemberment, as well as
cloning malpractice.  ("What good is a money back gaurantee!?  You
gave me a clone with Parkinson's Disease, you goober!")

This information claims to be from the RISKS digest, which is a 
reputable moderated digest, but I haven't checked to see whether
the attribution is legit.  I decided to send it on to y'all
anyway since the list volume has been so low lately.

(BTW: While we're feuding with the InterNIC, send your posts to
extropians@extropy.com and NOT to extropians@extropy.org, even
though the latter is the preferred long-term address.  I hope that
the problems with InterNIC are just a temporary "sickness", but
the InterNIC is not exactly a competitive consumer-friendly business.)

 Subject: Risks of installing Internet Explorer 4.0
 
 I just downloaded and installed Microsoft Internet Exploder 4.0 onto my PC
running Windows 95 at home.  Among the optional features that come with
this release are a few tidbits that were included with Plus!, the
mostly-useless set of bells and whistles that was packaged separately from
Windows 95.

 Two of these features are opaque window manipulation (when you move or
resize a window, the entire window moves in real time, rather than a
rubberband representation being tweaked) and anti-aliasing of large fonts.
The anti-aliasing feature is quite useful; it makes fonts in large point
sizes noticeably less pixelated.  However, in this feature lies a small,
and somewhat malicious, piece of code.

  This snippet of code apparently checks to see whether it is being asked
to render a font by the Netscape Navigator browser (or, indeed, any
component of the Communicator 4.x suite).  If it is, it gives back a plain
old jagged-edged font; otherwise, in every instance I have been able to
check, it gives back an anti-aliased font.

  This appears to be a clear instance of discriminatory coding on the part
of Microsoft, and is intended, one presumes, to make Navigator look
somewhat cruddy in comparison with MSIE (not to mention all of the other
software on a system).  It begs a troubling question: what other features
were included in MSIE 4.0 that were intended to, in some sense, impede the
software of Microsoft's competitors?

By picking an appropriate triangle, you can do that with any two circles of

This strikes me as a misconception (so to speak), although an extremely
pervasive one.  On the face of it, the growth cycle for a perfect 16 year
old young adult human body is 16 years.  And it's hard to see how that can
be achieved without all the sensorimotor interactions a conscious person
has with the rich physical world, and with other people.  The comic book
picture of healthy and muscular bodies growing suspended in fluid, ready
for cropping and transplantation, is entirely unhooked from everything we
know about mammalian developmental processes.

On the other hand, the real kicker in the headless frog embryo story is the
informed suggestion that we are nearing the point where functioning organs
can be cultured without requiring a whole body-brain complex to support
them.  I don't see why this should be done drastically faster in vitro than
a body does it in vivo, but maybe there are ways to tweak the cycle if a
complete body isn't needed.  Other mammals grow big and strong far faster
than we do, so maybe the latency plateau can be bypassed in decorticate
preparations.

 By picking an appropriate triangle, you can do that with any two circles of
 any size.  So it's true, but means nothing.

No you cant, it has to be perfect, or rather it has to be the right ratio.  I
am saying a perfect relationship, with congruent sides, to where the angles
of the triangle touch the earth's circumference at a point and the moon
touches the triangle at a tangent. If the moon was any bigger or smaller it
wouldnt be touching the triangle's side at one point, but rather two or none.
 Im asking if the earth/moon relationship represents this perfect ratio,
either with a plane triangle, or a pyramid.

Dear Freespeak:
Maybe we had better work on Freethink before we Freespeak.
Actually, that's the main problem with trying to administer a government
for the common good. 
It's simply that most people don't think in terms of the common good if
they think at all. Everybody has at least one opinion that they flatulate
on a regular basis. The problem is if they have an opinion that's the
limit of their perception. In other words no one elses opinion matters or
is even listened to. 
It never ceases to amaze me as to how ideologicaly fixated and parochial
we've all become. 
You can fantasize about your perception of government until the cows come
home but how are you going to impliment what you believe?
Enough already,

Subject: Is "Government" Possible?

IS "GOVERNMENT" POSSIBLE?

>From some recent posts I got the idea that it might
be interesting -- possibly even useful! -- for people
on the Advanced Freedom Solutions List to discuss the
question: "Is "Government" Possible?"

Note that I'm not asking whether "government" is
necessary; I'm asking whether "it" is *possible*.

To get the discussion going, I present two major
propositions with minor corolaries: 

1. Individual human beings are volitional.  We have
power of choice.  Through our brains, we essentially
control the energy that animates our bodies.  I lift
my finger as a result of a decision in my brain.  To
learn more how and why this implies that we are free by
nature, read 'The Discovery of Freedom' by Rose Wilder
Lane -- available from <http://www.laissezfaire.org/>.
This issue is also covered in some of the basic freedom
reports at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.

1a. The notion that we can be "externally controlled"
is a myth.  It's only because most people have been
brainwashed into believing and obeying terrocrats
(coercive political agents or terrorist bureaucrats)
that the apparency of "external control" is created
in some people's minds.

2. From cybernetics (the science of control and feedback
systems) we learn that in many cases a controlling
process has to be around 1,000 - 10,000 times faster
than a controlled process.  Consider, for example,
a steel-making oven controlled by a computer.  The
"significant time frame" of the oven is about five
minutes.  If the oven starts overheating, corrective
action typically has to be taken within five minutes
to prevent permanent damage to the oven.

In order for the computer to take corrective action
within five minutes, it typically has to perform of
the order of 100 actions or calculations per second.
The "significant time frame" of the computer has to
be around one-hundredth of a second.  In addition,
the computer must be able to "sense" the temperature
of the oven, detect changes that require intervention,
and transmit signals to the oven's heating mechanism
for corrective action.  (In this example, the
controlling process is about of 30,000 times faster
than the controlled process.)

2a. Consider driving a car.  Your brain and senses
constitute the controlling process.  The car is
the controlled process.  If the car starts veering
off the road, or some other eventuality requires
corrective action, you typically need to do something
within a second to prevent an "accident" or disaster.
Therefore, the "significant time frame" of the car
is around one second, maybe less.

In order for your brain to be fast enough to signal
your muscles to take the exact and precise corrective
actions necessary, within a second, it probably has
to perform actions and calculations at the rate of
at least 1,000 per second.  It may have to perform
parallel processing to achieve this.  A strong case
can be made that the brain as controlling process
requires a "significant time frame" 1,000 times or
more faster than that of the car being controlled.

2b. There are certain "dumb" control processes such
as the governer of a steam engine.  The governor
consists of "flaps" that rotate above openings from
which steam can escape.  As the engine speeds up,
centrifugal force raises the flaps, enlarging the
openings, enabling more steam to escape, slowing
down the engine.  The governer establishes and
maintains the maximum speed of the steam engine.

Another example of a dumb control process is the
thermostat that turns the air-conditioning system
on an off.

2c. Considering these cybernetic factors, you could
conclude that, in order for "government control" to
be possible:
(i) The terrocrats who masquerade as "government"
would have to have extremely fast brains;
(ii) The "controlled" victims would have to provide
the terrocrats with all the information necessary for
"external control" (or the terrocrats would have to
be omniscient);
(iii) The "controlled" victims would have to have
extremely slow brains;
(iv) The "controlled" victims would have to be
brainwashed into belief and obedience, that is,
further "dumbed down";
(v) The "controlled" victims would have to be
subject to control by dumb control processes.

I'd have to say that your assumptions about this technology are as
insightful as the automotive industry's opinion about combustion based
propulsion. What we know about genetics could fill a thimble.

Someday, these conversations will be compared to debates about the how flat
the earth is. (-;

If by "government" you mean as I do, something that claims rights and powers  
that individuals do not have and corporation could not dream of, then the 
answer from history is as obvious as it is tragic.
                       

        >Individual human beings are volitional.  We have  power of choice.
                         

It's not that easy, my power is limited, I can't do what I don't want to do I 
can only do what I want to do, and by pulling my fingernails off one by one 
with a pair of pliers you can radically change  what I want to do. Government 
learned that long ago, and they don't have to do it to everybody to stay in
power, just enough to generate a climate of fear.
                         

        >The notion that we can be "externally controlled" is a myth. It's

Don't underestimate them, believing such creatures is irrational, but obeying  
them is most certainly not. Galileo was not tortured but he was shown the 
instruments for it, as the worlds greatest  expert on mechanics at the time 
he certainly understood how such machines operated, as a result he publicly
apologized for his scientific ideas and said in writing that the church was 
right, the Earth was the center of the universe after all. I certainly don't 
hold this against Galileo, instead I look at it as yet another example of the 
man's enormous intellect. Only 20 years before, another astronomer Giordano
Bruno, said that space was infinite, the stars were like the sun only very 
far away and life probably filled the universe, but Bruno was not as smart as 
Galileo, he refused to recant his views. For the crime of heresy Bruno was 
burned alive in the center of Rome so all could see, according to custom 
green wood was used because it doesn't burn as hot so it takes longer to kill.
                         

        >Considering these cybernetic factors, you could conclude that, in

Little danger in that.

Again I think you're underestimating these people because all you've  proved 
is that government can't force a society to go in any  direction it wants, 
but that much is obvious, communist leaders repeatedly gave orders for their 
society to move in the direction of prosperity, it didn't, but that doesn't 
mean their silly orders didn't change things. Government doesn't have the
power to engineer the world to their liking, but it can see to it that my 
present wishes remain unfulfilled and it can make my future desires be very 
simple, either to stop pulling my fingernails out or just slit my throat 
and put an end to it.

I happen to know the person who actually wrote the Timewave Zero
software. The basis of this software came from interviewing Terence
McKenna, who had a visionary set of experiences in the Amazon regarding
hexagrams in the I Ching. It coincidentally fits with Arguelles' visions
of the Mayan Calendar, but there is no direct connection. And! NOT
EXTROPIAN THINKING! definitely not! I looked up the "Harmonic
Convergence" (in 1987 if any of you remember). TW Zero came up with
nothing, null, nil of interest for that day.

Anyway, TWZero is an example of true psychoceramics and has no
scientific basis at all...

Richard Feynman came up with it first, and uses the idea well, in what

Okay, all this might be so.  But if we take it too much to heart, we are
obliged to fall silent.  I remind you that this started with *your*
rhetorical inquiry: `How long is the growth cycle? six months? 2 years? 5
years? for a full adult body?'

What is the point of raising such a topic if our knowledge fills a thimble?
 If our contending comments merely debate the flatness of the earth?  

You refute your own objection.

Diameter of earth : approx. 12700 km
Diameter of moon : approx. 3500 km
Distance earth-moon : approx. 367000 km

Draw it and you'll see : such a triangle does not exist.

Not quite antigravity, but neat. Three days ago, only the National
Inquirer would have had the headline "Headless Frog Levitates", now
it can be done as a not very serious scientific experiment...

No. The radius of a circle inscribed in a equilateral triangle inscribed
in another circle is half of the big circle, so the moon is too small. 
If you inscribe a tetrahedron in the sphere, you get a smaller inscribed
sphere with a third of it's radius, which is still too large.

I think this nicely shows why one should mistrust pictures purporting
to show the secret relationships in nature - one has to check the
numbers, otherwise it is easy to be fooled.

Apart from that, transplanting your brain is only useful if you're not too
old, and have a healthy brain. The elderly, people with brain tumors,
Altzheimer's and the like wouldn't be helped much by brain transplants.
If such transplants became standard, the no 1 killers would be strokes
and cancers/degenerative diseases in the brain (instead of heart attacks
lung cancer and the like). 

Then again, the technology needed to perform a brain transplant
could probably also cure at least *some* of the (brain)diseases mentioned
above. Any doctor in the house to verify this?

I've once heard on some Discovery Channel program that you could
grow (human) tissues at an astronomical rate under the right conditions.
A small patch of cells could fill the floor of a football stadium in a
matter
of weeks or so, if cultivated under the right conditions. At least _some_
organs could be grown in vitro on a skeleton of some kind of stuff that
dissolves with time, maybe even whole bodies. This would only take 
a month or so(?).

Hey, you could have a body the size of a football field, if so desired.
How's that for fun ;)

The in vitro fluid is also the cells' optimal food, this is not a problem.
In later stages this fluid (or something better?) could be circulated 
through the body via an artificial umbilical cord (attached to the belly, 
not the neck like in _Space, above and beyond_)

You could pump up the clones' body with stereoids of some kind, and/
or exercise muscle groups with electric currents. That should do it.

I would like to point at Greg Egan's short story "The Extra",

apropos this subject.

I don't see how it would help. Maybe it would be useful for people
with cardiovascular problems, but the strain of the actual transplantation
is likely large. Brain transplants might be useful for diseases of the 
rest of the body, but suitable diseases are getting less and less common.

No. You are right in that cells can divide very quickly in culture,
skin cells (which was likely what they discussed) breed like bacteria
under the right circumstances. The problem is that they do not form
differentiated tissue, just a thin layer of cells. What you would need
is a way to get the tissue to differentiate into an useful organ or
even a body, and that requires solving some rather tricky
problems. Most of the structure is organized by interactions of
diffusing morphogenic messenger molecules, activating or deactivating
genetic switches. Their rate of diffusion is *crucial* for the correct
organization, so you cannot speed up the formation of the body without
speeding up *all* diffusion coefficients.  Tricky, very tricky,
bordering on the physically unlikely.

To develop the body fully, you need some activity in the physical
world, not just a clone-tank. But to answer your question, it would
likely be very, very expensive. Tissue engineering is likely the way
to go, keeping spare clones around would be uneconomical.

Hey, Uncie Doug!

I don't know if you remember me, but I'll just reintroduce myself anyway -->
I'm Derek Strong, fka Derek Ryan, and we met at my old home in Phoenix (the
"Phoenexus," where I lived with Ralph Whelan and Tanya Jones at the time you
visited).  We also hung out at Extro2 somewhat (and got kicked out of more
than one room together for partying too enthusiastically).

Anyway, if you don't remember me, I'm sure you remember Ralph and Tanya.
I'm the hyper, charismatic, generous, wealthy, suave, intelligent, funny,
short-but-nonetheless-large roommate of theirs (though I may have been
living with Rhonda while you were visiting us).  I'm getting in touch just
because I saw your recent post to Extropians and thought it'd be good to
keep our fledgling tendrils of association alive and well.

In particular, I wanted to let you know that Ralph, Tanya, I, and our two
new housemates Matt Day and Kip Repscher have all moved to Silicon Valley
recently.  (FINALLY!)  Here's our new info, if you care to make a note of
it:

833 Gary Ave.
Sunnyvale, CA 94086
(408) 737-8703

(This address puts us just a five minute walk away from the ExClave (Dave,
Geoff, and Romana's).)

Email for Ralph, Tanya, and Derek, respectively:

hplar@primenet.com
tanya@molly.org
derek@zhmort.com

I don't know where you go and what your travel schedule is like this days,
but I'll just go ahead and make clear again that you are always welcome to
stay with us any time you're in our area, and of course everyone would love
to hear from you any other time, as well.

Hope you're having fun!

Derek

Has anyone mentioned Stanislaw Lem (Polish SF writer and philosopher)?
His non-fiction books "Summa Technologiae" and "Dialogi" discuss
things like future development of various technologies, the convergence
of biological and technological evolution etc., as well as problems
of mind and personal identity. Though written in the 60's, in principle
they contain transhumanist and extropian topics (Lem was way ahead
of his time then and anticipated many recent developments).
Of course, his SF work is equally inspiring and recommended.

-- F.P. --

P.S.: I don't know if all of his work has been translated into
      English; I hope so.

No, but he certainly should be mentioned. Golem XIV is a good start
for thinking about SI, and "Peace on Earth" describes an early take on
a nanotech disaster.

Yes, it has been translated.

     Per Lloyd Miller's request, I am forwarding this to the lists I read as
well.  The Global Warming nonsense is a plot to vastly increase government
power...heteronomy restricted to the Elite.

Well, you *do* have the new information that your present 
consciousness-moment exists after the coin toss rather than before.
This observation is more likely given that a larger fraction of all
consciousness-moments exist after the coin toss than before it than
given that there are equally many consciousness-moments before as
after. Using this difference in conditional probabilities, together
with Bayes' theorem, you can give a Bayesian justification (contra
Eliezer) why you should make a shift in this case.

   Not true, I think. If a number of individuals share the same,
   or at least similar, value-system, that morality implies
   behavioural dynamics. Morality A may have game theoretically
   stable points at "better" value-sets than Morality B. So even
   though the value-sets may be higly subjective, the value-systems
   are not.

   The most obvious way a morality A can be better than morality B
   is the amount of synergy it promotes.

To say "A is better than B because it promotes greater synergy",
you have to say synergy is *good*, and I claim that that statement 
makes no sense except in the context of a morality or "value-system".
It may be objectively true that, say, A will outcompete B, but
again (I claim) this has no intrinsic moral significance, any more
than the fact that, say, the statement of A's principles appears 
earlier in the binary expansion of pi than the statement of B's 
principles; because there is no such thing as "intrinsic moral
significance", only significance in the context of a particular
value-set or value-system. I am not at all sure that the vague
notions of "value-set" and "value-system" are the right way to 
analyse the phenomenon of choice - I would prefer concepts that
were grounded in empirical neuroscience, and not just my
personal version of folk psychology - but I'll stand by the
general argument, that "absolute good" is probably as unreal as 
"absolute simultaneity".

Nonetheless, the sort of objective ranking of value-systems
you describe is highly relevant to anyone who's interested
in choosing a value system, or even in altering their 
value set, and who is a "rational valuer", in Max More's sense.
But to get the most out of it, one should probably first
figure out, as completely as possible, one's "value set" -
the "primary values", the things that are ends in themselves.
Is survival, or freedom, or novelty an end in itself?
If happiness is an end in itself, does it have more than 
one form? Do some forms matter (again, to YOU) more than others?
If you can't rank one form of happiness above the other, perhaps 
you should be indifferent when faced with a choice between one 
form and another form (knowing this could save you time one day,
since you'll know you don't need to spend time choosing). But 
what about a choice between having just one, and having both 
at once? If you prefer to have both forms of happiness at once,
does that mean that "having as many forms of happiness
simultaneously as possible" is a more important value for
you than either particular form? And so on. :)

I'm intrigued by Eric's idea that "the summum bonum is 
the generalizably extrinsic". I don't think it's any more 
defensible as a proposed Absolute Good than any other candidate, 
so I suppose I find it of interest as a psychological hypothesis 
("this is what we're really after") and as a hedonic heuristic 
("this is the thing to seek"). In fact, maybe so much emphasis
is placed on nano and AI in extropian/transhuman circles 
because they promise to make so much else possible, and are
therefore further examples of powerful extrinsic goods.

grow to market size....about 180 to 220lbs...from a one to two pound piglet
to a 200 lb market pig...in 6 months to a year...you could almost watch them

Why could that growth rate NOT be acheived under controlled conditions for

        I have yet to see proof that there is such thing as a "common good."
If there *is* such a thing, I seriously doubt that any sort of government
can represent a common good, regardless of whether the government in
question is democratic, socialist, facist or communist.  Whenever a
government claims that they are out to attain the "common good of the
people," the general outcome is one of a struggling economy and a
diminished quality of life; is that a common good?

        I partially agree with this on the account that many people form
opinions without considering alternatives.  Where I think you err is in
your presumption that all people who don't believe in government have
linear thought; on the contrary, history has shown that governments
fail...people who
insist that government will work are the ones who are not considering any
proposition otherwise.  An anarchist\libertarian system has not, to my
knowledge, been tried.  Is it not open-minded to want to try something new?
If an anarchist\libertarian system had already been tried a few times in
history, I think you might have a leg to stand on.  In effect, you have to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that such a system cannot work; this can't
accurately be done unless it is tried.

        I think the same could be asked of you: how are you going to
implement a government that can effectively produce the "common good" you
refer to?  It very well may be that the only accurate way this can be done
is to have a government of six billion people or none.

Thanks for diagnosing my thinking.  You're right, it probably is
more of a psychological hypothesis or hedonic heuristic or both
than a moral principle.  Your paraphrase identifying my clumsy
English phrase with the old Latin one makes me a little
uncomfortable, though I can see how I gave that impression, because
I tried to head off that impression by quacking about how I found
it quite likely that Aristotle's "summum bonum" is a meaningless
phrase.  They might be the same though... that would just mean
that my phrase is meaningless too.  ;)

The possibility of a summum bonum would to me imply the possibility
of a permanent end to all progress.  Whether my resisting this idea
is merely wishful thinking on my part I am not sure yet.

But you make an excellent diagnosis in pointing out the generalizable
extrinsicity of proposed projects in nano and AI, because thinking
about that is indeed one of things that prompted the development
of this idea for me.

First of all I would like to point out that I don't
think you should talk of brain transplants, you should talk of body
transplants. It's not because of any convention it's just because I
think that what is being transplanted is not you but to you and since
you are your brain, you can't transplant yourself, you can only make
transplants of organs to yourself. Size is not important here and your
brain can only receive transplants, in this case, body transplants.

About body transplants using cloning to create new bodies, it's not such
a futuristic
achievement. Did you know that there has already been body transplants
is monkeys and dogs? And that there are plans to try it on humans on a
near future? Besides, human cloning can be technically possible in a
very short time (some claim that it is already possible in the present).

Damien Broderick wrote:

I'm not sure about this (so don't jump on me if I'm wrong) but I think
that there is a relation between the time a mammal takes to reach sexual
maturity and the size of the brain. We are the mammal with longest
"childhood" and yet we are not the mammal with the more mass. If you
were to clone brainless humans (which is technically debatable) I would
say it would take much less than 19 years for you to get a fully grown
human.

The big problem is that it's not that linear that you are going to earn
much more life years
with this kind of procedure. Your neurons might die because of the death
of the cells that support them (the glial cells) and since you won't
transplant these cells, you would still die. Besides, the inherited risk
to this kind of procedure is (and will be for quite some time) very high
so it might not be worth it (I won't even mention the financial
resources for such operation). On the other hand, it might allow for
your
body to better remove the dangerous toxins that accumulate in the brain
(called age pigments) and therefore gain you years of life (since the
immune system and the whole body will be new, it will work better). I
wrote
about body transplants in my site, in my life extension section and I'm
currently developing that area.
Personally I think that avoiding aging for us (already developed adults)
is an interesting problem itself. Even that we do find a way to correct
all the errors in the genome that cause aging, it will be very difficult
to save us (I'm writing an article about that, BTW). There are a few
theories but none is currently technically possible, which means that if
we did find the genetic causes for aging (by far our best hope to
control aging) we would still age and die. What do you think about it?

Two more things of different subjects; Prof. Jose Gomes Filho, eu nunca
respondi 'a tua mensagem porque siceramente nao tinha nada
para dizer e nao por falta de educacao ou esquecimento.

Anders Sandberg, I heard you were a neurologist or something like that.
If that is true I would like to ask you a few questions: Can human
neurons divide in adulthood? What about songbirds neurons (I read they
could)? If you answer yes, can you tell how that happens or where can I
find more information about it.

See ya,

Here is how I look at this problem:

Facts are not interesting in themselves. They are interesting *for* 
somebody in a certain situation. There is a considerable correlation, 
within some groups of humans,  between what sets of facts each finds 
interesting -- that's part of the reason why peer reviewed journals 
work: what the referees find interesting is more likely to interest 
the readership than what the referees don't find interesting. I also 
think that John is right about intelligent people tending to be 
interested in more things than stupid people. This, however, I take 
to be a fact about human psychology, not a neccessary truth about the 
essense of what intelligence is; as demonstrated by the existence of 
highly intelligent people who don't find anything interesting, for 
example because they are depressed.

My guess is that what produces the feeling of intrigue and interest 
is activity in some fairly localised center of the brain, perhaps 
somewhere in the limbic system. It is known that electrical 
stimulation of these areas can produce intense sensations of hunger, 
thirst, irreality, remoteness, smallness (everything appears small), 
and it doeasn't seem implausible that intellectual interest might 
also originate here. What typically triggers this feeling can of 
course be some very high-level neocortical processing -- say, a 
physicist being excited by a formula because he understands its 
significance. But the same feeling could, in principle at least, also 
be triggered by means of appropriate electrical stimulation of the 
brain or by manipulating the emotive circuitry of the simulated 
intellect. In fact, the only reason that certain things naturally 
trigger our interest is that evolution has found the link conducive 
to fitness on the African savanna.

I therefore see no reason why the present discrimination function by 
which humans discriminate between interesting ideas or 
facts and uninteresting ones could not be replaced by any other 
criterion one might come up with, including the one that *every* idea 
is highly interesting.

Nor do I see any grounds for supposing that the present 
discrimination function is optimal for life in the modern world, less 
for the sort of life a superintelligence would live. "Optimal" should 
here be understood in the relative sense, as being conducive to 
achieving whatever other goals might be held by the individual. 
Instead I would expect that beings in the future, if they have the 
technology to do so, will adjust their curiosity to whatever level 
made them most efficient in achieving their other goals. If pleasure 
is one of these goals, then rather than making themselves inefficient 
by being too curios, they could leave their curiosity at the optimal 
level and turn on the pleasure directly, without going through the 
trouble of first encephalising it and associate it with a thought or 
an idea.

These considerations suggest to me that while more intellectual 
curiosity, and its objective correlates (such as diversity, 
information, novelty etc.) might be very excellent things for people 
like us in a world like the one we are living in today, it might 
nevertheless  be overly anthropocentric to assume that these things 
will also play a central role for a superintelligence or a society of 
uploaded humans.

Does angular velocity produce relativistic time dilation effects?  Would it be
possible to get your head and/or body to spin/orbit fast enough to time warp
into the future without the centrifugal force turning it to pulp?

Would continually supplanting a brain with, say fetus neurons, permit some sort
of biological uploading/augmentation, where the fresh neurons make up for/mimic
the ones that are dying off in the adult brain?  The brain does appear to have
a fair bit of redundancy worked into its structure, so given some time to
integrate themselves with the old neurons, the new ones may be enough for a
transparent transition from one generation of neurons to the next.

Assuming we can engineer designer restriction enzymes/ligases with the ability
to cut and paste DNA segments with high specificity, and that a
distribution/communication system can be set up to apply these operations to
all of the cells in a body, implementing the newly found bug-fix/patch to some
disease should be straightforward.  Eventually, this should lead to an
optimized and perhaps minimal genome which will allow standarized (platform
independent?) disease patches and/or body subsystem upgrades.  This technology
should arrive much before nanotech, as much of the enzyme machinery is already
in place.  Designing the genetic patches and predicting their side effects is,
of course, the hard part, but nanotech faces the same hurdle.  Are
object-oriented protein languages & compilers far off?

I appologize if my thoughts seem contradictory. Sometimes, I can confuse
even myself. (-;
Perhaps what I was trying to say is that there very well may be a way to
have much shorter development cycles than one may expect. Anyone care to
guess?  My guess would be if we could increase the growth rate, we'd
probably have to slow it down as well.

Speaking of cold fusion fairies, does anyone here know about free energy,
over-unity field theory or any other progressive engery theories? I heard
Bryan O'Leary speaking about this subject on the radio and his impression
seemed to be that there were already working models of these systems in
India and Japan.

What say you? It seems that the best ideas i've heard about transportation
involve some thoughtful combination of a free-energy system and
anti-gravity. Could a vehicle which repels mass to stay afloat ever get
into a head-on collision with another similar vehicle?

THe thing is, that, despite people's concepts of the "Singularity" being
a place or goal set and fixed, to anyone familiar with the concept, they
know that a singularity is always unreachable. When you think you got
there, it went and moved on you. It's the penultimate end of the
rainbow. The more capable, the more transhuman you becom, your own
conception of what the "Singularity" will be like moves that much
farther ahead. Of course, there will tend to be a contraction over time
as to the foreseeable event horizion, but nobody will ever reach their
own "singularity", except for death. Death is the end of the line, so
once you die, then you are there. Possibly with the exception of those
whose sigularity is the now, that they can imagine nothing beyond what
they are now. Those people are already walking dead... SO, if your
phrase is meaninless, then its the right one for the job.

Danny is apparently referring to a tetrahedron, not a triangle or a
pyramid. Using a rough Earth radius of just under 4000 mi. (3957 mi. on
average, as the radius at the equator is slightly greater than at the
poles due to centrifugal stresses), and a rough moon radius of 1080
miles, a tetrahedron made to fit exactly inside the earth (within a
couple dozen miles or so), would need a moon with a radius equal to
1333.333.... mi., so our moon is a couple hundred miles too small. If
anyone can call me on the numbers please do.

If these numbers are right, this is a good example, Danny, of how
"sacred geometry" is bogus because they use bogus math, the don't do
their homework. I suggest that you do yours so you don't get hoodwinked
by this sort of stuff.

I would suggest that it is possible that either a) Netscape didn't have
its anti-aliasing sh** together when Microsoft needed it to be to make
it into this version, or b) bratty little Andreeson won't play at all.
Considering that Word x.x can't import concurrent WordPerfect files, and
vice versa, only older verions files, this shouldn't be too much of a
surprise that the current browser releases aren't totally transferable.
Considering how whiney Andreeson has been in using the Justice
Retardment to enforce his mercantilist leanings in the face of a lack of
competetiveness technologically, I would give equal weight to
possibility B.

Many people who are or are related to refugees or immigrants from
socialist states tend to feel this way because nobody ever told them
that this was the first step they allowed to happen that culminated in
the economic debacles that were the governments in those states.

Most people would like to be permanently retired as well, but we all saw
how that sort of system worked for those living in the "socialist
workers paradise". Most people who think that they want "gun control"
actually want guns to be kept away from "the other guy". They think that
they are perfectly capable of responsibly handling, and have a right to
firearms.

As a freind of mine who is an intelligence consultant to one of these
formerly authoritarian states told me, a bureaucrat he knew said,"We
have a right to bear arms, but you must apply for a permit to buy a gun
first, and there is no limit on how long before we have to issue the
permit. We found that once we took away people's guns, taking their
money was real easy."

It is no accident that most of the gun control laws in european
countries were passed in the early 1930's. They were passed by
legislatures dominated by local nazi parties and their allies (a dirty
little secret in europe: most european countries had very active nazi
parties in the 30's, which simply changed their names to Socialist Party
or Democratic Socialist Party, etc after the war). It is also no
accident that a)the US has the most liberal gun control laws and b) over
the past 50 years the US has been the only country without serious
communist political or military insurgencies. Most everybody else has
been under a state of martial law of one kind or another at one time or
another, or given in completely to authoritarian controls.

> Just for the record, there are over 20,000 gun laws in the U.S.

Yes, and most of the early ones are almost word for word translations of
gun control laws passed by Nazi Germany in the 30's.

Its funny how the biggest proponents of gun control (Gun Control, Inc.,
Sarah Brady's little gestapo) commissioned a couple of U of Chicago
profs to do a study of FBI crime stats from between 1979 to 1992 to
examine the effect of "right to carry" concealed weapons liberalization
laws in a number of states in the early 90's. The profs found that
states with such laws saw an average 8% drop in violent crime rates
after such laws were passed, while states with no such laws had little
or no change. Needless to say GCI canned the profs and hired other
people to cherry pick the data in ways that would support their
previously determined conclusions.

The American psych (head shrinkers) association (whatever it is called)
also has found that the irrational fear of guns is a recognized mental
disorder. Well, at least we know that these sick people have no need of
help from the Americans with Disabilities Act, they already are in
charge.

Some of it brilliantly (by Michael Kandel), some of it woefully.  Alas, to
the best of my knowledge, the SUMMA *hasn't* been Englished, which is a
terrible shame.  Neither has the full text of his study of sf, although
fragments have appeared (it would now be very dated, of course, and was
based on a tremendously biased and random selection of material available
to Lem in Poland thirty-odd years ago).

There is yet another lesson in all these numbers: if you are willing to
specify a very small variance, say one percent, then you can generally
find an "amazing" geometric or numerical relationship between any two
numbers. You just keep trying "amazing" relatonships until one of them
fits. After you find one, you then announce that it's incredibly
unlikely
that your "amazing" relationship is due to chance, without mentioning
that
your "amazing" relationship is one of billions of possible "amazing"
relationships.

This is not to say that all such relationships are bogus. I have a gut
feeling that Bode's law may have an underlying cause based on the
mechanics of the original solar accretion disk.

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

>From a former AOL employee:

I'll try and cut through the crap, and try to get to the point of this 
letter.  I used to work for America Online, and would like to remain 
anonymous for that reason.  I was laid off in early September, but I 
know exactly why I was laid off, which I will now explain:

Since last December, I had been one of the many people assigned to 
design AOL 4.0 for Windows  (AOL 4.0 beta, codenamed Casablanca).  In 
the beginning, I was very proud of this task, until I found out the true 
cost of it.  Things were going fine until about mid-February, when me 
and 2 of my colleagues started to suspect a problem, an unexplainable 
'Privacy Invasion', with the new version.  One of them, who is a master 
programmer, copied the finished portion of the new version (Then 'Build 
52'), and took it home, and we spent nearly 2 weeks of sleepless nights 
examining and debugging the program, flipping it inside-out, and here is 
what we found.

Unlike all previous versions of America Online, version 4.0 puts 
something in your hard drive called a 'cookie'.  (AOL members click <A 
HREF="aol://4344:1047.g334.8411481.532897009">here</A> for a
definition).  However, the cookie we found on Version 4.0 was far more 
treacherous than the simple internet cookie.  How would you like 
somebody looking at your entire hard drive, snooping through any (yes, 
any) piece of information on your hard drive.  It could also read your 
password and log in information and store it deep in the program code. 
Well, all previous versions, whether you like it or not, have done this 
to a certain extent, but only with files you downloaded.  As me and my 
colleagues discovered, with the new version, anytime you are signed on 
to AOL, any top aol executive, any aol worker, who has been sworn to 
secrecy regarding this feature, can go into your hard drive and retrieve 
any piece of information that they so desire.  Billing, download 
records, e-mail, directories, personal documents, programs, financial 
information, scanned images, etc ... Better start keeping all those 
pictures on a floppy disk!

This is a totally disgusting violation of our rights, and your right to 
know as well.  Since this is undoubtably 'Top Secret' information that I 
am revealing, my life at AOL is pretty much over.  After discovering 
this information, we started to inform a few other workers at America 
Online, so that we could get a large enough crew to stop this from 
happening to the millions of unfortunate and unsuspecting America Online 
members.  This was in early August.  One month later, all three of us 
were unemployed.  We got together, and figured there was something we 
had to do to let the public know.

Unemployed, with one of us going through a divorce (me) and another who 
is about to undergo treatment for Cancer, our combined financial 
situation is not currently enough to release any sort or article.  We 
attempted to create a web page on three different servers containing 
in-depth information on AOL 4.0, but all three were taken down within 2 
days.  We were running very low on time (4.0 is released early this 
winter), so we figured our last hope to reveal this madness before it 
effects the people was starting something similar to a chain letter, 
this letter you are reading.  Please do the following, to help us expose 
AOL for who they really are, and to help us and yourself recieve 
personal gratification for taking a stand for our freedom:

1.          Forward this letter to as many people as you can (not just friends 
        and family, as many as you can!)

2.          Tell people who aren't on America Online in person, especially 
        important people (Private Investigators, Government workers, City 
        Council)

3.        If the information about the new version isn't exposed by the time 
        aol is released early this winter, for your own protection, DON'T 
        DOWNLOAD AOL 4.0 UNDER ANY CONDITION !!!

Thank you for reading and examining this information.  Me and my 
colleagues hope that you will help us do the right thing in this 
situation.  Enjoy America Online (just kidding!).

Regards,
A former AOL employee

Wow -- I agree with danny?  Good thing this is going into an archive or
it would be lost to history :-) ...

Seriously, <whoever "you" is> (danny, could you maybe forward your
messages rather than replying them, so the rest of us know who you're
responding to?), _Nanosystems_ is a *hard* book to read, and mortals
like myself don't take it in on a slow Sunday afternoon.  I can barely get
my email read in any given day/week, much less tomes of that depth and
magnitude.

Since I don't know anything else about the discussion, I'll leave my
comments at that.

Chill, folks -- we're on the same side!

These stocks are both listed on the NASDAQ (and therefore subject to the
disagreeably high commissions associated with that exchange).

>ps.  What is your recommendation for a mutual fund(s)?

I am probably not the best person to ask about specific mutual funds right
now.  However, I would recommend a "good" balance of Emerging Growth funds,
Global funds, and Tech funds if you want strong growth.  I would recommend
avoiding Blue Chip funds and most large Growth funds (both types have been
severely overfunded).  Index funds will provide a decent return over the
long-term but may be lackluster in the short-term.

This has all the usual markings of a fraud, so I see little reason
to take it seriously.  But to be honest, there's no reason that AOL
couldn't design their software to do anything they wanted--after all,
the user downloads a native-code browser, so there's no way he can
limit what it does.  The use of the term "cookies" here is an
obvious attempt to sound technical and play on paranoia about that
harmless feature of standard browsers.  Nothing in the rest of this
message bears any relation to them; what they are describing is called
a "back door", and while they certainly could do it, getting caught
at it would probably ruin a multi-billion dollar company, and even
Steve Case isn't that stupid.

Call it a hoax until they show some proof, like a code offset. Until
then, I assume someone just wants to piss off AOL by starting a rumor.

Since the Earth is/has been expnding, that would mean that perhaps in the
past the relationship was accurate (given that the moon has been the same
size since then, seeing how its solid cold, it appears that way), I wonder
when the date of that was.

No, sacred geometry uses correct numbers, true sacred geometry.  Why would
they use wrong numbers/equations?  I was referring to a picture at a web
site, thats all, they obviously just did it to look cool, i wanted to know if
it was a correct relationship.

Do you mean the disk that formed the planets?  What is Bode's law?  I feel
the same way,  I also believe there's a lot going on in saturn's rings, given
the braided rings, and god knows what else.  Oh, there's also high voltage
bursts emanating from saturn that is synchronistic with a specific place on
the ring.

Small nitpick:_ the glial cells are mixed up with the neurons of the
brain, if you transplant it, you will get the glial cells too.

I have already answered this in a private mail, but I just realized
yet another way to get around the fact that neurons doesn't divide
well; I have a paper called "Neuronal progenitors as tools for cell
replacement in the nervous system", which explains how progenitor
cells, genetically modified fibroblasts and transplants can be used to
replenish the brain. Quite interesting stuff, but still in its
infancy.

My guess is no, to get relativistic effects you would need huge
accelerations. I'm not 100% sure about the time dilation effects of
rotation, but they would also be inhomogenous.

Of course, using relativity to move into the future faster isn't life
extension, since you don't get more life and experiences, just spread
them out across a longer span of time as seen by an external observer.

The only thing an end in itself, is *life*. The problem
with choosing a value set becomes measuring *life*.
Now, you could say this is intrinsic, as *life* is uniquely
determined by *life form*. Here the term *life form*
includes both biological body, neurological circuit,
and memetic content like life style and culture.

So: Choosing your life form is a matter of *taste*,
the morality will follow.

Well, the limbic STRUCTURE may be localized, but the

Even limiting ourselves to genetic evolution, you

please explain how white skin was "conducive to

some things, evolutionary psychology is
straight-forward, while on others the explanations

< I therefore see no reason why the present
discrimination function by which humans discriminate
between interesting ideas or facts and uninteresting

I am trying to suggest that the reason this may not
be so easy is that there is overlap between
structural components and functional components. 
Creatures at our level of complexity (at least so
long as their expressed features have been developed
through mutual coupling with the environment, as
opposed to some hard-coded, externally-imposed design
- and even there, most of us know the hazards of
changing one part of a program without considering
its impact on other parts), can not have easily
cut-and-pasted components, certainly not without some
ripple effects.

Not to say that hedonistic engineering should be
taboo, only that it cant assume that all, or even
most, mental components can be replaced in a
plug-and-play approach.

< Nor do I see any grounds for supposing that the
present discrimination function is optimal for life
in the modern world, less for the sort of life a
superintelligence would live. "Optimal" should here
be understood in the relative sense, as being
conducive to achieving whatever other goals might be
held by the individual. Instead I would expect that
beings in the future, if they have the technology to
do so, will adjust their curiosity to whatever level
made them most efficient in achieving their other
goals. If pleasure is one of these goals, then rather
than making themselves inefficient by being too
curios, they could leave their curiosity at the
optimal level and turn on the pleasure directly,
without going through the trouble of first
encephalising it and associate it with a thought or
an idea. >

But, how can curiosity (or pleasure) be some
knowable-in-advance optimum that can be tuned without
feedback from current goals or tasks. How can it be
divorced from priority interrupts. (Im curious, and
enjoying this analysis, but my curiosity is keeping
me from other tasks, which could have unpleasant
consequences ;-)

Taken to a perceived optimal extreme, this approach
would suggest that there are no tradeoffs between
various goals, that every function is isolatable. 
But, removing other sources and simply tuning in a
pleasure channel, keeping the volume low while
multiplexing other tasks, seems to imply that
pleasure, or its opposite, can, in this designed
post-human creature I presume you're talking about,
be disassociated from the performance of these other
tasks.

< These considerations suggest to me that while more
intellectual curiosity, and its objective correlates
(such as diversity, information, novelty etc.) might
be very excellent things for people like us in a
world like the one we are living in today, it might
nevertheless  be overly anthropocentric to assume
that these things will also play a central role for a
superintelligence or a society of uploaded humans. >

Unless youre implying unlimited resources, the
ability to clone oneself to endless tasks (AND
somehow maintain a thread of cohesive experience), OR
a society of predominantly mono-functional agents,
why would the economics of incentives would be
radically different?

Yes, the disk that formed the Sun and its planetary system. Bode's "law"
is
simply an observation of a relationship between the ratios of sizes of
the
orbits of the six classical planets and a certain nesting of platonic
solids. This observed nesting "predicts" an orbit for a planet between
Mars and Jupiter. Bode's law predates the telescope. The asteroids were
discovered after Bode's law, and the Bode's law orbit is consistent with
the mean orbit of the asteroids. Please note: This can very well all
still
be coincidence. However, There may be a physical explanation. Since
planetary orbits affect each other the phenomenon of orbital resonance
may have caused clumping of planetisimals as the solar accretion disk
coalesced.  This clumping would not be random, but would likely cause
earlier-coalescing outer planets to pre-determine the orbits of
later-coalescing inner planets in a progression from outer to inner.
This would determine both the orbits and the sizes. I thought this up
all by my big self, but I suspect that professional astronomers have
independently dreamed this up many times in the past. We now have some
new mathematical tools to use on the problem. I have neither the time
nor
the skill to pursue this, but it's fun to speculate. Please note: this
depends only on the known laws of physics, no devine intervention is
needed.

It has been tried to insert fetus neurons in the spinal cord to cure
handicaped persons. Also, it has been tried to insert fetus neurons into
the brain to slow down aging, I believe Switzerland is the place to look
for this. As far as I know the results have been negative, it doesn't
work, at least for now.

I think we had a small communication problem here. When I mean
transplant, I mean body transplant since - like I wrote in my last post
- we can't transplant the brain. So when I say that we can't transplant
the glial cells, I mean that the glial cells will be kept with the
neurons. I think you misundertood me, we both mean the same thing. It
was just a problem with language.

The idea would be to wonder in space (not very far since we wouldn't
have much time) until the scientists on earth could figure out a way to
stop aging. We would spend, for example, 20 years in space while on
earth 500 years would have passed. We wouldn't die of aging and when we
would return we would certainly have aging cured.

BTW, thank you for your reply on the questions I sent you.

I agree this sounds wonderful but I am quite skeptic if this
technologies will arrive in time to save us. In my opinion, the biggest
problem is the application of any technique to all cells. Today we can
build virus to transfer genes to the cells but only a tiny percentage of
a culture of cells can be modified. And we can't just correct a few of
the cells, we have to correct most - not all but most - of them. And
that is a major problem

The topic of attempting to grow body transplant items by using a scaffold
to guide growth was raised by "den Otter" <otter@globalxs.nl>.  I had read
about experimental work in this area but could not remember an exact
reference. To find a reference (newspaper quality) I used an interesting
web site that allows you to search a large multi-newspaper archive (100 US
newspapers):

http://www.newsworks.com/

In this archive I found a relevant Detroit News article

Scientists rebuilding the body 
June 23, 1997 
http://detnews.com/1997/discover/9706/23/06230023.htm

begin excerpt
 
   In its infancy 20 years ago, tissue engineering was limited to growing
flat sheets of cells. But, except for skin, tissues in the body aren't
organized that way. The breakthrough that is driving the research now is
the ability to grow living cells on a synthetic "scaffolding" that will
dissolve away once the cells are firmly established.  Using this
technique, Boston-area researchers have grown pretty good looking ears and
heart valves. They can also custom tailor replacement cartilage for
functional spinal discs or joint pads. Key to most of the strategies is
the "matrix," a synthetic mini-scaffold on which the cells attach
themselves and grow. Mooney and many others are using scaffolding
materials based on dissolvable surgical sutures. They're man-made, but
they degrade into natural materials found in the body and are easily
carried away by the blood stream. By altering the mix of suture materials
used in the scaffolding, they can control the rate of its break down "from
weeks to years," Mooney said. 

end excerpt

Other techniques are discussed, e.g., methods for arteries.  Consider this
excerpt regarding cells in the pancreas. 

Begin excerpt

Scientists treating diabetes have made tiny porous beads of degradable
material that contain replacement "islets," the cells of the pancreas that
secrete insulin. The holes in the beads are small enough for nutrients and
oxygen to flow into the islet cells and for the insulin and waste products
from the cells to flow out. But the holes are too small for immune system
components like antibodies or white blood cells to get at the foreign
islets and kill them.

The islet cells, which come from pigs or cows, eventually die on their
own, and the capsules dissolve, so a re-injection is needed a couple of
times a year, but the system delivers insulin only as needed, the way the
body's own system would.

End excerpt

Here it seems possible that using tissue obtained by cloning would be
desirable because the threat of rejection by the immune system is
nullified and the cells may last much longer.

A natural idea I think is the following:

Initiate a clone and then by a process of selecting subsets of cells and
placing the cells in appropriate chemical micro-environments (i.e., with
the proper chemical concentration gradients)  cause the cells to
differentiate into needed cells. 

Islets cells would be a good example of needed cells for diabetics. 
Another example of needed cells would be spinal column nerves which are
still somewhat immature and capable of growth. Some individuals who are
paralyzed because of spinal column injuries have a gap between nerve
endings of bundles in the spinal column.  Imagine placing these cells in
the gap and setting up a chemical gradient so that the cells grow across
the gap and reconnect the spinal nerves.  Proper physical rehabilitation
may allow these individuals to use their full body again.

Frank Tipler's claims, which rely on the universe being destined for
colllapse, are coming closer to being testable...

HIGH-PRECISION COSMOLOGY will be possible in the next few
years through new measurements of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB)---with NASA's MAP satellite and the
European's Planck satellites---and expanded catalogs of galaxy
locations with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (a million redshifts to
be recorded in 5 years).  Several years ago the COBE satellite took
the temperature of the universe; the new CMB and galaxy studies
should go far to "weigh" the universe and determine whether it will
expand forever or collapse. Actually, the universe's vitae are
expressed more scientifically in terms of  parameters such as omega
(energy density), lambda (cosmological constant), and H (Hubble
constant).  Max Tegmark of the Institute for Advanced Study
(max@ias.edu) has estimated the effect of the new data on each of
these parameters.  For example, big blobs in the CMB map imply
a large value for omega, which in turn suggests the universe will
collapse. Small blobs imply a smaller omega and an expanding
universe.  Higher resolution samplings of tiny portions of the CMB,
such as that made with the Saskatoon detector in northern Canada,
observe blobs at a size that stands midway between that
corresponding to an open and shut universe. The new data should
settle the matter. (Tegmark,in Physical Review Letters, tent. 3

Bode's law had nothing to do with platonic solids it was a series that seemed 
to fit the spacing of the planets. The idea was to give each planet a number 
and then add 4 to it, Mercury got a 0, Venus a 3, Earth a 6, Mars a 12 and so 
on. Calling the asteroid Ceres a planet was stretching it, but other than 
that the fit wasn't too bad and even when Uranus was discovered it was close 
to where the law said. Everything was going so well, and then Neptune and 
Pluto were found and the "Law" failed badly.

The nesting platonic solids idea for the orbits of the planets was due to the 
early work of the great mathematician and astronomer Johann Kepler. 
He proposed his idea in 1596 and the agreement with observation was not great 
but it wasn't terrible either and Kepler knew that Tycho Brahe had much 
better observational data, the best ever made before the telescope. When he 
finely got to see Tycho's data he was horrified to discover it did not fit 
his theory, the disagreement was not large but it was too large for Kepler 
because he knew what a careful observer Tycho was. I think this is where 
Kepler proved he was a great scientist, even though he loved his theory and
had spent years of his life on it, when he found it didn't agree with 
observation, however slightly, he immediately abandoned it and went on to 
other things. The story has a happy ending because the "other things" were 
his discovery that planets moved in ellipses and his 3 laws of planetary 
motion, and that lead the way for Newton. If he'd screamed that the data must 
be wrong, as most would have even today, Kepler would be only a footnote in 
the history of science instead of one of the giants.

Incidentally, Kepler was also an astrologer, he had to be, that's how 
astronomers made their living back then. I think astrology is pure bull shit 
but that's because I'm a Leo and they're notoriously skeptical about that 
sort of thing.

Indeed. I feel it's worth doing it. So maybe I will try and
translate a couple of chapters and put them on the web, if
it is of interest to others in this list (unfortunately
my ability to write good English is rather limited, and 
SUMMA is not one of the easiest texts to read, understand ...
and translate). 
For a start, you can find the table of contents on

  http://itp1.physik.tu-berlin.de/~prengel/Lem/summa.html

If I get positive feedback, I may give it a try (unless 
someone else feels more competent to do it).

      Worse:  Microsoft Corporation's Windows95 _already has these 
      routines coded into it_, with rather weak encrypted lockouts.  These 
      lockouts can be (and are being) broken by any competent Signals 
      Intelligent outfit, and by _anyone else_ who can afford a trip to 
      Russia to buy the services of a retired Russian cryptanalyst trying 
      to feed his family on cardboard and water...   That means that every

(Just try a string search-and-replace of 'AOL' with 'Microsoft Corporation')

<quote>

> From a former AOL employee:

I'll try and cut through the crap, and try to get to the point of this 
letter.  I used to work for America Online, and would like to remain 
anonymous for that reason.  I was laid off in early September, but I 
know exactly why I was laid off, which I will now explain:

Since last December, I had been one of the many people assigned to 
design AOL 4.0 for Windows  (AOL 4.0 beta, codenamed Casablanca).  In 
the beginning, I was very proud of this task, until I found out the true 
cost of it.  Things were going fine until about mid-February, when me 
and 2 of my colleagues started to suspect a problem, an unexplainable 
'Privacy Invasion', with the new version.  One of them, who is a master 
programmer, copied the finished portion of the new version (Then 'Build 
52'), and took it home, and we spent nearly 2 weeks of sleepless nights 
examining and debugging the program, flipping it inside-out, and here is 
what we found.

Unlike all previous versions of America Online, version 4.0 puts 
something in your hard drive called a 'cookie'.  (AOL members click <A 
HREF="aol://4344:1047.g334.8411481.532897009">here</A> for a
definition).  However, the cookie we found on Version 4.0 was far more 
treacherous than the simple internet cookie.  How would you like 
somebody looking at your entire hard drive, snooping through any (yes, 
any) piece of information on your hard drive.  It could also read your 
password and log in information and store it deep in the program code. 
Well, all previous versions, whether you like it or not, have done this 
to a certain extent, but only with files you downloaded.  As me and my 
colleagues discovered, with the new version, anytime you are signed on 
to AOL, any top aol executive, any aol worker, who has been sworn to 
secrecy regarding this feature, can go into your hard drive and retrieve 
any piece of information that they so desire.  Billing, download 
records, e-mail, directories, personal documents, programs, financial 
information, scanned images, etc ... Better start keeping all those 
pictures on a floppy disk!

This is a totally disgusting violation of our rights, and your right to 
know as well.  Since this is undoubtably 'Top Secret' information that I 
am revealing, my life at AOL is pretty much over.  After discovering 
this information, we started to inform a few other workers at America 
Online, so that we could get a large enough crew to stop this from 
happening to the millions of unfortunate and unsuspecting America Online 
members.  This was in early August.  One month later, all three of us 
were unemployed.  We got together, and figured there was something we 
had to do to let the public know.

Unemployed, with one of us going through a divorce (me) and another who 
is about to undergo treatment for Cancer, our combined financial 
situation is not currently enough to release any sort or article.  We 
attempted to create a web page on three different servers containing 
in-depth information on AOL 4.0, but all three were taken down within 2 
days.  We were running very low on time (4.0 is released early this 
winter), so we figured our last hope to reveal this madness before it 
effects the people was starting something similar to a chain letter, 
this letter you are reading.  Please do the following, to help us expose 
AOL for who they really are, and to help us and yourself recieve 
personal gratification for taking a stand for our freedom:

1.          Forward this letter to as many people as you can (not just friends 
        and family, as many as you can!)

2.          Tell people who aren't on America Online in person, especially 
        important people (Private Investigators, Government workers, City 
        Council)

3.        If the information about the new version isn't exposed by the time 
        aol is released early this winter, for your own protection, DON'T 
        DOWNLOAD AOL 4.0 UNDER ANY CONDITION !!!

Thank you for reading and examining this information.  Me and my 
colleagues hope that you will help us do the right thing in this 
situation.  Enjoy America Online (just kidding!).

Regards,
A former AOL employee

They won't try too hard, but you may start finding it hard to
get jobs, as they rely more and more on computer information about
you ("Why haven't you been employed for the past 5 years?"  "Why
is the Social Security number you gave not registered?").  And
the heavens help you if you try to buy a house ("We see no credit
history registered under this information.".

Onward.

I beg to differ -- your thesis is anything but "clear".  When I say it, I mean
that the person I'm saying it to has lost sight of the importance of balance
in life.  Introspection alone cannot reveal reality -- you have to go look at
it.  And while reading and writing are valuable, people wrote the books and
people read them, and words on paper cannot convey the richness of human
experience and interaction.

Also, by "getting out" I may mean just to go take a walk on the beach; breathe
some fresh air; get some exercise; look at some flowers or rainbows or art or
architecture; or (gasp) touch somebody -- you're still a human, as much as
you may dislike that, and touch is good for humans.

Lee, do you think I write this stuff so you'll approve?  You need to get
out more.

;-)

Hello all,

I also receive a lot of phone calls regarding polls, credit cards company's
keep track of my spending, All the info regarding tax is kept in a
computer,
etc...................

Could a solution be, to start spreading Wrong information about,
yourself. I mean to mess up the database files of all these guys.
I work a lot with client-data to sell more and I think a lot about;
if it would be wise to start adjusting information about me. 
Like buying at several stores (rich/poor), in polls say sometimes,
I like left and sometimes right, etc........

Anyone an opinion, does it make sense to do this ?
or will "they" even try harder to find out more about me.

Greetings,

Berrie

Is this a general problem? My guess would be that most educated 
people don't even know what transpersonal psychology is.

The term "transhumanism" is surely not ideal -- it smacks too much of 
classical humanism, transsexualism, transvestitism, religious trance 
experiences etc., and has too little of hard-core science and 
high-tech flavour to it. But I think it is too late to do anything 
about it now --and it's not so bad, really. I think we are already in 
the process of impressing the cool connotations on the term that 
characterize our outlook.

I certainly think there is interest, but copyright rules and
fair usage may hold you back (I should know, Mitch and me got
into a brief bit of trouble for Golem XIV a few years back).

Actually, I think the connection to classical humanism is important
for transhumanism. Science and technology just provide the best tools
to achieve our core values, they are in themselves not important (even
if many of us appreciate them anyway and want to link them to our
transhuman lifestyles).

I did not insult you in any way, or make any personal comment, but I
will make one now: if you continue to assume that others are attacking
/you/ when they merely respond to your /ideas/ (as you have often
assumed of me, because our ideas often conflict), you will discourage
further exploration of those ideas.

Perhaps that's what /you/ meant--I can even believe you meant that
because I know you--but I still think that most uses of "you need to get
out more" are precisely as pegged: the mating call of the braindead,
used by people to mean "I have no idea what you're talking about or
why it's important; why aren't you talking about getting laid?"  If I
wanted to tell someone that his amount of introspection as opposed to
direct experience of life is too much, I'd use a different phrase (though
I've never actually had occasion to do so, because most people I know
are not introspective enough).

Interestingly enough we have another case of "Government Run Amok"...underway

alive...she fired a shotgun at the JackBootted thugs...and they are too

        WASHINGTON, DC -- The Illinois state police should quit trying
to "help" Shirley Allen -- before they kill her, the Libertarian Party
says.

        Allen is a 51-year-old widow in Roby, Illinois, who has held
authorities at bay for an entire month in what has become the longest
police standoff in state history. Police have surrounded her house and
demanded that Allen -- who they say is "strange" -- submit at gunpoint
to a psychiatric evaluation.

1. IRISH ACTIVIST GROUP SABOTAGES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROP
In Ireland, an environmental activist group called the Gaelic
Earth Liberation Front has destroyed a one-acre research crop of
genetically engineered sugar beet. Under the auspices of the
Irish Government, the crop was grown by the US chemical company
Monsanto to develop a sugar beet variety resistant to a widely
used herbicide. The Gaelic Earth Liberation Front said in a
statement: "This was Ireland's first genetically engineered crop
and we hope it will be the last." But of course it will not be
the last, and one wonders if this is activism for the sake of
activism by people who known little about the environment and
even less about biology. Patricia McKenna, a politician who
represents Dublin in the European Parliament, praised the
destruction of the sugar beet crop, accusing Monsanto and the
Irish government of "playing games with the Irish environment".
And that underscores the non-triviality of these events. The neo-
Luddite rumblings that are becoming common these days are useful
to some people with political power, which means both the source
of the rumblings and the politicians who use the rumblings need
to be confronted by the scientific community. Ultimately it is
the larger community which must be persuaded one way or the
other; it is the attitude of the larger community that will
determine the fate of the neo-Luddite groups and the politicians
who use them. Concerning the science involved, what is obvious to
the scientific community is not always obvious to the community
at large, and one can only hope the scientific community will see
its responsibility to make its case to the larger community by
forceful and articulate dissemination of information. There is no
other apparent reasonable road. (Nature 9 Oct 1997)

 I wrote:

IAN: Like a broken record, I find myself spouting 
libertarian doctrine even as I've seen the flaw in 
the common application of libertarian moral theory: 

If a landlord uses force to evict me, or even if 
the contract says if I break his rules I go to a 
cell in the basement, libertarian doctrine does 
not see this as coercion, so long as I'm free 
to leave his property. 

The federal government is the landlord of the 
property known as the United States. The rules
of the landlord  must be followed or penalty
is effected.  It is not coercion so long as 
you are free to leave the U.S. property if 
you have a problem with the contract.

As we can see, the U.S. property arrangement
is not different than the "private property,"
for we are free to leave the U.S., therefore 
the application of U.S. law is not coercion.

You do not have to sign the contact to be
compelled to abide by it. When I walk into 
a store, I still have to abide by their rules
even if I did not sign a contact. Entry =>
agreement with the terms of the property.
Thus to enter a preexisting claim is to 
agree to the rules therein, or not, in
which case the landlord can use force
according to libertarian moral theory.

Also, if a child is born in an apartment 
and its parents die sometime thereafter,
the landlord, in accord with libertarian
theory, has the right to evict the child, 
to use force against the child, even as 
the child did not sign any contract.

Libertarians seem to think that they have 
an inherent right to property upon which a
preexisting claim has been placed: the U.S.

The only difference between the smalltime 
landlord and Uncle Sam is that U.S. is big.
Yet there is no libertarian rule that places 
a limit on the size of an area claimed. Yes,
force was used to wrongfully remove preexist-
ing claims of Native Americans, but none of 
the guilty are alive today. If we say that 
therefore the U.S. property is forfeit, so 
too all land claims, for your dwelling pro-
bably stands on once Indian territory.


I think the importance of libertarianism
lies in the utility of private property,
such that people are more prosperous when
individuals are allowed maximum control of
areas that they purchase in exchange with 
others. In short, if a landlord (Uncle Sam)
that owns a vast area wants his tenants to
prosper, he will allow them a very high 
degree of liberty. He will allow them to 
control parcels of land and trade them.

What makes the market work is the ease with
which customers can exit a given establishment. 
What makes government not work is the difficulty
with which customers can exist the country. This
difficulty makes it a "landlords market," putting
the customers, or citizens, largely at the mercy
of those who are the de facto landlord. So it all
comes down to size. This places emphasis on the
need to expand beyond the Earth, beyond this
fixed and limited parcel of territory.

Yes I agree....this is exactly why I think I shouldn't do it.

This means then that you shouldn't really care if or what
they know of you. At the other hand, if you commit a crime,
or you run for office, your a sitting duck :-)

I also already consider my computer, public domain.
If I don't want it on the net, I should use one that isn't
linked to it. I think this is the only way to be and stay
(privatly) free.

Not only is the gaping flaw in this argument obvious
to anyone with two brain cells, it is clear that
you are intentionally straining to avoid the only
issue, because you, too, know what it is: If my
landlord wants to enforce my rental agreement, he
can go to the offices of Golden West property
management and retrieve a large document with my
live signature on the bottom to show that I consented
to his terms /before/ I moved in.

Since you clearly know that this is the issue, and
have gone to great lengths to evade and equivocate,
I can gather from your complete lack of intellectual
integrity in this argument that it is pointless to
attempt honest dialog with you on this issue.

If there's anyone else who doesn't get out enough,
wasn't at Extro3, or didn't read the Sep 97 Wired
(like me ;-)  I would definitely recommend Kevin
Kelly's article "New Rules for the New Economy:
Twelve dependable principles for thriving in a
turbulent world" at
http://wwww.wired.com/wired/5.09/newrules.html

Add this one to the Extropians reading list for sure.

This is an interesting argument.  I haven't heard it before.

Libertarianism is usually expressed as an absolutist position,
and I've yet to encounter an absolutist philosophy for which
caveats cannot be found by extrapolation to a sufficient
extreme.

Actually, I read an article by some anthropoligist
a year or so ago which suggested that Native Americans
came across the "land bridge" which now forms the tip
of Alaska quite a while back, migrated Southward and
not only displaced but completely wiped out a race
of PREVIOUS Native Americans.

I wish I'd kept the article, or at least took notes!
Does anyone have more info on this?  It certainly puts
a new spin on the "America belongs to the Native Americans,
we stole it, let's give it back" argument.

There seems to be a similar situation in Hawaii, where
the current Hawaiians are campaigning for cessetion from
the mainland US, for a return to indiginous power, etc.
Apparently the current Hawaiian population are descended
from Polyneasians who completely wiped out the previous
Hawaiians, the Mahunuae (spelling?).  The Mahanuae live on
only in legend, as semi-mythical "little people", like elves or dwarfs.

History suggests that government's ability to legislate ownership
of an area expands ALMOST as quickly as settler's ability to
find new places to settle.

Does anyone have a good argument that suggests this won't continue
to be the case as we expand into space/cyberspace/wherever?

Well, if you look at that aging disease that a few rare kids have, if
that sort of disorder can be turned on and off in anyone, then you could
do some sort of rapid development, but I would think that the product of
such things would tend to be on the short side.

There have been several, supported by some large corps over in Japan.
The most convincing evidence that fusion is involved was an experiment
involving heavy water and dissolved potassium salts. Apparently, the
test module produced excess calcium that could only be explained by
fusion of the deuterium with potassium (with an accompanying consistent
level of heat produced). There is also an outfit in Dallas claiming to
be producing hot water heaters using the same catalytic method as Pons &
Fleischman, but they can't claim that it's cold fusion because the
patent office has banned the use of the phrase (nice to see in our
office of innovation, eh?). Their drawings include a reactor about the
size of a shotgun shell, filled with pellets of the electrode materials,
produced by a proprietary method.

Whether it works or not I don't know. I'm also interested in hearing
whats up in this field.

The most recent non resident whipping boy, Arthur C. Clarke, was a big
proponent of air cushion vehicles, forecasting their replacement of
automobiles within 50 years (date of original projection: sometime in
the 50's). Of course this never happened, partly because they are: a) so
noisy b)so energy hungry and c) being frictionless meant that poor
maneuveribility in the event of uneven terrain or wind made them
unusable as a major transport form. Me thinks that for all purpose daily
transportation, anti gravity will not become feasible, except possibly
for mass transportation. Traffic is bad enough, imagine millions of cars
careening about like discs on an air hockey board. 

Any feasible anti gravity technology would be most useful in aircraft
and spacecraft. Now, replacing cars with personal antigravity propelled
aircraft is somehting else entirely. With smart navigation technologies,
using all of that volume in the air is a much smarter way to go about
it. Of course, if there is an accident, expect to die, unless airbag
technology is heavily used, in a manner like the Mars Pathfinder landing
method. Bounce, bounce, bounce...

Well, if we were to erroneously assume that the moon is the same size it
always was, and that the earth has expanded due to accumulated
meteoroidal material, then we would need to have accumulated material to
be 750 miles deep over the entire surface. This comes out to an
accumulation rate on average of one tenth of an ince every decade. Since
total new soil generation on earth averages  one inch per 30,000 years,
coming from all sources, including erosion of existing rock, I find this
figure highly specious.

Since we know that the moon has accumulated material at a far faster
rate than the earth, due to its higher angular velocity allowing it to
sweep through more space than the earth while taking advantage of the
earth's greater gravity well as an attractor of material, we can
conclude that the only time in earth's history that the moon may fit
into a tetrahedron large enough to fit inside the earth, is sometime far
into the future, so long as the sun doesn't go nova first.

I missed all of the links you provided. COuld you repost them so that I

Its entirely probable that given a star of a certain size with a given
amount of disc material of a given size posessing a given amount of
angular momentum that the approximate positions and sizes of planetary
bodies that form can be accurately predicted. Unfortunately, until we
get a chance to visit other star systems, any such theories at present
are merely theories without sufficient supporting evidence.

However, the property claims/grants that predate the formation of the US
Government are not subject to US government law as a matter of the
landlord principle. Of the 13 original states, the only property which
could possibly be construed as belonging to the Federal government is
the District of Columbia (and a fine example of landlord stewardship
they have made of that, eh?). There are also property grants to
individuals that predate US claims in the Lousiana Purchase, Sewards
Folly(Alaska), and the original Northwest Territory (the area  north of
and between the Missisipi and Ohio rivers up to the Canadian border).

In any event, for the origianl 13 states, since their state governments
predate the US government, they hold original claim on property in their
jurisdiction, except for that property granted to individuals directly
by the King of England. For the present owners of these properties, they
have inherited or bought the free association rights to maintain or
secede the relationship of their property with the state and federal
governments.

As for states relationships to the federal gov't, New Hampshire, for
example, has a Constitution that predates the US Constitution, and
recognises the right of the state and local governments to secede from
the union.

Ininformed consent is not recognized. Unless the conditions of entrance
are posted at the entrance, and the property owner will not allow
entrance until conditions have been read and agreed to, there is no
informed consent.

SO you are saying that since the parents died in the apartment, in
effect abandoning the child, then under the lease, the landlord can
claim the child?

Libertarians, as citizens, have the ultimate right, since the US is
nothing but responsible to and exists with the consent of the citizens.

Since the sovreign power of the US gov't is delegated by the people as
individuals, if the people decide to abolish it, break it up in an
anti-trust action, or make its role entirely voluntary for each and
every individual, allowing people to "go armadillo" in Vinge's terms,
then its legal. Since this voluntary principle already exists in the tax
code and in the Social Security Act, its not unprecendented.

I believe US Court precident is that if party A has

enjoyed the benefits of a contract for several years

without contesting it, then party B may hold them to

the contract's constraints, even if they haven't signed it.


I'm not sure how I feel about this, but couldn't the US

make the case that American Libertarians have used government-built

highways, and enjoyed the protection of fire dept., police, etc.,

even if they haven't taken advantage of them?



>Since you clearly know that this is the issue, and

I'm a bit new to the classic arguments pro/con Libertarianism.

Could you point out where you see equivocations in the previous

argument?

The feral government might like to convey the impression that it is the
landlord of the united States, but it assuredly is not! The whole idea that
a group of elite politicians is free to make whatever rules it chooses and
offer the choice of obidience or expatriation is equally absurd.

What customers?  In what sense are free people living in one of the united

Whether it continues depends on the choice each individual makes.  The
government is not my landlord.

Not recognized by who?  As far as the US government is concerned,
every single driver in this country is liable for the "Implied Consent
Law," without having signed anything.  Even ignorance of
the law will not stand up in court.

This brings up my major question about Libertarianism:

I generally agree with Libertarianism in theory.  But as far as I can
tell, for it to globally replace other systems of interaction, one
of two things would need to happen:

1. Everyone would need to voluntarily adhere to it.  But as long as there's a
profit to be made by coercion, I believe that some people
will always attempt to do so.

2. Some group would need to impose Libertarianism on the world.  Of course,
this imposition would go against Libertarian values.

This catch-22 makes me draw a parallel between communism and libertarianism:
sounds great, if everyone adheres.  But usually the only way to get everyone
to adhere is with guns, which means fascism.

Can anyone talk me out of this?

Although America is theoretically a democracy, in fact we have
a very complicated series of mechanisms of political control ultimately
enforced by violence or threat of violence.  "The people" may not
circumvent those mechanisms and remain within the existing laws.

"When does theft become property?"  Is a touchy issue.

If the Federal government doesn't "really" own something because they

stole it decades ago, what's to stop a member of a racial minority from

claiming that I don't "really" own my car, because it was bought with

money from my job, which I obtained partially thanks to my education, which

I obtained partially due to my priviledged upbringing and parent's income,

which priviledge was partially due to race, because white people have

several economic and social advantages over other races in this country,

because our ancestors committed theft, forced slavery, and several other

crimes?


While ingenuity, hard work, etc., contribute to ownership, isn't there

always also a correlation with one-time theft, albeit sometimes abstracted by

quite a few layers?

In an earlier post in response to the "Landlord" analogy, I
accused Ian Goddard of willful evasion and intellectual dishonesty.
After seeing some of the follow-ups, I now realize now that I had
somehow failed to read all of the post, and perhaps misinterpreted
some of what I did read.  I apologize for my hasty accusation, and
if it has caused anyone to doubt Mr. Goddard's honesty, I urge
them to disregard my comments on the matter.  If it has caused
some to question mine, I don't blame you, and I offer no excuse
for my unwarranted judgment.

I have been, and hope I will continue to be, quick, vocal, and
without restraint in my opinions.  I also hope that those
listening understand that it is because I firmly believe that
the most effective means of human communication is to encourage
unfettered--even brutal--speech.  Though I do not believe that
speakers have any obligation of tolerance, I do think they are
obliged to be honest and to check their facts, which I failed
to do in this case.

I apologize to Mr. Goddard and to the rest of the readers of 
this list for my failure.

My land is on an Indian reservation,

This appears to be the case, both on linguistic grounds and DNA 
studies. At least *four* such waves of immigration took place before 
the European invasion. Each one displaced the previous, causing it to 
move southward. The remains of the oldest wave are in South America, 
the newest in Alaska and northern Canada.

Indeed. BTW, I don't use the term "Native American", in part for the 
reasons above. I call them Indians, as do all my Indian friends and 
aquaintances.

Hmmm. I don't think Earth governments will be physically able to 
enforce space resourse claims.

Yes, that's their claim, by breathing the air on any land mass on the Earth's 
surface you have in effect signed away your rights and  "voluntarily" given 
some government the power of life and death over you. It matters not at all 
if you or I think this reasoning makes the slightest sense or not because
they have the power to enforce it regardless.

Why? Nobody on this list is foolish enough to be talking about a world where  
everybody can do anything they want to, if you want to bash in my head with a 
baseball bat and I'd rather you didn't then we can't both have our way. 
What many of us are talking about is a world without government and the 
reasons this would encourage libertarianism. All police would be private 
police who work for various private protection agencies, and people don't
like to PAY to restrain the private behavior of others in most areas, child 
abuse and perhaps a few others excepted. If you try to enforce your private 
law that most people hate and find intrusive then it's going to be very 
expensive for you, however if everybody except me thinks it's important to 
ware a funny hat every Tuesday and are willing to pay big bucks to enforce it 
then I'm just going to have to ware a funny hat on Tuesday. Everybody  can't 
have total control over what laws they want to live by, but we can have a lot 
more control than we have now.

This is how I think government will die, unless the singularity happens first 
and changes the world so radically that it renders these matters moot. 
Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide 
communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will 
make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes. My confidence comes from the 
power of exponential growth. In general, if I increase the complexity of my 
encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice  as long to encrypt it, I have 
made it not twice, but billions of times more difficult for an attacker to 
break it. The government has access to more  powerful computers than I do,
but not that much more powerful. There is just  no getting around it, recent 
developments in mathematics and communication have tipped the balance away 
from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  For the first time in 
human history 2 people on opposite sides of the world will soon be able to 
make enforceable contracts without anybody else knowing about it, and even 
they might not know or need to know the physical location of the other.

Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves 
in this brave new world, but making rules is easy,  enforcing them is not. 
Short of dismantling the internet and confiscating all home computers it's 
impossible to dictate what form of  encryption or digital cash you must use 
in your home. When people are given a choice between one form of cash that 
government likes and you pay tax on and another that you don't it won't take 
them long to make a decision.

Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't find the 
money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would not work as 
people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of course) that 
suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be extracted, like
property taxes and building permits, would have to be increased to astronomic 
levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a tax revolt would follow. 
Without money government will grind to a halt.

I don't think that works. Progeria makes aging faster, not development
(otherwise the victims would grow up into adults instead of becoming
"ancient dwarves"). While development can likely be speeded somewhat,
it is probably hard to do with the entire body since many of the
processes have to occur together but have very different timescales;
think of lengthening of muscles and lengthening of bones. But speeding
up individual tissues is probably quite easy.

Sounds like a fraud, since even if cold fusion does work it requires
deuterium or tritium to work, and the amounts in ordinary tap water
are likely far too small (~0.015%) to produce any noticeable heating.

Actually, you can tell these luddites are scum even without knowing
too much about their background and general history, methinks.
The genlabs simply need better protection, like guards that hit first
and ask questions later, or some vicious dogs. An automated perimeter
defense with squirtguns that fire a disgustingly smelling green goo that
will stick to the skin for weeks would be nice too. Poetic justice:
luddites
defeated by advanced technology. Of course abortion clinics could use
some kind of advanced defenses too, so that gun-wielding religious fanatics
can be dealt with swiftly and severely. It would be a worthy 
extropian goal to help develop better (automated) defensive systems/
strategies for such vital institutions. Beats reading books IMO :)

That position is dangerous, and doesn't solve anything. It would
likely just mean a more polarized situation, more violent luddites and
even less public support for genetic engineering - if something is
surrounded by barbed wire and dangerous guards, it cannot be good,
right?

Most of the truly dangerous luddites are not the activists; the
activitsts could just as well be attacking meat trucks, abortion
clinics or racist organisations, their luddism is mostly just a
convenient reason to be an activist. The real danger comes from the
"normal people", who can be much more dangerous for research and
development by the power of public opinion, voting and spending money,
and the people who can convince them that genetic engineering is
unnatural, evil and dangerous. No amount of guards, barbed wire and
dogs can protect againste Jeremy Rifkin and the other
biofundamentalists.

To quote somebody who was interviewed on Swedish television
(unfortunately without the regional dialect which really made it
funny): "There should be an end to progress so people can keep their
jobs!". That view is dangerously common, and people in general fear
change despite the fact that it helps them in the long run. It is very
easy to use this fear to strike against proponents or technologies of
change such as genetic engineering, the Internet och
transhumanists. Think about it.

The U.S. is not a person, and thus has no rights.

Consent is the highest form of acceptance. Think of acceptance as a scale,
with gun-to-the-head *submission* on one end, and yes-that's-what-I-want
*consent* on the other end. When viewed in this manner, it is clear that
obey-or-leave-the-country is closer, on the scale of acceptance, to
submission than it is to consent.

Agreed.

Libertarians unilaterally decide that aggression (initiation of force) is
immoral, while proportionate defense against aggression is moral. I call
this the Primethic Decision. This means that a libertarian will recognize
and respect everyone's right to consent (to that which would otherwise be
aggression), but will consider it moral to defend themselves wrt those who
do not make the Primethic Decision, i.e. non-libertarians.

The Primethic Decision (that aggression is immoral and defense is moral)
thus establishes the right to consent, which is the basis for all universal,
reciprocol rights. IOW, universal, reciprocol rights cannot exist without
first recognizing the right to consent, which can only come from the
Primethic Decision. All else is by consensual agreement.

It is not necessary that all adhere. Those who do not, should they aggress
against others, are simply, and morally, defended against.

>Can anyone talk me out of this?

Does this help?

Hello all,

I tried to find something like this on the Net, but since I 
could not find anything it's:

A: a stupid idea 
B: It's new
C: I should look better


As I tried to draw, could we make some "flexible" pipes,
that have attached  balls with a light gas. This way the
structure rises from earth to space. 
Note that I'm not familiar with all the different layers of "air"
between here and space, so I don't know if the gas trick
works. Maybe instead of balls filled with gas, you could use
rockets, that point to space, fed from the ground with fuel.
A pipe of 100 KM, isn't a problem to build, is it ?
Anyway, once the structure (one long pipe) is up, inside
there is a "screw-elevator" that can go up and down !

Could a structure like this work ? or are there some
laws of nature, that prevent this.

Greetings,

Berrie

Briefly, there are a number of problems.
1) Wind forces would rip it apart.
2) Balloons leak.
3) To float even, say, an empty two-liter bottle requires a 
balloon larger than the bottle.  A full one (imagining
something actually trying to climb the pipe) would take a
much larger one, even at ground level.
4) Since the atmosphere thins as you rise in altitude, 
balloons don't float as well higher up.
5) Since there's wind, even if it didn't get ripped
apart, it would probably end up at a 45-degree angle,
and subjected to enormous forces (imagine attaching one
end of a soda straw to the ground and the other to a balloon).
6) a 100-km long pipe with the relative dimensions and 
structural strength of a soda straw, or even ten end-to-end,
would be about 100 feet in diameter.

Incidentally, nanotechnology will solve many of these 
problems by:
1) making much stronger materials possible, getting rid of the
problems of wind shear and large diameter (which creates
wind resistance)
2) allowing us to make lots (billions) of tiny 
(buckyball-sized) balloons instead of clunky big ones --
and buckyballs don't leak
3) allowing the surfaces to react to the wind direction
using AI and tiny actuators

Sorry not to be more rigorous, but I'm packing for a trip
and it already doesn't look like I'm getting any sleep.

Fun idea, but likely not workable since the air thins out more and
more as height increases. This means that the buoyancy gets smaller
and smaller for each ball, until the weight of the cable and balls
would counteract the upward force. I think even diamond balls filled
with vacuum would be too heavy beyond a certain height. And since you
want to reach space rather than the high atmosphere, this is likely
not enough (still, there are many uses for this kind of ultra-high
altitude tower for (say) communications).

A 100 km pipe *upwards* would likely have a rather extreme pressure at
the bottom - you would have a 100km liquid column at the bottom, which
likely will overcome even nanodesigned materials.

A more reasonable approach would be the classic beanstalk hanging down
from an asteroid outside the synchrnonous orbit. That seems to be
possible using nanomaterials, and would reach into space quite a bit.

As Kennita and others have pointed out, it is hard to build such a
structure.  However, even if you could build it, it wouldn't be that useful
for getting to space.  It is a non-obvious fact that most of the difficulty
in getting from here to orbit is in acquiring speed, not altitude.
Attaining orbital velocity of 8 km/sec requires storing 16,000,000 joules
in every kilogram of payload.  On the other hand, reaching an altitude of
100 km requires only 1,000,000 joules per kilogram.  So climbing to the top
of a 100 km tower gets you only 6% of the way to orbit.

True, violence (even if it's rightfully defending one's property)
might trigger more violence and give you a bad image. Unfortunately the
*opposite* isn't true: if you put up no resistance whatsoever and leave
your facilities wide open the activists will attack them anyway. This most
recent incident only proves my point. Besides, most people already have
this image (guards, dogs, barbed wire etc.) of genlabs, so there isn't
really
much to spoil. Most industrial facilities, department stores, warehouses
etc. have high profile security anyway, and nobody really minds. So why not
research facilities? In fact, if your defenses aren't really dangerous
(ok, forget the guards and the dogs), and even have a funny note to them,
they might actually *help to boost your image*. The squirtguns with smelly
goo (that glows in the dark) could be both effective and good for P.R. Kick
ass gently,and with a smile...

I fully agree with you here, but it is no reason to leave the research
facilities/abortion clinics undefended. Barbed wire might not stop
technophobe ideology, but *words* don't stop shotguns, iron
bars and molotov cocktails. The battle against ignorance and malice 
must be fought with means appropriate for the specific occasion. Defending
yourself and/or your property isn't un-transhuman afaik.

I've thought about it a lot. I don't see anyone attacking the internet now
or in the (near) future, unless it attacks us first (which is at least
theoretically possible). Transhumanism might be attacked (regardless 
of what its proponents might say or do) when it gets "too big for comfort".
Right now transhumanists are usually seen as a bunch of computer 
nerds with silly SF fantasies, harmless Utopians. When there will be 
more the government and the press and (thus) the public _might_
"rediscover" them and some "incriminating evidence" will be fabricated to
justify persecution. Its been done time and again...

 I should observe that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian. 
 I've spent the last seven years promoting libertarianism, 
 whether with pamphlets at protests, county fairs and the 
 like or over the Internet. 

 But I always practice and encourage questioning your 
 memes, which is in fact how I became a libertarian.
 In many ways it's more important to make the case
 against what you believe/believed than for it.

 Now, in reply:

  IAN: So if my apartment is on land that was stolen
  from the Indians, I get to live rent free? If that
  pesky landlord comes around here again I'll just  
  get out the gun... "How dare you extract rent 
  from stolen land. Do you think theft is OK?" 

  I don't think theft is OK. My eighth great grand- 
  father Roger Williams vigorously opposed, as I do now,
  the theft of Indian lands (http://www.symmetry.net/roger).
  But even as the Indians did trade for land among 
  themselves (a very significant fact rejected by 
  socialists that Roger observed himself after living
  with Indians for several years), still much, most,
  or all Indian land was at sometime stolen from 
  another tribe. 

  In short, there's no way to establish the rightful
  owner. Clearly, even as Indian lands may have been 
  stolen,  it was the duty of European settlers to 
  respect what claims they came upon. Perhaps they
  could have said, "If it was stolen, the claim is 
  void, so we get it. Get those thiefs out of here."
  That would be analogous to someone saying, "Since
  the U.S. robbed Indian lands, I don't have to pay
  taxes." So the case that if the U.S. was stolen,
  it's void is a circular argument, since it also
  justifies the existence of the U.S. to the extent
  that Indian property was once stolen, which the
  evidence suggests most-to-all probably was
  at some point after a tribal war.

  So I don't see the case that the U.S. is void.
  In which case the preexisting established claims
  stand, with libertarian moral theory activated
  now, or at most to the point rightful owners
  can be established and proven.

The research material and equipment is expensive but insured; what I
am arguing is not that research facilities and similar places should
be left unguarded (there are enough problems with theft in normal
institutions), but that extreme security measures 1) focuses on the
wrong part of the problem, the symptom, and 2) is likely to create an
even more explosive situation.

If Frankenstein had had his lab in a small cottage inside the village
instead of a forbidding castle in the mountains, the villagers would
have been less inclined to storm him with torches and pitchforks.

What we really need is to make people understand the new technologies
with an open mind. Just educating them about how they work has the
surprising effect of just polarizing the opinion (the
pro-genengineering camp becomes more pro, the anti-camp more
anti). This is very hard, but we need to do it or else we are going to
need your defenses even in our homes ("A transhuman! Kill the ugly
mutant!!").

Take a look at the controversies about pornography on the internet,
the spread of illegal information and terrorism. I don't know about
dutch media, but here in sweden the coverage have tended towards the
very negative. Several politicians have proposed some rather draconian
measures to prevent the spread of this nastiness, but have failed
largely due to party politics. The first time internet was mentioned
seriously in a swedish movie it was of course a movie about
international child pornography. However, the negative opinion is
changing since at least 30% of all swedes now have access to the net,
and are discovering that it isn't a swamp of evil or the cybernetic
heaven, but a fairly boring/useful/useless place. But I guess that
when people start to move to untaxable digital money, the government
will see that as a direct attack.

Exactly. And frankly, it isn't that hard to find disturbing stuff in
transhumanism that could easily be used against it. That is why we
need to get our ideas into the mainstream as much as possible instead
of trying to work in splendid isolation - we are vulnerable as a
separate group.

They would have if they ever found out. In fact, I'm sure they would be
*very* displeased if they knew that someone was creating a monster made of
stolen bodyparts in the middle of their cosy little neighborhood.

The net doesn't really seem hyped around here, in one way or another.
Holland is almost pornography heaven. Hardcore is for sale at most
newsstands and bookstores, and there are plenty of specialized porn
stores in most larger cities. Besides kiddieporn (under 16 years) just
about anything goes. There are even some excellent sex with animals mags
from...Sweden!

To my knowledge most of the onholy attempts to fight porn on the net
have failed thus far, even in the puritan-infested good ol' USA. Even if
they
could pass some of those sanctimonious laws, they could never tame
the net. It would require co-operation of all (major) governments in the
world, and even then...it would backfire on them anyway. Hackers would
now have all the excuse in the world to attack government computers, and a
even a single individual can do a lot of damage. Besides, how could the
governments ever finance and police such all-out operation? The "war on
drugs" already takes up most of their resources, and there is even a limit
to taxation.

As far as I know the politicians in holland are trying to get as many
people *on* the net as possible (don't know exactly why, maybe just
to look modern or something). They might regret this one day...

I usually find swedish movies very depressing, so it doesn't really

Well, I'm working on a text for the local group for the proliferation of
transhumanistic ideas *right now* :-)

I'm not sure if the Libertarian advocacy is for (1) no government globally, 

(2) personal refusal to obey any outside government, or (3) something else.


What's the difference between the theoretical large-scale private police force

and the US government?  Just scale?  Or is it that the US Government doesn't ask

newborns to sign a contract?  If the latter, would requiring toddlers to either

sign a contract agreeing to pay lifelong taxes in return for citizenship, use

of roads, etc., or leave the country immediately satisfy the contraints of

Libertarianism?

Okay, this is starting to make sense to me.  Are you saying that:


1. Libertarianism disallows imposition of noncensensual government.

This can be brought about in one of two ways:


2. It can be ENFORCED by resisting privately (or in consensual groups)


3. Technology may offer an economic model that supercedes government's

ability to enforce noncensensual rule.


Yes?

<< Well, if we were to erroneously assume that the moon is the same size it
 always was, and that the earth has expanded due to accumulated
 meteoroidal material, then we would need to have accumulated material to
 be 750 miles deep over the entire surface. This comes out to an
 accumulation rate on average of one tenth of an ince every decade. Since
 total new soil generation on earth averages  one inch per 30,000 years,
 coming from all sources, including erosion of existing rock, I find this
 figure highly specious.
 
 Since we know that the moon has accumulated material at a far faster
 rate than the earth, due to its higher angular velocity allowing it to
 sweep through more space than the earth while taking advantage of the
 earth's greater gravity well as an attractor of material, we can
 conclude that the only time in earth's history that the moon may fit
 into a tetrahedron large enough to fit inside the earth, is sometime far
 into the future, so long as the sun doesn't go nova first.

No not at all, the earth has been expanding due to matter from the inner core
being moved into the mantle, (the inner core is 3 times as dense as the
mantle)...(well im not sure if its the inner or outer core, or a process of
both) which happens at a far faster rate than soil deposits on the earth or
moon.  Im referring to the study (sorry no references, Ill ask some people
and try and find out) that concludes that if you fit the continents back
together again into the original land mass, the only way they'll fit properly
is if the earth was 80% of the size that it is now.  And since the moon
doesnt have a hot mantle (well, im not sure if it did back then though, it
doesnt seem like it) it would have been approximately the same size (maybe a
mile smaller due to the meteoric impacts you were talking about).

Oooh!  Can I just point out that while I generally loved this movie,

ALL 5 PEOPLE i went to see it with, as well as all three critics

I've read review it, were happy to note that they felt the message

of the film was an affirmation of faith [without evidence]!


Aargh!  Sagan wrote an entire book (The Demon-Haunded World), and spent

much of his career warning of the dangers of this.  Skepticism and

reason, as well as a profound distrust of organized religion and similar

superstitions, formed such a large part of his body of work.


Although Sagan had a heavy hand in the film, around 80% was filmed while he

was on his deathbed, and another 10% was filmed AFTER he died.  It makes

me crazy to think the film people managed to make a film espousing the

REVERSE of Sagan's message, while still loudly proclaiming him imprimatur!


Argh!  Ooeerg!  [teeth gnashing]


The book was much more clearly pro-logic.  Joss was a much less loathable,

pretty-boy character.


And the book had one fascinating idea which was inexplicably (okay, the

film people correctly thought it was too complicated for mainstream audiences)

omitted from the film: PI contains a "secret message" from the (non-divine)

alien creators of the universe.

Yes!  Okay, this makes sense, thanks.


The big question for me now is "If you divided the world into those willing to fight

for the spoils of fascism, and those willing to fight for unconstrained personal freedom,

who would win?"


One of Gardner Dozois (sp?) peerless "best sci-fi of the year" collections once had a story

where Gandhi attempted to help India resist Nazi Germany.  The outcome seemed to suggest

that the author believed most people will knuckle under rather than going to the wall for

personal freedoms.  If this is true, one person (or a small group) would need to be

capable of either resisting the imposed rule of a large number of people, or the cost/benefit

ratio of controlling that person would need to be too poor for the majority to bother (and

I think people like Newt generally feel "I don't care what the cost/benefit ratio is for

dominating that PARTICULAR person, since the benefit of creating a precident is incalculable").


How do others feel?  Is this inherently untrue?  Is one person's ability to fight the

establishment (or become invisible to the establishment) changing due to technology sufficiently

to escape this formula?


best,

k.

 IAN: If you live on the same piece of land that 
 your x great grandparents lived on prior to the 
 formation of the U.S., I believe that you are not 
 subject to federal or state laws on your property.
 But arguably once you pass into U.S. territory you
 are subject to a tax that equals annual income tax.

 But, where then in the transfer of that property 
 to others was sovereignity ceded to the U.S.? Hmmm.
 Ergo, when did rightful ownership by the U.S. actually
 begin?  I can't say, except when the property owner
 accepted the validity of the Union, which I expect
 most did, sooner or later. I will also except the 
 demand of a robber for my wallet sooner or later. 

 The argument I've used against the U.S. is that 
 just because a group of guys got together and 
 yelled to others "We're your government, send 
 us money and stuff," does not justify their
 claim to such authority apart from the fact
 that they could round up more guns than me. 

 However, the fact is that I was born into a 
 world upon which preexisting claims were made.
 Those people whose claims were violated and who
 violated them are all dead now. I have to respect
 those claims that preceded me.  This is actually a
 very atomist angle for a holistic logic guy like me.


 There is no possibility of determining legitimate 
 owner of the U.S., therefore, by default, ownership
 goes to the longest standing claimant, the U.S. govt.

 One problem is that we expect the world to be perfect,
 and anything short of that must be abolished. But it's
 NEVER going to be like that. We're not going to live on
 a planet with a perfect chain of ownership all the way 
 back to "Adam and Eve" (so to say). Philosophy must 
 be principled AND practical. If our current state 
 of justice depends upon correcting all historic 
 wrongs, we're never going to get to a current 
 justice. We have to deal with what we have,
 and start with principled standards now.


>As for states relationships to the federal gov't, New Hampshire, for

 IAN: But until they officially secede, you would be 
 subject to U.S. law, i.e., terms of Union membership.

  IAN: Basically, we agree. The store owner 
  can also inform you by removing you for a 
  violation, such as not wearing shoes. The 
  idea that the owner must post all things 
  you cannot do in the store on the door 
  and all things not posted are legal is 
  excessive in the extreme, yet that's 
  a logical outcome of your argument:
  if x is not posted, x is legal. Better
  to have a region in which a set of laws
  apply universally, i.e., a country.

  The larger point is that all newborns,
  i.e., everybody, enters a world in a 
  state of de facto "uninformed consent,"
  but that does not absolve anybody from
  having to abide by preexisting claims.

  IAN: Not at all. I'm saying that the

  housing. It's not like if I don't have 
  to give you free housing I own you. ??

  IAN: It depends upon who owns the guns. If everyone
  owns the guns, literally, then everyone will be in-
  clinded to respect everybody else's rights. If all 
  guns are ceded to one central authority, the chances
  are maximized that you'll end up with fascism, even 
  if the pretext of such centralization is to protect
  everybody's liberty. I don't know if I can absolutely
  prove that, but I have faith that it will hold true
  and tends to be supported by the real-world evidence.
  For example, in areas where the right to carry is 
  legalized, as I understand, murder and rape drops.

  Did people in Hong Kong have the right own firearms?

As far as I could think, the better choice is letter B (and of course, C...)...:

A possible solution could be: Transmit *only* the data related to  the
structure of the body to be transmitted "to space" (or elsewhere...)
and not the whole matter of the body.... The present problem is to construct
a scanner precise enough for reading such structure...  ( a small detail: to
delete the old body when it has alredy been read...>>> another  problem to

Well, if we develop anti-gravity, why not develop some sort of anti-collision
field that would repel you from any object within a certain distance(with the
repelling energy being adjustable in terms of distance and strength), like
magnets, until you land or engage with some other object.  That would be
great and very fun for playing some kind of game in the air, with fast,
cushiony bounces off of the others.  Or maybe just close cruising with the
others, feeling the others' energy fields as you come close, playing, like
tag or love making(thats to say if we could combine our own sensory fields
with that technology, incorporating our nervous systems).

i think that any review of history of some depth will show that it is
certainly true that "most people will knuckle under rather than go to the
wall"

but this isn't neccasarily due to ignorance, or even fear... rather, it often
seems to be a case of the individual being to busy staying alive to notice or
care much what is happening 'round him/her until it's too late to do anything
about it...

we all know that freedom takes work to get and to keep... unfortunately it
seems most of us are kept so busy existing we don't have much time or energy
or money left to fight a decent fight...

any thoughts?..thanks for listening... Fireeye

Not necessarily. If they are not too depresed, they might continue to

By no means! These structures are very necessary today. What I was 
saying was that in the future we might want and be able to change the 
way these feelings are triggered, so that they would only be 
triggered by thinking that might be practically useful. To put it 
more provocatively: art tends to be useless, so it would seem like a 
good idea to rewire us so that we no longer find art interesting, and 
to use other methods to get the pleasure or emotional experiences 
that we would have obtained from wasting mental resources on art. 
Unless, of course, we think that art is valuable in itself. (And 
unless and until such rewiring becomes commonplace, art will also 
maintain an instrumental value.)

I certainly did not intend to imply that. I used the reference to the 
African savanna only in order to vivify my point that what we find 
intellectually interesting today is (at least partly) dependent on 
our evolutionary prehistory. Many people seem to regard "pure 
intellectual curiosity" almost as if it were a sacred and 
unimprovable gift from God. (I do think it is a extremely valuable 
trait of character in humans, though.) But what is interesting is 
not, so to speak, a metaphysical truth; it is a contingent fact about 
human (and animal) psychology that we tend to find such things as 
complexity, variety and self-organization interesting. There is no 
reason why we should not change what we find interesting, if that 
would make us more efficient.

You have a point, but let me clarify what I am arguing: Consider 
anger. It's an emotion that did more good than bad to the 
individual (or his genes) in our evolutionary past, but might 
nevertheless be maladaptive in today's world. Most agents nowadays, 
whether persons or countries, have enough intelligence and education 
that they would get better results if they control their anger and 
decide what to do by means of rational deliberation than if they let 
loose their wrath. Similarly, I suggest, with intellectual curiosity. 
That is another emotion. I thinkt that in the future we will have 
enough intelligence and knowledge that we will get better result if 
we decide what to devote our intellectual resources to by means of 
rational deliberation rather than following our instinct. As opposed 
to anger (which, it should be said, might still be useful on some 
rare occasions), intellectual curiosity has not yet become redundant 
as an instinctual guide to appropriate behavior, but as we learn more 
about the potential of different research fields, this will probably 
change.

  IAN: So, if I walk into someone's property 
  I get to stay rent free so long as I don't 
  sign any contract: "You can't throw me out,
  I never signed the contract." What a deal!

  The scenario you cite is not resolved by 
  every inch of land being "privately" owned 
  with every landlord having a set of rules,
  regulations, and rent. Hence, complaining
  about a fait where all land is claimed is 
  weighing in for or against libertarianism. 
 
  You suggest that governments have this unique
  attribute that if you stand on gov't property
  you are subject to gov't law,  but the same 
  holds for private property;  therefore the
  alleged unique attribute of gov't that is
  bemoaned does not actually exist as any-
  thing unique to this thing called "gov't."

  There are claims upon land and the claimants
  demand a rent/tax from other people who 
  inhabit the areas within the claims. When
  I got to the Earth, every inch was already 
  claimed, so I have to agree to pay the fees,
  try to evade payment, or overthrow the claim.

  Libertarians want to evade payment to large-
  scale land holders, while socialists want to

One rare syndrome that causes "clinical manifestations that resemble
premature aging in humans" is called Werner's syndrome (WS). 
Werner's syndrome and progeria are apparently distinct but both cause
premature aging. See:
http://medinfo.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/posts/archives/mar97/852909270.Me.r.html

Recently, excellent progress has been made in understanding Werner's
syndrome.  See: http://www.bioscience.org/news/scientis/aging1.htm

The Werner's syndrome gene (WRN) has been identified and it is similar
to DNA helicases.

begin excerpt

Helicases are involved in DNA replication, recombination, chromosome
segregation, DNA repair, transcription or any function that requires
unwinding of the DNA. In view of similarity to helicases, the WRN
protein may exert similar functions in cells. Yu et al suggest that
the consequence of the defect in WS patients may be the accumulation
of DNA mutations that ultimately lead to the age-related
manifestations of this disorder.  Somatic mutations of oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes may be the underlying basis for the increased
incidence of cancer seen in these patients. The DNA damage may also be
responsible for premature replicative senescence and consequent
pathologies. Whether the WRN gene is implicated in the normal aging
process remains to be seen, however, the new discovery undoubtedly
will shed light on the pathways that lead to the premature aging in
patients with WS.

end excerpt

Further evidence that the Werner's syndrome gene codes for a DNA
helicase appears in the August 1, 1997 edition of Nucleic Acids
Research Online.  Article title : "DNA helicase activity in Werner's
syndrome gene product synthesized in a baculovirus system" by Noriyuki
Suzuki, Akira Shimamoto, Osamu Imamura, Junro Kuromitsu, Saori Kitao,
Makoto Goto1 and Yasuhiro Furuichi

http://www.oup.co.uk/oup/smj/journals/ed/titles/nar/Volume_25/Issue_15/gka505_gml.abs.html

begin excerpt

The gene responsible for Werner's syndrome (WRN) contains a region
homologous to the Escherichia coli RecQ type DNA helicase and was
thought to code for a DNA helicase belonging to this helicase
family. However, no evidence has been shown before to substantiate
this prediction. Here, we show data that the product of the WRN gene
is indeed a DNA helicase.

end excerpt

Switching topics. The topic of telomeres comes up on this list
periodically.  Telomeres and telomerase are relevant to cancer
research, aging research, and cloning. Science News, October 11, 1997,
reports (based on an article in Cell) that telomerase-deficient mice
have been created and six generations have been bred.
The results are controversial. See:

Less important: Define fascism. Exactly what are we fighting against? I
would say aggression.

Important: Define freedom. Exactly what are we fighting for? I would say the
right to consent, or not consent, to that which would otherwise be
aggression, i.e. our individual right to freely choose the rules by which we
conduct our lives, so long as we are not aggressing against others.

More important: Define fight. By what means, and in what sense are we
fighting? Unless we have self-destructive tendencies, we fight in ways that
are relatively safe, having the potential of relatively high reward at low risk.

Most important: Define win. What, exactly, is the goal? I envision a society
wherein communities are philosophical rather than geographical, and each
individual is free to choose (and unchoose) between communities, or to
choose no community. The sole purpose of any overall government would be to
defend consensual rights.

IMHO, we can only get there by a process of evolution. Violent revolution
can only give us more of the same...or worse.

Ultimately, dedicated aggressors are few, but highly organized. Dedicated
defenders are even fewer, and highly disorganized. In between are those who
aggress because to not do so would be somehow detrimental to them, and those
who resist when it is relatively safe to do so.

Such dominance is unpersuasive, and therefore, tenuous. The real battle is

You've forgotten one thing.  The Washington regime did not get here
first.  It was created, by people and states with pre-existing land
claims, and exists by virtue of a contract -- which it has broken.
If the government doesn't like the contract which allows it to exist,
rather than amending it by unilateral fiat (i.e. appointing judges to
interpret that the contract couldn't possibly mean what it says), it
should leave our land.

A better analogy is between the government and a carpenter

Start with "guns ... means fascism."  I'll assume you don't literally
mean fascism as Mussolini meant it (state management of the economy
while retaining the form of private ownership) but rather dictatorship
in general, or perhaps even use of force in general.  If you shoot
someone who tries to rape your sister, are you a fascist?  I hope
you don't think that.

Weapons don't mean dictatorship.  *Concentration* of weapons in
the hands of an elite means dictatorship over the disarmed masses.
Where weapons are widespread, dictatorship becomes far more difficult.
(I hear that Albania is quieter now that most households have
machine-guns looted from the army!)

I have no desire to "impose libertarianism" on people who enjoy
paying taxes, or enjoy having their choices arbitrarily restricted.
If you want to go to jail for smoking a joint, okay, I won't stop you.
If you want to have your business seized for hiring an undocumented
immigrant, okay, different strokes.  If you want to pay higher prices
for goods and services provided by the state-certified cartel, fine,
go right ahead.

But I claim the right to defend myself against aggression, which
includes aggression by tax-collectors and narcs.  I reserve the
right to "impose libertarianism" on *them* only insofar as they
attempt to impose socialism or puritanism on me or my friends.

In my favorite scenario (not necessarily the most likely) for a
libertarian transition, there's no upheaval; people just stop
cooperating with Big Brother, until it collapses of its own weight.
There will be an uneasy period, as everybody waits for the
"inevitable" crime wave - but I bet it won't happen.  As the
drug trade comes from underground into daylight, violence should
decline; and as trades formerly made uneconomical by taxes or
regulations suddenly become profitable, many petty criminals
will find they've got better things to do.

Suppose an advanced civilization wants to capture and store as much of the
Sun's energy output as possible (as say antimatter), without disturbing
its stellar processes, how would they do it? Most likely by building a
sphere around the Sun and taking advantage of the temperature difference
between sunlight and its external radiators to operate a giant heat
engine. The efficiency of this heat engine determines the percentage of
the solar energy output that can be captured and the temperature of the
shell itself. I will assume that the heat engine is as efficient as
possible given only thermodynamic constraints.

Anders Sandberg gives a calculation of the thermodynamic efficiency of the
dyson shell in his (draft) Jupiter Brain paper, and concludes that a
smaller dyson shell is more efficient than a larger one. But I think his
reasoning is slightly flawed. I'll show that the reverse is true, and that
dyson shells may have a much lower temperature than previously thought
(see for example
http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dysonFAQ.html#LOOK) which may
explain why they have not yet been observed. Previous temperature
estimates assume that the energy captured by dyson shells is also used up
(dissippated) by them. However it seems more reasonable to assume that
dyson shells only serve as energy collectors, and that the energy stored
by them is eventually used elsewhere. For example really large computers
may be set in interstellar space for more efficient cooling, physical
security, and access to multiple energy sources.

A heat engine works between two heat reservoirs with a temperature
difference. A dyson shell works between the Sun which has a surface
temperature of 5800 K and the temperature of its external radiators which
is initially at 3 K, the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. 
However, even with a temperature difference as large as this it cannot be
100% efficient and therefore must radiate away waste heat. However its
ability to radiate waste heat is limited by its external surface area and
soon its radiators grow hotter as the waste heat builds up. This has two
effects. First it allows the radiators to eliminate heat more quickly, and
second it makes the dyson shell less efficient because the temperature
difference is smaller, thereby causing it to producing more waste heat. 
Fortunately the first effect dominates so the external temperature
eventually reaches an equilibrium. The temperature at this equilibrium can
be found by applying Carnot's Theorem and Stefan-Boltzmann's Law. 

Carnot's theorem says an ideal heat engine working between temperatures of
Th and Tl has an efficiency of (Th-Tl)/Th. Here Th is the temperature of
the Sun, and Tl is the temperature of the dyson sphere's external
radiators. It follows that the dyson sphere must radiate away Tl/Th of the
Sun's energy output (S) as waste heat. The amount of waste heat that can
be radiated away by a blackbody sphere of radius r and temperature Tl is
derived from Stefan-Boltzmann's Law as 4*pi*r^2*sigma*(Tl^4-Tb^4) where Tb
is cosmic background temperature and sigma is Stefan-Boltzman's constant.
So to find the equilibrium temperature we set that equal to S*Tl/Th and
solve for Tl.

Doing this in Mathematica produces a complex looking solution to the
quartic equation, which I will not bother to reproduce here. However it
turns out that the effect of the cosmic background radiation is not
noticeable until we get to a radius of about 100 AUs. Ignoring the cosmic
background radiation gives us Tl~=(S/(4*pi*r^2*sigma*Th))^(1/3). At 1 AU
this is 161 K with efficiency of 97%, and at 10 AUs this is 35 K with
efficiency of 99.4%. At 100 AUs, and taking into account cosmic background
radiation, Tl is 7.6 K with efficiency of 99.87%.

Do you know where they are coming on advanced/faster growth?  Like the rate
at which something grows?  I heard about them using headless human clones for
organs within the next 5 to 10 years, but there would be a problem with
growth, I mean by the time the patient's specialized organ would be ready it
would be way too late.  Sorry if this has already been discussed.  It looks
like im missing some posts, like the ones on headless frogs, could someone
send me them?

thanks

My (educated) guess is that a Dyson sphere would show up as a very strange
looking object in the sky surveys such as IRAS, COBE, DIRBE (Diffuse
Infrared Background Explorer) satellite datasets. It would be especially
strange signal in the infrared: if one knew the object's distance very 
well based on visual magnitude, but then found that its IR flux gave a 
whopping signal compared to what you would expect.

The new temperatures that you gave, based on thermodynamic efficiencies,
are actually terrestrial dust temperatures. Those are the sort of 
temperatures you would find for dust around infrared excess stars.
(I have a little bit of text about infrared excess stars at
http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html)

For example, the four brightest infrared excess stars are 
alpha Lyr, alpha PsA, beta Pic, and eps Eri. Those four have 
dust temperatures (micron-sized dust around the star) of 85K, 60K, 110K, and 
50K, respectively.

So I don't think that something like this would be invisible to
our current instrumentation.

However, I hope that someone is working with some of the better
datasets to look further for Dyson spheres. For example, the
Hipparcos data is publically available now, so one can use that
for finding positions of stars much more accurately than known before.
And the ISO, IRTS and other infrared observatories should give one better
infrared fluxes than the early-80s IRAS data.  People who are looking
for planets (there is a mission under study now called the "Terrestrial
Planet Finder"), are already considering many of these issues,
that is, how to detect signatures of cool dusty material and other unsual
things around a star.

Hi,

I missed some of these posts so im not sure if this has been posted, but...

How about a huge slingshot or spring?  Like dug way deep into the ground.
 Pretty simple and inexpensive, just sling/spring us into orbit! or maybe a

DNA helicases are a class of proteins which are involved in the unwinding
of DNA, I believe. A diagram depicting a helicase is found at: 
http://www.gene.com/AE/AB/GG/collaboration.html

In the previous post I should have strictly said: The Werner's syndrome
gene (WRN) has been identified and the protein it codes for is similar to
a DNA helicase. The previous post does state: Helicases are involved in
DNA replication, recombination, chromosome segregation, DNA repair,
transcription or any function that requires unwinding of the DNA.

Apparently. some people agree with you. In the past, I had read about
proponents of searching for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) using
the optical spectrum.  Looking through the SETI site:
http://www.seti.org/

one finds a page with links to other SETI pages including

The Columbus Optical SETI Observatory

This site has a page of links to Optical SETI information

Take a look at the work made with mass drivers, they are based on an
electromagnetic accelerator which accelerates the payload into
orbit. A mechanical slingshot would likely not work, since the
stresses would be too large.

As far as I know, there are no known diseases that make humans grow up
significantly faster than normally. Very early puberty is known, but
it seems to be a hormonal problem and has nothing to do with overall
development. Diseases that release large amounts of growth hormone of
course speed up growth a lot, but it tends to be rather crude and
leads to acromegalia.

I am inclined toward a more orderly transistion, hence my three part
transition plan:

1. Allow 50% to repeal any laws or portions thereof.

2. Automatically reduce the percentage required to repeal by 1% per year.

3. Allow the majority (50%+1) to raise or lower the percentage required to
repeal by up to, but no more than, 5% per year, and not to exceed 50%.

The idea is to eventually find the optimum percentage, and thus achieve near
unanimity.

Most of us tend to overlook the importance of repeal. As I like to put it:
No matter who makes the laws or how, if I had the exclusive power to repeal
them, we would all be living in GarysWorld. :-)

That subject heading is an ad hominem, an attempt

before I read Huben. As I recall, he does not address 
the moral theory,  but maybe the case is the same as 
his. If so, I should read up on it again and cite 
him when and where I propose this again.

Further, Anton knows that putting my name in the

before, leading to list fueding, but he does it again,
clearly a second initiation of ad hominem muck.

 IAN: OK, so if your going to go with the X people were
 here 100 years before Y people 200+ years ago, then you 
 should call for the transition of power from the federal 
 government to a council of Native Americans, since their 
 great great grandparents were here with preexisting claims 
 BEFORE those you cite were here before the government. 

 Or do property rights begin only with Europeans?

Secrecy breeds hostility. If you have something in the cellar and
people don't know what it is, it is much easier to regard it as evil
than if you do your work in public. Yes, there will be people who
disagree with you, but there wont be a similar risk of the whole
village showing up with torches. Openness is a good way of making
others accept you and to get interested in your work.

In a discussion on propaganda I participated in yesterday we decided
that it is easiest to label something as evil in the minds of people
if they know very little about it than if they know the thing
reasonably well (fairly obvious). If you keep your work hidden and
heavily defended, people will start to think you have a lot to hide
and it will be very simple for the real luddites to convince them that
you are doing disgusting things. On the other hand invite the
neighbors to visit, they will be much less inclined to listen to
propaganda. Exactly the same method works for fighting racism - it is
hard to be a racist if you know foreign people.

kindergarten to PhD level). Ideally these sites should be interactive
so that people could ask questions and get good answers back.

Another thing is to start discussing these technologies in public
*now*, not wait until they suddenly bursts onto the scene and
everybody gets moral panic. 

Do discuss transhuman technologies with friends, but do it in the
right way. Instead of starting with immortality, total transformation
of humanity and the wild effects of nanotechnology, which will only
convince people that you are a sf freak, introduce ideas about dynamic
optimism, cognitive tools to get smarter, how we can live longer using
the right diets and the joy of controlling one's life instead of being
controlled. These are ideas most people can readily accept, which
doesn't contradict anything they think they know, are directly useful
and also leads to more radical ideas in the long run. As a
transhumanist friend of mine uses to say: "The war about the future
will be settled in the coffee break discussions!".

It is probably a fairly different debate in different countries, and
Holland is as far as I understand it fairly liberal in this
respect. Not at al puritanical as Sweden! (Yes, the myth about the
free swedish sexuality is just a myth; I suppose said sex is just
exported :-)

They certainly will :-) Actually, it is a smart strategy to get people
onto the net, since that may give the nation an educational edge. But
here in Sweden the government was (and is) definitely trying to make
sure the net only contains wholesome stuff. Of course, that project
failed completely thanks to the fact that any proposal by the Moderate
Party is automaticly sabotaged by the Social Democrats, and vice
versa.

Things could get rather messy. It is all a question of how fast things
can chamge. If just a few people use the net for untaxable
transactions, then it is a great excuse for the governments to hunt
them down, scan the net and generally create a "war on tax fraud" -
likely with great public support if they can make the media say that
the only people using this are rich capitalists. On the other hand, if
there exists economical software that everybody can use and it becomes
widespread before the governments can stop it, then they will have a
hard time doing anything.

Transhumanism isn't really about how money should flow or not, but a
sizeable number of transhumanists are extropians and hence laud this
kind of development, and many of us really want to control our own
money in the ways we want. So there would be a link to the
transhumanist movement, that is sure.

Great! And I'm working on a tutorial for arguing for
transhumanism. Good luck!

I'd amend this to say *exclusive* concentration of weapons.  Otherwise,
you've just called Canada a dictatorship, since we (I'm Canadian) have
much more restrictive gun laws than the US.  It's legal to own a gun
in Canada, but there's plenty more red tape to get through to do it.

>Where weapons are widespread, dictatorship becomes far more difficult.

True, but the price is that petty crime has far more potential to
develop into violent crime, and gangland-style crime has the potential
to become more common.  For example, being mugged at gunpoint is
*completely* unheard of in Toronto, because the kind of people who'd
like to mug can't get their hands on a gun.  I'm under the impression
that "mugging at gunpoint" style robberies are more common in large US
cities than here.  That's what I mean by "petty crime developing into
violent crime".  As for gangland crime: it becomes easier for young
gangster-wanna-be's to fulfil their dreams of gangster-dom if guns are
easily had.  I know that in Toronto, a few schools are becoming more
violent these days than any schools were when I was young, but it's
mostly knife violence.  I shudder to think how bad it could be if the
kids could buy a gun at the local pawn shop.  Heck, it could become as
bad as some places in the US.

>(I hear that Albania is quieter now that most households have

Could you substantiate that?  Where did you "hear" this?  And can
you be sure that there's a cause-and-effect?  Maybe it's quieter
because, now that everybody has guns, all the violent people have
killed each other.  (Which is not necessarily, bad, I'll admit...)

>But I claim the right to defend myself against aggression, which
>includes aggression by tax-collectors and narcs.

If you actively "claim" this right, then you're saying that you
claim the right to ignore the laws of your land at your discretion.
I think that your ideals are noble, but your plan-of-action is less
than admirable, if you actually try to "claim" this right.  If you
don't like the law in a democracy, there are avenues to try to change
it.  If you can't change it, then there are only 3 choices left, as
I see it: (1) avoid the laws by hiding your actions that break them
(ie, tax evasion & smoking joints in secrecy, which is the current
method) (2) Try to change the laws in an unlawful way, ie, violently.
As Kristen points out, this should be self-contradictory to a
libertarian.  (3) Move to a place where the laws are more in line with
your views.  Are there any countries in the world that libertarians
could move to that would be more in line with their views?  I don't
know.

This just ain't gonna happen, at least in our lifetimes, because there
are far too few libertarians to stop co-operating.  You'll just have
Big Brother in your face, with his gun.

>There will be an uneasy period, as everybody waits for the

I agree that there will probably not be a crime wave, but I'd put even
money on there being more violence, probably gang-land related, as
power-hungry organized crime leaders fight it out.  Toronto is beginning
to see a bit of this, unfortunately.  There have been a few gangland
style shoot-outs in the past few years, which were unheard of until
recently.  And by-standers have been hit.  I'd prefer not to live in
a world where there was no deterrent to that kind of crime.

Again, could you justify this?  I can see that as a possibility, but
I can also see the possibility of turf wars being even more violent
than they are now.

Lack of government is the only option because if they're around you must obey  
them. They make you an offer you can't refuse.
             

        >What's the difference between the theoretical large-scale private         
        >police force and the US government? Just scale?  
                   

Scale is part of it but there's more, let's start by considering the question 
of corruption. The better job a private protection agency (PPA) does, the 
more it can charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay with PPA #1 
rather than switch to PPA #2 then I will stay with #1 ONLY if they charge 10$ 
less. Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to a dollar stolen directly 
from the PPA. For this reason it is in the financial interest of the heads of 
the PPA to keep bribery of employees as low as possible. Contrast that to the 
situation today, it doesn't cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is 
stolen from me, and they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving 
payoff money from the thief. 
  
Now let's talk about how well privately produced law would do in providing 
justice. In a government dictatorship one man's whim can lead to hell on  
earth, but I don't see how 40  million Germans could have murdered 6 million 
Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic  world. Things aren't much better in a 
democracy or republic,  51% can  decide to kill the other 49% , nothing even 
close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically.
 
Consider what would happen in Germany a few years ago if law and law  
enforcement were driven by market forces. In general, the desire not to be  
killed is much stronger than the desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish 
stranger. Jews would be willing to  pay as much as necessary, up to and 
including their entire net worth not to  be killed. I doubt if even the most 
rabid anti Semite would go much beyond  2%. As a result the PPA protecting
Jews would be  much stronger than the one that wants to kill them. In Anarchy, 
for things  that are REALLY important to you (like not getting killed) you 
have much  more influence than just one man one vote.
   
What about reducing the level of violence in the world? Everybody would have 
a reason to avoid violence if possible because the disputing parties would 
not want to turn their front yard into a war zone and violence is expensive, 
it plays hell with the bottom line. The successful protection agencies would
be more interested in making money than glory or even saving face. Most of 
the time this would work so I expect the total level of violence to be less 
than what we have now, but I'm not such a utopian as to suggest it will drop 
to zero and just like now even when force  is not used the implicit threat is 
always there. 
          
What about tyranny, could a PPA become psychotic and take over everything?  
It could happen, but it's much less likely than the US Army doing it and they 
certainly have the power to do so if they wanted. At the first signs of 
totalitarian behavior in a PPA, people could simply stop doing business with 
it and switch to a competitor, this would cut off its  lifeblood, money.
Remember, doing business with a PPA is voluntary and that gives enormous 
power to people, a power that citizens forced to finance the  army and police 
regardless of their opinion of it, do not have. Also, just  like now, PPA's 
in a world of anarchy would attract people who enjoy exercising control over 
other people, but unlike the police and army of today, it would also attract 
people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer to have in 
positions of power.

Yes, although "noncensensual government" is a redundant phrase.
                   

        >Technology may offer an economic model that supercedes government's

With government there is no place else I can go if I don't like it, but I can

nothing stopping me from becoming a landlord myself.

By the way, I think Ian is doing us a favor in asking us to examine our core

I will admit that when you're talking about undeveloped land it's difficult 
to make an airtight case for ownership based on natural law. If you go back 
far enough in the history of any plot of land (except perhaps for Antarctica)  
you will find that somebody stole it from somebody else, government land most
certainly not excepted, but we must deal with practicalities and it's 
unrealistic to  expect the way humans manage their affairs to be as neat and 
tidy as the axioms of Geometry. Besides, land is not very important.

The thing that disturbs you is the way resources that were not produces by 
human actions, land, was divided up, but that's only a small part of the 
wealth or property of the country. In the USA the rental value of buildings 
and land is only 13% of the value of all property, and most of that is in the 
buildings. Mineral wealth is another 3% and it would be zero is somebody
didn't spend money and  expend labor to get the minerals out of the ground. 
The income derived from assets that were not the result of human or machine 
labor can't be more than 5% and will certainly shrink much more in the 
following years. 

I don't find the argument convincing that because we can't trace a clear 
title to 5% of the world's property that gives government the right to 
control 100% of it. Their natural law case for ownership of the disputed 5% 
is no  stronger than my own, the claim for the other 95% I can only attribute    
to megalomania.

On the other hand, the American government did steal the land fair and square 
from the English, who stole it from the French and Spanish, who stole it from 
Indian tribes, who stole it from other Indian tribes.

I have spent this afternoon arguing with my office mate, filling the
whiteboard with equations and having him look through thermodynamics
textbooks. Our current consensus is that you are right and I was
wrong.

This has a maximal Carnot efficiency of eta_ultima=(5800-3)/5800 
~0.9995.  So any dyson shell cannot become better than this.

My mistake was that I calculated the efficiency of the shell to be
(T_shell - 3)/T_shell, which is wrong since it is not the temperature
difference between the cooling system of the shell and outer space
that is used to do work.

If we look at the system star+shell as a single heat engine, its
maximal efficiency is eta_max=(5800-T_shell)/5800, where T_shell is
the temperature of the shell radiators.

It seems that our derivations of T_shell differ, since I assumed that
the available work was expended inside the sphere, while you assumed
it was expended outside in interstellar space. That resulted in my
estimate of T_shell to [S/4*pi*r^2*sigma]^(1/4), and yours to
(S/(4*pi*r^2*sigma*Th))^(1/3). Doing the work outside of course makes
the system more efficient since the waste heat of the work in my case
would heat up the radiators more and lower the efficiency of the
entire shell.

But you are right, the larger the shell becomes, the more efficient it
is.

Thanks for pointing out my error and making me learn more thermodynamics.

Foundations of Transhumanism is a new web site that will provide easy 
access to selected transhumanist material of an academic 
nature. I belive it is important that transhumanism begins to be 
done systematically and in a way that is academically respectable. I 
think we have so far done a comparatively good job in popularizing 
our ideas and making them available to the general educated public 
(which is extremely important). But if some student who is writing 
her MA, say, wants to do it in transhumanism, she will  have a hard 
time convincing her professors that this is really something more 
than science fiction and entertaining speculation. I have been 
contacted by several people with that predicament. It is especially 
hard to find transhumanist texts of the sort that are publishable in 
academic journals etc. So I think it is meaningful to have this site 
for academic transhumanists.

In its present form, the page includes links to such works as the 
Engines of Creation, that are not really academic but nevertheless of 
a very high standard, if they are currently the best text available 
about a certain issue. Where no appropriate texts exist, I have in 
some cases inserted a shorter paper of my own as a temporary place-
holder. More papers by various persons will be added by and by, but 
the emphasis is on quality rather then quantity.

question: if you have altitude (say into orbit), why do you still need
speed ? (I mean, for example, the elevator, screws his way up, does
it need to gain speed ? I thought it could go the whole way with the
same speed)

Ok.

But: if you'd had a rocket-platform on the top of this structure,
isn't it easier then to go into orbit ?
Also since, it's space, can't you just build on. Ok, it's a long way
but in space the structure doesn't have a lot of forces to take on.

Then: can someone tell me from where to where the "winds" are
blowing hard ! ( I mean from X-km to Y-km from earth)
I thought that maybe by making holes into the pipe, more like
a grid, you could save weight and the wind can get trough the
pipe.

Maybe I'm not seeing this right: But isn't it the problem to get
away from the gravity of earth that usses all the energy. 
And therefor it's so expensive to go to space ?
My simple idea, is just to get an elevator to space (100 km ?)
This wil give you a road to space, by wich you could ship parts to
this height. Build rockets/sun-sails/etc.. on top and work from there.

So one problem is: the gas isn't light enhough anymore at some
point in the air ?

An other, the materials for the pipes ? Does this mean that the forces
from the wind, can rip appart a woven stucture from some very strong
wire ! one available today.

3rd: the gas balls, can't keep the stucture up. 

If one of you has the time, can you tell me a bit more about, how
big a ball of gas would be needed to keep up a pipe from let's say:
- 4-diameter, and a lenght of 100 meter
- it's a woven structure of a stong wire (available today)
- it's an open structure (because of the wind)
- and it has in it of cause the teeth, were the screw-elevator,
  has to hold on.
- I have no clue, what something like this would weigh :-)

Anyway, if some of you have the time, and think it's fun,
could "we" (says the one with now scientific knowledge :-)
try to create(virtual) a thing like this. Just to see were the
problems lie, and find some ways to get arround them.

I know, the cable on to an astroid is probably better.
But my thought-experiment, is more from the ground up !
So: we can't make a cable on to an astroid.

Anyway: thanks all for the help !

Greetings,

Berrie

As preparations for the one week of the year that you get to make 
yourself into something new, (e.g., All Hallows Eve) a question:

If you could design a transhumanist Halloween costume, what would you 
create?  Is anyone actually doing a transhumanist costume this year?

A term/pun:

 quid pro con

The polite way people line up on prearranged "opposite sides" of a
predefined "issue".  The favor that ridiculous opponents do each
other (e.g., the quid pro con between Democrats and Republicans,
Communists and Capitalists, etc.).  Balance of Error.
More generally, any mutual imprisonment arrangement.

(Reading Hakim Bey's *Immediatism*:

    There are no issues. There is no such thing as sexism, fascism, 
    speciesism, looksism, or any other "franchise issue" which can be 
    separated out from the social complex and treated with " discourse" 
    as a "problem." There exists only the totality which subsumes all 
    these illusory "issues" into the complete falsity of its discourse, 
    thus rendering all opinions, pro and con, into mere thought-
    commodities to be bought and sold. And this totality is itself an 
    illusion, an evil nightmare from which we are trying (through art, 
    or humor, or by any other means) to awaken.

  that these darker skinned people were Indians 
  from the country India. I think the best definition

 IAN: Does this mean you could blow up the U.S.
 but not a person?  The fact is, nobody has any
 rights but the rights they claim and the rights
 others agree they have, since rights are simply
 an intellectual  construct not existing in the
 objective reality apart  from the ability of 
 those that claim rights to enforce them. So 
 perhaps you do not give rights to many 
 people, only one person at a time.
 Not sure I see the difference.

Okay.  How come, in the beginning of the movie, the Puppet Master is
this evil person, wiping out people's minds and enslaving the husks,
killing people, etc., and our heroine is out to fight this evil...
But at the end of the movie the same being talks to her in this
wise-old-man voice, proposes a marriage of minds, and she goes
along with it?

What gives?  Murder and brain-wiping are okay for godlike cyberbeings
who know all about evolution?

Hi All,

    It's great to see some of you are planing to attend the conference.
I plan on being there on the 5th thru the 8th, and look forward to
talking about some of the frontier ideas that will be presented.

    There's not much of anything nano-related here in Alaska, and very
few people are familiar with the ideas. Look me up while your there!

See ya at the conference,

-Dan

When I think of the benefits of using something like Direct Sequence 
Spread Spectrum modulation over visible light frequencies, with 
bandwidths in, say, the terahertz range, I don't see any reason why an 
advanced civilization would be emitting much radio at all.  Worse yet,
such a signal would look just like white light, or starlight, or any type 
of source desired.  It would not be decipherable or even detectably 
artificial unless the transmitting folk wanted it to be.  For that 
matter, any number of "stars" we see could just as well be transmissions.

Sorry, SETI fans.

A very laudable initiative, which I fully support. We need this a lot.

Perhaps you should consider looking up the following biotechnics
research group (I hope the URL is right, I may have given the wrong
one) which explicitly is planning to look at human enhancement
techniques:

Can you blow up a group of people without blowing up any person within that
group? People have rights. Groups are simply collections of people who have
rights.

A right is a *just* claim. In order to be just, it must be both reciprocol
and universal. There can be no reciprocol, universal rights without the
right to consent (to that which would otherwise be aggression), which can
only come from the Primethic Decision, i.e. an individual moral choice to
the effect that proportionate defense against aggression is moral and
aggression is immoral.

A rights claim is, as you say, an intellectual construct, but it exists as
such whether others agree or not. In fact, without the right to consent,
agreement is meaningless. Might does not make rights. You are confusing the
ability to enforce a claim with the claim itself.

Rights are not given; they are claimed. Privileges are given.

> Not sure I see the difference.

Let's imagine that you are arrested (mistaken identity, of course), and
locked up with a group of amorous cellmates. Will you bend over and submit
to the will of the majority, or will you claim the *right* to defend
yourself, even though you may, in fact lack the *ability* to effectively do
so? Do your rights not exist because your cellmates disagree? Does the group
have rights beyond those of its individual members?

FBI 'knew in advance' of Oklahoma bomb

THE trial of Timothy McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma bomb was a government
cover-up to shield FBI agents who knew about the plot but failed to stop it,
according to a book by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard alleging massive corruption
under President Clinton.
London Prints the Facts...Why Not Here?

With McVeigh already sentenced to death for the blast which killed 168
people, and Terry Nichols, an alleged accomplice, standing trial, the book's
claim will spark anger, particularly in Oklahoma City where witnesses saw
bomb squad officers before the explosion, and 70 per cent of citizens believe
that the government is lying about it.

The Secret Life of Bill Clinton includes a transcript of an official
debriefing of Carol Howe, an undercover informant for the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms. Howe gave warning that the Oklahoma federal building
has been a target and said: "Strassmeir has talked frequently about direct
action against the US government. He is trained in weaponry and has discussed
assassinations, bombings and mass shootings . . ."

Andreas Strassmeir, a former German army officer, had penetrated a neo-Nazi
commune called Elohim City (God's City), from which, the book says, the
terrorist attack may have been planned and executed. Despite this and despite
interviewing more than 20,000 witnesses, the government has interviewed
Strassmeir only on the telephone a year after the bombing when he had fled to
Germany.

The author, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, who worked as The Sunday Telegraph
correspondent in Washington until the summer and who now works for The Daily
Telegraph, recounts a remarkable interview of his own with Strassmeir. They
discuss an "informant". Strassmeir has denied that he was referring to
himself during the conversation.

Mr Ambrose writes: " 'There comes a time in every botched operation when the
informant has to speak out to save his skin, and that's now, Andreas'. "

" 'How can he?' Strassmeir shouted into the telephone. "What happens if it
was a sting operation from the very beginning? What happens if it comes out
that the plant was a provocateur?'

'A provocateur?'

'What happens if he talked and manipulated the others into it? What then? The
country couldn't handle it. The relatives of the victims are going to go
crazy. He's going to be held responsible for the murder of 168 people.'

'That is true.'

'Of course the informant can't come forward. He's scared shitless right now.'

'It sounds to me as if you've got a problem, Andreas.'

'Schiesse'. "

Some 300 members of the victims' families are suing the government claiming
that the bombing was a "government sting" designed to trap neo-Nazis but
which went horribly wrong.

There is no doubt that McVeigh was guilty, says the author, but the whole
truth has been concealed because none of the witnesses who saw McVeigh with
accomplices was called to testify by the prosecution. That would have led
back to Elohim City and the culpable incompetence of the FBI and ATF, the
book argues.

These conclusions may gain credence even among the sceptical American press
following comment yesterday by Robert Novak, a respected columnist, in the
Washington Post. Dismissing previous smears of the author, Mr Novak writes,
he "is no conspiracy theory lunatic (and) is known for accuracy, industry and
courage".

The Secret Life of Bill Clinton also documents a cover-up in the death of
Vince Foster, deputy White House counsel, officially ruled a suicide. The
author has evidence of obstruction and systematic falsehood in the official
version of events - prompting the lead investigator, Miquel Rodriguez, to
resign.

Patrick Knowlton, a witness, refused to retract testimony that he saw a
thuggish man standing guard at Fort Marcy Park shortly before Mr Foster's
body was found.

The night before Mr Knowlton's second interrogation by the FBI, his car was
vandalised. The author has tracked down the perpetrator: a freelance FBI
agent with the highest category of security clearance. The book suggests that
Mr Foster's suspicious death may be linked to his incriminating inside
knowledge of alleged corruption in Mr Clinton's government in Arkansas.

Larry "L D" Brown, a former member of Governor Clinton's security detail,
recounts a mission to Mexico allegedly to kill a man who knew the state
government was winking at weapons smuggling to the Nicaraguan Contras.

The author writes: "Brown did not want to be on the wrong side of a
house-cleaning operation by the CIA, so he accepted the mission."

Regarding theories of human migration into the Americas 
Kristen Brennan said : 

>Can you suggest a URL/book/whatever where I can learn more about this?

I do not have a academic journal reference to the theory of multiple
migrations. But the following newspaper article from August 21, 1997 
is relevant:
http://detnews.com/1997/nation/9708/21/08210077.htm

The article discusses a skull which was recently found in the Columbia
river which radio carbon dating suggests is 8,400 years old.  The analysis
of the skull and its disposition have caused controversy:

begin excerpt

The remains, uncovered last summer, provide strong evidence that the New
World's earliest arrivals may not have been direct ancestors of modern-day
American Indians.

Instead, many of the latest studies suggest, America's earliest
inhabitants may have arrived in migrations thousands of years earlier from
places much farther away, most probably southern Asia, but perhaps even
northern Europe.

Kennewick was the latest in a series of finds and re-examinations
beginning in 1992 that have shared a startling common denominator: the
oldest of the skeletons appear to have Eurasian features, as opposed to
the northern Asian features, common to modern American Indians, that are
characteristic of later-date remains.

The issue raises questions about the prehistoric foundation of American
Indians in their ancestral lands. More immediately, it lays open the
question of who wins possession of the oldest remains. 

In Kennewick Man's case, a group of tribes in the area have demanded a
halt to all studies and immediate reburial -- a move that some
anthropologists claim would be an affront to historical inquiry. "Some
scientists say that if this individual is not studied further, we, as
Indians, will be destroying evidence of our own history," says Armand
Minthorn, a member of the board of trustees with the Confederated Tribes
of the Umatilla. "We already know our history."

A little surprise tucked into today's book review of Mark Edmundson's 
_Nightmare on Main Street_, which purports to deconstruct America's 
general pessimism through an examination of its Gothic tradition.  
The reviewer, Paul Di Filippo (of the Washington Post) spends several 
paragraphs listing the materials that Edmundson apparantly 
ignored in researching his book.  When you read the following, note 
that the term Extropian seems to be on its way to becoming a social 
adjective!

quote:

	As for data that might go against his theme, Edmundson
	too quickly dismisses the whole forward-looking
	Extropian/Wired cyberscene, stating 'Utopian discourse
	is at what may be an all-time low in premillenial
	America.'  With such hearty techno-luminaries and their
	followers as Nicholas Negroponte, Eric Drexler, Stewart
	Brand and James Gleick pouring forth visionary dreams
	of gadget-mediated paradises just down the road, this is
	a highly debatable proposition.

It's short for `lint-in-your-ear motile oratory'.  Ancient Atlantean
wizards used this method to fly into orbit after the earth had expanded too
much and destroyed their homeland.  The method is now known only to a few,
but appears to have involved an occult practice of meditation in which the
side of the head was lowered until the ear rested on the navel.  Lint was
then drawn into the cavities of the ear by specially trained earwigs, and
the coded messages buried in the DNA strands of the lint were chanted until
the adept rose into the heavens.

[I'm being blocked by some Machine Mind from getting my posts on the net
right now, so this will presumably arrive a little late on the list]

At 09:36 AM 10/23/97 -0600, Kennita wrote of the small flurry over:

WAX:
>>> >You need to get out more.

ME:
>>> Curious.  I've always regarded that as the mating cry of the braindead.

Hey, let's not forget the original context, people!

My jab at Wax was in a precisely framed context, namely his use of the
phrase as a stick to beat Mitchell Porter for his imaginative posting,
something that had obviously taken Mitch some minutes to think through and
write when he *could have been out* (Wax implied) doing something more
valuable, or more fun, or less geeky.  

This is the same Mitch, as list regulars will know, who has just returned
halfway around the world after several weeks of travel up and down the USA,
meeting more interesting people in more diverse places than many people on
this list will encounter in the next year.  *Get out more?*  Wrong target
for (what I read, in context, as) a tiresome jeer.   So when I wrote `I've
always regarded that as...' I meant to imply `in this rhetorical context'.

Kennita's generic hint that some of us would be well advised to touch each
other more often and smell the roses (mine have just come into bloom, big
and yellow) instead of cowering in front of computer monitors (I've just
got home from a long sunny walk by the creek) is not necessarily insulting.
 It could even be a salutory reminder that there's a complex world beyond
the screen.  But it does skid past the mistaken and rather silly context of
the initial remark.  

(Do I personally - for what such reflections are worth - *get out more*?
Do I myself  have a life?  A rather more stifled life than I'd wish,
certainly, more constricted than I'd like it to be.  I live alone these
days, but I'm not persuaded  that reading a lot and writing books and
talking with you cyberspace folks, sharing my conjectures and reading and
puns, is an *alternative* to reality.  It's part of reality, perhaps a
redemptive and expansive part.  I don't find many compatible people out
there in the street, or even in the university when I occasionally pedal
over to the campus.  But doesn't the literal narrowness of the e-channel,
its asynchronous theatricality, factor into the appeal of living part of my
life on-line?  Of course.   Does this mean my original reaction to Wax's
cliched jibe was transparently self-defensive?   Gosh, I *never thought of
that*.  [Get a life, Sigmund.])

Umm, ok, I take it you're making fun of me, trying to anyway, dumb example,
because I dont know about the atlanteans and the earth expansion thing is
science fact.  I had this argument with yall once, and then another time
someone said I refused to look at concrete evidence, well, you cant get more
obvious than fitting together pieces like a puzzle!  Im referring to how the
only way for our continents to fit into the original land mass is for the
earth to be 80% of the size it is today (im talking perfectly, otherwise
there are spaces that get larger the further you go towards the poles, only
to be relieved if you REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH), I mean, HELLO?????
 There it is in front of your eyes!

now i have no idea what a linear motor is, and although im interested, you
dont have to tell me what it is if you dont want to, although I would
appreciate it if someone did.

Damien:

You forgot that the ancient Egyptians also had the linear motor (they've been
found in burial crypts next to the storage batteries that powered them)
millennia ago, and that UFO abductees have reported that Grays have used them
in hideous chromozone-bending experiments deep in the caverns reached by the
USS nuclear sub Nautilus in 1958 when it supposedly "reached the North Pole"
(ha!). This means that Grays probably gave the tech to the Atlanteans in the
first place.

Go ahead and mock, you talk about too much boring stuff anyway.
It's all true, I read it somewhere and why would they lie?

Well, I predict that it *won't* be paradise.

But it *might* be _fun_. For more people, more often.

:)

Speaking of media, (and Kathryn :) )I got the pix back from Extro III.
Does anyone on the list have a good  (1200 DPI or better) scanner that
can handle Ektachrome slides?

 When I think of the benefits of using something like Direct Sequence 
 Spread Spectrum modulation over visible light frequencies, with 
 bandwidths in, say, the terahertz range, I don't see any reason why an 
 advanced civilization would be emitting much radio at all.  Worse yet,
 such a signal would look just like white light, or starlight, or any type 
 of source desired.  It would not be decipherable or even detectably 
 artificial unless the transmitting folk wanted it to be.  For that 
 matter, any number of "stars" we see could just as well be transmissions.

Is there a place I can find out more about this on the web?  Like the

Radio is just as fast a laser signals : the speed of light. You don't
want a signal transmission to be in a band of the spectrum that the
natural environment pollutes with its own noise. The visible spectrum is
one of these. There are far fewer and far lower powered radio sources in
the sky than visible light sources, and natural radio sources can be
easily distinguished from artificial sources, though pulsars had
astronomers confused for a bit.

The reactor uses deuterium oxide. Heat is transferred by heat exchanger.

Michael:

Y'know, the ancient Incas also used  linear motor technologies. Just
look at the Nazca Lines. All those shapes can only be seen right from
the air, so of course, they had to have flying ships of some kind, and
all those lines are clearly landing strips for the Inca art critics to
get into the air so that then could evaluate the latest works.

If you don't beleive it, yall are just repressing the technological
birthright of native americans, yall don't want to beleive that native
peoples had all this fancy stuff first but gave it up to live a more
pure primitive way, because it might infringe on yalls patent rights or
something...

Danny, Danny, Danny, think first. The earth is cooler now than it was
billions of years ago, right? Its no longer molten all the way through?
So due to contraction of cooling it should be smaller, right? NOT
bigger. I also thought I had explained to you that the fact that the
existing contintents being only so much area means absolutely nothing
with regards to the size of the earth, as well as that there is no way
the earth could expand due to material from the core moving out.
Material flows in and out all the time, and the density is merely due to
the gravitationally induced pressure of the weight of all the mass in
the outer layers pushing in. By your logic, the earth should be smaller
since the outer layers have been pushing against the core for billions
of years, so they must have compacted it down more. (Y'know, like why
your cereal settles down in the box over time).

Ignorance of the law is recognised as a mitigating factor. A few years
ago I was out waterskiing on Lake Washington with a freind. We didn't
have a third person to act as watcher. I was driving, so when the Coast
Guard stopped us, I got a ticket for it. When I went to court, I
explained that I was a resident of New Hampshire and was not aware of
the regulations for water skiing there in washington state. The judge
ruled that as a mitigating factor and let me off.

That is where civil disputes are still a big part of libertarian theory.
Use of civil legal remedies to counteract coercive acts in a libertarian
society has been fully hashed out.

Well, it all depends on how it is done. If libertarian lawmakers get in
office and merely change the laws in a way that encourages people to
live, work, and think in libertarian ways, then people will for the most
part be free to be unlibertarian, but will pay to beable to live and
work in such anti-freedom ways. People really have no idea how much of
their lives are shaped and influenced by such mundane things as tax and
social welfare policies. For example, people wonder why so many welfare
people seem to be generationally attached to it, but they don't know
that there are, or have been rules that prohibit welfare recipients from
owning assets of such mundane value as a car or even a share in a family
business.

Since this country used to be pretty libertarian, at least much more so
than it is now, any actions taken under arms by libertarians can legally
be construed as merely a the enforcement of a civil law remedy. Freedom
loving people have seen their rights be eroded for several decades, so
any action they take is merely the enforcement of a class action suit.
Our Constitution already recognises that if the people feel the
government is not representing them, is acting in a tyrranical manner,
then it should be overthrown. Thomas Jefferson said, "The tree of
Liberty, from time to time, must be watered with the blood of tyrants
and patriots."

I would by no stretch of the imagination call the US Constitution, nor
Thomas Jefferson a fascist document or a fascist person. The only way
you can even make any parallel between communism and libertarianism is
that they are at extreme opposite ends of any political spectrum.
Libertarians want to be able to prevent others from violating other
individuals while communists consider violating other's rights as an
obvious given.


> 
> Can anyone talk me out of this?

Easy, the internet is possibly the largest and most successful
libertarian experiment in history, and you don't see wars, etc.
Obsolescent governments are trying to force sovreignty on the internet
by have found that to be rather problematic. Since anything crossing
state lines is legaly interstate commerce, they can't under the
Constitution legally mess with it, and so long as congress sees a
libertarian policy vis a vis the internet as a positive business
environment, they won't change it, and even the Communications Decency
Act they tried to pass has been tossed out, so even their power is
limited. Because the internet is predominantly a communications medium
between people, the First Amendment is paramount with anything done on
it. WHile there is little case law on the internet, the touchy areas
with things like porno on the net in the end will I beleive, be found to
only be enforceable in the originating data's jurisdiction under the
standards of that jurisdiction. If such a policy is not ultimately
practiced, we can all shortly expect to be living on the net according
to the moral codes of the Wahabi sect of Saudi Arabia. SInce that does
not seem palatable to most people, such a situation would obviously
naturally encourage people to err on the side of libertarianism.

Since the Constitution is the ultimate law, and it already recognises
the people's right to revolt against unjust laws, governments, and
rulers, any lesser law that limits that right is in itself unjust and
should be disobeyed. While I personally am not opposed to use of force
in such actions, nonviolent actions can and do acheive their goals of
overturning unjust laws and unjust governments, and would be just as
illegal as an action using force of arms. A mob is nothing more than an
unthinking, unguided missile.

There also is nothing wrong with libertarians using nonviolent means to
acheive their goals. This is essentially what has happened in the former
Soviet Union.

actually its how the continents fit, so its not about area, but about how
they are shaped, and by seeing how they fit, the only way they can fit
perfectly is if the earth was smaller than it is now, 80% smaller.  So no the
land doesnt affect the expansion of the earth necessarily, but it shows that

This is your opinion, you dont know how the inner core/mantle relationship
works.  Havent you ever heard of an expanding sun?  Things expand when they
cool.  Anyway, this is just a theory to back up the fact that the earth was
smaller a long time ago.  So, doesnt it seem obvious that the core is
expanding into the mantle?  The core is 3 times denser than the mantle.  You
say that the mantle flows in and out of the core, which of course you dont
know for sure, but if this is true, at the same time couldnt less and less
mantle be flowing back into the core?  Think yourself!

I'm a little delayed in getting started on the next Exponent newsletter,
which will include an EXTRO 3 report, but I'm about to start. If I can get
any of the best photos from you (or anyone else,either by email or other

By your own admission (read above), the way the plates fit together have no
relation to the surface area.  By extremely simple geometric principles,
this also means that the SIZE of the earth has no relation to the way the
plates fit together.  You can't have one without the other.  In fact, what
you are proposing doesn't really make much sense geometrically.
Free-floating plates (e.g. plate tectonics) will fit together
*irregardless* of any expansion or compression because all the components
are multiplied by the same growth factor in all dimensions.  And this is
true whether or not the continents change size as the Earth changes size.

If you draw the continents on a balloon, they fit together equally well
whether the balloon is half-inflated or fully inflated.

First, an expanding sun is irrelevant to the mechanics of a large, solid
planetary object.  Apples and oranges. 

Secondly, your "possible" explanation of the mantle/core system violates
several basic principles of mechanics and thermodynamics.  I strongly
recommend that make the effort to educate yourself in such areas as simple
mechanics (Newtonian physics) and thermodynamics.  A strong foundation in
these subjects will go a long way towards immunizing yourself against the
plethora of pseudo-science proponents in the world.  When addressing an
audience such as this, it is best to have at least a basic understanding of
the science that you are preaching, since the audience most surely does.

The mantle is less dense than the core primarily because it's made of
different 
material.  The core is solid metal, mostly iron.  The mantle is rocks
like silicates and carbonates.  Solid metal weighs quite a bit more those
rocks.

Moving material from the core to the mantle or vice versa wouldn't change its
density. It would be the same stuff.  However, it would be nearly impossible
because of the weight difference.  Since the stuff is molten (more or less)
the iron would just sink right back to the bottom.

Umm... I'm not absolutely sure this is true. Would it not show some
statistical evidence of the multiplexing? I admit it might be subtle, and I
agree that Arecibo would be of limited utility. I think the idea of the Frank
Drake crowd is to assume that "they" *want* to talk to "us", and would go for
something like a tin can on a string near a watering hole. If "we" want to
look for "their" "Ophiuchi Hotline[s]", that is a different matter. IMHO,
YMMV, etc.

I'm in an _advocatus diaboli_ mood, having just seen the movie. Prefix all my

You were lucky. You could have gone down. The court showed mercy. Did the Judge
dismiss, or were you found "not guilty"? I'm guessing the former. If the latter,
the state could have appealed and won. Not that they'd bother...

I also find it interesting that the USCG was enforcing _state_ laws. I'm not sure
that's within their powers/jurisdiction, though I'm sure they do it all the time.

You both miss another point: one of the profits of authoritarianism is delegation.
Some people *want* other people to be coerced by yet other people. So some people
will always attempt to create a State.  See below...

*Ahem*. Well, let me step up to the plate here for a minute. I think the parallel
is between communism and anarchy. They'd both work if you could get there, but
maybe "you can't get there from here." That's my biggest problem with both of them.
"Anarchy at gunpoint" is no fun, and pretty damned low-quality anarchy to boot.

Now this may not be the point the Codewarrior Princess was trying to make, but I
think it's a closer fit.

Yet. So far it's hard to project power in cyberspace, and impossible to take and
hold territory. This may not hold true forever.

A balance of power, and a bunch of other conditions detailed in Axelrod's _EoC_,
need to obtain for cooperation to be a successful ESS. I wish this were as obvious
to everyone as it is to me. But you can't teach calculus to a starving peasant, and
that fact is not the peasant's fault.

There's a real problem, way down deep, about where disputes end and clear title

Dear people,
I'm new to all this talk
and I have few queries,...

How does one handle 100s of mails
over a space of 3 days while handling 
a full time job ?

Do you guys do your research and homework
before publishing stuff like that ?

Does your writings contribute to the 
extropian ideals, and thus creating a
better world for prospective post-humans ?

Please feedback to me ASAP
before further disillusionments sets

In a message dated 97-10-27 02:43:58 EST, you write:

<< The mantle is less dense than the core primarily because it's made of
 different 
 material.  The core is solid metal, mostly iron.  The mantle is rocks
 like silicates and carbonates.  Solid metal weighs quite a bit more those
 rocks.
 
 Moving material from the core to the mantle or vice versa wouldn't change
its
 density. It would be the same stuff.  However, it would be nearly impossible
 because of the weight difference.  Since the stuff is molten (more or less)
 the iron would just sink right back to the bottom.
  >>

Ok, thats interesting, do you know of the relationship between the inner core
and the outer core?

also, i was just about to read the most previous post before this one that
was also titled Re: earth/moon relationship, and then AOL kicked me out and I
lost it, so could someone send it to me?

thanks

Hmm, that's an assertion anyone can test. I just checked. Thermal expansion
coefficients are published in big books, and most of the ones I looked at are
positive, not negative. SO I feel confident saying:

Actually, most solids, liquids and gases don't.

Water does, when it makes ice. Steam doesn't, when it makes water. Both these
facts are part of what makes Earth such a nice place. Ice melts, rather than
sinks, to name one good thing.

Most things get smaller when they cool. Example: lava cracks as it solidifies.
Why? It is contracting, and it can only contract so far before cracks appear.
Another example: which would you use to loosen a pipe fitting, heat or cold?

Good filters. :) There's also the seeming paradox that the most activity
comes from the people with the most time to spare, not the people who
send a few high-Q posts, such as (to name three) Eric Watt Forste, Steve
Witham, and Robin H.

Some do, some don't. It's an open list, not a closed club. Consequently
the SNRR is kind of, umm, well, mediocre or worse at times. Some good
people get dragged into time-wasting arguments around here. Consequently
*they* aren't perceived to be shining at their true luminosity, either.

Ouch. I'm guilty, I'm trying to not fall for every troll, but it's hard,
and I need more practice.

> Please feedback to me ASAP
> before further disillusionments sets

Hey, if you feel you have to tar every member of the list because there
are some bozos, go ahead, but please recognize that's what you're doing.
OK? :)Suggestions have been made for several ways to improve the SNRR,
but nothing has been done, because the list is run by King Log, not King
Stork. I dislike it, too. I'm getting better filters. And I don't like
having to.

The inner core is a solid apparently because of the enormous pressure it's
under.  It's made of the same stuff as the outer core.  Exact details of the
inner core structure aren't entirely clear because the pressures and 
temperatures exceed our current experimental limits.  I believe the current
theory is that the inner core is an iron crystal, which you just can't
get under conditions at the surface.

Interesting. Would these stars have been found if their spectra didn't
also have higher frequency components? If we're to spend say 1 to 10
million dollars with best current technology on a dyson sphere search,
what is the radius in which we'd have a good chance of finding one if it
exists?

 IAN: Scale is all of it. The only reason you have this 
 choice between PPA1 and PPA2, resulting in the favorable 
 incentives cited, is because PPA1 and PPA2 are SMALLER by 
 definition than government police forces which contain as 
 clients all people living within X region, whereas in the 
 PPA1 vs PPA2 scenario you can pick and choose * because *
 you are external to their sphere of land ownership.

 I think Kristen is exactly right to suggest that there's 
 no difference between large private and large government 
 scenarios.  "Gov't" as some special kind of entity is 
 a myth.  The economics of gov't are the economics 
 of large-scale land ownership, of monopoly.

 It's not "moral sin" that makes gov't bad.
 This is the "demystification" of gov't.

 IAN: So long as you have enough money to pay 
 all the rents and tolls in between you and him.
 As soon as you ran out of money while looking
 for that good landlord, you could quickly find 
 yourself in debt slavery. Granted many smaller
 claims r better,  but the only difference in
 the cost/benefit analysis comes down to the
 size-of-land-claim differential, with the
 larger having all the costs of monopoly.

 IAN: The price of land is one thing that could 
 stop you. Granted I agree that things will be
 more favorable when there are more small land 
 claims to  choose services from,  but that's 
 what I'm saying: the only problems with gov't
 stem from the fact that it's so big and thus
 is so hard to say no to, i.e., hard to leave.

 IAN: Thanks, John has the spirit of free inquiry, 
 refreshing indeed!  One of the most important things
 for free thinkers to teach, more so than our pet memes
 is to do and how to do the "memetic self-check." Always
 challenge your memes and encourage the freedom of such
 in ones "memetic identity group." One thing one finds
 out fast in the conspiracy venues, is that any quest-
 ioning of meme type x instantly results in one's 
 being seen as an defined as an "enemy agent"
 by all meme type x propagators. 

 Such a reaction is antithetical to free inquiry,
 and is a primitive memetic defense mechanism.

 IAN: Yes, exactly; therefore the basis for any
 definition of "preexisting ownership" is void 
 and the concept of "preexisting ownership" of
 X must default to who owned X before I came
 into existence or before I discovered X.

 "Preexisting what?" Me. Others were first...


> Besides, land is not very important.

  IAN: It's as important as owning all of it 
  means owning the basis of everything, or 
  owning 70% of it means owning it all -30%.
  Land owned is one of the most critical 
  factors in total control. Saying land is 
  not important and that gov't is a big
  problem is incompatable, because it's 
  simply the claim to the ownership of so 
  much land that makes the gov't what it is.

 IAN: The capital value of land is but one 
 measure of it's power. The right to enforce
 law and extract tax/rent upon all who find 
 themselves on it is the  major measure of 
 the power/value of land. You cannot deny
 that fact and critique gov't at the same 
 time, since the size of the land claim 
 is the basis of the "evils" of gov't.

 IAN: But still someone has to be given title 
 the to land, and it most logically defaults 
 to the longest running claim, since it pre-
 existed most lives, current and historic.


> Their natural law case for ownership of the disputed 
> 5% is no stronger than my own...

 IAN: Yes it is, if their claim preexisted yours.


>On the other hand, the American government did steal the land fair and 
>square from the English, who stole it from the French and Spanish, who 
>stole it from Indian tribes, who stole it from other Indian tribes. 

  IAN: Exactly, but practicality dictates that
  for reasons of not fighting wars over land and
  getting on with consumer commerce that we fix 
  it with A claim, and the current gov't is the
  longest running and looks like best candidate
  on the block.  Of course, I think this land-
  lord should be about 99% absentee, maximizing
  individual liberty. Like Hong Kong was... 
  Hong Kong with a dash of Holland.

  I'm just countering 100% anarchy. Minarchy.

i turned my attention towards this list for my 'research and homework' after
not receiving any replies from two separate astronomers i emailed (still
havent actually), but it turned out to be false, pretty interesting if it
were true though dont you think?  Now the attention has turned to when in the
past this relationship could have existed, since the earth has been
expanding.  We're actually talking about something I dont think anyone else
has talked about before, I think its worthy of discussion. It would be nice
to have that date archived: when WAS the moon in that specific relationship
with the earth?  Maybe it doesnt mean anything if it was, you could go on
forever with relationships between moons and their planets and other moons
and the sun, and im sure some interesting things would come up, and perhaps
they would have some significance, so its good to try and find out.

You may wish to add a link to Max More's doctoral dissertation which
treats the topic of identity. This is a central concern to any
transhuman/posthuman being which has the capability of transforming
"itself"  radically.

CONTINUITY, TRANSFORMATION

The link above leads directly to the thesis and will work, but the site
uses frames so you may wish to access the thesis by going thru

Since you have a link to "Engines of Creation" you may wish to add a link

The case for examining transhumanist issues could perhaps be strengthened
by referring to ongoing technical progress. Links to the full papers of

 The inner core is a solid apparently because of the enormous pressure it's
 under.  It's made of the same stuff as the outer core.  Exact details of the
 inner core structure aren't entirely clear because the pressures and 
 temperatures exceed our current experimental limits.  I believe the current
 theory is that the inner core is an iron crystal, which you just can't
 get under conditions at the surface.
  >>

Thats interesting, then perhaps its the inner/outer core process that is
making the expansion?  I heard somewhere that we've created temperatures 3
times hotter than that of the inner sun, in fusion reactors, is that bogus?
 Anyway, Ive known about the crystal being in the center, thats really cool,
im sure it has all sorts of implications/potentials, having effects on
different wave/frequency/magnetic spectrums etc...

do you know of a url on this where theories are being made etc..?

thanks

Even if Ambrose is an MI6 asset he seems to be just
what is needed!   But contrary to his nonsense about
the "little people" defending liberty conflict at the top
is all that stands between where we are and total tyranny.

AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD -- 10/26/97
===================================
Abbreviated Transcript of C-Span Interview
------------------------------------------

Portions of remarks made  by  London Telegraph newspaper reporter
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (AEP) during  an  appearance  on  C-Span,
October  26, 1997, appear below.  By way of introduction, here is
a partial review  by  Conspiracy  Nation of Mr. Evans-Pritchard's
new  book,  *The  Secret   Life   of   Bill   Clinton*.    (ISBN:
0-89526-408-0)

Let's  get  two  things  straight:   (1)  the  London   Telegraph
newspaper  is  *not*  a "tabloid"; it is a *broadsheet*.  It does
not feature pretty girls in bikinis  on page 3; it is a respected
British newspaper having a circulation of about 1 million readers
per day.  During the years immediately before World War  II,  the
Telegraph   sided   *with*   Winston   Churchill   and  *against*
"appeasement" of Nazi Germany  on  the march.  (The London Times,
however, sided with the Neville Chamberlain "appeasement"  policy
which,  we  know,  was  a  big  mistake.)   The  London Telegraph
newspaper has been around  since  1855,  and anyone who regularly
visits their  web  site  knows  they  consistently  do  excellent
reporting  on a wide variety of issues.  (2) Just because Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard is British does  *not*  mean he is therefore with
MI-6.

Reacting to Evans-Pritchard's book,  *The  Secret  Life  of  Bill
Clinton:   The  Unreported  Stories*,  one  Internet  commentator
called the London journalist a modern Alexis DeTocqueville.  This
is  an  apt  description:   Evans-Pritchard,  visiting  our land,
travelling through it, and jotting down his observations, gives a
keen outsider's sketch of  the  United  States,  as it is, in the
mid-to-late 1990s.  Do not be misled by the title  of  the  book.
*The Secret Life of Bill Clinton* is not about "Clinton bashing,"
*per  se*, but portrays the larger situation of an elite class --
Democrats and Republicans --  full  of decadence, corruption, and
snobbery, and stubbornly resisted by the  common  people  of  the
United  States.  The heroes of AEP's book are the ordinary people
who, against all  odds,  have  successfully "monkey-wrenched" the
plans  of  their  "betters"  to "manage" the country.  Yes, there
have been defeats.   But  AEP's  larger  point  is  that, even in
defeat, there has been a wide-ranging RESISTANCE which  has  most
definitely  slowed the enemy's advance.  And there have been many
victories in some of the  minor  skirmishes, too, detailed in Mr.
Evans-Pritchard's book.

The one critique I have of the book is in  its  coverage  of  the
Oklahoma  City  bombing(s)  case.   It carefully demonstrates the
ineptness  and  even  cover-up  occurring  in  the  so-called FBI
"investigation," but the author does not come to grips  with  one
aspect  of  the  case:   the  fact that explosives must have been
placed directly *on*  the  support  pillars  of the doomed Murrah
Building.  (We know this from expert analysis done  by  Brigadier
General (retired) Benton Partin.)  Since charges were placed *on*
the  support  pillars, the next question (not noticed by AEP) is,
"How did  the  'rogue  terrorists'  involved  gain  access to the
building?"  Unfortunately, Mr. Evans-Pritchard misses that in his
otherwise good analysis.

The  book, as is to be expected (since it is written by an author
who has achieved cult status  amongst researchers into the hidden
ways of the U.S. government), breaks a lot of  new  ground.   The
book  gets  the  "gears  turning"  in  one's  mind.   Aspects  of
revelations   Evans-Pritchard  has  surfaced  may,  circumstances
permitting, be touched on in  future issues of Conspiracy Nation.
But this underground news  outlet  can  not  possibly  cover  the
entire  eruption of previously-suppressed information provided by
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.  People  routinely ask, "Gee, Conspiracy
Nation, but what can *I* do?"  What can you do?   Buy  this  book
and keep it on the best-seller lists.

Transcript
----------
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard interviewed on C-Span, 10/26/97
-------------------------------------------------------

C-SPAN: Why is Oklahoma City such a focal point of the book?

AEP:   Well,  I  think something that hasn't been reported to the
American people is, many of  the  families have filed a number of
lawsuits against the federal government, alleging that  [the  OKC
bombing(s)] was a sting operation or, at the very least, that the
government  was  negligent  --  had  some responsibility for what
happened, perhaps had  a  degree  of  prior  knowledge.  It was a
broader conspiracy, and they haven't been told the full truth.
   The families [of the victims], many of them, are  very  angry.
One  family  in  particular,  Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost 2
grandchildren in the daycare  center, conducted their own private
investigation for 2 years.  And they  feel  that  the  government
covered  up the true story; that it was a broader conspiracy, and
that it was  probably  a  sting  operation that went disastrously
wrong, and they've not come clean about it.

C-SPAN:  Mr. Evans-Pritchard is a reporter, based in London.   He
spent some time here in Washington.

AEP:  I did four-and-a-half years as the Washington correspondent
for  the London Sunday Telegraph.  And I've now returned, and I'm
writing about European affairs for the Daily Telegraph in London.

C-SPAN:  Last  Monday,  syndicated  columnist  Robert Novak wrote
this piece, "A Sting Operation Gone Awry."  And  he  talks  about
Andreas  Strassmeier,  "a  former  West  German  army  lieutenant
illegally in the U.S."  Who is he, and why is he important to the
bombing?

AEP:  Tim McVeigh telephoned him 2 days before the bombing, after
he  had  called the Ryder Truck rental agency.  And that's how he
got drawn into the  whole  question  of  the bombing in the first
place.  [Strassmeier] spent 8 years in the German army.   And  he
told  me  he'd  had  intelligence  training  and  he'd  done some
intelligence work in the German army.   And he came here with the
intention of working undercover for the U.S. Justice  Department.
And  he  admitted  that to me.  So it's quite significant that he
should figure as  a  character  in  the  extended McVeigh circle.
He's also been named by an undercover informant of the ATF, Carol
Howe, as somebody who's stirring up  race  war  and  a  terrorist
campaign against the U.S. government.  Now with his background, I
find  it  very  hard  to  believe  that  he's  a genuine neo-Nazi
terrorist (which is how he presented himself.)  I suspect that he
was here on some kind  of  undercover mission; whether it was for
the German government, or the United States government, or  both,
I  don't  know.   My own conjecture (I can't prove it) is that he
was a joint asset, penetrating the neo-Nazi far right.

C-SPAN:  You devote a fair amount of your time to a  lot  of  the
conspiracy theories we hear, on this network, and read about from
time  to time in different publications.  Vincent Foster:  Was it
suicide, or was it murder?

AEP:  Well, I don't answer that question.  What I say is, Kenneth
Starr's investigator, the prosecutor  he appointed to re-open the
case, came to a different conclusion.   He  told  Kenneth  Starr,
after  a  4-months  investigation,  there was serious evidence of
foul play.  His name is Miquel  Rodriguez.  He went to Starr.  He
told Starr what he'd uncovered during his investigation using the
grand jury.  And Ken Starr looked the other way!  He didn't  want
to  hear  it!   He  didn't  want  to  deal with it.  So Rodriguez
resigned and went back to California.   And that is the only time
that it's ever been seriously investigated.  After that,  it  was
all damage control.
   So  I  don't  feel that Ken Starr has the authority to deliver
the report that he's delivered.  I  don't think he answers any of
the questions; it's just a re-hash of the Fiske report, which was
incredibly weak.  And  he  selectively  uses witness testimony to
support his case.  And the  people  who  are  familiar  with  the
archive  of  documents  in  this  case  are amazed that he's just
ignored a colossal amount of evidence.  And he's ignored what the
crime scene witnesses said.

C-SPAN:  So what is your  conclusion about the Clinton presidency
so far?

AEP:  In terms of the  scandals,  or  in  terms  of  its  general
performance?

C-SPAN: Well, in terms of this book.

AEP:   My  conclusion is that he's a very, very corrupt man.  And
it's partly  a  generational  thing.   I  think  that the current
generation in power (not just in America, but in most  industrial
countries)  has  lost  its  honor code.  It's lost its integrity.
Bill Clinton is the emblem of that.

C-SPAN:  You write that, "If President Clinton eludes justice, at
least it can  be  said  that  his  destructive influence has been
checked." Checked by whom?

AEP:  Well, the good side of this book (it's not all negative) is
that the ordinary people of America have held  the  line:   we've
seen  it  with  the families in Oklahoma; we've seen it, in other
people, throughout the  book,  who  are  *resisting* the abuse of
power, in their little  corner.   Not  always  successfully,  but
they're  impeding  what I consider to be a decadent and dishonest
leadership class from  dragging  this  country  down in terms of,
into a Banana Republic.  The ordinary people are the ones who are
going to save America and not allow it to go the way  that  other
countries  have  gone  when  its democracy has been threatened by
internal decadence.

C-SPAN:  Briefly, *why* did  you  write  this  book, and who were
your sources?

AEP:  There are very few un-named sources in the book; almost all
of it has got named sources.  So people can make a judgement  for
themselves, on how they want to evaluate it.
   I  first  got dragged into this morass when I started going to
Arkansas and talking  to  ordinary  people  there.  And it became
quite clear to me that a lot of very bad things  had  been  going
on  for  the  last  10  or  15  years.   It had become a haven of
narcotics trafficking.  And the more  I looked into it, it seemed
to me the  political  machine  in  Arkansas  was  involved.   And
there'd  been  a  lot  of mis-use of the criminal justice system:
people had been  intimidated,  people  had  died.   And I started
looking into these issues and I...  Well, there was no going back
after that. I got drawn right into the middle of it.

C-SPAN:  Explain this picture [on book cover]:  why was it taken,
and why is it on the cover?

AEP:  Well, I can't answer that, because I've only just  seen  it
myself.   I  came over from London on Thursday night.  I've never
seen the book before.

C-SPAN:  The picture,  of  course,  of  First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton whispering into the ear of President Clinton.   Was  that
taken at the White House?

AEP: I must find out. It's terribly negligent of me not to know.

C-SPAN:   You,  in a number of instances, use the term, "abuse of
power." Who has the power? And who's abusing it?

AEP:  It's about...  It's more than just Clinton.  It's about the
whole power structure in the United States.

C-SPAN: But who, specifically?

AEP:  The Justice Department.  The FBI.  The political class as a
whole.

C-SPAN: So who's calling the shots?

AEP:  Very good  question.   It  appears  that [these things are]
orchestrated  by   the   highest   levels   of   the   FBI,   FBI
Counter-Terrorism in Washington.

C-SPAN:  Did anyone in the Clinton White House, either current or
former, co-operate with you on this book?

AEP:   [Slight chuckle] They stopped co-operating with me quite a
long time ago.

C-SPAN: Why?

AEP: I think they found that they couldn't really "spin" me.

C-SPAN:  You're now back  in  London.   Did  that have any direct
relation on this book?

AEP:  If I was an American journalist (and I'm pretty critical of
the American press)...  But I can see all  the  constraints  that
they're  working  under.   It's  quite difficult to challenge the
entire power structure.  (Which is  what  I've done in this book.
It's  not  just  attacking  Clinton;  I'm  pretty  tough  on  the
Republicans as well.)  You kind of "burn your  bridges"  and  you
lose your friends.  It's very difficult for a journalist to write
that type of book about their own country; they can't continue to
operate  and function, as a journalist.  If I did this in London,
about the British power structure,  I really couldn't continue to
work there. So, leaving [America] sort of made it easier.

C-SPAN: How does all of this connect to the President?

AEP:  Well, he's...  All these things  have  happened  under  his
watch.  Waco happened under his watch; it's the worst... it's the
Wounded Knee of the 20th century.  It's the worst abuse of power,
in  terms of number of people killed as a result of an act by the
government.  And he never  dealt  with  it!  He, instead of heads
rolling and people being brought to  account,  he  went  out  and
tried the victims.
   And  so  that  set  in motion the militia movement.  It set in
motion, to some degree,  the  domestic  terrorism that the United
States now suffers from (including the Oklahoma  bombing.)   This
happened under his watch!  (Although there are deeper forces that
have  been  at  work  for  many,  many years, that contributed to
this.)  I'm not sure it  would  have happened if Paul Tsongas had
been elected president.

I think the "official" explanation is that the Puppet Master was
forced to do it by its creators, but really didn't want to do it.

Of course, it could be that the heroine suffers from technophilia :-)

I agree. It is important for personal development to experience the
sensual side of life. We are sensual beings, and most of our mental
architecture is based on that. Even if we autoevolve a lot, I would be
surprised if we would loose this aspect, it is very deeply ingrained
in our fundamental structure. Of course, we might gain new senses and
ways of experiencing the wonders of the world, some of which may today
be regarded as distinctly non-sensual such as internet traffic or the
radio spectrum.

:-) Most conventional people would definitely say that I haven't got a
life. I spend most of my waking time reading, working at a computer or
talking with people. I rarely go to movies, I never go out for dancing
and I don't drink alcohol. Instead I play roleplaying games, lecture
at the young scientist association or a local highschool and discuss
with my friends. I'm almost the archetypal nerd.

But I'm profoundly happy too. The rather cerebral world I inhabit is
filled with wonders, ranging from the grand beauty of dynamical
systems theory and neural networks to the fun of developing new ideas
to see how well they float. I learn things all the time, I discover
things about myself and the world every day. My email discussion
channels may be serial, in black and white, with no body language or
other non-verbal clues, but they still manage what I regard as the
most precious things in the universe: ideas, communication and
information.

Do I really need to "get out more"? Obviously, it is a good idea to
experience new things, to open up new areas of skill and possibility,
but I don't see any reason why it is more valuable to move in the
physical or social world than in the intellectual world. Balance
doesn't mean that one should devote exactly one third of one's time to
each of these worlds, it means that one should find the right ratios
to achieve personal satisfaction and development.

Well put.  You didn't mention in your message how you take care of that
side of yourself.  Vigorous exercise, music, taking time to enjoy food

IMHO, roleplaying can offer many valuable vicarious experiences (and 
social/emotional interactions as well).  You can bet my characters 
don't spend all their time nerding!  There are kidnapped heirs to be
saved -- castles to be built -- demons to be slain!  And it has to be
done in cooperation with others, and it has to be _done_, not just
argued about (I've lost characters, and entire parties, to being
ambushed, poisoned, buried, etc., because there was too much squabbling
about the next step to take -- remembering this has stood me in good
stead in real life).

Now *that* is what I like to hear.  I think there are too many bright
(even brilliant) people out there who are angry, bitter, depressed, etc.
(and who may not realize at a level they can work with that if they
don't like feeling that way, they can change it).

Not "more" -- just "as".  And I think the emotional world is as valuable
as the other three (I've seen many social people who manage to still
manage to stay aloof from their emotions -- it can be an amusing picture
or a sad one, depending on the person).

I would add:  and recognize what the ratios are, and not denigrate those 
who have chosen different ratios, and acknowledge the value in the
quadrants that one has decided to devote less personal attention to,
and not let any of them get *too* close to zero, lest the (dynamic)
balance be overtipped.

Yes, but it would also have the effect of restricting legitimate posts

I don't know, but according to my _1995 Information Please Almanac_:  "The 
temperature at the core of our Sun must be 20 million degrees centigrade, the
surface temperature averages 6,000 degrees centigrade, or about 11,000 
degrees Fahrenheit."

I won't put us past having created a tiny region of 60 million degrees 
centigrade for some fraction of a second -- hardly anything surprises me
any more -- but Yoicks!

I train ninjutsu, which is both excellent excercise and mentally and
physically useful, and also take long walks when I can (usually I
refrain from taking the bus or train, and simply walk).

When it comes to music, I try to mix the styles I listen to: most is
classical, some is techno or synth, and some is from various cultures
such as sufi or gregorian chants and japanese drumming. It takes a
while to learn to enjoy new kinds of music, but it is worth it.

As for food, most of the time I'm fairly conventional, but I really
enjoy trying new kinds of food, and our transhumanist group here
visits one national restaurant each month (I think we are planning to
try Basque food this time; we have already tried the American,
Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Mexican, Italian and Kurd kitchen).

Another thing I do is to try to perceive things more. There are
wonders everywhere if you look at the tiny details - the textures of
marble, the intricate structure of plants, the patterns formed by
autumn leaves or snow blowing in the wind, the scent trails of fellow
humans or the nuances of sound in a coin falling.

Yes, roleplaying is useful, creative and fun! Actually, transhumanist
ideas are much more acceptable to roleplayers, since they are used to
looking at new (possibly imaginary) ideas and trying to see how they
would work. It may turn out that the roleplayers will in the long run
affect our culture more than we expect.

Yesterday we finished a hard science fiction game. We spent over 6
hours developing a linguistic code with which to communicate with an
alien race, and in the end managed to reach contact and cultural
exchange. My players argued about how to tailor communications to fit
the sensory structure of the aliens, trying to find common ground and
the delicate diplomatic questions of allowing telepresence devices
onboard. It was great fun, and in the end they succeeded in learning
about the alien culture and opening up real human-alien contact (at
the small price of nearly wiping out both species).

Imagine getting people to seriously think about how sensory
experiences shape our language and philosophy, having a lot of fun!
I'm starting to think this could be used in higher education...

That was one realization that really changed my life and made me the
one who I am today. Of course, it is one thing to realize it, and
another thing to actually manage to live by it, but it is possible.

Some good heuristics there. 

The ratios may change over time; up until this year I did practically
no physical activity voluntarily and believed that I *was* weak, slow
and clumsy. Now I have stepped up my physical side quite a bit, with
noticeable bodily changes and improvements on almost all
aspects. Self-transformation can be very fun!

"Higher frequency" ? I didn't mention anything about higher frequency.
(Higher frequency of what?, I should probably ask)

Maybe you are thinking about the Doppler velocity techniques that 
astronomers have used to discover Jupiter-sized planets around 
other (main sequence) stars.  If so, that is completely different.
I was talking about infrared excess stars. The physics involved
with the IR excess stars is about energy and fluxes and heat. See the URL 
I gave previously (http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html) for 
some notes about that. 

The Doppler velocity techniques are all about.. well doppler velocities. 
The techniques are similar to those used in helioseismology. 

Geoff Marcy's URL has some words about his planet finding 
techniques here:

http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html

and I wrote a detailed explanation about helioseismology for
my Stanford job (solar oscillations group) here:

http://soi.stanford.edu/results/heliowhat.html

Actually I have thought alot about calculating if the stars in
Marcy et al's (Doppler) speculated planet systems also have IR excesses 
(I even discussed it with him a couple of years ago), but I have 
not done the calculations yet. It would be an interesting result 
(maybe someone has already done it by now).

These stars that we are talking about, both the IR excess stars and
and the Doppler velocity stars are all nearby: 25 parsecs or less.

You would absolutely have to have a database of stars with parallaxes.
I don't know what is the Hiparccos catalog's radius for stars. If 
your search for Dyson spheres uses the  Wooley or Gliese catalogs
to provide parallaxes, (those are the catalogs used by Fred Witteborn,
my old boss at NASA-Ames, when he searched for Dyson spheres in the
early 80's) then that radius would be 25 parsecs or less. 

There are lists around of candidate search stars for finding
other planets. Geoff Marcy's group has one. The Terrestrial
Planet Finder working group will have one soon. The Kepler and
Darwin missions already have lists for candidate stars. Project
Phoenix (SETI) has a list of candidate stars, as well. I don't know
how much overlap there is, but I would be that there is a huge
overlap of stars in those lists. I believe that alot of this information 
is available at these different groups' Web sites.

After I made that post I finally got around to
reading your "Cortical Integration" paper and found
it to be a useful survey. Perhaps another approach is
the "spreading waves of activation" network (see 
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/Noetica/OpenForumIssue5/SWA.html
)

One problem I sometimes have in interpreting (or
maybe its in responding to) some posts is summed up
by something you wrote in your "Cortical Integration"
paper:

"The thought was to get as simple a world as
possible, yet one that had enough complexity to allow
an illustration of the principles behind the system."  

I tend to read between the lines and look for all the
exceptions rather than stick to the basics of the
specific scenario being postulated, immediately
trying to fit it into my own model of reality.  I
wonder if thats a symptom or example of the
unconstrained curiosity youre making a case against;
or, perhaps, its just a desire to skip the hard work
of logical analysis and try too soon for some sort of
artistic integration.

Hello Extropians,

In an e-mail conversation with my micro-economics teaching assistant, we
got onto the subject of the inefficiencies of government as a monopolistic
firm.  I am in no way experienced enough to have a sufficiently informed
debate on this topic-- could someone more learned please help me poke some
holes in his argument(although some points of his are very convincing).
Especially, how do I argue against his statement that public healthcare is
40% cheaper than private!?!

Thanx a lot,

Geoff

In some sense economists do not differentiate between government and 
firms in terms of production.  A hospital is just another firm.

A caution here.  It is a misconception that monopolies are always
inefficient or that competition is efficient.  You will learn later 
on that efficiency requires that a firm's marginal costs equal 
prices.  A monopoly often sets price above marginal cost so is 
inefficient.  However, it is not the case that increasing the number 
of firms is a good idea since it might cause production costs to rise 
(this is the case of a Natural monopoly).  The solution lies in 
regulation by forcing the firm to set price equal to MC.  However it 
might mean that price is less than average cost and so yields 
negative profits.  The solution here is to subsidize the firm so that 
profits are zero.  The easiest way is to turn the firm into a public 
corporation financed through general tax revenues.  Hospitals for 
instance.  Note that Canada offers the same level of healthcare as
the US but at about 40% lower costs.
    Second, there are goods called puplic goods (as opposed to 
private goods).  Private firms will generally provide too little of 
puplic goods so are inefficient (like say Education).  Alternately 
they may offer too much (like pollution).

There is a model that looks at govt competition.  It analyses "voting 
with one's feet".  Individuals move to the jurisdiction that offers 
the right tradeoff between services and taxes. (eg Sask, AB, BC).

The issue here is that outcomes are interdependent.  Cutbacks in 
healthcare affects the efficacy of social programs.  The issue is one 
of coordination.  You will see this point made in the Game Theory 
books.

> firm, with all its citizens holding shares, and some crazy politicians
> with no business-sense at the helm.  

The view that many economists make is that, yes, governments may be 
inefficient but that does not mean that competition can do any 
better.  The converse holds as well.  The issue comes down to 
figuring out when one form is better than the other and always being 
vigilant in pushing for more efficiency, equaty, and fairness. 

Talk to you later   Joel

Back when San Jose's PBS station was regularly running "The Prisoner",
I had the complete Number 6 outfit, but that's a little obscure these
days.  I'll have to wait for McGoohan to make a movie or something
before I can use that costume, which I consider to represent the
ultimate transhuman: a man trapped, tortured, and tempted, but who
refused to sacrifice his mind, his goals, his chosen identity.

In this case, the government is a monopsony (a market with only one buyer)
rather than a monopoly (a market with only one seller).  The government
buys services from millions of doctors and thousands of hospitals at a
price it can dictate.  Just as monopolies drive prices above their
open-market value, monopsonies drive prices down.  Whether this is a good
thing depends on whether you are a buyer or a seller, but the net result
for buyers plus sellers is a loss, called the 'deadweight loss' in Econ 101.

Government monopsonies in agriculture were responsible for the collapse of
much of Africa's agricultural production in the '70s.

How about Mary Shellys Frankenstein, but instead of grunting and

	Actually, the TA is correct.  If you take the total amount of healthcare 
provided divided by the total dollars, one would find the highest value 
achieved under public healthcare systems, due to economy of scale (which 
means that if you buy a whole bunch of something it's cheaper per item).

	Think about it.  As was explained to me, imagine that you had to go make a 
pencil from scratch.  You had to grow the tree, mine the lead, the whole 
bit.  Think of how much work it would be to make one pencil.  Now, think of 
the little bit more work to make an additional pencil.  The work per pencil 
drops.

	The real problem (IMnot-soHO) people on this list have with public 
healthcare, is that one person should not be forced to pay for another's 
healthcare.

	A smaller problem deals with the fact of when you make something available 
to everybody for free, soon there isn't much left (as you may have noticed 
the last time you tried to get something for nothing).

Thats because HANDGUNS are rare, would you share Canadian muggings
at knifepoint statistics with us......

Here in Chicago two years ago there were 950+ murders, 140+ by
"kitchen knife", 130+ by "Baseball bat" and only one (a domestic)
by a so called assault weapon. Guess which one was banned.
 
>I'm under the impression that "mugging at gunpoint" style

It happens here where I live here in Chicago, which is shocking
(sarcasm alert) since handguns have been illegal in Chicago since
1983. "Only criminals and cops have handguns in Chicago."

Once again by your own admission we are seeing an increase in
violent trends, but the lack of handguns means they are knife
attacks instead.

Gang shootings are down, that's because the shooter is often
identified, that information makes it back by word of mouth to
the rival gang, and the shooter and his family now become targets.
The crime is becoming rarer because the gangs are literally
running out of shooters. The gangs have attempted to reduce the
"transaction cost" by the increased anominity of the "Drive-By"
type shooting.

 In areas where concealed carry has been reinstituted, the
murder,rape and armed assault crime rates drop dramatically. The
best known case of this was in Miami, where the criminals began
targeting easily identifiable tourists (unarmed) rather than risk
confronting an armed citizen.

The answer to crime is a combination of early detection and
prevention, (education) and swift and serious punishment when
commited, i.e. a twenty year sentence with no chance of parole for
commiting a crime with a handgun. (raise the transaction cost to
appropriate levels)

I first noticed the South America/Africa fit when I was in grammar
school, and you are correct, the two were originally touching, in
fact all land was a single mass, we have named it Pangea. You are
incorrect in that there is only one way for this to be achieved.
(expansion of the earths circumference.)


South America/Africa are on two different plates (plate tectonics)
the area between them is known a a fault. The fault between these
two is in the bottom of the Atlantic now, it is known as the Mid-
Atlantic ridge, and is volcanically active. We know it is there
because of a variety of oceanographic data, and minisubs have have
visited and photographed it.

Magma from the Earths core rises at this point pushing the opposing
plates apart. You might be interested in how this was confirmed. As
the rising magma cools the iron particles in it align themselves
with the earths magnetic field, and are trapped in that orientation
when it solidifies. As you know the Earths magnetic field reverses
from time to time (10s of thousands of years) so the orientation of
the particles changes. This creates bands of particles over time.

                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-       -+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        South America |||||||||||||| ridge |||||||||||||| Africa
                      -+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-
 
When the magnetic bands in the sea floor were checked, they formed
mirror images on either side of the Mid-Atlantic ridge!

When two plates collide they can raise up (forming mountains) or
one is pushed below the other (subduction). The area off Japan is
a huge subduction zone leading to frequent earthquakes (seismometer
needles in Japan are always moving) and increased volcanic activity
as the subducted plate, now headed for the earths core, melts.

Check your local PBS station for a series called "Planet Earth",
they do a much better job of explaining it than I do.  ;)

I think he meant that, if a star has a Dyson sphere around it, you
can't see the star in visible light (== higher frequency than
infrared).  In fact, you can't see the star at all.  You can only see
the infrared light that the Dyson sphere emits.

As an aside about the "allowing external posters" thread: I'm not

respond to posts that way.  If you only allowed posts by approved

Perhaps there should be a list of "allowed posters", separate from

Seconded.  This is as spam-free a list as any on the Net; no need to
fool with a good thing.  I've found it useful, in fact, to post from
an address other than the one I gave to the list: since I can identify
the address to which spam is sent, I know that anything sent to that
address in bulk was sent to addresses harvested from postings, and is
not legitimate list traffic.  I've successfully had one bulk mailer
booted from his ISP because of that.

A perfectly compressed signal is indistinguishable from noise.  Any
deviation from noise would be an opportunity for further compression.  The
thermodynamic and information-theoretic definitions of 'entropy' coincide
to the extent that black-body radiation and a signal that is maximally
compressed look exactly the same.  Indeed, I think the term 'entropy' was
coined in the information-theoretic sense for exactly this reason.

Okay, I think I'm getting this Libertarian stuff.  "Violence ethical only when used to defend

personal liberties" - check.  "Digital cash and other new technologies make it difficult for

traditional governments to control the currency of power" - check.


Thanks for everyone who's contributed to my understanding.  I've still got a few devil's

advocate caveats I'm happy to be talked out of:


1. I agree that the still-burgeoning, information-based economy is fostering the profitability

of libertarian-style models.  But I suspect that (a) the cost/benefit ratio of dominating

others will always be more attractive than self-suffiency to a minority of persons willing to

use coercion, (b) most people will succumb to governance over self-rule (if handled correctly),

 and (c) the greater the % of population willing to be governed, the more difficult it is for

those who do not wish to be governed to retain autonomy.


Therefore, I submit that although libertarianism will advance to a degree, it will never fully

replace current systems of government.


2. Hypothetically, if coercive government did disappear completely, wouldn't power-mongers just

switch their mechanism from coercion to persuasion?  John Clark noted that Germans probably

wouldn't have attempted genocide against the Jews en masse without the Nazi military machine.

But would a Nazi propoganda machine have been equally effective?  It's my understanding

that a large percentage of the American population believe that welfare recipients are

responsible for much of the country's ills, but have no idea that USA spends 150 billion/year

on corporate welfare.  Isn't that governance by persuasion rather than coercion?  And although

I'd like to believe that the only factor influencing the market value of my work is the work

itself, I'm fully aware that public perception of my race, gender, sexual preference, education,

etc., are extremely influential.  If any body can control the factors that set the prices for

my work, does it really matter that they use persuasion rather than coercion?  Is it only 

an ethical victory, or is there something I'm not seeing?


What's the libertarian position on this?  That population control through media, while sometimes

unfortunate, is not unethical?

For extropians participating in a local EIGs (Extropy Investment Group) or
investment discussions on the list, I have to say, today was a hair-pulling
day.  Not because it wasn't evident that the stocks were plummeting, but
because I was making trades just when it was announced:

"NEW YORK -- Given the orderly pace of things, no one is calling it Black
Monday yet. But the dramatic decline in Wall Street so far today has caught
everyone's attention -- especially after the New York Stock Exchange put the
brakes on all trading at midafternoon."

It was midafternoon when I tried retouching that dial to put a hold on a
trade.  I thought it might be better to get up at the crack of dawn and see
what the numbers are tomorrow morning.  It is quite a heart-beat when the
lines are busy and the clock is ticking and you don't know whether the trade
has confirmed or not.

It is said that stock is a thrill - a roller coaster ride at times like
this.  I surely felt it today.  

Thanks to James Rogers and Peter Voss for giving solid investment advice
during this vulnerable time:  "Now is a good time to invest."

Countries like Canada and Britain save so much money partially because

the cash cow of privatized health care in the US finances the lion's share of

development of new pharmaceuticals and techniques, which then benefit

public health care systems worldwide.


I read an article a year or three ago that asserted that wealthy Canadians

were happy to use public health care for MOST things, but that when they

needed a cutting-edge technique, or an especially skilled surgeon, they quite

commonly flew down to America and paid cash. 


In general, health care you pay for is better than health care through the

state.  Even the current near-equivilance of quality of care between countries

like Canada and the US is only possible because the R&D burden is unevenly

carried by the US.  If all health care systems were public, the quality

of healthcare worldwide would decrease.

No, the density difference is small.

No, it's true; but we can make such temperatures only amidst explosions and 
that's a poor simulation of the core.

Oh, I knew I would regret that comment.  There's nothing mystical about the
core according to this theory; it's just a big electromagnet made of a
material
absent at the surface of the earth but quite mundane in the core.

I'm on a slippery slope. Unbounding the Future is distinctly popular. 
EoC is popular too, but it is so damn brilliant that it is impossible

I will have a think about that. What I think I want to avoid is 
linking to anything I find interesting. There are already a number of 
excellent transhumanist sites with hundreds of links (e.g. Ander's 
and Mitch's). But some people when they come to a site might rather 
want five or ten limks that lead to really good central texts. If 
they want a more exhaustive bibliography they can use AltaVista.

I'm not much of an investor, but my sense is that this correction will
go on for many months.  The market has been quite high by historical
standards.  The high valuation can really only be sustained by a bullish
investor psychology, where people are buying in expectation of rapid
price increases rather than for future value.  Even though the proximate
cause of the drop is Asian financial instability, the real reason is
this change in psychology.  Everyone's been nervously waiting for the
market to peak, and when they see it, they want to get out.

This price shock will probably change the average motivation from greed
to fear.  If the market doesn't bounce back fairly quickly, investors
will realize that it is no longer a sure thing, and they will want to
protect the profits they have made so far.  They will do so by selling,
which will further drive down prices.

One interesting difference from the 1987 crash is the use of trading
halts.  This was a controversial measure put into place after that crash.
The idea is that the crash is motivated by irrational panic, and that by
halting trading for a while, reason will return.  It's an unusual theory
because it is based on the assumption that investors are irrational,
which is contrary to the assumptions generally used in analyzing markets.

A lot of people opposed these holds because they depart from the idea of
a free and efficient market, and they seem like attempts to legislate
away the natural process of fluctuating prices.  But in the aftermath of
the 87 crash people felt like they had to do something.

Today, the market fell about 200 points, and so they put in a 30
minute hold.  As soon as the hold was lifted it fell even faster.
People said it almost seemed like the hold just gave people time to get
more sell orders in.  Finally, the market was shut down 45 minutes early.
Otherwise the drop, a record in terms of points lost in one day, would
have been even worse.

It could be that these holds and shutdowns may make the psychological
factors even worse.  If the market is falling, at least you can assume
that at any given moment the valuation approximately reflects people's
views.  Actually, of course, during a rapid drop like today the market
may lag behind, but generally at the end of the day you can expect that
the next day could see some improvement.  But when you know that the only
reason the market didn't fall more was because of an artificial hold,
you can be practically certain that this will generate more pent-up
selling pressure.  The holds end up increasing fear and uncertainty
because you no longer can assume that the market is clearing and
reflecting people's opinions.

I don't think now is a good time to buy.  Although recent drops have
been followed by quick recoveries, I don't think that will be the case
this time.  It should be possible to get a much better deal in a few
months, although by then the psychology will have turned so that no one
will be very excited in stocks at that time (which is itself a time to
start buying).

Ah, but if the signal is maximally compressed, the signal can't be
self-clocking. To recover the signal at the other end, you'd have to have
a perfect clock and/or never miss a bit. Nicht wahr?

Now, the redundancy could be *vanishingly small*, just as you can approach
c; and I agree with the limiting case--I just don't think it's a robust
architecture. So it's a question on both ends: just how godlike are these
hypothetical beings, and what purpose would they have in implementing the
limiting case?

 Some do, some don't. It's an open list, not a closed club. Consequently
 the SNRR is kind of, umm, well, mediocre or worse at times. Some good
 people get dragged into time-wasting arguments around here. Consequently
 *they* aren't perceived to be shining at their true luminosity, either.

Isn't this the same requirement for the previously proposed FTL
communication, that you'd need the key already on the other end to be
able to tell what the noise means in the first place?

Also: If the clock is being referenced to say, a pulsar that all can
observe, then such a compression scheme is possible for widespread use,
eh?

Here are some arguments: 

1) The Canadian health care system averages 40% cheaper than private
health care in the US because a) private health care coverage is taxable
income here in the US b) Canadians fix prices below market demand
levels, thus putting ceilings on the earning abilities of doctors to
earn market rates and c) the most high cost health services in Canada
are highly restricted and rationed, far more than is rational, which is
basically meant to force people to go to the US to have procedures done.
The Canadian claims of 40% do not factor in this externalized cost. If
they did, they would be much closer to US rates. Also, d) tort laws here
in the US encourage excess consuption of health care services merely to
rack up bills to influence liability awards by juries, and to inflate
the costs of malpractice insurance here as opposed to Canadian
malpractice rates.

You will notice that none of these factors has anything to do with the
actual cost of goods and services, just with the various ways in which
governments pass laws that manipulate the market.

The Canadian practice of externalizing high cost health care procedures
is very similar to the way in which private companies are encouraged by
tax law and the weak state of civil law (as remedy) to externalize costs
with regard to pollution and education. If businesses actually had to
pay for the costs of education of the workforce and the cost of
pollution (or elimination of same), we would see corporations become
mini-socialist governments in effect, while workers could pick and
choose which corps to trade goods and services with.

The liberal claims that pollution control is a public good only
government can provide is highly specious, since it was government that
originally ruled that corporations were free to pollute in ways harmful
to the property of others because of the positive economic public good
industrial development provided (i.e. tax dollars in politicians
pockets, politicians who appointed judges). Unrestrained pollution is an
effect of government mercantilism, not the market.

You'll notice that the largest and most effective penalties against
corporations that pollute are civil actions, not government fines, and
that the most effective environmental regulations passed in the last 30
years were those that aided private citizens in pursuing civil actions
against polluters. You'll also notice that the worst environmental
disasters and general environmental degradation happen under
monopolistic governments, like the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China,
etc. Contrary to popular opinion, the US currently has among the highest
environmental quality of any developed or developing nation.

coercion is more cost effective for short term profit taking, but
negative for long term profit taking in an economy of informed
consumers. If someone gets the word out that company A, individual B or
PPL C is a completely crooked nogoodnik, the negative PR will in the
long run, if the coercion continues toward enough people, become a "bad
thing" for the profitability of A, B, or C. Any libertarian system
requires a certain level of communication freedom to allow the market to
receive and transmit accurate signals, as well as a minimum percentage
of participants having a concious idea of the difference between their
perceived self interest and their real rational long term self interest
(which can often be rather counter-intuitive), basically the market has
to have a minimum level of average intelligence. As intelligence
amplification occurs over time with the singularity, the point of
economic equilibrium will drift toward libertarianism.

Self governance is avoided by most people because it currently is too
labor intensive, as compared to the alternative services currently
offered by state organizations. With the development of technologies
that make self governance less labor intensive, or that increase
individual productivity, giving them more time to devote to self
governance, people will tend to demand more and more self governance.
Those state organizations which fail to meet this market demand will be
revolted against, voted out of office, or disbanded.

If a government is nothing more than a propaganda machine, then it in
effect is little more than a tourist attraction. I would not call Nazi
Germany a particularly attractive tourist attraction, though I imagine
the spa set would probably feel right at home... ;)

When a corporation is told by a government that it is only going to
confiscate half of what the government thinks it owes, then that is
merely a reduction in government theft, not an increase in welfare for
the corporation. Whose money is it anyways? The corporation earned it. 
Welfare is when a group or individual gets more back from the government
than it puts in in taxes, not when the amount of government confiscation
is merely reduced. You've bought into one of the Great Lies of liberal
governance.

The vast majority of our present total federal debt is, in fact, due to
increases in domestic spending, mostly in entitlement growth. Liberals
would have you beleive that the $6 trillion was all spent on defense.
Since $5 trillion of that was racked up between 1980 and the present
day, that means that we must have been spending almost $300 billion
every year since that time on defense. SInce the real numbers show that
this is not the case, that the only time the defense budget was as high
as that was in 1985, and that since then the defense budget has
decreased by half, while the entitlement budget has tripled, that
entitlements are responsible for a greater share of government debt.

Well, as a single white straight male veteran with no dependents, I
can't collect welfare, unemployment, get vocational rehabilitation, win
a suit an employer for wrongful dismissal, or even collect on the
veterans benefits I worked for unless I figure out some con to become
part of a group that has been wronged in some way.

Last year between jobs I tried everywhich way to get any kind of
benefits, just for experiments sake. In the 14 years I've been in the
workforce, I estimate I've contributed around $50,000 to the system yet
have not received one penny back in a direct payment. Now, I wouldn't
mind it if I could specify what services I wanted and what I didn't. I
could specify all of my taxes go to defense and into government debt,
and I wouldn't mind at all not getting anything back but those two
services. But the claims that all of these taxes are for services I am
entitled to when I've found that they always have a loophole to exclude
me tells me that the government is the biggest bigot of all.

When I tried to leave out all data pertaining to my race, gender, etc. I
was told that I couln't receive benefits if I didn't give that
information, yet I can easily get by in a job application without such
info.

If you are willing to expose yourself to media, you get what you pay
for. On the other hand, you should be able to choose what sort of media
to can be exposed to. The Orwellian perpetual wallscreen is not my idea
of freedom of expression.

I've been saving for the past several months and had been expecting a
drop to occur sometime soon so I could get back into the market in the
aftermath. I'm interested in finding technology stocks that took rather
hard hits far in excess of rational expectations. I'm expecting such
issues to lead the market recovery or at least a bounce back, when it
occurs. If anyone has any info for me to pursue research on, it'd be
appreciated.

I think I see the misconception at work here; it is a common one.  

The Earth's gravity does not stop just 100 km up.  It goes out forever,
growing weaker with distance.  It declines as one divided by the square of
the distance from the center of the Earth. We call the gravity 1 g at the
surface (6400 km from center) so at 100 km altitude (6500 km from center),
it is still .97 g (this is (6400/6500)^2).  You could probably not even
notice the difference in gravity if you stood on a 100 km high platform.

What keeps satellites in orbit is not that they are beyond the reach of
gravity, but that they are going sideways very fast.  Like anything thrown
sideways, their path bends downwards as they begin to fall.  However, they
are going so fast that after they have fallen 1 km, the earth below them
has receded more than 1 km becuse of its curvature.  So they keep falling
toward the Earth, but missing.

What I said in my original post is that it is much harder to get enough
sideways speed to get to orbit than merely to get to 100 km of height.

 Oh, I knew I would regret that comment.  There's nothing mystical about the
 core according to this theory; it's just a big electromagnet made of a
 material
 absent at the surface of the earth but quite mundane in the core.

Well, you did acknowledge its potential on the magnetic spectrum, isn't that
what I was suggesting?  Did I say anything mystical?  Now perhaps the
magnetic field is related to/or affected by the fact that it is a crystal and
not just a ball, and who's to say other fields arent affected as well?  The
electromagnetic field comes to mind.  Now something could be interpreted as
mystical due to the fact that the human brain is also an electromagnetic
field, but thats up to you.

Now yall, WHAT is wrong with this post? I dont see anything, except totally
legit questions and ideas.  Filter it if you want.

Hi Micheal
Remove from the 'onthestreet' stuff
not the extropy list, anyways
nevermind,....I seem to getting the same volume,...
The best way around the ssnr thingy I figure out
so far is to read the digest first, and then
focus on one or two topics of interest
Go thru the emails, and delete off the 'stuff'
that is irrevelant,...( if really pressed for
time , I delete all the emails altogether,... !! )
and then write some of my own after I've assimulated
some good rad stuff to be publish and then it seems
more worthwhile to pursue subsequent emails from my
original email,...make sense ?! :-}
As for overall white noise pink noise multicolored
maybe extropy should consider more stringent
registration like forms to filled out listing
detailed description of prospective logger-ons...
What dya think ? Let's keep in touch Okay,...
( Sorry, would have gotten this out earlier
but the network was done ?! )

This is different; I'm saying that even with the key already in place at
both ends, you need either perfect information through the channel (in
both time and frequency domains) or *some* redundancy/pattern, however
small; the latter permits you to resynchronize if that is needed.

Something *approximating* it, maybe. Another problem is that (I think) you
have to be able to _resolve_ time to the granularity of the symbol rate.
Methinks there's another engineering limit there. You'd have to know
your position and velocity relative to the pulsar in order to correct for
Lorentz-Fitzgerald effects; h-bar <uncertainty> = delta p x delta v,
right? I am not sure whether all these limits converge, but my gut and
vague memories say they do.

Now, if you have zero-lag action at a distance, then the pulsars could be
clocks for all the "smart" stars. Good luck--I'm not willing to say
it's utterly impossible; I just doubt it's a commonplace across the
universe, and I think the proposition is impossible to falsify, and more
of a bull session topic than something to take action regarding: "What if
there were infinitely powerful beings? Why' they could do... *anything*!"
Fun to yack about, but as unsatisfying as rock-wool candyfloss. IMHO. :)

Carl F. might have a more informed opinion; for sure he's got more math
than I.

Hi peoples especially Danny,
Yes I'm new,...and I didn't mean to 'tar' anyone
just wanted to know if there were more efficient 
ways to correspond ideas ( as agreed with Micheal
Butler ) , I'm not against any ideas, that's the 
whole point,...I mean, truth stated is a benefit
to all interested parties ( esp extropian ones )
and meaniful information,...of course, anyone
can argue what constitutes meaningful ; revelant
information, so earth/moon relationship
way to go,...
Everyone should draw conclusions to extropian ideals
and have these ideals been met, as a result of our
'corresponding' so improving the 'ssnr' is a valid
input...feedback anyone?
AlexTseng

im the one who posted it originally, my apologies,
are you new and didnt readit?  I was referring to a
picture i saw of the moon fit snugly inside a
triangle fit snuggly inside the earth, making a
perfect relationship, and so i turned my attention
towards this list for my 'research and homework'
after not receiving any replies from two separate
astronomers i emailed (still havent actually), but it
turned out to be false, pretty interesting if it were
true though dont you think?  Now the attention has
turned to when in the past this relationship could
have existed, since the earth has been expanding. 
We're actually talking about something I dont think
anyone else has talked about before, I think its
worthy of discussion. It would be nice to have that
date archived: when WAS the moon in that specific
relationship with the earth?  Maybe it doesnt mean
anything if it was, you could go on forever with
relationships between moons and their planets and
other moons and the sun, and im sure some interesting
things would come up, and perhaps they would have
some significance, so its good to try and find out.

I think the difference is like day and night. It's true that if a private 
company kept getting bigger and more powerful and if the competition kept 
getting smaller and weaker then eventually it would be fair to call it a 
government. I can't point to the exact point where this transition occurs, 
but I can't point to the exact point where day fades into night either.

Exactly.

I wish it was not necessary to work for a living, but wishing does not make

The problem is it has no competition.

That sounds very 18'th century-ish, times change. As an Extropian you know 
that even the old cliche about land, "they're not making any more of it" is  
not true. You should also note that the richest man in the world did not make 
his money from land but from information.            


        >Saying land is not important and that gov't is a big problem is        
        >incompatable, because it's simply the claim to the ownership of so         
        >much land that makes the gov't what it is.


It's incompatible only to those who say the government's claim is valid and 
I'm not one of those.
                

         >since the size of the land claim is the basis of the "evils" of         
         >gov't.


Land claims is not the problem, in the USA there is lots of land in private  
ownership that the government has never claimed ownership of. The problem is  
that there is no area of wealth, value, or life they don't claim the right to  
control and the fact that they usually have the muscle to back it up.
                          

        >I'm just countering 100% anarchy. Minarchy.


If it worked I wouldn't mind a small very limited government, but its been  
tried and it doesn't work because it refuses to stay small and limited.

Lots of people may not like them, but how could they kill the Jews if there

I'm very interested in anti-gravity technology which repels mass to achieve
lift. If two AG vehicles neared each other, wouldn't their two fields repel
away like opposing magnets? And without sounding too Star Trek, would it be
possible to have an inverse field on the inside neutralizing inertia so
that you'd never get tossed about... I imagine it being like a video game.
You'd be still inside the vehicle, but the whole time your experience would
be unaturally stable. Perhaps that would allow us to be better, safer
piolets. Now, I have no idea what kind of power supply would be needed to
energize such a device.. but it is certainly fun to dream about it.

Another interesting point of interest to me is oraganic life. If you are
traveling near the ground and a dog, squirl, insect or other life form gets
underneath your field, does it get crushed? Perhaps the vehicle could have
a sensor which would bend the field around animals. Gosh, a portable
version of this field generator would make an impressive anti-attack shield
for handicaped or those unable to protect themselves in dangerous
situations?

The mind reels.

I'm still interested in anyones opinions on anti-gravity. Has anyone seen
the CNN report on the Finish super-conductor researches who claim to have
generated a gravitational anomoly? Someone told me that they were
suspending a live chick in the field.

          One Europe, One Union, One Faith?
            Comments on the Persecution 
             of Scientologists in Europe
                    by Sean Gabb



Failures of the Debate on Europe

One of the great limitations on the debate over Europe at the moment is
that it is conducted almost entirely in terms of economics.  We are
told, for example, that closer integration means more regulation from
Brussels, and therefore fewer jobs, lower profits, and a general sinking
towards the European average from which we have so conspicuously
diverged.

Of course, these are true points.  A United States of Europe - or
anything corresponding to it - is not in British economic interests.
But this is not the end of the story.  There are other aspects of
European life which would be established in this country, and which
would be at least as alien and alarming to us as the Common Agricultural
Policy, the Single Currency, or all the other horrors so well described
by Christopher Booker in his Sunday Telegraph articles.


Persecution of the Scientologists

In particular, there is what we must regard as the odd attitude of the
German Government to religious non-conformity.  Today, several thousand
members of the Church of Scientology demonstrated in Berlin against what
they see as religious persecution by the German authorities.

They are not alone in believing themselves persecuted.  In January this
year, an advertisement appeared in the American newspaper press carrying
the signatures of various Hollywood celebrities.  There was Dustin
Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, Aaron Spelling, Oliver Stone, Mario Puzo, and Gore
Vidal among 34 others - none, to my knowledge, Scientologists or even
very religious.  What they had signed was an open letter to Helmut Kohl,
the German Chancellor, protesting at the behaviour of his Party and his
Government towards the Church of Scientology.  "In the Germany of the
1930s" they wrote, "Hitler made religious intolerance official
government policy.  In the 1930s, it was the Jews.  Today, it is the
Scientologists."  The authors continue - none, by the way is a
Scientologist - with a plea for Herr Kohl to "bring an end to this
shameful pattern of organised persecution".

Perhaps we can ignore celebrities.  So many of them embrace such bizarre
causes that none of them can be reliably trusted on any matter external
to their own careers.  However, their claims are supported by the State
Department in Washington.  In its annual survey of human rights around
the world, it lists Germany beside China, Cuba and Burma as a country in
which human rights were abused in 1996.  And the abused rights in
question were those of German Scientologists - people against whom there
was, according to the State Department, a "campaign of harassment and
intimidation".  The German Government has also been criticised in a
human rights report issued by a team of British scholars that includes
Dr Dennis O'Keeffe, a devout Catholic, and Professor Antony Flew, an
atheist and expert on David Hume.

I accept that comparisons with the holocaust are inappropriate.  People
have not yet been robbed of all they possess in Germany, nor stripped of
their citizenship, nor herded into slave camps, nor murdered on a vast
scale.  Even so, not all is well in Germany.  Look beneath the veneer of
tolerance, and German society has neither understanding of nor patience
with any but the established Catholic and Protestant churches.  To some
extent, Muslims and Buddhists are excluded from German national life, as
are adherents of many other new and minority religions.  But to be a
Scientologist seems to be worst of all.  To be one of these is to risk
all sorts of official and officially-sponsored discrimination.  In
Bavaria, for example, firms run by Scientologist have been barred from
tendering for public contracts.  Applicants for jobs in the public
sector must disclose their religious affiliation:  if that turns out to
be to the Church of Scientology, they are passed over.  The Church has
even been placed under surveillance by the Bavarian security services.

In the private sector, Scientologists are rejected by some banks when
they try to open accounts.  Scientologist-owned businesses have been
vandalised.  Individual Scientologists have received anonymous hate
mail.  Artists and performers known to be Scientologist have been
blacklisted.  Chick Corea, an American jazz pianist who is also a
Scientologist, had to cut short his tour in Germany last year, because
he was refused permission to play in certain venues.  The youth wing of
the Christian Social Union, the junior partner in the German Government,
picketed performances of the film Mission Impossible because its star,
Tom Cruise, is a well-known Scientologist.


Forcing People to be "Free"

What makes all this worse is the manner in which international
condemnation has been brushed aside.  When the Soviets filled their
lunatic asylums with dissidents, they at least had the humanity to be
ashamed.  The German Government is simply angry and astonished.  Herr
Kohl has dismissed the criticism with a sneering attack on the ignorance
of foreigners.  Bernd Protzner, the General Secretary of the Christian
Social Union, actually claims that "influential circles in the State
Department have obviously fallen for Scientology's hate campaign against
Germany and have let themselves be used by the sect."

Whatever their political background, prominent Germans make the same
defence of the anti-Scientology Kulturkampf.  The Constitution they gave
themselves after the War obliges them to protect democracy and human
rights.  No one familiar with George Orwell will be surprised that this
allows them to persecute any group officially deemed undemocratic.  It
is also justifies a strongly "positive" view of human rights.  According
to German Government spokesman Peter Hausmann, his country can be proud
of its human rights record.  It stands up well to any international
comparison.  "It is the obligation of all public bodies to protect the
human dignity of its citizens" he explained.  "That includes their
physical and mental safety".  Any Nazi or Marxist would be proud of so
clear a statement of the old "forcing people to be free" defence of
tyranny.


The Pan-European Taste for Persecution

If this were a purely German oddity, it might not say much against the
European project.  The problem is that the Germans are not alone in
their intolerance of religious dissent.  The Greek Government takes it
for granted that only communicants of the Orthodox Church can be real
Greeks:  All the others are potential traitors who need to be watched.
The French, for all they have canonised Voltaire as their patron saint
of tolerance, are little better.  "I share the apprehensions of the
Germans regarding these sects" their Foreign Minister, Hervé de
Charette, said recently.  He went out of his way to denounce the
Hollywood open letter, and to express his government's full support of
Germany in its war against Scientology.

Now, Scientology is seen by many as a strange kind of religion.
Outsiders do tend to regard its theological claims as unlikely.  Then
again, most religions seem strange to outsiders; and I do not find the
stories about Thetans and Engrams any more inherently unlikely that I do
stories about the parting of the Red Sea or the Resurrection of Christ.
Indeed, what Scientologist theology I have read makes rather more sense
to me than the Athanasian Creed.  But questions of religious truth or
falsehood are not the point.  The point is that everyone ought to have
the right to worship as their conscience demands.  It is not for
governments or anyone else to pick and choose among religions,
tolerating some but not others.  It is the duty of government to provide
an impartial framework of laws within which life, liberty and property
are respected.


British Freedom

Even here in Britain, there are calls for persecution.  In The Evening
Standard for last Thursday (23rd October 1997), there is a story on the
front page - "Action call on London 'Christ' cult' - about how some
Labour MP wants an official investigation into a religious movement
called the London Church of Christ.  Its offence, apparently, is that it
recruits adults and persuades them to stop going out to night clubs, in
favour of studying The Bible and recruiting others to do likewise.

To its credit, persecution has so far been the policy of the British
Government in religious matters.  The Home Office recently accepted
Scientology leaders as ministers of religion for immigration purposes.
Inform, its approved consultant on new religious movements, has advised
the Independent Television Commission to accept Scientologist public
awareness films for showing on British television.  The Church of
Scientology has applied for charitable status.  Whether or not this is
granted, we can be sure that the Charities Commission will base its
decision on objective criteria, and not on public or official hysteria.
For the moment, we remain what we have long been - one of the great
world centres of religious liberty.

To what extent would this change if our Maastricht opt-outs were
replaced by a complete acceptance of European social policy?  Would our
churches also have to be registered with the authorities, as in much of
Europe?  Would some be favoured with grants and public acceptance?
Would others be rejected and even persecuted under cover of concern
about the public good?  Looking at the balance of Continental opinion,
the answer at the moment seems to be yes:  our traditions of religious
liberty would go the way of our ancient weights and measures, harmonised
out of existence.

Important as they are, the debate over Europe is about more than
economics.  It is also about different views of the world.  Ours, on the
whole, is the right view.  For myself, it is not a view I would
surrender or endanger even if the economic arguments all pointed us
towards closer integration.


Afterword

It ought not be necessary for me to go on and say more.  However, the
usual statist response to criticism is to throw doubt on the critic's
motives.  Logically, it is of no importance why I have written the
above.  But a regard for logic has never been part of the statist
intellectual armoury.  I therefore add the following disclaimers in
advance:

1.  I have not been paid to write this article.

2.  I am not, nor ever have been, a member of the Church of Scientology.

If anyone cares to reply, let it be on the substantive issues raised
above.

I'll just cut to the point, this movie was a smart way to introduce a

Hmmm, perhaps I've been thinking about this wrong.. What about simple
differences between the rates of typical human growth. For instance, I'm
6'5" and was almost six feet before age 11. My girlfriend (ironically) is
about 5'3 and can still wear the same clothes that she wore at age 11.

Are there measurable hormonal levels or other factors which can be
atributed to say, my accelerated growth? Since we were originally
discussing how we could grow human body parts to adult size in a short
period, could we then just manipulate the chemical relationships which
naturally exist in the body to encourage a hyper-growth state???

whos to say really.. sounds to me like they were trying to show (during the
short duration of the film) that the being was indeed growing and learning
what it needed to evolve. Remember that even us primitive humans are mere
barbarians who will possibly learn someday the pursuit of
intellectual/emotional fulfilment is more important than killing and hating
eachother.


Even though this film had more than one hole in it, I found it a great
flick. I only wish there were more like it. I just purchased another

Quite possibly the most violent animation I've ever seen, but pretty cool

The human growth hormone system is relatively well understood. The
hypothalamus sends GHRF (Growth Hormone Release-Factor) and
Somatostatin (growth hormone inhibiting factor) to the anterior
pituitary (there might be some other chemicals involved here too). The
pituitary gland releases GH, growth hormone (somatropin) which
stimulates growth of various tissues in conjunction with hormones
secreted by the thyroid, the gonads and adrenal cortex. 

It stimulates the productions of several polypeptides called
somatomedins from the liver, which are apparently responsible for most
of the anabolic effects (there are known receptors for somatomedins on
liver cells, fat cells and cartilage cells). 

GH stimulates protein synthesis and the uptake of amino acids
especially in skeletal muscles, while the somatomedins appear to also
act on the muscles and the cartilage at the epiphyses of long bones,
thus influencing bone growth. These hormones have complex effects on
the carbohydrate metabolism, and act together with glucocorticoids to
cause lipolysis (i.e. the decrease of body fat).

I guess that there are a lot of factors here that could lead to fast
growth and a large adult size, both external factors like diet and
internal factors like the amounts of hormones secreted, how strongly
they affect different cells, the "development program" which
determines the hormonal changes during childhood and puberty and
various obscure interactions with other hormone systems. A lot of this
is likely genetic, if you have (say) genes for more efficient
somatomedin receptors a similar amount of hormones will make you grow
more than another person with normal or less efficient receptors (the
balance of hormones is dynamic, so just increasing the amount of
hormones doesn't necessarily increase the effect, since there are
negative feedback loops in the system).

As I have already pointed out, it is unlikely that we could get "hyper
growth" (i.e. growth orders of magnitude faster than normal
development), at least in differentiated tissue. Growing huge amounts
of (say) skin cells or undifferentiated neurons, no problem, but if
you want a functional kidney you need some very elaborate
differentiation to occur which cannot be speeded much since it depends
on the diffusion coefficiencts of various chemicals. But it seems
reasonable to get faster growth by manipulating the hormone levels in
cultured tissues or in people, it is just that it won't be any
miracles.

The honest answer is that we do not have antigravity technology, that
it doesn't appear feasible in any useful way* given the known laws of
physics, and that at present it doesn't appear on the horizon even of
theoretical applied science. That may of course change, but it isn't
something to bet much on (are there an idea future for antigrav?).


* Robert Forward has done a lot of work on suggesting fun ways of
making antigravity of various kinds using the known laws of
physics. They likely work, but do not appear worth the trouble. See
his book _Indistinguishable from Magic_.

I think you are mistaking the German view.
It's true that there is much intolerance regarding foreign religions in the
German public and I'm not glad about this at all.
But the point why the government fights the "church" of Scientology is not
what the scientologists believe but what they do.
Their intention appears not to be religion but commerce and suppression and
exploitation of their members. So there are voices who demand not to consider
them a church but sort of company.
Religion is free in Germany, but a religious community has to keep to German
laws, that's all.
If the Scientologists' aim is to take over control of the whole world, this
is against German constitution.
I do not try to defend the German government as I myself do not agree with
them in many points, just trying to explain.
And all this has really nothing to do with what happened here a long time
ago.

As you might expect, I would characterize the ultimate transhuman
very differently:  someone too engrossed in the joy and challenge of
becoming something new to be disturbed by others' opinions of what
ey is now.  Such a transhuman, trapped and tortured, would be unlikely
to find any offer made by such torturers the least bit tempting 
compared to eir vision of the future, and would find the concept of
sacrifice void, or laughable, and in any case too insignificant to 
acknowledge, much less to refuse (my "ultimate transhuman" is much
more into Yes than No).

Frankly, a couple of seconds thought should give you enough proof. When
was the last time you heard of a drive-by shooting by a tobacconist or
liquor store owner? When drugs are legal, drug dealers are too busy
collecting money from their customers to worry about shooting each
other.

Of course there are dangers: there was a drive-by shooting between
alcohol and tobacco smugglers in England earlier this year, as
thanks to the oppressive British taxes they can make tens of thousands
of dollars just by taking a van through the Channel Tunnel and bringing
it back loaded up with cheap alcohol and cigarettes from the 
Continent. So legal drugs with high taxes are still a problem; and
as a Canadian I'm sure you're aware of the level of cross-border
smuggling of legal drugs from the US into your country. From what
I hear that's not entirely violence-free either.

First big murder to hit the headlines in England after the handgun ban 
happened late one night just outside London; a driver apparently got
annoyed by the car in front and rammed it several times, finally 
pushing it across onto the other side of the highway, where it was hit
by a car coming the other way which killed everyone inside. Really lucky
they didn't have handguns, eh?

Yes, I read the paper about them with interest. But it isn't
antigravity, it is just magnetism overcoming gravity. Nothing
different from maglev trains or the executive toys with a magnet
floating in the air. The solenoid construction they used was
interesting, but obviously not useful for (say) making a antigravity
car.

Making things fly isn't that hard, we have everything from balloons to
jet engines to catapults to do it. Antigravity is something more
specific.

Congratulations, you have just rediscovered the beanstalk (aka orbital
tower) and the rotovator! 

Start with a satelite in geosynchronous orbit; it will orbit the earth
in 24 hours, which means that it will always stay over the same place
(that is the definition of the geosynchonous orbit). Suppose you
lowered a long string from it; it would obviously hang straight down,
over the same spot of surface all the time. This is the idea of a
beanstalk; you simply connect your satelite in geosynch orbit with the
ground by a strong cable, and add a counterweight cable with (say) a
tethered asteroid beyond ao that the whole system remains stable.  Of
course, the cable needs to be rather strong, but buckytubes seems to
be a real possibility.

The rotovator is a cable that rotates around the earth (its center of
mass is in a circular orbit) with a period of rotation that is a
rational multiple of its period of orbit; if implemented properly the
ends will drop down into the atmosphere almost vertically, slow down
to zero local velocity for a short while, and then move out again.

Ok. I see the problem. So you hardly save anything (fuel) by starting from
100 km. This means thus, that everything will automatically float/fall back
to earth.

Ok. If I'm correct we move approx. 2000 km per hour with the earth.
Is it possible, instead of making a cable on to a astroid, that we bring
up the contra weight ourselves ? I hope I can explain it a bit better.

Just imagine that the soda-straw-tower works.
The first part is held up by big balloons, until X-km, or if
this does not work, by some other pressure. At "some" point
the spinning (rotation of earth) from the weight "takes-over" ? 
If I look at your figures, maybe I think to small !

What height would be sufficient ? into orbit ? or can we do
with a smaller tower. I mean by sufficient, a height were we
could have a working-space, to build rockets an other things.
Is it hard to calculate at what perfect height, what perfect contra
weight is needed to keep up the tower, and allow an elevator trough?

If I look it the simple way: when I turn around with a cord, I only need
a very small weight at the end of it to keep the cord as a straight line.

The question above, is of cause without the winds !

Kennita: what I don't understand is, why when it's length is 
going up, the same has to be true for the diameter. Do you need
this for the strength? 
Also, what do you think of the "open"-structure.
Is that still not wind-proof :-)
I can't imagine the forces on the structure, but isn't there any
material today that could be woven to a "net", that can stand
these winds. Is it also a particular height, were these winds are
at top-speed. ?

What I find very hard to grasp. Is were the Air is so light, you/things
are weightless, is this gradually building up from the surface of the 
earth, or are you at some magical point weightless ?
I know this last one can't be the case, but picturing it :-)

It's a bit double, when I think you/things have enough height,
I forget about the gravity, and when I think of escaping gravity, I think
to easily that your in space (so, you are weightless) and therefor
nothing is pulling you back. Which as I start to learn isn't so.
I try to project visual (in my head) all the different influences on the
tower, to
understand how it works up there.

Thanks again for all the help, I guess these contributions are not
really what a lot of you are looking for in this list. But being new
to extropy/transhumanism and with an average understanding of
science, it's hard for newbies to get a grip at this movement.
Maybe you should think of an entry-test :-)

Similar in Britain; I remember seeing several campaigns to raise
money so children who couldn't get treatment there could fly to
America for it. The only way that the British government can
continue to fund the NHS is by keeping wages very low compared to other
countries (which is why British nurses often go to work for private
hospitals in America), restricting use by older people (and lately
they've been limiting access to some treatments for smokers), running
down the infrastructure and increasing waiting time for operations. 

In Britain, if you're over 70 and need a non-essential operation,
odds are high that you won't get it from the NHS; if you do, you'll
probably have to wait a year or two. How many Americans would put up
with that kind of treatment, when with private healthcare they could
have the operation in a few weeks, if not tomorrow?

Of course a very large part of the cost of health-care is set by the
licensing restrictions which limit the availability of medical staff.
I don't know how those compare between the countries in question. A
further issue is how long you try to keep people alive; I strongly
suspect that US private hospitals would continue life-support well
beyond the point when the NHS would pull the plug. That isn't cheap.

Actually, if you're using a rocket that's not true. You save a 
significant amount, both because you get above most of the air,
which eats up a large fraction of a rocket's fuel in drag, and
because you can use vacuum nozzles, which are several percent
more economical than sea-level nozzles. This (lifting the rocket
to 80,000 feet with zero velocity) was the approach that Kistler
Aerospace planned to use for their first 'SSTO' before they 
switched to more traditional designs.

However, the fact remains that you're at most 25% of the way to
orbit. I have, though, read theoretical designs which launched
the payload vertically to a couple of hundred kilometers, then
'slowed it' into an orbiting space station using a mass-driver.
Sadly, building such a station would probably be almost as hard
as building a beanstalk, as the mass-driver had to be hundreds
of kilometers in length.

I've been off the list for a couple of months while I finished a project.
It's nice to be back.

Life magazine recently published a "millenium special issue", reviewing the
events of the past millenium in the picture-laden non-intellectual way for
which they have become famous.  The last page of the magazine contains a
1500-word essay speculating on the events of the next millenium.  Its main
topic is the imminent arrival of superintelligence and the resulting
displacement of the unmodified human from the position of Top Creature.
Isn't it neat how Extropian memes are reaching the great American public,
even if in fairly dilute form?  Among those quoted in the article are Paul
Horn, the senior VP of research at IBM, Vernor Vinge, who first publicised
the Singularity, and myself, whose cousin wrote the article.  

My cousin, Chuck Hirshberg, called me first, because he knew I was into
"that future stuff".  I hit him with, in rapid succession, the Singularity,
nanotech, and the technological modification of human nature.  He would
have liked to include the last two in his article, but there wasn't room,
and they were relatively less spectacular.

My cousin called Horn as a reality check, to make sure this Singularity
thing wasn't just some wacky thing I dreamed up.  According to my cousin,
Horn basically agreed with me.  I was fairly surprised that Horn was so
receptive to the concept.  He is in a position of some authority, and I
would have thought the establishment more resistant to notions that might
so thoroughly dis-establish it.

Authorities doesn't *have* to always attack new ideas, even if that
has become "folk wisdom" by now. It seems that as long as the threat
to the establishment is not "real" in the sense that it exists in the
physical world rather in potentia, it is not perceived as a threat and
can be studied fairly objectively, but when it becomes a present
threat all resources are arrayed against it.

This is a form of short-sightedness that seems to appear in most large
institutions, and which IMHO will almost guarantee that most of the
current institutions will not survive the first decades of the next
century.

Isn't it even simpler than that?  If we're talking about FTL communication
here, then by definition the message is received outside the light cone
of the pulsar with respect to the sender, and "simultaneity" is undefined
and can't be used to clock the signal.

A single iron crystal has been considered as an explanation for a few types
of anisotropy measured in the core.

While a single, huge iron crystal may sound incredible, it is actually
fairly plausible.  Most substances exhibit allotropes and crystal
restructuring that only occur under extremes of heat and pressure, and most
of which are unstable under "normal" conditions (diamond is an example).
Iron at ordinary pressures changes its crystalline structure back and forth
between FCC and BCC depending on the temperature.  I would imagine that
center of earth conditions could be replicated in the laboratory to verify
if iron undergoes any type of interesting organizational change under those
conditions.  I might add that the high temp/pressure conditions expected in
the core are ideal for large metal crystal formation, as there is enough
energy to lubricate the reorganization of the atoms and enough pressure to
control their organization.

A couple of observations.  First, I am seeing more and more transhuman and
extropic ideas discussed in the popular media and popping up in odd places.
 As I've mentioned a few times, it seems that Forbes magazine's editorial
staff has some not-so-closet extropians on it.  And, as an example of the
latter phenomenon, just the other day in a meeting, a 50-ish lawyer said to
me that he wished he had a computer connected to the net all the time he
could carry in his pocket and view through his glasses.  This fellow was not
particularly "advanced" in his thinking otherwise -- in fact, I would call
him a decided "good old boy" in his cultural mein.  One of my young
associates looked across the room at me with raised eyebrows when the older
lawyer said this, as if to say "Man, this crazy stuff you've been talking
about might be right, after all!"  These sorts of isolated events have a way
of adding up to something more than just quantitative change at a certain
point.

Second, Anders' point about how the "establishment" reacts to
paradigm-challenging matters made me think of something I read this morning
in "The Passions of the Western Mind."  Apparently the idea that the Church
was immediately and adamantly opposed to the heliocentric theory is actually
a simplistic generalization.  In fact, Copernicus was a respected adviser to
the papacy, his work was patronized by leading clerics throughout his life
and the text of his book was part of the curriculum in some church
institutions.  It was only when heliocentrism became identified with a
broader front of challenge to the church that folks got burned at the stake
for it.  Perhaps there's a lesson there for those who would engage in
guerilla memetics . . .

 There has been discussion of optimal lifestyles for longevity.
I put forth these views for examination. 
Exercise basic functions( walking, eating, breathing, etc.).
Feed intravenously.
Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.
Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).
Do not move anything that will not save your life.
Movement means free-radicals.
Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free radicals.
Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill yourself.
This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.

Tell me if anyone knows how this view could be bad,
excluding the arguments of 
1) Willpower requirements.
2) Missed opportunities due to confinment to reclining wheelchair and IV.

Most foods and vitamins/nutrients, etc. must go throught the
digestive system and the liver to be assimulated properly. You
cannot get a complete enough diet by parenteral feeding. It is
a dangerous and impossible long term practice and would be
extremely foolish to initiate voluntarily. 

>Keep high oxygen saturation to reduce work by heart and diaphram.

Your oxygen saturation is already as high as you can possibly use.
On the contrary, if anything you may want to *reduce* the amount
of oxygen intake (as long as all areas of the tissues are equally
supplied) and the subsequent amount of free radicals generated.
I have often wondered if people who live their lives at moderately
high altitudes may have increase longevity.

>Do not die from muscle degeneration( heart, diaphram).

A laudable goal, but how do you implement it without exercise?

>Do not move anything that will not save your life.

This is probably inconsistent with the previous one unless, you
make sure to continuously surrround yourself with precariously
balanced boxes which might at any time fall on you :-) 

>Movement means free-radicals.

So does eating, breathing and being alive. Free-radicals are both
harmful and necessary for life at the same time. It's where they
are formed and how they are dealt with that is important.

>Free-radicals can kill, they are bad, do not cause excess free radicals.

In the right places and at the right times, they are part of the
metabolic processes of life.

>Causing excess free-radicals is self detructive, do not kill yourself.

A much too simplistic view.

>This could lower calorie intake and body temperature dramatically.

Maybe. But it is also going to kill you quite quickly for other reasons.

>Tell me if anyone knows how this view could be bad,

For the reasons stated above (and many others), its very bad
excluding the negatives below (and many others).

>excluding the arguments of

>2) Missed opportunities due to confinment to reclining wheelchair and IV.

How were you intending to do the basic exercise functions (walking, and
breathing 'fully') you listed if you are confined to a wheelchair.

There are a couple of very good science fiction novels on the subject of
the "beanstalk". The beanstalk is attached to earth at one end and to a
satellite beyond geosynchronous orbit at the other. Since the satellite
beanstalk is trying to pull the satellite at faster than its free
orbital
speed, the satellite exerts a upward force on the beanstalk, keeping the
thing upright.
  The best-known of the books is probably
      the Fountains of Paradise
      Arthur C. Clarke
       (c) 1978, ISBN 0-345-25356-6
Another book was written by another author at about the same time. It
used a different construction technique. I cannot remember the name,
though.

 nothing is pulling you back. Which as I start to learn isn't so.

 tower, to
 understand how it works up there.

If you want a stronger structure, you either build it out of stronger
material or, if you have no stronger material (available at an acceptable
price), you build it thicker.  Do you think people building multi-story 
parking lots would take up valuable parking space with those big fat
pillars otherwise?  And would suspension bridges use big fat cables 
instead of slender ones?

An open structure would probably help, because you can often get just
as much strength with less material by arranging it in an open lattice
(the Eiffel Tower is an example, as are geodesic domes).

I don't know about the top-speed height, but remember that the air
gets thinner higher up, so even if the winds are faster there may be
fewer molecules trying to push your structure over.  I'm not sure the
analogy is exact (I'm sure I'll be told), but I'd imagine (say)
that rain gets going pretty fast by the time it falls a thousand feet 
or so, but half an hour's worth doesn't push on you nearly as hard as 
one large bucket of water tossed on you from a few feet away in one
second (she says, remembering her last white-water rafting trip).

Hope this helps,
Kennita

 Declines that last months generally require triggers such as rising
real interest rates, a recession, or a war. This is especially true
after a long bull market. I haven't seen anything that would cause a
sustained change in U.S. investor psychology.

 The assumption of irrationality is probably the main motivation behind
trading halts, but I can think of an alternative.
 Many of the people selling at the bottom are using a very simple rule
(they no longer have enough equity to back their margin debt), and
brokers tend to give high priority to alerting investors to this.
 On the other hand, people buying because stocks have become cheap
want to compare a number of stocks to find the ones most underpriced,
and the communications needed to alert them that stocks have suddenly
become cheap can easily be slower.

>It could be that these holds and shutdowns may make the psychological

 Another way that trading halts can accelerate declines is that people
who think they may be forced to sell to cover margin debts feel greater
urgency if they expect they won't be able to sell if they wait.

 People who have invested a lot of training in their current skills

 I'll be there, and will probably be demoing an enhanced version of

as part of the Mediator/LinkMap demo on Thursday Nov 6 at 9 pm (you
don't need to register for the conference to attend this demo).

Hi peoples 
1 ) I was wondering about buckyballs as the material
needed for a mega-engineering project like a beanstalk
2 ) Is it possible to first put a series of
geostationary spacestations/spacefactories that
produce buckyballs and 
3) related materials/pre-fab/self-replicating
processes ( maybe we can expand on this
self-replication stuff, I see it as inevitable
progress if we are to do beanstalks; dyson spheres
and roaming intelligent asteriods with artifically
engineered trees ... I think Dyson expounded on this
as well !! ) 
4) With all the materials; manpower and resources in
Space then we build down...right?!
5) Is there other materials other than buckyballs
which is just as good for the job ?! 
6) What about nano-technology producing a
super-conductor that works at high temperatures, does
this provide the energy supply infrastructure needed
for mega-engineering ?
7) So we really serious about this mega-engineering
stuff ? ( I see it as the push its going to give to
technology , of course if other factors like Doomsday
and Tower of Babel occurrences can be filtered out of
our history !? This push/leap in technology is what
this extropian paradigm is all about ! )
8) SO WE'RE GOING FOR IT ?!  ANYONE GOING TO SHOOT US
DOWN ... WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET FUNDING FOR THIS
MEGA-STUFF...( i know i'm cramping in a lot of stuff
in here , i just want to put us in a 'constructive'
direction )
9) Great, thanks for your kind attention
10) Great resources and web-pages, guys,
out of this world,...!!!

Very true. And since this is a fairly large group in our societies,
they will be a significant roadblock to many of our more radical
projects. I have no doubt they will fail in the long run, but that
breakthrough is likely to hurt a lot of people, both due to the strong
reactions and due to the quick change.

I'm not sure, and I'm not a geologist, astrophysicist or even a
physicist, but I would argue it is unlikely. The core is believed to
contain not just nickel-iron, but other heavy elements. This suggests
to me that the core cannot form a nice crystal lattice, and likely has
an amorphous structure. But a lot likely depends on the behavior of
this mixture at high pressures and temperatures; things can get rather
counterintuitive down there, so I wouldn't be totally surprised if it
occured.

Is there a geologist in the house? :-)

Overall, it seems that the best way of living longer is CR combined
with a suitable level of exercise. The body can handle free radicals
quite well, and the small increase due to the exercise is offset by
the improvements in health.

That an ordinary healthy human should not try a parenteral diet is
fairly obvious (what is the point, really?), but as far I know there
are a few people who have survived on a parenteral diet for years
after massive intestinal failure.

But doesn't the lung capacity and red blood cell count increase,
leading to a similar oxygen saturation?

Many have said exercise is good 
but never has it been explained to me in a convincing manner.
1-What are the health benifits besides strong hearts, lungs, and ankles
(weak ankles cause many falls which lead to complications due to
osteoporosis)?

2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?
While I'm speaking of them,
3-Have any tests been done to estimate the average length of life 
after specific nutrients are removed from the diet?
I wonder how long it takes to die from each nutrient deficiency.
4-What phrases could I use for a medline search?

 Possibly, but there is generally less O at higher altitudes.
I imagine the red cell count balances the lack of O.

High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,
provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the capillaries.

If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream
(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)
there are also increases in efficiency of temperature distribution,
preventing hyper/hypothermia, thus leading to decreased free-radical
production 
from sweating/shivering.

 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) 
at high altitudes when they have a lack of white cells to fight them?

 I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate 
if I increase my red cells and my O saturation.
7-Any predictions?
8-Hmm...any risk?

There is an article containing criticisms of the Canadian health care
system and other national health care systems at the Cato Institute web
site. Unfortunately, it is from 1992 and thus the illustrative examples
given are rather dated. Yet, when viewed generically the criticisms
presented accurately reflect some prototypical libertarian complaints:

(I am not a libertarian but I think this is the kind of material you were
requesting.) 

http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa184.html 

The one common characteristic of all national health care systems is a
shortage of services.  For example, in Great Britain, a country with a
population of only 55 million, more than 800,000 patients are waiting for
surgery.(4)  In New Zealand, a country with a population of just 3
million, the surgery waiting list now exceeds 50,000.(5)  In Sweden the
wait for heart x-rays is more than 11 months.  Heart surgery can take an
additional 8 months.(6)  In Canada the wait for hip replacement surgery is
nearly 10 months; for a mammogram, 2.5 months; for a pap smear, 5
months.(7)  Surgeons in Canada report that, for heart patients, the danger
of dying on the waiting list now exceeds the danger of dying on the
operating table.(8)  According to Alice Baumgart, president of the
Canadian Nurses Association, emergency rooms are so overcrowded that
patients awaiting treatment frequently line the corridors.(9) 

<skip>

Sometimes the rationing of care is even more explicit:  care is denied the
elderly or patients whose prognosis is poor.  In Britain kidney dialysis
is generally denied patients over the age of 55.  At least 1,500 Britons
die each year because of lack of dialysis.(10) 

Countries with national health care systems also lag far behind the United
States in the availability of modern medical technology.  It is well
documented that in Canada, high-technology medicine is so rare as to be
virtually un- available.(11)  That comparison holds for other countries as
well.  Advanced medical technology is far more available in the United
States than in any other nation.(12) 

(Footnote 11) For example, Canada has only 12 magnetic resonance imaging
units, compared to more than 900 in the United States.  There are 2.5
times as many CAT scanners in Seattle as in the entire province of British
Columbia.  Canada has only 11 open-heart surgery centers, compared to 783
in the United States.  The United States has six times as many lithotripsy
units as Canada.  United States vs. Canadian Health Care: An Information
Package (Washington: National Committee for Quality Health Care, March
1990).

No system of government is tyranny for those who consent to it, and no
system of government is virtuous for those who do not consent. A truly
libertarian society would allow communities of every sort, so long as
participation is voluntary, and those communities are non-aggressive wrt
other communities. The trick is to somehow devise consensual communities
that are philosophical rather then geographical, wherein you and your
neighbor could subscribe to different governments.

Persuasion has no value except as prelude to action. If coercive action is
excluded, there can be no problem.

If, by corporate welfare, you mean tax cuts, you are confusing *giving* with
*not taking*. If I take two dollars from you and "give" one back, I am not
giving you anything.

In a free and competitive market, the value of anything, including your
labor, is more than the seller thinks it is worth, and less than the buyer
thinks it is worth.

      The Power of Prayer
      ===================

     "In speculating about the nature of prayer, Ellen Johnson (leader of 
      American Atheists) wondered that "... a superintending, self-aware 
      conscious force in the Universe [could] upon whim, grant or refuse 
      certain supplications, and, if need be, suspend the laws of nature 
      to accomplish that which it would not have done otherwise.  In other 
      words, this divinity has an insatiable need to be entertained by the 
      act of prayer before performing what it is requested to do."

      "Ellen Johnson's arguments were considered so extreme that the 
      American press did not report them.  Had it done so, she might have 
      been killed."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      I started off as an Anglican (Episcopalian) Christian.  That Nicene 
      Creed, though -- 'six impossible things to believe before 
      breakfast!"  >:-}  I do think prayer works, on many levels. 
      Fortunately, _none_ of these levels relies on supplications to any 
      divinity, insatiable or otherwise.  The 'God of Spinoza' knows what 
      you're thinking (you do, don't you?)

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      Silva Mind Control graduates access a Higher Intelligence (not God 
      -- you can be of any religion or none in the Silva system) for 
      information and assistance.  The full procedures are given in book 
      "The Silva Mind Control Method" by Jose Silva and Philip Miehle. 

      95% of the full value of the coursework is available through reading 
      the book, which is life-enhancing, full of 'gadgetry', and a joy to 
      read. There are full scientific evaluations of the course outcomes 
      in appendices. It's always in print. Coursework is quicker, is all.

      There are over six million Silva Graduates worldwide now.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      For the next process, you just need to be able to settle your mind 
      into an 'Alpha' (EEG) meditative state. Those who find meditation 
      difficult can purchase a simple EEG electronic sound-and-light 
      brain-frequency entrainment device for the purpose. Works infallibly 
      in around five seconds for me (Synetics MindLab kit -- very nice!).

      Actualizations:  you can now connect your dreamed-of events with 
      their actually occurring. There are just four Laws to observe, in 
      making anything happen:

      [1]  You must _desire_ that the event shall take place.

      [2]  You must _believe_ that the event _can_ take place.

POSTSCRIPT:

      The other day, I was standing in my living-room, staring out of my 
      living-room window with a 'fixed and terrible intensity', as I 
      though through a very difficult problem.  (Coincidentally: I had 
      been talking earlier on the phone about John Paul Vann's heroic 
      defence of Kontum in the Vietnam War, where his forward air fire 
      control commanders Rhotenberry and Ba were calling down B-52 ARC 
      LIGHT air strikes from three mile high to impact within 700 yards of 
      their own positions (Ref: Neil Sheehan, 'A Bright Shining Lie' -- 
      [1987] -- magnificent book!).

      
      At _exactly_ the instant the solution came to my mind, a brilliant 
      blue-gold flash of lightning struck down vertically  just 700 yards 
      away, accompanied instantaneously by a crash of thunder.  The sky 
      turned black, and an inch of rain fell in half an hour.  The 
      resultant local flooding was reported on national broadcast news.

      This sure impressed me!  >:-}

I seem to remember reading an article that stated that the very centre of
the core was a massive crystal(I think of iron)  How was this determined?
Well, don't quote me on this, but I think either someone shot some time of
EM radiation through the earth and measured it's distortion on the other
side (of course, the radiation would be altered differently depending on
how it entered the grain of the crystal)  Hmm... that doesn't sound like a
very likely scenario now that I think about it.  How about this: when an
earthquake occurs on the other side of the planet, you measure how long it
takes to go through the diameter of the earth.  The time it takes should
be influenced by the direction the shock wave passes through the crystal.
Apparently, the arrangement of the domains of this large iron crystal
explain the earth's large magnet field.  Also, one could explain pole
shift(not the kind Danny was talking about!) by the inversion of this iron
crystal, which might be induced by some external magnetic field... a large
metallic asteroid?  Sorry I'm being so vague... has anyone else read the
article to which I am poorly alluding?

No, no known EM radiation is strong enough to pass through the whole
earth. Neutrinos of course pass through it all the time, but they
don't reveal much. So this explanation sounds bogus, as you say.

This sounds like a reasonable way of determining if it is there or
not; anisotropy should be easy to detect. I took a brief dive into the
web and found references to inner core anisotropy, and these pages:
http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/tromp01/node2.html
http://www.sigmaxi.org/amsci/articles/95articles/Wysession-full.html
http://www.physics.georgetown.edu/~jkf/seminars/f96/cohen.html 
which seems to support the crystal idea. It may not be a single
crystal, but a lot of them packed together.

This sounds bogus, since the mass (and hence possible magnetic dipole
moment) of asteroids are orders of mangitude less than the earth. 

The most popular current theory is that the magnetic field is produced
by dynamo currents in the liquid outer core, driven by the earth's
rotation. The shifts in the magnetic field are caused in this model by
chaotic shifts between two parts of the same attractor. No need for
ultra-magnetic asteroids.

It is very possible to form crystal lattices using a mixture of different
elements, especially with metals.  In fact, some alloys (eutectics) exhibit
the same phase behavior as pure metals.  Iron is generally an easily
alloyed metal, probably due to the fact that it switches crystal structures
(between BCC, FCC, and HCP) easily under fairly mild conditions.  As for
amorphous crystals, I don't think metal crystals can be amorphous.  If I am
not mistaken, amorphous crystals can only occur when there is little or no
electron mobility in the lattice, which is not the case with metal crystals.

Additionally, high temperature/pressure environments are *ideal* for large
crystal growth.  The high temperature means the atoms have enough energy to
organize, and the high pressure strongly encourages the formation of large
crystal lattices.  When you consider that the core pressure is around 50
million psi, it would be nearly impossible for amorphous crystal structures
to occur, especially when you have the atomic mobility that occurs at a
temperature of 5000-6000 C.

The determination that the core may be a large iron crystal was due to the
anisotropic propagation of seismic waves through the core.   The
differences in propagation speeds were consistent with the propagation of
seismic waves through large crystals.  Additionally, there was a high
correlation between the collected seismic propagation data, and the data
generated via a computer model assuming a single large iron crystal in a
HCP lattice.  An HCP lattice is the most likely structure for an iron
crystal (which also exhibits FCC and BCC lattices) under the conditions
expected in the core.

Yea, if "they" want to talk to us at our present level of development,

If a light signal were modulated with a significant chunk of the available
bandwidth, say, >1% of it, the modulation would be too fast for our
(standard) detectors to notice.  The signal power would be detected,
and the overall power spectum, but not the modulation.  If it is modulated
as fast as we are likely to be able to do with nanotech, which I'm
estimating at at least 1 terahertz (based on the reported, computed,
wiggle rates of some nanotech mechanical structures), there is little need
to use the bottom few percent of available bandwidth.

And as I mentioned, the overall power spectrum of the signal could be
disguised as anything else. Some current military spread spectrum
transmissions cannot be distinguished from background noise even if you
plug the output of the transmitter directly into your RF spectrum
analyzer.

Would the crystal structure hold together under tidal and other
macro-forces?  I wonder if there are any models of physical properties
of crystals of this size.

Surely the sync signal would not have to be perfectly hidden to be
undetectable to us primitive apes?  And, it is not actually needed, the
other method to recover the clock is brute computing force and a very
stable local clock.  Just decode the signal using the key with all
possible sync timings, and when you find the correct timing, use from then
on.  Or, be listening when the signal is first turned on.

This is, if I understand you, the main reason that I think an advanced 
transmission would be invisible to us at our present state of 
technology.  See my prevoius post re: modulation bandwidth possible with

What logic prompted this, Anders?  Rubies/sapphires are high quality but

The core is dense and magnetic, which implies a metal; iron is a very

be from seismic tomography.  As for crysttalline nature, well, at those
tempertatures and pressures you *assume* something is crystalline.

The core is somewhat less dense than pure iron at core conditions, so
you guess it is impure, and you guess the impurities from abundances and
chemisty.  And by modelling; a 90 % iron core with sulfur, oxygen, and
possibly a bit of extra crud matches seismic observations.

someone was saying the core doesn't rotate at the same rate as the rest
of the Earth.  I forget all details.

Good article; thanks for the pointer.  I don't think, though, that
he attacks the discipline itself so much as he attacks Rothschild's
sloppily-researched book on it, and some of its followers.  He
does not, in fact, have anything at all to say about specific
tenets of Bionomics (if indeed there are any; that's his main point).

Ahhh, but you're assuming that you are not moving with respect to the
signal source. If you are, you need to know your motion to extreme

I was wondering if anybody on this lists knows about *scientific*
approaches to some of the phenomena most people consider mystical.
Things like out-of-body-experiences, spontanuous recovery from
sicknesses, witchcraft and so on. I'm quite sure that some of these
things are relatively easy to explain while others haven't even been
touched by science, yet.

The first question to be asked: is something real or just hallucinated.
I've never made an out-of-body-experience myself, but today, I've been
told there are people who can actively do that. If that's true, you can
try that under different conditions and it might be possible to find out
some interesting things (it would also be quite interesting to develop
methods for gaining knowledge about things like that).

Another interesting thing would be to find out how homeopathy works. Or
what astrology is all about. What has become of parapsychology
(personally, I even find many common psychologists don't really seem to
understand that much - I might be wrong, it's just an impression).

I've intentionally kept this quite general to find out whether there is
an interest in that at all, in further discussion, I'd appreciate
talking about only one phenomena or class of phenomena.

Has anybody heard of the "holographic theory"? I haven't had a chance to
look into that, yet... I guess I have to read some books from the
extropy-list first.

later,
Holger

I actually don't want to sound pessimistic in my first posting to this
list (just today, I've read the article about dynamic optimism which I
found pretty good), but there's something I have been thinking about
since I first found out about Extropy - but so far, I couldn't find an
answer.

In history, very often genius ideas and inventions turned out to be
rather "dangerous", one example are nuclear weapons, a better one are
CFCs. From what I know, when CFCs were discovered, everybody thought
they were completely harmless (non-toxic etc.) It took some years before
the actual problems they may cause (destroying the ozone-layer) was
discovered. I don't know if this is as bad as the media keep on telling
us, but there are a lot of other examples (like simply cars that pollute
the air).

Now, I'm not at all a conservative person, but I do see a problem here
that should be solved somehow - actually, it's a couple of different
problems. If solutions to these problems are already available, please
tell me where to find them.

1) Today, humans are by no means perfect. They have a certain idea of
what they do and what the consequences are, but it happens quite often
that something "impredictable" happens. If you apply changes to the
ecologic system, can you really predict what consequences this will have
in the long run - and would you take the responsibility?

Possible solution: I assume that most scientists are very intelligent,
so they should understand stuff like pancritical rationalism and should
be able to apply this to their work. By doing that, they at least
improve the chance of not doing anything that has extremely bad results
in the long run. Usually, it's the innovator who decides whether
something should be invented or not, right?

2) Today, humans are by no means perfect. While I trust scientists to
have at least a vague idea of what they're doing, I do not trust people
in general. For example, people that work for governments (so-called),
or people that are only interested in profit. Actually, you just have to
walk on the street and talk to people, and you'll discover a lot of
people that simply don't understand a lot of things (they don't actually
need to - for what they want to do). I believe that this poses a great
risk of misuse of any technological advancement.

Solution: Educate people accordingly. (easy to say - but I don't believe
it's possible until I see world-wide results).


If you want to overcome the fear most people have of technology, you
need to solve these problems and make people understand the solutions.
This is obviously quite an old problem, but I think the risks are ever
increasing - until humans themselves are majorly improved (anybody who
has access to advanced technology that has a potential danger needs to
be capable of understanding what he's dealing with - something that is
definitely not trivial).

The major problem with this is that I can improve myself, but I can't
improve the rest of the world - and only one insane person can do great
harm if he has access to the "right" weapons. Imagine a person like
Adolf Hitler with access to future-genetics and nanotechnology. I assume
it will be possible to create both - lethal viruses that spread quickly,
and nanotech-robots that wipe-out life (maybe filtered with certain
genes???). I've recently seen a documentary about Hitler's personality,
and he actually was a poor fool. He was lonely and psychotic. If he
didn't have the power he had, history would have been quite different.
But what if there comes a day where we have to face an insane fool who
has the technology to wipe out all life on this planet? Someone who just
doesn't understand or just doesn't care about the responsibility?

I've obviously put up the "worst scenario one could think of" - but I
think it's quite possible if there is no major change to how most people
think. If all people were Extropians, there would probably be no problem
but I'm afraid that will take somewhat longer than development of
Nanotechnology (and many other things that can be grrrrreat - if used in
a responsible manner).

Tell me what you think about this - I'm definitely not questioning
technology but humans.

later,
Holger

does the ban really extend to private entities, too?

I'll ask my cousin this weekend up at our hunting lodge. Crystals do not
need to be one element. Crystals are often formed as matrices of
compounds (one example: silicon based crystals for transistor and diode
components are doped with other elements with different valences to make
emitters and acceptors, Gallium Arsenide is another compound that forms
crystals.) When matter is under sufficient pressure, it will crystalize
no matter what its content. The content and the rapidity of
crystalization will, however, determine the homogeneity of the matrix,
as well as the flaw density. I would imagine that there is a decent
amount of other elements besides iron in the core, but iron will still
be the overwhelmingly largest percentage, and that since the core has
been under the same or similar pressure since the time of planetesimal
formation, its present content would be similar to that at the time of
its original formation, so the "crystal" core could be the most original
structure on earth.

Forgot another definition of "quid pro con": 3. tricking someone into a sense
of closure by letting them disagree with you or "have their say".  Leaving
someone holding the stake, or giving them the short end of the stake.

1. The polite way people line up on prearranged "opposite sides" of a
predefined "issue".  The favor that ridiculous opponents do each
other (e.g., the quid pro con between Democrats and Republicans,
Communists and Capitalists, etc.).  Balance of Error.
2. More generally, any mutual imprisonment arrangement.

This is true, but I make two observations:

1) This is not for a major portion of a life time (and certainly not for
   an extended life-span). It is only done to extend what is clearly the
   terminal portion of their life.
2) In line with 1), these people continue to deteriorate at a rate higher
   than others of their age.

Yes, it does, at least at high altitudes. (Red cell count always,
lung capacity only if born at high altitudes, I believe.) However,
these things may well not increase proportionately to the amount of
oxygen deprivation. Thus, the cells may also learn to live with less
oxygen and as a consequence have less free radical damage. I simply
don't know if this is true or not.

One person on the CRSociety list is proposing water restriction instead
of food calorie restriction. If the above idea is true maybe if we all
practiced a little bit of oxygen restriction by breathing less, we might
train our cells to need less oxygen, and consequently produce less harmful
free radicals and make us live longer.

Though it's an interesting thought, I am the first one to agree that it
make be quite wrong and impractical.

 IAN:  But that it has no competition

 of the same situation:  monopoly.
 In the case of gov't, a monopoly
 of de facto land ownership.

 IAN: Yet virtually all Earth areas are

 in a big way.

 IAN: Right, what you do on top of the 
 land is most important, and yet, don't
 forget all those hard drives and such
 not only rest upon land, but came from 
 land at some point. We're getting more

Hello All,

As I explained several times, we are working on a Transhuman
foundation in the Netherlands called "Excedo"

What I'm looking for, to put on the site, is the History of Transhumanism
and Extropy.

Can someone explain me in 1 word (okay 2 then :-)
what the main difference is between Extropy and Transhumanism ?
I mean, I have to explain it to someone who is not into it.
Like most of our work on the site will be aimed at, we want to
reach/educate people also, who are not familiar with a lot of these
aspects. Besides this we are already invited by some media to explain.

Also, can I take this text as the starting point of Extropy.
-------------------
Still interested? Okay. In 1988 these two guys named 
Max More and Tom Morrow launched a magazine called Extropy.
In it, they explained several ideas they were putting together.
Eventually, they had interested many other people in these extropian 
ideas. Most of us think these ideas hang together very naturally; in fact,
many of us can look back over our notes and journals and see that we
were always extropians, but just didn't have a name for it before 1988.
An extropian is anyone who is interested in expressing and advancing 
these ideas, so there can't be any hard and fast definition. Nevertheless,
here are some attempts (which flagrantly disregard the principles of
E-Prime). 
-------------------

Who used Transhumanism first ?....and does this has a similar
starting point (see the above text)

Why was "Extropy" the lucky word ? 


Thanks again all !!

Greetings,

Berrie

Too detailed to go into here, but clearly proteins must be broken 
apart into amino acids or short peptides, many vitamins and nutrients
have active transport mechanisms form the intestines, the liver does
essential modification of many vitamins and nutrients eg changing EFA's
into triglycerides.
Read the nutrition and metabolism book which I suggested in my other

I see where you are coming from (and trying to get to). I like the idea.
The problem is that the body is far too complicated physiologically and
biochemically, and our understanding is far too limited, for anything like
what you want to be possible for decades to come.

>I prefer feeding to take as little time as possible.

I agree. That's why I now do most of my feeding by drinking blended food
"slurries". The blender 'chewing' the food saves me time and effort.
Occassionally, I still chew because I like chewing and its good for my teeth
and gums which I don't want to atrophy (just yet :).
 
>I would rather everything be predigested

The predigested part is not so easy. I believe there are healthy and
nutritional benefits of passing food throught the digestive system which
cannot easily be gained any other way.

Me too. All the time.

Then there are easier ones to avoid using than the whole digestive
system.

How about having your arms and legs amputated? (Maybe leave your
right arm so you can type - or maybe not with good voice recognition)
There is evidence that shorter people live longer. It might be true
the a happy arm/leg amputee who gets his exercise by rolling around
and squirming on the floor might live longer too. :)

Not just smaller, other imporant functions. Anyway some of the parts
you have listed do not wear our early or are not terminal if they do.
I don't believe that anyone has ever died from a wornout tongue or had
a tongue transplant for that matter. :)

Also tongues can be very useful for lots of fun things.
I wouldn't want to be without one. :)

Yes, but it is only for certain specialized *diseased* things and even
then still mostly unproven.

>High O means low pulse/respiration, which means those parts last longer.

I you breathed up to a 50% oxygen mixture, the amount of oxygen in the
blood would only increase a little (the disolved %) since most of it is
in the "hypersaturated" (actively bound) hemoglobin. Your pluse rate
would change very little. It is true that your would need to breathe less
than half as frequently or deeply, however. But the cumulative long-term
damage on the lung tissue of the extra oxygen would probably negate any
benefit.

The big point here, Mike, is that "good old Mother Nature" has pretty
well optimised us already.

Eventually, I agree. But we are nowhere near the "bionic man" yet.
Easier to try the amputee route mentioned above.

Use slurries as described above. (They also make taking >100 nutrient

stomach although the acid requirements will not be changed.

Sorry, they will be. They are generated by the mitochondrial production

So you aiming for "Donovan's Brain" (an old sci-fi flick).

You can best proctect your brain by first all the same things as will
protect the rest of your body - your brain is *fundamentally* similar
cells after all. Then you go after a lot of the "smart drugs" things
which are especially brain protective.

Done a bit above. Read a good biochemistry book.

The area to concentrate on most, IMO is the mitochondria, where there are
very few repair mechanisms for DNA damage caused by erratic free radicals.
Our bodies can live with this only because we have multiple mitos in each
cell and because they can divide and multipy within the cell (except
sometimes damaged ones mulitply faster than the good ones and destroy the
cell).

No question of it IMO. I am very pleased that my morning body temp is only
95.7'F and it only rises to 97.2'F during the day. (and I am *not* hypothyroid)

I think its definitely good, but CR, melatonin, (and genes) are the only
harmless ways to lower it that I know of.

I don't think isometrices will fulfill the function of either aerobics
(heart, lung, arteries, veins, immune system, happy endorphins, etc( or
weight work (prevent osteoporosis).

But you *do* need to take time to read and understand the science

Enhance immunity, enhanced intelligence and mental energy, increased GH, etc
(just about every life enhancing factor you can think of - except production
of free radicals and some waste products, both of which are not a problem,
ie more than made up for by compensating enhancements, if the exercise is
not too extreme)

2-Did they die of nutritional deficiency?

Medically, "Nutritional deficiency" has a very technical meaning. For each
nutrient which is deemed essential, there is a specific deficency disease
which happens when all others are adequate and only it is deficient.
It is necessary that there be such a disease in order for a nutrient to be
called essential. The RDA is the amount which is necessary to prevent this
disease in most people.

Thus, it is likely that no one on parenteral feeding "technically" dies of 
nutrient deficiency since the diet ensures that they get all of the known
essential nutrients. The problem is that first there are likely still some
unknown important nutrients and the term essential as defined above is not
necessarily sufficient to keep one alive for very long.

For the technically essential nutrients, yes, these things are generally
known.

You might be better to begin with an advanced nutrition text such as

_Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism_ Groff, Gropper and Hunt
Krause's _Food, Diet, and Nutrition Therapy_

I spoke to this on my other post.

>High red cell count also means high nutrient distribution,
>provided there is enough fluid in the bloodstream to fill the capillaries.

Sorry, but you need to learn more physiology. The red blood cells have
nothing to do with nutrient distribution. In fact, more red blood cells
might tend to make it worse, there is only so much blood volume available.
See Guyton's _A Textbook of Medical Physiology_ (a good book on the body
changes due to exercise also)

>If there are increased amounts of fluid in the bloodstream
>(5- input technical term here: hyperfluidity?)

>production from sweating/shivering.

Again you need to learn more physiology. The body is not warmed and cooled
as if some central heating system with the blood vessels taking the place
of water or air condiuts. The temperature regulation is done directly by
each cell in response to thyroid hormones and others information transmitters
all the blood does is even out the temperature from one spot to the other.
So you are correct that more blood volume could aid in preventing "hot spots"
where additional free radical damage might be increased by the higher
temperature.

> 6-Do people host more bacteria( which do not like high levels of O) 

some do some don't

Why should people at high altitudes lack white blood cells?

>I've been wanting to know how low I can get my heart rate

My morning pulse is 44. My hematocrit (% of red blood cells) is not that
high though). I have heard of young med students as low as 30. Using a pulse
oximeter which measures % of hemoglobin saturation, I can hold my breath
without blacking out until my "SAT" goes down to about 85% (normally 98% for
every healthy person). No one else I know can go below 90%.

>7-Any predictions?
>8-Hmm...any risk?

I can't tell you what the risk is until you tell me how you plan to accomplish
this. Off hand other than be a tranfusion of red cells (dangerous to play with)
I can't think of any way to do it (many taking testosterone injections - also
dangerous to play with).

I think suitable is probably less than you think.

 One thing I have noticed about the medical establishment 
is their obsession with keeping the terminally ill on 24-hour emergency
while failing to improve the "healthy" people 
who are not willing to pay up the ying-yang
for drugs which treat symptoms 
and gismos that blink and beep.

If your doctor EVER says "Nothing is wrong with you" 
get another doctor.

...altitudes or environmental pressure?
Hyperbaric chambers increase oxygen saturation 
by sqeezing out other gases.
I did a web search on oxygen therapy and found many interseting claims.

Capillaries recieve less nutrients, blood thickens, 
heart/lungs pump more (free-rads),
but if it extends my brain's lifespan it may be worth it.

Here is another web reference about the Earth inner core:

The Crystal at the Center of the Earth
http://www.psc.edu/science/Cohen_Stix/cohen_stix.html

The web page briefly discusses the work of Ronald Cohen and Lars Stixrude
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They performed calculations
using a CRAY 90 to predict properties associated with different
hypothesized iron crystal structures. (The web page is at the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center where the CRAY 90 is located.)

Isaac Bonewits (the first, and the only that I know of, person to
get a degree in Magic from an accredited university) wrote a book
called Real Magic that did a fair job on some of this stuff.  I'm
fairly sure it's out of print, though.

I think filtering, guided imagery, coincidence, the placebo 
effect, and peer pressure account for a lot.  Not being 
particularly concerned with Occam's Razor or the scientific 
method also helps.

Nobody can do that. Technologies, the ecological system etc. are highly
nonlinear, and is is usually impossible to make accurate predictions over
a long period ("sensitive dependence on initial conditions ..."). Kelly
in "Out Of Control" suggests that the only way to learn something about
such systems is to let them evolve, i.e., TIME is an important parameter, 
and there may be no shortcuts to a later state of the system. As for the
consequences, Lem says in SUMMA TECHNOLOGIAE: "The only way to deal with
a technology is another technology." (I'm currently re-reading it since 
it seems to contain some ideas which are valuable to extropianism; I've
tried my best to translate the first chapter into English, since there
doesn't seem to be an English edition, see
http://itp1.physik.tu-berlin.de/~prengel/Lem/summa.html).

Come on. Do you really believe that nuclear technology (and weapons)
wouldn't exist today if Einstein had decided not to publish "his" 
famous "E=mc^2"? At a certain point, discoveries simply are on the 
agenda, and it's a matter of chance WHO will be the lucky(?) one to 
make them, but they will be made sooner or later.

There are groups like CSICOP and the Skeptics Society that sometimes
attempt to present alternative non-paranormal explanations for phenomena
considered mysterious. Unfortunately, these groups have chosen to only
make a small portion of their magazines available on the web:

CSICOP publishers of Skeptical Inquirer
http://www.csicop.org/

Skeptic Society publishers of Skeptic Magazine
http://www.skeptic.com/skeptics-society.html

Another web resource with a "skeptical" viewpoint is:
The Skeptic's Dictionary by Robert T. Carroll
http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/

The dictionary entry for Out-of-body experience (OBE) is brief:
http://wheel.ucdavis.edu/~btcarrol/skeptic/obe.html

It refers to books by Susan Blackmore and it also points to an essay by
Keith Augustine: 

The Scientific Case Against Immortality
by Keith Augustine
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/scientific_case.html

Here is an excerpt about near-death experiences (NDEs) which are
related to out-of-body experiences:

begin excerpt

Some findings of NDE research are more consistent with physiological and
psychological models. None of the patients who report NDEs are brain dead
because brain death is irreversible (Beyerstein 46). First, NDEs only
occur in one-third of all cases where there is a near-death crisis (Ring
194). Second, the details of NDEs depend on the individual's personal and
cultural background (Ring 195). Third, physiological and psychological
factors affect the content of the NDE. Noises, tunnels, bright lights, and
other beings are more common in physiological conditions directly
affecting the brain state, such as cardiac arrest and anesthesia, whereas
euphoria, mystical feelings, life review, and positive transformation can
occur when people simply believe they are going to die (Blackmore, "Dying"
44-45). Fourth, the core features of NDEs are found in drug-induced and
naturally occurring hallucinations (Siegel 174). The OBE can be induced by
the anesthetic ketamine (Blackmore, "Dying"  170). A tunnel experience is
a common form of psychedelic hallucination (Siegel 175-6). All NDE stages
have occurred in sequence under the influence of hashish (Blackmore,
"Dying"  42-3). Fifth, a build-up of carbon dioxide in the brain will
induce NDEs (Blackmore, "Dying" 53-4). Sixth, the panoramic life review
closely resembles a form of temporal lobe epilepsy (206). There are even
cases where epileptics have had OBEs or even seen apparitions of dead
friends and relatives during their seizures (206). Seventh, computer
simulations of random neural firing based on eye-brain mapping of the
visual cortex have produced the tunnel and light characteristic of NDEs
(84). Finally, NDEs can be induced by direct electrical stimulation of
brain areas surrounding the Sylvian fissure in the right temporal lobe
(Morse 104).

Bad people exist, and some are worse than others.

1) I don't worry about it -- worrying is bad for my immune system and 
   my productivity.
2) I advocate ubiquitous technology -- a Neo-Hitler will have a much
   harder time wiping me out with nanotech if I have it too.
3) I expect both improved psychology (to notice destroyers early)
   and excellent virtual reality (so we can give them something
   to destroy without bothering the rest of us).
4) I try to stay in relatively safe places.

There's probably more, but it's late.

I have been trying to weigh to benifits of intelligence vs. free-rad
production.
I suppose being stupid would kill me sooner.
Someday I'll ask someone to convince me exercise is good 
and they will not only list what it does 
they will say how it does it,

 How rapidly could I change red/white cell counts?
If it is controlable enough I could:
A)increase plasma during feeding.
B)increase red cell during exercise.
C)increase white cell during cleansing.

:-)
As my pride is wounded from my apparent lack of physiological knowledge,
I will defend myself with my grasp of physics 
which extends beyond my body into the hot, dry air 
which fills my lungs at the center of my being, 
warming my soul by reaching through it's bloody tendrils
(rather much like a central heating system).:-)
I am sorry.
Alas, I could not resist.

In case you missed my point I will try to explain.
Heat is not soley within the cells.
It can be created in them 
though I was meerly pointing out that dehydrated toes get froze.
As water being rapidly pumped through the system 
disperses warm blood amongst cold blood 
the mean temperature is more easily kept regular(regulated).
I feel better now.

Well, I don't plan to use a hyperbaric chamber

That's what I want.
A machine that replentishes the blood supply.
Out with the old, in with the new.
No eating, no drinking, no breathing, no muss, no fuss,
that's the life for me.

I once made a salad slurrie.
I did not realize I could fit an entire head of lettuce in one glass!
The amount of calories I would have saved from blending.
were spent setting up and cleaning the blender. 
It's only worth it if done in mass quantities or if I have no teeth.

Good books are hard to find.

White cells use them to help fight germs too( rads not books).

I have lists of the leading causes of human death,

A body count would be helpful.

Hey, thanks.
That's a pleasant and uncommon response.
I admit,

Less body work = less heat.
Molecular agitation is another reason I do not want to use many body parts.

Clinch every muscle in your body for a few minutes 
and see if you heart is not racing.
It won't build alot of strength 
and won't put alot of strain on most bones, 
you are right.

About endorphins,
have you ever heard of anyone being able to release them at will?

Very good. Let's see, that means we have Aleph (transhumanism in 
Sweden), Excedo (tranhumanism in the Netherlands), Bostropians 
(Boston region extropians) and the Extropy Institute (extropianism 
world-wide). Have I missed out something?

This Sunday I am scheduled to meet up with David Pearce to make 
plans for a transhumanist association in Britain.

Roughly speaking, the difference is that extropianism includes the 
political doctrine that something like anarcho-capitalism is a good 
thing. Thus every extropian is a transhumanist, but not every 
transhumanist is an extropian.

Welcome! If an idea is valid, then it should be considered even if it
sounds pessimistic; only passive optimists and pessimists reject ideas
because of their mood.

We cannot predict the long-term consequences of our
actions. Period. But we can do our best to avoid bad effects, and I
think we are responsible for all our actions.

> Possible solution: I assume that most scientists are very intelligent,

As a scientist, I'm flattered but unfortunately this isn't very true
(in fact it is a remain of the old romatic idea that artists and
scientists are set apart; in reality scientists are fairly ordinary
people in general).

This is what happens today, although PCR is not used as much as it
ought to. It is just that we always hear about the disasters and not
about the millions of potential disasters that are prevented.

Innovations, yes, but most discoveries are accidental or unexpected,
and most technology is developed because somebody for some reason
funds it (be it the market, an individual or a group like the
military).

Thanks again, but I think you should nuance your position a bit
more. I think one can trust all people (with a few exceptions) to some
extent; being a scientist doesn't per se make you more trustworthy,
just as being a government official doesn't per se make you less
trustworthy.

This is actually the solution to many other problems, like poverty and
the spread of some bad memes.

A deeper understanding of the problems might do too - I know some
people who react with "try harder!" when I explain that we cannot
predict the long term consequences of technology even in principle. It
would be useful if we could make people think more and better about
these issues.

It is a good start to improve oneself and act as a catalyst for
improvement in others.

This is a real problem, since even if we solve the problems you
discuss, there may always be somebody who is deranged or clumsy enough
to mess things up. Even without sociopaths and zealots there will be
accidents and people who do dangerous things for good reasons.

The solution is likely to empower people in general, so that it will
be hard for dictators, fanatics and error to overcome
all. Unfortunately this only works if the technologies are not of the
kind that the first use wins (this was the cause of our major
nanotechnology debate a few months back; was nanotech inherently such
a technology, or could even deliberate nasty nanodevices be
contained?). In this case dispersal seems to be the only strategy.

Actually, I think it is time for us European transhumanists of
different kinds and names to start to network a bit better. As
Nicholas listed, we know about associations in Sweden, the Netherlands
and likely soon Britain. But there are isolated transhumanists in
Denmark, Germany, France and right now Russia (Eugene Leitl is there),
and doubtless plenty of others (many with no net access and many who
have come to our ideas independently).

We of Aleph have been discussing arranging an european transhumanist
meeting next summer; is there interest out there in helping to develop
a working european transhumanist network?

I will help in every possible way, and I can speak for all of Excedo.
But since were >H who all like to say our piece, I won't speak for

We will meet next Sunday, so we will discuss this !

OK !

I will use this ! We did indeed decide to become Transhumans instead
of Extropist because of the different opinions on this subject.
It also has to do with the pro-government-climate in the Netherlands.
And to be honest I don't think (IMHO) that it has to change much,
(for now that is)......although we still have to find out how we can deal
with the law regarding Cryonics.

Bernie, hold on.  Nick's response to your query about the difference between
transhuman is not a distilled explanation.  Granted, some extropians might
approach their political views from an anarcho-capitalist view, but this is
not inclusive of all extropians and certainly there is no doctrine that
states that an extropian maintain this type of political slant.

Many extropians are libertarians, however there are numerous extropians that
neither subscribe to anarcho-capitalist views nor libertarian views.  They
have formed their own concepts about government, its relationship to our
well being.

I think the mechanism of most of the benefits is reasonably well known,
but I would take anywhere from a short mongraph to a long textbook to

No, you miss the point. The number of possible chemicals (with very
different properties) is higher than astromomical. Not all the chemicals
in natural foods have even been isolated and even for many which have,
their value or lack of it is not known. This is partly because not all
the chemicals that our body uses and makes have been discovered yet.
And certainly not all the biochemical pathways.

I always maintain that one of the fundamental mistakes that extropians,
transhumanists, nanotechnologists, uploaders, AI people, etc make is
grossly underestimating human and brain complexity.

a) For plasma volume increase give electrolytes plus colloid.
   There are standard medical plasma expanders available.
 
b) For increase red blood cells take testosterone (a slow method)
   or get a direct transfusion of compatible red cells
   or drain you own blood and add plasma expander, this will lower
   hematocrit and cause spleen to empty its red cell reservoir and
   to manufacture more, then transfuse own blood back.
   Walla! super high hematocrit!
c) I can think of no way to do this at present except by infecting
   yourself with many things which you have previously been vacinnated
   against.

The real question is why would you want to do any of these things?

True enough as far as I understand you. But it the blood flow is
so fast and the blood volume so large (all 5 liters of your blood
cycled through your body every minute) and the capillaries so close
to every cell, that the body temperature will not vary much from
one point to another as long as you maintain good circulation.

But red blood cells don't have anything to do with food. They only
carry oxygen and transfused one will likely even be difficient of that
You will have to breath even more to reoxygenate them.
You body is already a very efficient and quite optimal life support
system for your brain. Don't you realize that's what its real
purpose is?

Its much better if you combine many vegetables with low fat tofu or

Naw! You slop around a little water in the bottom to rinse and drink that
so less than a teaspoon is wasted, then you rinse immediately (before it dries)
under a running tap. Usually this is sufficient and takes less than a minute.
If still not clean enough, then simply "blend" some water and then rinse again.

> It's only worth it if done in mass quantities or if I have no teeth.
 
I started it as a necessity when I got a full set of braces on. But now I plan
to continue. However, a full blender is two meals worth and from cooked stuff
I usually do two at a time.

No, because fiber will not draw anything from *you*, only from the food.
I am thinking of beneficial gut bacteria effects, but I don't have anything

Are you searching medline or the Internet? For all searching it is
necessary to be very creative about the terms and names. You need to
think of all possible ways the subject might be expressed.

Probably to do with Body-mass-index (BMI) and the mass/surface
area effect (the reason why elephants have such thick legs)
CR gives lower BMI too.

In the 70s Dr. John Lilly developed techniques whereby pretty much anyone
could have an OOBE.  He then carried out the research you propose.  Alas,
it turned out that people weren't actually leaving their body, they only
thought they were.  What they saw when they "went somewhere" was not what
was actually there, but what they thought should be there.  So it didn't
replace airplanes.

 There was an explosion of scientific investigation of 'altered states of
consciousness' during the '60s and '70s.  It didn't pay off with the
massive progress its proponents hoped for.  The altered states turned out
not to be real useful, except possibly for psychotherapy, and all the easy
and reliable methods of alteration involved abusable drugs which the
government has chosen to suppress.  What techniques from that period are
still in use?  Hypnotic psychotherapy, meditation and acupuncture
anaesthesia are all I can think of, and none of them have had very big
effects on the world.

I suppose one could have predicted that altered states would not be
massively superior to the standard state, given evolutionary
considerations: if it was easy to change the structure of our minds in
desirable directions, evolution would have made the states switch on and
off appropriately, without requiring vast efforts to achieve them.

 side (of course, the radiation would be altered differently depending on
 how it entered the grain of the crystal)  Hmm... that doesn't sound like a
 very likely scenario now that I think about it.  How about this: when an
 earthquake occurs on the other side of the planet, you measure how long it
 takes to go through the diameter of the earth.  The time it takes should
 be influenced by the direction the shock wave passes through the crystal.
 Apparently, the arrangement of the domains of this large iron crystal
 explain the earth's large magnet field.  Also, one could explain pole
 shift(not the kind Danny was talking about!) by the inversion of this iron
 crystal, which might be induced by some external magnetic field... a large
 metallic asteroid?  Sorry I'm being so vague... has anyone else read the
 article to which I am poorly alluding?

Hi, Ive read it somewhere too but cant recall why they think its a crystal.
 A majority of their knowledge comes from earthquakes and hydrogen/nuclear
explosions, and I've read a different article (discover(y?) magazine) on how
they now know from waves from things like that, that the surface of the outer
core is very jagged, definately not smooth, but they didnt say anything about
a crystal, so puting the two together I've always thought of the outer core
to be a crystal and the inner core being a much denser crystal, and the
mantle being an ocean with currents and such playing off the energies of the
core.  The dynamic relationship between the two crystals and the mantle must
be very interesting.

Don't forget Portugal although according to some countries legislation I'm

About a meeting, if it's not too far away I might be interested.

Actually, I've done this a few times, having gotten the idea out of some
book or other, but it's been a while since I did it. A good text on 
biofeedback might have a decent explanation of the process and how you
can best achieve it.

Great! So reading yet another book won't be too much of a burden. Just
don't strain yourself when you're flipping the pages. =)

It is complex, but I think it will not be too hard to reproduce it's

I want to optimize my body for the actions it is performing.

I want to take the load off the cells so they wear slower,

I know, 
I was talking about replentishing all parts of the blood
(including O as a nutrient, I can't think of a better word).

Are you telling me their is no possible way to artificially reoxygenate
blood?

Trying to replace organs is a great way of learning about what they do.
You can look at the body and see what is not being done.

It makes heat and requires nutrients that coulod be better spent elsewhere
but I probably won't bother to chop it.

If this were true cutting-edge scientists would often be forced into

I'm not saying it does not happen, 
but I hope it doesn't happen that often.

I do not believe life new saving technologies are beyond today's
capabilities.
All we have to do is get the right people to cooperate with eachother.
Getting O into red cells seems quite easy.

Could white cells eventually be replaced with anti-biotics 
or due they perform other functions?

I read in Popular Science (Nov. '97) that IBM is developing a silicon
germanium semiconductor technology that can be manufactured at existing
facilities.  Does this new chip technology represent a threat to
gallium-arsenide manufacturers in the near future?

This is all true, but it misses a critical point: is there a moral
difference between acknowledging responsibility for your action,
and acknowlegding responsibility for your inaction? In particular,
if we fail to innovate, population increase will destroy the existing
global ecosystem. If we continue to innovate along existing rate curves,
we are very likely to reach a point at which a superintelligence
emerges. I feel that ignoring either of these potentially catastrophic
phenomena is as less morally defensible as the thoughtless introduction
of
a new innovation would be.

Earth/Moon relaionship
has become iron crytsal core
Cor!!,..progress !!!

What is the implications of Earth
having an iron crystal core, which
exists with some other impurities
as a 'whole' lattice, is it another
target for mega-engineering projects ?

Are there future projects been prepared
to confirm its existance,...

Hey, what about the buckyball factory
in Geosyn orbit,...Do you guys follow
NASA / JPL ...? Landing a probe on a comet
this time,.. good start, how about using
comets as platforms out of the solar system
or land a comet on Mars to terraform ?!

Hello All,

My idea is to combine a few thoughts I had about a starting point
and a history of the Transhuman movement.

I would like to have one source of information were people can start
reading about all (a lot :-) of the aspects of Extropy an >H.
Building up from History towards the future................

Therefor I post this start text, which is of cause not much, but
well.........
it's a start. I suggest that all who like and know something of a specific
subject send to my personal address their contribution. This way we
will keep the traffic low on the list. 

I will compose from all your contributions a new text, and repost it 
again. This we will repeat a few times, until we will have a satisfying
text/source/well...................

What I would like to see develop is an optimistic and easy to read
scientific correct story about.......well........basically about everything
:-)
But as I mentioned in the text, every line will have a number in front
of it, so that anybody can refer to this text and his or her own 
opinion and additional information.

So to make it a bit clearer. Someone who knows a lot about the DNA,
will write and introduction to it (the basic concept) and in relation to
the main text. For a detailed look into the matter, you can click on the 
number in front of the line, were you will find links, opinions, and
references
to books, etc........

To kick it off, and get it on the road, I would like to suggest that:

Anders, starts with the intro, the big bang, earth
Max, starts with Civilization, and Now, and Future

Doesn't have to be much, and you will probably have a lot of text
you can easily copy. It's just the first structure !?

Can I post it as .doc ??

I will repost it with numbers per line on the 4th of November.
So that we can start the discussion, and building process.
And all the other people who would like to help can start adding
their text.

Also as suggestion:

update 8 November
update 12 November
update 15 November
update 19 November
update 22 November
final version for the year 1998 post on 29 November.

USA and UK can relax, Sweden and the Netherlands can start the
translation work :-)

>From what I've read until now in the Extropy list, there are a lot of
people with scientific knowledge, writing skills and enthusiast/
optimistic/fun thoughts and opinions. I hope "we" can combine al
this power in one very good "bible :-) of Transhumanism"

Hope to hear from you all soon !!

Greetings,  :-)

I'd be very interested in this. At the moment, the names "Extropianism"
and "Transhumanism" are pretty new to me, and I'm not exactly sure what
exactly the difference is. The way I see it, Transhumanism is probably a
part of Extropianism, but I wouldn't be sure if - for example part of
the Extropian Principles - can be found in Transhumanism,too.

Would it be correct to say "Extropians are more critical than
Transhumanists"?

I'm living in Munich, Germany and am currently trying to find a few
people around me who are open to Extropian ideas for discussion - since
next week my vacation will be over (I'm studying
computer-science/engineering and communication studies), I'll probably
have very limited time for that - there's just too much interesting
stuff to learn, and for the next 4 months I'll focus on University ;-)

later,
Holger

>Why was "Extropy" the lucky word ?

I coined this work in January of '88 in the course of researching the
information-based interpretation of entropy.  The roots "ex" and "tropy"
essentially mean "out of" and "disorder."  I chose "ex" as an alternative to
"en" in "entropy" because I sought a word that would indicated, in a general
sense, a movement towards greater information.  I did not want to use
"negentropy" because that already had a narrow, technical definition.

Please note that I do not claim to be the first person to ever put together
"ex" and "tropy"; I could never prove that claim at any rate.  But I do not
think that any predecessor had used "extropy" in the sense that I intended,
and that Max has so ably fleshed out.

Holger, I explained the relationship between transhumanism and extropianism
in my post of 10/30/97. If you didn't receive that message, please let me
know and I'll resend it. Again, in brief: Extropianism in one specific
version of transhumanism. It's specific character is defined by the
Extropian Principles (see our web site at www.extropy.org) There can be
many kinds of transhumanists, all of whom share general goals of overcoming
human limits. They may differ on the best means of doing so, and on what
they emphasize.

>Would it be correct to say "Extropians are more critical than
>Transhumanists"?

I don't think you could say this as a general statement, though sometimes
it will certainly be true. Extropians definitely emphasize critical
thinking (along with creative thinking). This has always been stressed --
see the principle of Self-Transformation (and in the forthcoming version
3.0, see the principle of Self-Ownership).

We've seen some transhumanists who are not very critical, though this may
be simply their personality rather than an explicit part of their version
of transhumanism. There are people who could be called transhumanists who
apparently do not value critical thinking, and who look to scientifically
implausible methods for overcoming human limits. As our ideas spread, I
expect to see religious versions of transhumanism -- Christian
Transhumanism, Islamic Transhumanism, and (not too far from their current
beliefs) Mormon Transhumanism. Since religious generally promote faith over
reason, those transhumanists will not be as critical as Extropians.

>I'm living in Munich, Germany and am currently trying to find a few
>people around me who are open to Extropian ideas for discussion 

Sorry we didn't meet when I was in Munich in March this year. I believe
Extropy Institute have a couple of contacts in the area. We would like to
encourage an Institute offshoot there.

Onward!

I've seen there are a few local extropian mailing-lists on the
extropy-server. Would it be possible to have a european one? This could
be used for bringing together european extropians / transhumanists and
organize meetings etc.

Do any mailing-lists like that exist already?
A problem for Europe may be that many people prefer talking in their own
language, this could be solved by having prefixes in the subjects (i.e.
ES for Spanish, FR for French, DE for German etc.), so messages could
easily be filtered (maybe two letters are not sufficient, though).

Is there an interest for such a list?

later,
Holger

I sent Anders a message offering to start such a list. We just have
to decide on a name. How about exi-euro?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

In an attempt to open the space frontier to private human activity, 
and to destroy the myth that space is owned by any government or 
any government agency, two international space organizations will 
announce a $250,000 "Cheap Access to Space" (CATS) Prize on 
November 7th at "Space Frontier Conference VI" in Los Angeles.

The conference, with the theme "Space: Open for Business", will be
held at the Los Angeles Sheraton Gateway Hotel from November 7-9,
1997.  A central topic will be the transformation of space from a 
government program to a real frontier driven by commercial 
development. The conference will feature frank discussions about 
privatizing the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.
There will also be presentations on new commercial markets, such as
the emerging space tourism industry, recent plans to privately capture
and mine asteroids, and proposals to use space solar power to
compete with today's coal and nuclear energy systems.

The formal announcement of the $250,000 CATS prize will be made
at a press conference and reception on Friday, November 7 at 7 pm.
The prize will be awarded to the first private team to launch a 2 
kilogram payload to an altitude of 200 km or greater.  Conference
attendees and members of the press may attend the reception.  The
rules for the competition, and other details, will be announced at
this time.

The Space Frontier Foundation, an international space policy and
media organization, will manage the competition and is holding 
the prize which has been funded by the Foundation for the 
International Non-Governmental Development of Space (FINDS),
a private 7 million dollar endowment.  "Governments don't open 
frontiers, people do" stated Foundation President and FINDS
Executive Director Rick N. Tumlinson. "Prizes have been used
throughout history to foster innovation in the private sector.  From
the age of exploration to Lindberg they have inspired imaginations
and helped knock down barriers."

A special all-day session on Friday, November 7, sponsored by the
U.S. Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, will focus on radical
innovations in spaceplane technologies and services being offered
by the new generation of entrepreneurial rocket companies.  The
conference is being co-sponsored by the ProSpace, the "Citizen's
Space Lobby."

Guest speakers will include such notables as former astronauts
turned entrepreneurs "Buzz" Aldrin (Apollo 11), Charles "Pete"
Conrad (Apollo 12) and Dr. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17), Mars
advocate and author Dr. Robert Zubrin, asteroid resources expert
Dr. John Lewis (University of Arizona), world-renowned robot
builder Red Whitaker (Carnegie Mellon University), NASA's
John Mankins (NASA/HQ), and former congresswoman Andrea
Seastrand.

"Whether you are an investor, an entrepreneur, a space reporter, or
working on a movie about our future, this is the one place to be this
year," advises Tumlinson, who has testified multiple times before
Congress on space commercialization issues. "It's like the day
before the computer revolution. This stuff is real, it's beginning
right now, and it will soon change our civilization forever."

The Space Frontier Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that
has been fighting since 1988 to change how we all think about,
and attempt to open, the space frontier. Our goal is the near term and
irreversible expansion of the human race into space, and the
permanent settlement of the high frontier.

Registration for this 3-day conference is $90, or $70 for students.
Registration will open at 8 a.m. on Friday, November 7th.  The
Sheraton Gateway Hotel is located at 6101 West Century Boulevard
near Los Angeles International Airport (310-642-1111).

For more detailed information on the conference visit our web site

Space Frontier Foundation, or to receive press credentials, call

I will be living in Heidelberg for a few years, working on my PhD project
starting next April, and  I would certainly be interested in such a list.

P.S. I heard through the grapevine that there is a German publication
of many pages long that detailed Extro 3 with all/many of the participants.
I saw a Web version of a publication about Extro 3, but I think that this 
other publication is something different.

Someone told me that they saw me in there plus many many of the other 
Extro 3 participants (hmm odd since.. I was only at Extro 3 for a few 
hours, unfortunately). Can anyone give details about this German article? 
Is there any way to get a xerox copy of the article?

IT_COULDN'T_BE_DONE

Somebody said that it couldn't be done,
But he with a chuckle replied
That "maybe it couldn't", but he would be one
Who wouldn't say so till he tried.
So he buckled right in with a trace of a grin
On his face. If he worried he hid it.
He started to sing as he tackled the thing, 
That couldn't be done and he did it.

Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that;
At least no one ever has done it";
But he took off his coat and he took of his hat,
And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,
Without any doubting or quiddit,
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
That couldn't be done, and he did it.

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,
There are thousands to prophesy failure;
There are thousands to point out to you, one by one,
The dangers that wait to assail you.
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin
Just take off your coat and go to it.
Just start to sing as you tackle the thing
That "cannot be done," and you'll do it.

     - Edgar A. Guest

One piece of writing I should have mentioned in relation to a history of
transhumanism is Reilly Jones excellent and substantial article "A History
of Extropic Thought:Parallel Conceptual Development of Technicism and
Humanism ". This is the written version of the talk that Reilly gave at
EXTRO 2 in 1995. It's a highly content-rich history of the roots of
extropic thinking from ancient times to the present. With Reilly's
permission, I'd like to include this on our site in the history section.

This essay is available in the EXTRO 2 Proceedings. (Yes, they are finally
in print. If you were a full registrant for EXTRO 2, you should have
received a copy by now). Copies are available for $30 (postage paid in the
US, otherwise add $5 for airmail) from:

I have no recollection or record of saying this,

I make the same claim as Prof. Krugman, so I don't see
him as coy or deceptive.  And bionomics seems squarely 
marketed as a substitute for mainstream economics, not 
Keynes and Marx.

The people who do the math are rarely the same as the

Romer's work is solidly within the standard 
"equilibrium thinking" framework.  (In economics, 
equilibrium doesn't mean statis.)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

[I was sending this to the extropy.org address for some odd reason.
Profuse apologies to those might've seen it already.]

I just finished a re-read of Prometheus Rising -- some thoughts and a
question follow.

Some philosophers seem to think that the "hard problem" of consciousness
(how neural correlates give rise to subjective experience --
http://sol.zynet.co.uk/imprint/hardprob.html ) is unsolvable until we
know something about human perception. Perception is the mechanism that
turns an objective reality into a subjective experience. So how we
perceive a sensed event affects the internalized nature of the
experience and in a feedback loop, the internalized nature of the
experience affects our perception, and so on. In this way, (by way of a
string of certain internalized experiences) some can be conditioned to
"expect" a certain experience, and thus will perceive a sensed event as
such. I'm reminded of the adage (and Eric Watt Forste's well-considered
sign-off line) "Expectation foils perception."

Prometheus Rising offers a number of exercises to alter our perceptive
framework. Working with the eight circuit Leary-Wilson model outlined in
that book, I've long known that the majority of my early imprints have
been on the third (semantic) circuit. Accordingly, I've become prone to
excessive rationalization, and the corresponding communicative
roadblocks that can sometimes occur when dealing with first, second or
fourth circuit types. I think RAW makes a great case for balance among
the first four circuits, since such would allow more possibile
perceptive frameworks through which to experience objective reality. The
Holy Grail, of course, is the ability to switch between perceptive
frameworks at will and in their entirety, allowing conscious exploration
of reality from the standpoint of many different people. This is
attractive in the sense that different people notice and internalize
different things. If we could flip-flop between one perceptive framework
and another, we would have a more accurate picture of the universe than
any single-perspective person can have by themselves. Seems a step in
the right transhuman direction. In fact, the idea of a single
intelligence capable of synthesizing the internalized experiences of
several people seems likely to crop up in nearly any discussion of the
benefits of uploading.

Whether this is possible, I haven't the faintest. So, has anyone
attempted the perception re-training exercises in Prometheus Rising? If
so, with what results?


Thanks,

Keith

Dear EvMick,
No, I don't think you need to get out more.
You seem to get great emotional and intellectual fulfilment
living your life the way you do.
As with all lifestyles I'm sure you've found that yours has more than a few
shortcomings, however. I'm curious as to what you might peceive them to be.

Yes, I agree. Those four lines I posted were confused and I 
appologize for my mistake.

Not even the belief that something broadly like libertarianism is a 
good thing? There has been some debate on whether this list is an
appropriate forum for discussing "basics", and I got the impression 
that this in practice ment arguing about the merits of 
libertarianism. I think several people scolded Erik Moeller about 
that about half a year ago, though I didn't follow the thread very 
closely.

> Certainly, you cannot uphold Spontaneous Order while

As a clarification: Could a person who held the following belief be 
an extropian: "The likely only way to avoid a nanotechnological 
disaster ending life on earth is if there is a world-wide 
dictatorship, where the dictator coerces people into following his 
will. So I believe in dictatorship and coercion"?

Anyhow, I now think the following is an accurate statement of 
the difference between transhumanism and extropianism (though perhaps 
not one that is very useful for newbies):

Extropianism is transhumanism plus the claim that the Extropian 
Principles (by Max More) are right. Thus you can't be an extropian 
without being a transhumanist, but you may be a transhumanist without 
being an extropian.


>There are people who could be called
>transhumanists who apparently do not value critical thinking, and 
>who look to scientifically implausible methods for overcoming human
>limits. As our ideas spread, I expect to see religious versions of
>transhumanism -- Christian Transhumanism, Islamic Transhumanism, and
>(not too far from their current beliefs) Mormon Transhumanism.

I disagree. As you wrote yourself in the Extropian Principles 2.6:

"transhumanism values reason and humanity and sees no grounds for
belief in unknowable, supernatural forces externally controlling our
destiny"

Therefore I don't think that christians, muslims or mormons could be 
transhumanists. I think we should rule that out in our definition of
the term "transhumanism"; otherwise the concept of transhumanism 
degenerates into:

transhumanism = extropianism - balls&brains

which I strongly object to! While I favour keeping the concept of 
transhumanism rather open and inclusive and a bit vague, I think it 
is memetically useless to define it as, say, "any doctrine that we 
can (and should) overcome our biological limitations" without making 
any reference to technology or anything that sets us apart from all 
those religious people who believe in an afterlife or whatever. We 
need a general term to denote people who think *like us* (whether 
more specifically we are extropians or not), and "transhumanism" is 
the best such term we have.

"Islamic Transhumanism" is comparable to "Christian Science".

Has anyone else noticed that when one uses HOTBOT or DEJANEWS to search
for articles on the extropian archive, they are linked up wrong?

<< Dear EvMick,
 No, I don't think you need to get out more.
 You seem to get great emotional and intellectual fulfilment
 living your life the way you do.
 As with all lifestyles I'm sure you've found that yours has more than a few
 shortcomings, however. I'm curious as to what you might peceive them to be.
 Quo Vadis???
 
 AMG

Youre right about the first part..I lead this life cause there's little demand
for  beaver trappers anymore...and I can't find a starship yet...or an
asteroid miner (I"m looking!!)

Regarding the second part...shortcomings....

Thought about that for a little while...and I assume you mean PARTICULAR
shortcomings...unique to my lifestyle....and I can't come up with
any...nothing that the nomadic tribes of the steppes or the horsetribes of the
great plains would see as a problem...or even today's elderly
"snowbirds".....just a nomadic lifestyle...strike "camp" every morning....find
a new one every nite...and anything left behind is gone forever...an
increasingly HI TECH lifestyle....and it's getting easier all the time...

I just recently...no more than a couple of months ago...purchased a new
rig.<brag mode...ON>  She's a 1995 LongNose Peterbilt...300 in wheelbase...90
in custom sleeper...470 hp...18 speed...She's so strong she'll "loaf" at 75
mph turning 1500 rpm on the flats grossing 80,000 lbs...and will barely notice
any but the most significant hill.  I have a refrigerator, TV and VCR
builtin...with more to come as I decide what I need.Climate Control, Cellular
telephone ,LapTop Computer and GPS navigation... <brag mode...OFF>

Like a turtle..I carry my home with me..

My biggest problem...and I'm sure you can guess what's coming...is government
meddling...but that's no different from everyone else's...it's just a little
more visible in my profession.

Course....there's the loneliness...but I'm not as subject to that as most
folks...and I've found that people can be lonely in crowds...city folk are
perhaps more lonely than ranchers...and email and the internet is making a big
dent in that problem..


And I don't know what Quo Vadis means.

The Borg and Dominion of Star Trek, and First Ones of Babylon-5, are
transhuman (well, trans-original-organic-alien.)  They have gone beyond
there previous states through technological means.  Are they extropian?

The Borg are definitely big on Boundless Expansion (so's cancer.  So's a
black hole).  If we ignore the "Borg Queen" stuff they may operate on
Spontaneous Order, like our brains.  Dynamic Optimism, check.
Intelligent Technology, check.  Self Transformation, check.

Oops, checked the text of the Principles.  Don't know if "voluntaristic"
and "diversity" apply even within the Borg.

The Founders of the Dominion have evolved themselves into immortal
shapeshifters who don't always seem to worry about the First Law of
Thermodynamics.  ST check and mate.  SO?  The Great Link qualifies.
They're pretty tolerant among themselves, and if you want to apply
diversity to shapeshifters...  They're not so hot on spontaneity
anywhere else, mostly because they've usually been persecuted by anyone
who could get away with it.  IT?  They use intelligent races as tools.
They don't need much themselves these days, except to move around.
BE?  They've overcome most limits already.

I think most would agree that the Borg aren't extropian, but SO is the
only missing principle.  They're really neat otherwise.  And the
Dominion is even neater -- the only non-extropian thing on them is their
effort to bring all Solids into the Dominion.  Which they see as a
self-defense measure.  And not that pre-emptive, either.

Is being mean to wild intelligences far below you on the tech scale
non-extropian, if you're libertarian among yourselves?  A big question
when AI comes around, and I don't remember a consensus on the list.
Except the AIs aren't wild, but possibly tame or domesticated
intelligences.

} Extropianism is transhumanism plus the claim that the Extropian 
} Principles (by Max More) are right. Thus you can't be an extropian 

I still like my rendition: extropianism is the Enlightenment, updated.
Adam Smith, Darwin, computers, the success of Anglo-American societies
over benevolent dictatorships.

Transhumanism is Renaissance humanism with more toys and broader
horizons.

The Enlightenment was humanist.  Was their non-Englightened humanism?
Uh, I'll pass to Max.

"I think it's amazing that 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult thought
they would beam up to space ships if they killed themselves.  Any
reasonable person knows that in reality they will be reincarnated as
animals.  You might not agree with my belief in reincarnation, but a lot
of people do, so it's not a cult.  There's certainly no evidence that
larger groups of people have ever believed anything stupid.  So once the
number of believers exceeds a certain level, say 40, you have to think
there's something to it.

Unlike those "cultists" I wasn't brainwashed into my beliefs.  I simply
had a huge painful void in my life that I filled with the first thing
that came along.  You have to respect that. I'm not as gullible as those
poor saps.  That's probably because I was born in June, which makes me
a Gemini.  We're naturally skeptical." -- Scott Adams

As the witching hour approaches, greetings.  I enjoyed reading 
everyone's ideas for transhumanist costumes, especially Borg 
Janet Reno!

Me, I'm going as a cyborg tonight, in my very own laminated gold suit 
and helmet, courtesy of SLYX.  Can't sit down in it, can't bend over, 
but hey you have to make some sacrifices.  (The outfit might be in the 
next Skin Two, but we don't know which pictures they plan to use.)  
And a few nights ago I finally agreed to run in our annual Heels Race 
disguised as a drag queen.  Two blocks in high heels, ow ow ow.  I 
passed for awhile before someone recognized me, but they decided that 
drag is drag no matter what basic equipment you are working with.  An 
appropriate attitude, I think!

Sin,

Kathryn
