There is nothing magical about the number 2, it's just the simplest example. 
In your case the universe splits into 5, in 4 of them event A happens in one 
of them event B happens. You split just like everything else and have an 80% 
chance of seeing event A.

 The advantages of such contracts are obvious enough to academics that
you wouldn't accomplish a lot by making a big project out of this -
unless you try to spread this idea to the medical profession. I suspect
you are more suited to swaying academics than hospital managers.

>2) "Explaining Product Bans" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps)

 If you can succeed turning this into a sufficiently convincing
argument that you sway a significant number of academics, then you
would certainly accomplish much more with this project than with
the others, both in terms of promoting freedom and your reputation.
But I'm not convinced you have the beginnings of a powerfull argument
here.

>3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps)

 Probably the safest of the 3 projects. You would probably turn this into
a convincing argument. However, it isn't clear that that would accomplish
a lot.

 I find it hard to understand why people would be more afraid of this
when the life insurance is $100,000 than they are with the current life
insurance level of $0.
 Most people seem to have some awareness that HMOs are currently making
this kind of tradeoff.

Your problem is that you actually need to deal with Cyberpromo =

This is one of many examples of how cyberpromo continues to violate the =
principles of the IEMMC by spoofing addresses and not providing working =
reply addresses.

So far it appears that the IEMMC is a joke or at best unable to control =
Cyberscum and his clients.

I'm not sure what you are saying here, in speaking of three different
versions of yourself (the one which measures Spin up, the one which
measures Spin down, and *this* one).

You may be asking something like the following:  I am about to make
a quantum measurement, which has two possible outcomes, spin up and
spin down.  We have prepared the system so that quantum theory predicts
that the spin up outcome will occur with probability 99%, spin down with
probability 1%.  I make the measurement, and as we know, most of the
time it comes out spin up.

Yet, in some versions of the many-worlds interpretation, the world is
said to split into two parts when I make the measurement, so afterwards
there are two instances of me where before there was one.  Since there
are two, subjectively there should have been a 50% chance that I would
find myself in one particular one of them.  This contradicts the 99%
chance which I actually observe.

I may be missing your point in simplifying the argument to this point,
because it does not seem to me to carry much weight.  A priori there
is no more reason to expect the splitting phenomenon to give equal
probabilities to finding yourself in one of the two outcomes than to
give 99% or any other probability.  The mere fact that one went to two
does not imply that the two outcomes have equal measure in any sense.

Actually, in Everett's paper he did not consider these kinds of discrete
measurements, which lend themselves to these somewhat misleading (IMO)
counting arguments.  He discussed the continuous case, where the measurement
had an infinite number of possible outcomes.  There, it is necessary to
use an integral rather than a simple sum to describe the state function.
And it is natural then to introduce a measure function to weight the
various branches of the state function.  You then derive the probability
of an observed outcome by integrating the measure function over the range
of all parameters which produce that specified outcome.

A simple counting argument for numbers of worlds can't work if there
are infinite numbers in all classes.  If you want to apply the counting
argument to the continuous case, what you have to do is in effect to come
up with your own measure function, one which is not based on the amplitude
but which is a constant.  It is much less clear in this case that this
measure function is a priori the right one.  Rather, the measure function
to be used must be specified explicitly as part of the interpretation.

It is not a strong argument to say that the Everett interpration must be
wrong because it uses a different measure function than one which may
strike you as a priori correct.  Bryce De Witt thinks Everett's measure
function is a priori correct!  Both views are mistaken, IMO.

Again, to explain how I interpret this argument, we can consider the
measurement above to be repeated many times.  If you assume that one
split occurs with each measurement, then after, say, 20 measurements,
only the branch which measured spin up every time has high probability.
Yet only one of the 2^20 possible branches is this one.

As before, the reply is simply that all the branches do not have equal
measure and equal probability.  We must assume that the probability,
the weight, of a branch is measured by the square of the amplitude
associated with that branch.

As I wrote in my earlier message, this is an additional postulate which
must be added to the strict Schrodinger equation in order to derive
the observed results.  I believe that it is nevertheless much simpler
and more plausible than the projection postulate of conventional QM,
which it replaces.

Why ask why?  This must be postulated.  Is it plausible that subjective
probability follows the square of the amplitude?  There are arguments
in favor of it.  Everett showed that the only worlds which would observe
probabilities consistently violating the predictions of QM have amplitude
approaching zero.  I think it is a plausible axiom to suggest that
worlds with amplitude zero are not experienced.  But it is an axiom,
and it is not right to ask "why" it happens.  You might as well ask why
the Schrodinger equation works.

I've seen this suggestion, but I don't think it is economical or necessary.
In my opinion the measure/probability postulate solves the problem
adequately, based on the arguments I described above.

I am referring to the "Copenhagen" interpretation, which suggests that
there are two kinds of processes which govern the time evolution of
dynamical systems: in isolation, the system follows the Schrodinger
equation, which describes the deterministic evolution of the state
function; and when measured, the system's state changes discontinuously
and randomly to one of the possible measured values, with probability
based on the square of the amplitude of that value's component in the
state function.

Well OK, but I don't understand why this is an "objection". If nature deals 
in irrational numbers then that's just the way it is and ANY interpretation 
must deal with it. There may indeed be a random element in determining how 
many universes get made, there is some randomness in almost all physical 
phenomenon, I don't see why Everett should feel more guilty about it than
anybody else.

One more thing, if modern physics has taught us anything it is that the 
absurdity of something tells us nothing about it's truth.

This is an objection to the popularized notion of "many worlds" rather
than to Everett's original idea of eliminating state function reduction.
IMO you can't take this "universe splitting" idea that literally.  What I
prefer is to suggest that the effect of the decoherence (and resulting
independence) of branches of the state function is "as though" the universe
were splitting.  But there is only one state function; what changes is
which part of it you can interact with.

So the problem with counting the "number of worlds" is not really a
serious objection against Everett's ideas.  As I wrote in my other
message, Everett actually worked with the continuous form of the state
function throughout, so he would have had an infinite number of worlds
right off the bat, if he were using that term (he never says "worlds").

A good, accessible article comparing the popular many-worlds interpretation
with Everett's original relative-state formulation is Am. J. Phys 58 (9),
September 1990, p. 829.  (Am. J. Phys. is a relatively non-technical journal
for physics teachers and students.)  Among the arguments against MW in
the popular form is that it violates conservation of mass, since new
universes are being created all the time.  This is really a matter of
misunderstanding Everett's key idea.

 Dear Friend,

          <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
                     YOU WANT TO READ THIS!!!!!!!!
          <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>


 (... this message is from Jonathon Myers who followed the instructions
  presented here precisely for the potential to earn $50,000 within
  90 days ... please read on ... )


	The enclosed information is something that I almost passed up!
 Fortunately I saved the mail message and a few weeks later decided to read
 the mail message again, I did some math (I'm good at math) and  THE RESULTS
 WERE ASTOUNDING.

 My name is Jonathon and one evening I was sitting at my computer to read my
 mail (just like your doing) and I got a letter telling me that I WOULD BE
 MAKING $50,000 WITHIN 90 DAYS.  Naturally I was extemely skeptical, but I
 decided to read on (the full message when printed was seven pages long!).
 After reading the entire message I thought it sounds good but I'd be crazy
 to think that it would work.  So I put it away and kept on going with my
 evening.  A few weeks later, I was sitting at dinner with my wife and we
 were talking (arguing really) about bills (we're not poor but sometimes
 things get a little tight.)  That evening when I sat down to read my mail,
 I decided to look over this message again.  This time I gave it some
 serious thought, after doing a bit of math I realized that I WOULD BE CRAZY
 NOT TO TRY IT.  I already had everything that I would need to make it work,
 my total cost would be less than a night out (movie and dinner), and it was
 incredibly simple!!!!

 I didn't ask for this (we'll kind of - if you count prayers), I didn't send
 out for this, someone just got my name off a mailing list, THANK GOODNESS
 FOR THAT!!!!!.  What I finally realized on my second reading is that here
 is A MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON that I could invest as much as I wanted to
 start, without putting me further behind on my bills.  Also, at the very
 least I would definitely not lose anything.  After I determined that THIS
 IS COMPLETELY LEGAL, not some chain letter, I WENT FOR IT!!!

 At first I sent out 20,000 mailings.  It only cost me $35.00 for the
 names.  The great thing about email is that I didn't need any money for
 postage or printing, only the cost to fulfill my orders.  At this point I
 would like to apologize if you're someone that is normally turned off by
 this type of marketing (believe it or not, I am - or at least I was).
 Please, read on.

 Within a week of sending out my first message, I began receiving orders for:

 REPORT # 1.  Within 2 weeks I had received over 20 orders for REPORT # 1.
 You must receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT # 1 within 2 weeks.  If you
 don't, send out more programs until you do!  The first step toward reaching
 my goal was met. Within a month I had received almost 150 orders for report
 # 2.  If you don't get at least 100 orders send out more programs until you
 do!  Once you've reached that goal you can relax, YOU WILL MAKE AT LEAST
 $50,000 GUARANTEED !!!!!!!!!!!

 In a little bit over three months I had made over $54,000 cash with more
 coming in every day!!!!!

 Needless to say, since then my wife and I have had very few "discussions"
 about bills!!  This thing has completely changed my life.  Please take a
 moment to read the attached program, IT WILL LITERALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE
 FOREVER (I promise)!!!  This program truly does work, I am living proof -
 flesh and blood sitting at a computer terminal just like you, however YOU
 MUST FOLLOW IT EXACTLY, let me say that again YOU MUST FOLLOW IT EXACTLY.

 Should you decide not to participate in this program, I'm truly sorry.
 This truly is A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY.  At the very least I would ask that
 you save this program to read again later, what you'll do may surprise you!
 For those of you who are crazy enough to know that you would be crazy not
 to try this, READ ON (Did that make any sense?).

	   	Sincerely,
	         Jonathon Myers

 ----------------------------------------------------
 A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
 ----------------------------------------------------

 "By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
 enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that it is legal,
 and could not have been created by an amateur.

 Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business for ten
 years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was doing the same
 things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working.
 Finally, I had figured it out.  It wasn't me, it was the economy, inflation
 and recession had replaced a stable economy that had been with us since
 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
 rate...because many of you know from first hand experience.  There were
 more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.

 The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing
 invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not including those who never
 had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the
 poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER."
 The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "move up"
 or "get rich," inflation will see to that.  You have just received
 information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life,
 with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."  You can make more money
 in the next few months than you ever imagined.

 I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
 anyone else that has provided a testimonial for this program I have already
 made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after
 sending out over 18,000 programs.  Now I have several offices which market
 this and several other programs here in the US and overseas.  By spring, we
 wish to market the 'Internet' by a partnership with AMERICA ON LINE.

 Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way, it
 works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to email a copy of this
 exciting program to everyone to everyone that you can think of.  One of the
 people you send this to may send out 50,000, and your name will be on every
 one of them! Remember though the more you send out, the more potential
 customers you will reach.

 So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, material, and
 opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

 "THINK ABOUT IT"

 Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a
 little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and figure
 out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the worst possible
 response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of
 money!  Definitely get back what you invested.  Any doubts you have will
 vanish when your first orders come in.  IT WORKS!

 "THREW IT AWAY"

 "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away, but later
 wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who
 to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was emailed another copy
 of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it came.  I DIDN'T throw this
 one away.  I made $41,000 on the first try."

 "NO FREE LUNCH"

 "My late father always told me, 'remember, Alan, there is no free lunch in
 life.  You get out of life what you put into it.'  Through trial and error
 and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I finally figured it out. The program
 works very well, I just had to find the right target group of people to
 email it to.  So far this year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.
 I know my dad would have been very proud of me."

 ----------------------------------------------------
 HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$
 ----------------------------------------------------

 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll
 assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each. Let's also
 assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a good list the
 response could be much better.  Also many people will send out hundreds of
 thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But continuing with this example,
 you send out only 2,000 programs.  With a .5% response, that is only 10
 orders for REPORT #1.  Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs
each
 for a total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order
 REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000.
 The 5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.  Those 1,000 send
 out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The .5% response to that
 is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000 five dollar bills for you.
 CASH!!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000
 for a total of $55,550!!!!

 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO
 WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A
 MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS
 INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me, many people will do that and more!  By
 the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing.  You
 obviously already have an Internet connection and email is FREE!!!
 REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing
 email lists.

 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not require
 you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you
 never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If you believe that
 someday you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, THIS IS IT!
 Simply follow the instructions, and your dream will come true.  This
 multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.
 Email is the sales tool of the future.  Take advantage of this
 non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the
 more people will be doing business using email.
 Get your piece of this action!!

 MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is being
 taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and The
 Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and
 services will be sold throughout Multi-level Methods by the mid to late
 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last
 several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics show 45 people become
 millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.


 --------------
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 --------------

 We at Erris Mail Order Marketing Business, have a method of raising capital
 that REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME.  I am sure that you could use $50,000 to
 $125,000 in the next 20 to 90 days.  Before you say "Bull", please read the
 program carefully.

 This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity.
 Basically, this is what we do:  As with all multi-level business, we build
 our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every
 state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi- level business partners,
 and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent.

 YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE MAIL, so you are not
 involved in personal selling.  You do it privately in your own home,
 store or office.

 This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:

 Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  Do this
            by ordering the REPORT from each of the four 4 names listed
            on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 CASH and a SELF-
            ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS SIZE #10) to the
            person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  International orders
            should also include $1 extra for postage.  It is essential
            that you specify the NAME and NUMBER of the report requested
            to the person you are ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR
            4 REPORTS because you will be REPRINTING and RESELLING them.
            DO NOT alter the names or sequence other than what the
            instructions say.  IMPORTANT:  Always provide same-day
            service on all orders.

 Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with
            yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
            Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,
            moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and
            address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list
            and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  When
            doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  and
            addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT
            POSITIONS!!!

 Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it
            as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used with
            whatever email program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 will tell
            you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email
            lists.

 Step (4)   Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very
            important) to everyone whose address you can get your hands
            on. Start with friends and relatives since you can encourage
            them to take  advantage of this  fabulous  money-making
            opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, more
            than ever.  Then, email to anyone and everyone!  Use your
            imagination!  You can get email addresses from companies on
            the Internet who specialize in email mailing lists.  These
            are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.

 IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so always
 request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase these lists
 when you order the four 4 REPORTS.

 ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

 REQUIRED REPORTS

 ***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

 ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE AND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER

 =====================================================================

 ----------
 CONCLUSION
 ----------

 I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this program. You too,
 will be making money in 20 to 90 days, if you follow the SIMPLE STEPS
 outlined in this mailing.

 To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make financial
 decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into investments, retire
 or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of money hold you back.

 However, very few people reach financial independence, because when
 opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is much easier to say
 "NO" than "YES", and this is the question that you must answer.  Will YOU
 ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it? If you do
 nothing, you have indeed missed something and nothing will change.  Please
 re-read this material, this is a special opportunity. If you have any
 questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this information.
 You will get a prompt and informative reply.

 My method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that costs
 me pennies to produce and email.  I should also point out that this program
 is legal and everyone who participates WILL make money. This is not a chain
 letter or pyramid scam.  At times you have probably received chain letters,
 asking you to send money, on faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO
 product what-so-ever!  Not only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of
 someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive.

 You are offering a legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase
 the product from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free
 enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is a
 series of four 4 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information contained
 in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your participation in this
 program more rewarding, but will be useful to you in any other business
 decisions you make in the years ahead. You are also buying the rights to
 reprint all of the REPORTS, which will be ordered from you by those to whom
 you mail this program.  The concise one and two page REPORTS you will be
 buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost off about
 3 cents a copy. Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!


 "IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"

 "Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to
 participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I decided that the
 initial investment was so little that there was no way that I could not get
 enough orders to at least get my money back.  BOY, was I ever surprised when
 I found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders!  I will make
 more money this year than any ten years of my life before."

                                        Mary Riceland, Lansing, MI

 -----------------
 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
 -----------------

 Send for your four 4 REPORTS immediately so you will have them when the
 orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the
 product/service to comply with US Postal and Lottery laws. Title 18 Sections
 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE
 EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."

 WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:

 1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you desire.

 2.      Get a post office box (preferred).

 3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember,
         your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the others all
         move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the list.

 4.      Obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you
         receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT #3.

 5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  The
         more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money
         you will make.

 6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.

 7.      Copy the four 4 REPORTS so you are able to sent them out as
         soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE
         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!

 8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.


 YOUR GUARANTEE

 The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you must
 receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't
 within two weeks, email out more programs until you do.  Then a couple of
 weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2, if you
 don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once you have received 100 or
 more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep breath) you can sit back and relax,
 because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO  MAKE  AT  LEAST  $50,000.

 Mathematically  it  is  a  proven  guarantee.   Of  those  who  have
 participated in the program and reached the above GUARANTEES-ALL have
 reached their $50,000 goal.  Also, remember, every time your name is moved
 down the list you are in front of a different REPORT, so you can keep track
 of your program by knowing what people are ordering from you.
 IT'S THAT EASY, REALLY, IT IS!!!

Found in _Rogue Queen_ (1951), a novel by Sprague de Camp:

	The Terrans had spread a dead leipag [native animal] out on 
	the ground and taken the beast thoroughly apart. ... Bloch was
	removing all the muscles and organs ....  Every few seconds he
	stopped to dictate notes to Barbe, or to tell her to draw a
	sketch or point a camera at the remains ....

If that were written after 1980, Bloch wouldn't have a human assistant:
he'd have a head-mounted camera, which responds to coded movements of
his jaw or eyelids, and a microphone feeding either an AI or a tape.

Anybody want to improve my guess of 1980 as the transition date?

Only tanks filled with liquid nitrogen are acceptable, though I'm no
hurry to get into one. Besides, I don't dislike other otters for the
colour of eir fur or the shape of eir tail, but for the wrongness
of eir memes and the unwillingness to change in the face of overwhelming
evidence that the path they follow leads to certain 
death and destruction.

I would guess it is to avoid EM-noise; modern processors work at such
frequencies that they get into the radio spectrum easily. As was
pointed out, this can be a serious problem for some devices. I'm not
that worried about pacemakers, modern pacemakers have a system that
turns them the the "default" 70 bpm if their sensors appear to go
nut, but there are many other systems that can get disrupted this
way. An extropian might even consider spreading EM-noise an
infringement on privacy.

Are you sure the FCC are outlawing *all* home building, or just
outlawing home building which doesn't meet the standards? There is a
big difference between the two, although following the standards can
of course be very tricky.

Small insects have around a thousand neurons. Assuming 10^3 Hz update
frequency and 10^3 synapses each, we need on the order of 10^10 flops
for uploading a real time insect. Not that far from what we can do
today, although it would be impractical. This is a high upper bound
on the complexity of an insect animat; most functions can be done
much more easily as can be seen in robotics labs over the world. So
my guess is that a few megaflops of computing power might be enough.
The size of the computer will depend on the available technology;
today it would be hard to make a clever enough insect-animat, but in
a few years it should be quite doable.

Smarts isn't really needed, cunning is better. Insects are stupid,
but they can do great evasive flying and very complex manipulation
based on simple, interconnected responses. A cell repair device could
just move around randomly, avoiding things that could be damaged 
by it until it found something that was damaged, then it would fix
it. No more brain than a simple insect; I guess you could get that
power into a 100nm side cube.

Similarities in looks are rather irrelevant, and while personality
facts are important for intelligence they are not as tightly bound to
genetics as you make it sound. 

According to Bouchard et al 1990, Bouchard & McGue 1981 we have the
following correlations in intelligence (as measured by IQ tests)
between: 

Identical twins reared together		0.86
Identical twins reared apart		0.75
Nonidentical twins reared together	0.57
Siblings reared together		0.45
Siblings reared apart			0.21
Parent-Offspring reared by parent	0.36
Parent-Offspring not reared by parent	0.20
Adopting Parent-Offspring		0.19
Adopted children reared together	0.02

A correlation of 0.75 may sound like a dramatic similarity, until you
realize that this means roughly 50% of the variance in intelligence
can be attributed to genetics. 

Note that a lot of this genetic variance also is fairly tangential:
if you have genes giving you a better immune system there is a good
chance that you will be able to develop your mind more than if you
are constantly plagued by infections.

 Dear Friend,

          <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
                     YOU WANT TO READ THIS!!!!!!!!
          <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>


 (... this message is from Jonathon Myers who followed the instructions
  presented here precisely for the potential to earn $50,000 within
  90 days ... please read on ... )


	The enclosed information is something that I almost passed up!
 Fortunately I saved the mail message and a few weeks later decided to read
 the mail message again, I did some math (I'm good at math) and  THE RESULTS
 WERE ASTOUNDING.

 My name is Jonathon and one evening I was sitting at my computer to read my
 mail (just like your doing) and I got a letter telling me that I WOULD BE
 MAKING $50,000 WITHIN 90 DAYS.  Naturally I was extemely skeptical, but I
 decided to read on (the full message when printed was seven pages long!).
 After reading the entire message I thought it sounds good but I'd be crazy
 to think that it would work.  So I put it away and kept on going with my
 evening.  A few weeks later, I was sitting at dinner with my wife and we
 were talking (arguing really) about bills (we're not poor but sometimes
 things get a little tight.)  That evening when I sat down to read my mail,
 I decided to look over this message again.  This time I gave it some
 serious thought, after doing a bit of math I realized that I WOULD BE CRAZY
 NOT TO TRY IT.  I already had everything that I would need to make it work,
 my total cost would be less than a night out (movie and dinner), and it was
 incredibly simple!!!!

 I didn't ask for this (we'll kind of - if you count prayers), I didn't send
 out for this, someone just got my name off a mailing list, THANK GOODNESS
 FOR THAT!!!!!.  What I finally realized on my second reading is that here
 is A MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON that I could invest as much as I wanted to
 start, without putting me further behind on my bills.  Also, at the very
 least I would definitely not lose anything.  After I determined that THIS
 IS COMPLETELY LEGAL, not some chain letter, I WENT FOR IT!!!

 At first I sent out 20,000 mailings.  It only cost me $35.00 for the
 names.  The great thing about email is that I didn't need any money for
 postage or printing, only the cost to fulfill my orders.  At this point I
 would like to apologize if you're someone that is normally turned off by
 this type of marketing (believe it or not, I am - or at least I was).
 Please, read on.

 Within a week of sending out my first message, I began receiving orders for:

 REPORT # 1.  Within 2 weeks I had received over 20 orders for REPORT # 1.
 You must receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT # 1 within 2 weeks.  If you
 don't, send out more programs until you do!  The first step toward reaching
 my goal was met. Within a month I had received almost 150 orders for report
 # 2.  If you don't get at least 100 orders send out more programs until you
 do!  Once you've reached that goal you can relax, YOU WILL MAKE AT LEAST
 $50,000 GUARANTEED !!!!!!!!!!!

 In a little bit over three months I had made over $54,000 cash with more
 coming in every day!!!!!

 Needless to say, since then my wife and I have had very few "discussions"
 about bills!!  This thing has completely changed my life.  Please take a
 moment to read the attached program, IT WILL LITERALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE
 FOREVER (I promise)!!!  This program truly does work, I am living proof -
 flesh and blood sitting at a computer terminal just like you, however YOU
 MUST FOLLOW IT EXACTLY, let me say that again YOU MUST FOLLOW IT EXACTLY.

 Should you decide not to participate in this program, I'm truly sorry.
 This truly is A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY.  At the very least I would ask that
 you save this program to read again later, what you'll do may surprise you!
 For those of you who are crazy enough to know that you would be crazy not
 to try this, READ ON (Did that make any sense?).

	   	Sincerely,
	         Jonathon Myers

 ----------------------------------------------------
 A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
 ----------------------------------------------------

 "By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
 enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that it is legal,
 and could not have been created by an amateur.

 Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business for ten
 years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was doing the same
 things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working.
 Finally, I had figured it out.  It wasn't me, it was the economy, inflation
 and recession had replaced a stable economy that had been with us since
 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
 rate...because many of you know from first hand experience.  There were
 more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.

 The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing
 invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not including those who never
 had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the
 poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER."
 The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "move up"
 or "get rich," inflation will see to that.  You have just received
 information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life,
 with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."  You can make more money
 in the next few months than you ever imagined.

 I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
 anyone else that has provided a testimonial for this program I have already
 made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after
 sending out over 18,000 programs.  Now I have several offices which market
 this and several other programs here in the US and overseas.  By spring, we
 wish to market the 'Internet' by a partnership with AMERICA ON LINE.

 Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way, it
 works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to email a copy of this
 exciting program to everyone to everyone that you can think of.  One of the
 people you send this to may send out 50,000, and your name will be on every
 one of them! Remember though the more you send out, the more potential
 customers you will reach.

 So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, material, and
 opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

 "THINK ABOUT IT"

 Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a
 little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and figure
 out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the worst possible
 response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of
 money!  Definitely get back what you invested.  Any doubts you have will
 vanish when your first orders come in.  IT WORKS!

 LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE:

 If you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like I
 was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign.  I DID!

                                        Sincerely,
                                        Christopher Erickson

 PS  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up
 on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "THREW IT AWAY"

 "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away, but later
 wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who
 to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was emailed another copy
 of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it came.  I DIDN'T throw this
 one away.  I made $41,000 on the first try."

                                        Dawn W., Evansville, IN

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "NO FREE LUNCH"

 "My late father always told me, 'remember, Alan, there is no free lunch in
 life.  You get out of life what you put into it.'  Through trial and error
 and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I finally figured it out. The program
 works very well, I just had to find the right target group of people to
 email it to.  So far this year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.
 I know my dad would have been very proud of me."

 HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$
 ----------------------------------------------------

 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll
 assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each. Let's also
 assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a good list the
 response could be much better.  Also many people will send out hundreds of
 thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But continuing with this example,
 you send out only 2,000 programs.  With a .5% response, that is only 10
 orders for REPORT #1.  Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs
each
 for a total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order
 REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000.
 The 5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.  Those 1,000 send
 out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The .5% response to that
 is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000 five dollar bills for you.
 CASH!!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000
 for a total of $55,550!!!!

 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO
 WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A
 MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS
 INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me, many people will do that and more!  By
 the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing.  You
 obviously already have an Internet connection and email is FREE!!!
 REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing
 email lists.

 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not require
 you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you
 never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If you believe that
 someday you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, THIS IS IT!
 Simply follow the instructions, and your dream will come true.  This
 multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.
 Email is the sales tool of the future.  Take advantage of this
 non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the
 more people will be doing business using email.
 Get your piece of this action!!

 MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is being
 taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and The
 Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and
 services will be sold throughout Multi-level Methods by the mid to late
 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last
 several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics show 45 people become
 millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.


 --------------
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 --------------

 We at Erris Mail Order Marketing Business, have a method of raising capital
 that REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME.  I am sure that you could use $50,000 to
 $125,000 in the next 20 to 90 days.  Before you say "Bull", please read the
 program carefully.

 This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity.
 Basically, this is what we do:  As with all multi-level business, we build
 our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every
 state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi- level business partners,
 and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent.

 YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE MAIL, so you are not
 involved in personal selling.  You do it privately in your own home,
 store or office.

 This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:

 Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  Do this
            by ordering the REPORT from each of the four 4 names listed
            on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 CASH and a SELF-
            ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS SIZE #10) to the
            person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  International orders
            should also include $1 extra for postage.  It is essential
            that you specify the NAME and NUMBER of the report requested
            to the person you are ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR
            4 REPORTS because you will be REPRINTING and RESELLING them.
            DO NOT alter the names or sequence other than what the
            instructions say.  IMPORTANT:  Always provide same-day
            service on all orders.

 Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with
            yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
            Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,
            moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and
            address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list
            and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  When
            doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  and
            addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT
            POSITIONS!!!

 Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it
            as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used with
            whatever email program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 will tell
            you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email
            lists.

 Step (4)   Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very
            important) to everyone whose address you can get your hands
            on. Start with friends and relatives since you can encourage
            them to take  advantage of this  fabulous  money-making
            opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, more
            than ever.  Then, email to anyone and everyone!  Use your
            imagination!  You can get email addresses from companies on
            the Internet who specialize in email mailing lists.  These
            are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.

 IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so always
 request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase these lists
 when you order the four 4 REPORTS.

 ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

 REQUIRED REPORTS

 ***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

 ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE AND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER

 ----------
 CONCLUSION
 ----------

 I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this program. You too,
 will be making money in 20 to 90 days, if you follow the SIMPLE STEPS
 outlined in this mailing.

 To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make financial
 decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into investments, retire
 or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of money hold you back.

 However, very few people reach financial independence, because when
 opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is much easier to say
 "NO" than "YES", and this is the question that you must answer.  Will YOU
 ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it? If you do
 nothing, you have indeed missed something and nothing will change.  Please
 re-read this material, this is a special opportunity. If you have any
 questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this information.
 You will get a prompt and informative reply.

 My method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that costs
 me pennies to produce and email.  I should also point out that this program
 is legal and everyone who participates WILL make money. This is not a chain
 letter or pyramid scam.  At times you have probably received chain letters,
 asking you to send money, on faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO
 product what-so-ever!  Not only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of
 someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive.

 You are offering a legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase
 the product from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free
 enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is a
 series of four 4 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information contained
 in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your participation in this
 program more rewarding, but will be useful to you in any other business
 decisions you make in the years ahead. You are also buying the rights to
 reprint all of the REPORTS, which will be ordered from you by those to whom
 you mail this program.  The concise one and two page REPORTS you will be
 buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost off about
 3 cents a copy. Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!


 "IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"

 "Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to
 participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I decided that the
 initial investment was so little that there was no way that I could not get
 enough orders to at least get my money back.  BOY, was I ever surprised when
 I found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders!  I will make
 more money this year than any ten years of my life before."

                                        Mary Riceland, Lansing, MI

 -----------------
 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
 -----------------

 Send for your four 4 REPORTS immediately so you will have them when the
 orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the
 product/service to comply with US Postal and Lottery laws. Title 18 Sections
 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE
 EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."

 WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:

 1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you desire.

 2.      Get a post office box (preferred).

 3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember,
         your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the others all
         move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the list.

 4.      Obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you
         receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT #3.

 5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  The
         more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money
         you will make.

 6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.

 7.      Copy the four 4 REPORTS so you are able to sent them out as
         soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE
         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!

 8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.


 YOUR GUARANTEE

 The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you must
 receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't
 within two weeks, email out more programs until you do.  Then a couple of
 weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2, if you
 don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once you have received 100 or
 more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep breath) you can sit back and relax,
 because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO  MAKE  AT  LEAST  $50,000.

 Mathematically  it  is  a  proven  guarantee.   Of  those  who  have
 participated in the program and reached the above GUARANTEES-ALL have
 reached their $50,000 goal.  Also, remember, every time your name is moved
 down the list you are in front of a different REPORT, so you can keep track
 of your program by knowing what people are ordering from you.
 IT'S THAT EASY, REALLY, IT IS!!!

I seem to recall that certain British generals had their warriors - the
supposed flower of the Empire - repeatedly charge dug-in German troops
armed with machine guns.  Luckily the Empire had more fine young men to
kill than the Zulu Chief.  Didn't stop it `going extinct', of course,
eventually.

Hang on, John - an *irrational number of diverging worlds*?  

I think this shows that analogical thinking (here, analogical *digital*
thinking  :) ) has been pushed too far by forcing a `realistic' reading of
the Everett model.

Conclusion:  Just observing... But the libertarians *will*  win 
(not just  in this small aspect, since the related psycho-social  
problems are larger and deeper than they seems...) ... Always with 
inteligence, diplomacy and... politenesss... 

Obs: Sense of humor  is  always a  good "memory refreshing" option  
("mem." refreshing.. hehehe) for those having a better emotional 
equilibrium (and because of it, get "to come and go" easily...), 
principally when use a lot - and efficiently - their brains...).
(I go on after cause some old p-n junctions are burning....hahaha)

Almost certainly?  By what standard?  

The study Kennita referred to actually did measure the contribution of
post-natal environment, genes, and pre-natal environment on IQ (not
intelligence in general, which is a more complex thing).  This showed that
the genes were #2 on the list; less important that post-natal environment.

Do you have any evidence to back up your contention?

Yes, I have often been thinking about seceeding from homo sapiens and
starting my new species. Unfortunately, for the moment that would be
mainly a gesture and a rather ineffectual one for that matter. Of
course, if a lot of transhumanists together began to talk about
seceeding, things might be different. 

One problem is that the majority would not like these ideas one bit.

One cannot define a species into existence; it has to evolve. A paper
describing homo cyber would either be a post fact description, or an
attempt to prescribe a certain path. What about the transhumanists
who, for whatever reason, decide to evolve in another direction? I
don't think the future belongs to one species, I believe it belongs
to a whole taxum.

I agree with you on this; there is no point forcing our values onto
others just as we don't want values forced upon us. That is why a
separation may be a good thing, but usually separations also lead to
conflicts (when you encounter the Xs daily, it is harder to become
prejudiced against them than if you rarely meet them).

No. For example, most of the time the world dives into exactly 2, on rare  
occasions with irrational probability it divides into exactly 3. The 
probability  of seeing the event is an irrational number a little greater
than 2 but less than 3. I never said Everett was deterministic and got rid of

Many writers of the secular/humanist variety are dedicated to such
conventional ideals as unselfishness and sacrifice.  In some cases,
that may be why they are able to devote so much energy to the efforts
which have brought them to your attention.  Of course, they are "only
human", and so they have more personal goals as well, but they often
view these as flaws, and aspire to identify more with the group's goals
than with their own individual ones.  To them, cryonics is a crime of
the highest order.  By striving to avoid death, the great leveler,
practitioners are in effect setting themselves above the rest of human
society.

The result is that the typical secular humanist is one of the least likely
candidates for cryonics.  This would apply to Asimov and Sagan in the
list above.  I seem to recall some claims that Feynman was skeptical about
the workability of the idea.  (If true, as one of the founders of the idea
of nanotechnology this should give us all pause.)  Clarke does not come
across as a bleeding-heart liberal like Asimov, so I don't know what his
thoughts would be about it.

The thing is they didn't happen and for any of them to happen you're changing
more than one thing, you're changing everything... everything is a
consequence of everything that happened before it.  There's no escape!!

For instance: Let's say we flip a coin, there's a 50% possibility of heads
right!?  Possibility is something we have made to explain complex systems,
which we don't understand, can't observe or can't measure.  In reality that
coin is heads was heads and will always be heads.  50,000 years ago that
particular coin, in that place, at that time, in my hand was going to be
heads.  If we knew everything about that coin we would know that it was going
to be heads.  Of course, we can't predict the future because we can't know
the position of everything.

Do you get the same result if you only send one photon through one slot?  Or
do you have to send two photons through both the slots at different times?
 Also, surely there are more than two probabilities (the two slots) there are
near-infinite probabilities (going through the slot at different angles,
hitting the thing with the slots in, going in the opposite direction...).
 All of these seem just as likely as the photon going through one slot or the
other.  So then, we only get new worlds from possibilities we measure.  But
to measure our photon in this world surely the photon must be in this world
(or can photons and electrons pass between worlds?).  If I happen to move a
piece of film in the way of one of the many (possibly infinite) paths of the
photon I'll measure it and therefore create a new universe.  Now with all
these phantom photons floating about, sooner or later a large majority of
them are going to get measured in some way (Which could lead you to the
conclusion that a single photon radiates in a sphere but is only detectable
by measurement).  We whould be getting a  rate of millions of worlds per
photon (anyone want to estimate the amount of photons, the amount of
directions each could move in and how likely they are to be measured given
the size of space and the number of possible measuring devices within it?).

Question:  Why don't more operating systems come with built in programming
languages and compilers?

Note to Unix users: Yes it is great!

Most modern operating systems don't come with a built in programming language
and compiler, gone are the days when all computers had a BASIC prompt
(memories!).  This is probably because today's OS is meant to be simple and
user friendly.  But I think users have a right to create their own software
without having to buy any expensive compilers, etc.

When I buy a car, I can pull it apart, make modifications and remove parts to
put in other cars.  Yet when I buy software all I can do is what the software
allows me to do.  I can't see how it works, I can't super charge it and I
can't change the colour.

Here's my idea: Build an object oriented visual operating system (not a
operating system with a GUI strapped on but a visual software environment).
 Create a simple object system that allows all objects to inherit simple
properties with zero programming (If it's not attached you can move it).
 Include tools for editing text and objects (all tools can edit all documents
and objects, no more applications).  Users can build (rather than program)
there own tools or they can buy third party-tools.  When they buy third-party
tools they're allowed unrestricted access to modify them how they like (by
sub-classing, so they don't have to see the precious code).

Now, you could say this is the way operating systems are going, or even the
way they are (if you buy the right applications).  But I think the ability to
create should be built into operating systems at the lowest possible level.
 We need software environments where we can manipulate and create objects
directly rather than using bulky applications.

This has a deeper meaning than just allowing anyone to create software (and
thus insuring a healthy supply of programmers).  It is also important for the
future of computing and the _death of the software industry_ (cue Jaws
music)

As computers progress, they will reach a point where we <gasp> no longer need
to buy software (or download it from the net).  Instead, you the user will
program your own computer via voice recognition/understanding and, through
Artificial Intelligence your computer will program itself.  No software
applications, just a pool of reusable components and agents that are clipped
together as you speak.  To get to this wonderful utopian freeware future we
need to point ourselves in the right direction

--Wax

P.S. Okay I'll admit it I'm using Windows, yeah I'm a hypocrite, could
someone point me in the direction of freeware land... I seem to be lost!

No, I don't think this kind of tradeoff occurs now with an HMO.  If the
HMO was strictly working on the basis of spending the least money, it
would refuse to authorize any medical treatments to anyone.  This way it
would have zero expenses and make lots of money from the insurance premiums.

Of course, it can't do this, first because it wouldn't have any customers,
second because it would be a breach of contract, and third because it
would probably be illegal in the regulated medical industry.  Instead,
the HMO promises to fund all treatments which are accepted by the medical
profession as justified in terms of extending the life and improving
the health of the patient.  When it refuses to authorize a procedure,
it is with the excuse that it is experimental or that it will not help.
It never says that the treatment costs more than the patient's life is
worth.  If it does refuse medicine which is valid by the stated rules,
the patient can use various appeal and arbitration procedures to contest
the refusal.

So the current situation with an HMO is very different than it would
be under Robin's proposal.  Under that plan in its purest form, the
HMO might very well refuse a helpful medical procedure, if the expense
would be greater than the life insurance payment.  The contractual basis
between the HMO and patient is very different.  A refusal on the basis
of expense would be completely justified by the HMO.  In fact, if the
HMO got into cash flow difficulties, it might even refuse procedures
which would be cost effective, as long as the death of the patient due
to lack of treatment would not occur too soon (borrowing from tomorrow
to pay for today).  None of this would be contestable by the patient,
because the contract would allow the HMO to do whatever it wanted with
the money, relying on the life insurance payment to give it incentives
to extend its patients' lives.

I'm not saying this plan is necessarily a bad idea, merely that the
incentives and the nature of the patient-HMO relationship would be very
different than under the current system.

Try to avoid The Lawnmower Man 2, they decided to go down the route of "VR's
now so good it looks just like real life" and the whole film consists of kids
pretending to fly in front of a blue screen.

The best way to get a point across is to ignore black and white, and go for a
nice fuzzy grey.  Several themes have crossed my mind:  

1.  A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'
movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into
someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of his
opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of showing the
government through the eyes of someone who's seen better.

2.  Have a couple of people thaw out of cryonic suspension and go on to
explore the wonderful possibilities of the posthuman world.  Keep the
audience in awe of the possibilities and they might not notice the lack of
good vs. evil.  And then, just when they think it's all over interrupt the
credits with scientific news on actually progress towards these possibilities
(You could also throw in a natural disaster, get them all working towards a
goal).

Not exactly the kind of groundbreaking film to alter the perception of the
world though (which I think is what we're aiming for here).

I think the best approach would be something 'ala Atlas Shrugged, where 
important people disappear, one by one. Somehow, one of them slips and
reveals their influence in the real world. They are of course, being
uploaded.
One of the uploads could be someone who is somehow strategically important
to something, be it a military, scientific or what have you situation, and
is the
McGuffin for the hero. At the end, the hero saves the world somehow,
without
betraying the uploads or letting the rest of the world know what has
happened. At 
the very end, a newscast plays out, telling the world that the now-famous
hero has disappeared mysteriously...

Well, anyone whose spent any time with a marketing staff knows how this
turns out. The
bottom line with programming is that no matter how you may abstract the
details
of the system, there are logical constructs that must be learned to enable
intelligent
program flow for any program. Once someone has learned these, they can
program a 
4GL (that is, a language that is very close to English) poorly. To create
optimized programs, 
they must learn the particulars of the system. The cry that may be arising
now is: "Well what
about Java? It totally abstracts the system? How about that?" The truth is
that Java provides
another system, the Java virtual machine, whose particulars you must learn
to program well
in Java.

     With all due respect, I'm assuming your first language isn't English. 
     English is my only language so if you working with two, you're ahead 
     of the game.  But try rinsing out your posts with a spell checker.  
     The enormous number of misspellings is rather disorienting to those of 
     us who value the crafting of words.
     
     Now, onto the subject of polygamy:  How broad is a mind that refers to 
     the two sexes as "man" and "wife"?  You've objectified the sex 
     assigned to "wife" (presumably female).  How broad is the mind that 
     notes that "he" has to earn enough to justify more than one wife?  And 
     the notion of family is a cultural invention.  
     
     Your notions give me the impression of something more like opportunism 
     to be able to have sex at any given chance than to achieve a sense of 
     communal happiness by transcending traditional mores.
     
     I'm also interpolating in your whimsical thoughts on heaven having a 
     homosexual spin to it.  Most Judeo-Christian teachings instruct that 
     humans transcend sexual desire when they get to "heaven".  That's 
     A-sexual not gay-sexual.  <G>
     
     It is my opinion that the seed justifications for most religions 
     putting restrictions on sexual behavior is because of our rather 
     primitive tendency towards possession, objectifying humans rather than 
     regarding them as other conscious entities.  "Possessing" humans in a 
     marriage or family may have a better spin to it than more blatant 
     forms of slavery.  The difference is that each entity gets a role in 
     the decision making.  Women and children have been usurped in the 
     patriarchal motif that pervades western culture.  
     
     A true polygamous situation would not only enable the "man" to have 
     wives, but the wives to have wives, the man to have men.  Then there's 
     the matter of how children are factored in to the sexual 
     interrelations.  Some may draw the line at children (as would I out of 
     cultural deference and personal preference) but fact of the matter is, 
     we place up boundaries regarding the impropriety of sexual relations 
     with children because of the manipulative and objectifying ways in 
     which we practice such behavior.  
     
     For male-female combinations, it is not genetically in our best 
     interest to inbreed.  From such bad biological mixing could spring the 
     social taboo.  The same could even be said for men and boys in a world 
     where the population needed regular fortification.  It doesn't keep 
     the species up if men are not putting that semen to good use! <G> 
     Modern Western culture has no such issue and instinctual drives 
     towards a heterosexual orientation would not sufficiently impair a boy 
     exposed to same sex relations to necessarily retain that "preference" 
     unless you factor in mental and emotional issues (again, back to 
     objectification and disregard for the self-aware creature that could 
     create a dysfunction in the perception of self).
     
     Polygamy is a male-dominant and opportunistic mindset.  The true 
     freedom lies in putting away the notions of human possession.  As 
     benevolent a relationship as we might have, the stirrings of jealousy 
     and covetousness have very limbic and survivalist roots.  This may be 
     why early religions sought to lock it down and put hefty penalties on 
     not being restrained.  As we move towards an evolved sense of self, 
     having a sexual relationship, however brief, should carry no more 
     stigma than having a fast food lunch with a co-worker or having an 
     elegant dinner with friends.  
     
     Ah, food and sex.  Next to breathing and imagining, they are pretty 
     high up on the "don't forget to..." list.

EvMick, don't blame this man for the schools he was sent to.  Public
schools, especially the inner-city ones that tend to serve poor Blacks,
have gotten far worse than they were when you were in school, and they
weren't great then.

One of the most difficult decisions you have to make in public discussions
is how to deal with people possessed by dangerous memes.  If you let the
meme go unanswered, it might propagate even though the logic behind it is
so weak.  If you answer it, you might raise the stature of that meme in
other people's eyes, you certainly prolong the annoying thread, and you
waste your own time that you could use productively.  By and large, I tend
to answer it.

Everyone else is free to skip this.  If you want something to get the bad
taste out of your mouth, read anything by Thomas Sowell.  He writes clearly
and interestingly about the long-term effects of culture and cultural
dislocation, and it will give you a good historical perspective on this
debate.

Surprise, surprise.  People immigrate into a culture that has a
long-standing meme about the only large racial minority the society had
until then (imported, mind you, into a slave system that lasted 400 years
and deliberately destroyed the cultural structures that help people
succeed), and the new immigrants pick up the dominant culture's nice,
little, protective, scapegoat meme.  Yes, all races distrust others, it's a
meme thing.  That many of them pick on Blacks is not evidence of much.

>"Prejudice" as the media like to call it is often simple rational thinking.

Prejudice and stereotyping I can deal with.  They are useful ways of making
quick decisions without using a lot of valuable mental energy.  But if you
hold on to your stereotypes in the face of evidence and logical
counter-arguments, you're an idiot.

>The facts: the whole of central and southern Africa hasn't produced
>an even remotely technolological "modern civilization". 

What does this have to do with genetic determination of intelligence and
potential?  Are you saying that "civilization" is a result of intelligence?
 I have read an interesting book that claimed agriculture was only
economically rational above a certain population density (Douglas North,
Structure and Change in Economic History), and this was even more true of
cities.  Regardless, we know very little about ancient civilizations, and
even less about the archeological record of Africa, so I don't give much
weight to this assertion.

>Fact: they did not even invent the wheel or bow and arrow.  

What is this supposed to imply? Caucasians probably didn't either, they
just learned them from someone else.  If I come up with two other early
technologies Africans had, are we even?  It's far easier for me to believe
that stable civilization is an accident of history, sustained by
geographical characteristics that allow for exposure to and trade with
other cultures.  Sub-Saharan Africa, unfortunately, was geographically very
isolated. 

>Unlike for example native

Native Americans, in both North and South America, may have "adapted", but
they were demonstrably less successful.  Their culture was practically
wiped from the face of the two continents, replaced by an imported culture
that has controlled the area ever since.  Africa, on the other hand, is
still largely African.  Even in South Africa, the Boers and English didn't
manage to immigrate or reproduce enough to even match, much less
out-number, the native races.  Could it be characteristics of the African
environment that make our western memes or genes less advantageous there?
As Africa slowly pulls itself out of the miserable quagmire of colonial
rule and cold-war supported dictators, I suspect your genetic theory will
loose what credibility it has.

Now, you presented the last set as facts, and I am willing to argue them on

Oh, so now you say that cultural context in necessary for individual
intellectual growth.  So if I didn't happen to live within a technical
civilization, would that be evidence that I am genetically less intelligent?

I don't get this.  I don't think that all memes are equal, and that's one
of the factors to which I ascribe the problems Blacks have today, both in
the US and in Africa.  You, on the other hand, seem to be arguing that
meme's are racially, or genetically, determined.  Which is it?

I completely agree with Hal's comments on secular humanists. They agree on
many extropian values, but their lack of egoism will kill them!

Clarke knows about cryonics, and has even written a brief for Alcor back
when they were under attack by government agencies. He has no plans to sign
up, and has some objection based on his view of personal identity, i.e., he
thinks there is no point signing up because he will eventually become such
a different person. I find it hard to see this as anything other than a
rationalization for some fear he has.

Maybe one day a bunch of extropians will be able to corner him in a room
and probe at his philosophical views and perhaps persuade him to change
them to something less lethal.

It should be noted that there may be some sociobiological bias
towards serial monogamy in humans, but as my friend Valdemar puts it:

I've been told for the longest time that my attraction to technological
immortalism was dismissable as a kind of adolescent fear of the unknown,
that I simply couldn't bear the fact that one day this "I" would no longer
exist.  It has always amused me inasmuch as (and this seems to be the very
thing which Clarke has grasped and which has made *him* afraid), it is of
course the immortalist who faces the more absolute unknown.  It is indeed
likely that the "I" I will have become (more likely a whole cloud of us by
then) in a century or two will have a scarcely comprehensible
next-to-nothing in common with this "I" in the first place.  Talk about a
bleak embracing of the *known* -- refuse to make arrangments in the face
of death and it is next to certain what you'll get.  Best, Dale

I just considered very interesting on talking now with a friend "at"
tomorrow...(I'm still on 01 Aug, Fri...)
Obviously we begin to conjecture lots of related pre-scientifical 
thoughts about the real possibility....
For me, as far as I can conclude, the future is just an 
extrapolation of the present conditions of the Universe... and the 
past would be just recorded in a possible "atomic-molecular" memory. 
And, possibly, the "molecular agglomerate" so-called human brain is 
able to get in (dynamical) resonance with both effects.

Yes. But it would be a *huge* movie, something like Exodus or Dune.
The book stretches over one century of accelerating change - hard to
make a movie of. Although parts certainly would work (unfortunately
it is the lowlife setting of the Zaibatsu in the first chapters that
I think would work best, and that is nearly conventional cyberpunk).

Hmm, something like the Copies in Greg Egan's _Permuation City_?
Although these uploads were public and had some PR problems (some of
the rich uploads even tried to improve the image of uploads by
memetic engineering through a sitcom :-)

Not bad, would likely work as a novel too. Not 100% original, but
workable.

Sorry, your warning is too late. I saw it... it took me several days

Fun. But not likely to work well. Maybe it would be better to film _V
for Vendetta_? That novel would certainly work as a film; putting an
anarchist assassin as the protagonist might be too hard to deal with
for most.

Hard to make interesting - utopias are boring, and a more realistic
posthuman world would be fairly incomprehensible, needing a lot of
tedious explanations. 

Maybe one could run it as a confrontation/contrast between a
posthuman society and mehuman society? In the future there is a
schism between the transhumans and normals, and most of the
transhumans move into space (something like Schismatrix); in time two
different societies develop. The chrononauts awaken to find that the
posthumans in space have sent down a small nanite swarm to awaken
them since their cryonic suspensions will decay in time without
anyone to tend them (and the posthumans might feel grateful to their
forerunners). In doing so the posthumans have actually broken the
rules, and the mehums will be *very* angry if they find out. So the
posthumans can't give them any direct help, but either they will have
to adapt to the mehuman society, or find a way to get into space.
Could be interesting to show the choice between a normal, limited but
basically understandable human existence, and an incomprehensible
posthuman world - some of the people might choose one over the
another, and it is uncertain if anyone is wrong.

Hard to do that in one sweep. Few films ever does that (some books
do, however). I think it is a good idea to make transhuman memes leak
into the mainstream, that is where we want them.

Indeed, in one of some my mad menthal researches (not that all 
are like these, at the opposite, but these help a lot to 
separate from the local spatial-temporal knowledge, and, sometimes, 
discover something "unseen"...) I thought that since our brains are 
nothing more than a molecular agglomerate ( as I've already said 
somewhere...) and, consequently,  a matter agglomerate interacting 
something very near, such brain is processing nothing more nothing 
less than a certain quantity of the possible physical interactions 
between particles of such matter ( obvious...). The mere "feeling" 
(detecting) of such interaction already would mean (in a certain 
level) a knowledge experience of any of such happening interactions. 
So we already "know" them inside ourselves and are simply translating 
them to, f.ex., a math/phys language...(higher levels of 
knowlegde...) 
And why wouldn't we have already  the possibility of "controlling the 
matter" as mentioned dear Danny... and do not know how to do it...
Matter dealing with the same matter....with a control-processing 
global function (the brain + other sensors...) and possibility of 
concluding about itself...    

A thing  litterally to think...

PS: About the lainguistic mistakes, as I'm not an english language 
country citizen, I ask you to forgve me (Except some that I do not 
remember... I will possibly agree with the English Education 
Ministry - or something like that - which said that the "palmer"in 
useful  with some school boys (or if one behave as if were...))

This is a troll, isn't it?     :-)

1) every language since COBOL was supposed to put programmers
out of business. Really. Sorry, but the ability to
construct algorithms requires logical thought processes.
The algorithm designer is a programmer, no matter what
tools are used. In the hands of a competent programmer,
better tools lead to higher productivity and better
programs. In the hands of a non-programmer, better tools
lead to nothing much. I do agree that simpler-to-use tools
lower the learning barrier, but a 5-year-old using Pilot
logically is a programmer, while a company president using
Excel illogically is not.

2) Over the years, there have been many examples of
programming tools integrated in various ways into an operating
system or operating environment. I'm not clear on the
distinction you are trying to make here: Why do you
think UNIX has integrated tools, but Windows does not?
both environments have a distinct OS and Distinct tools.

3) There are a lot of free OSs with freely-available source
code. Linux is a good place to start.

4) Java is the latest and likely the greatest attempt to
achieve true reusability and ease of visual programming.
The javaBeans specification is specifically designed
to permit easy visual programming, and vendor independence
is central to the Java philosophy. Yo can download the
Java Development Kit and the Beans devlopment Kit for free.

In re Rick Knight's extensive post:  Good stuff!  Keep it coming!

I would dearly like to hear others' thoughts on the subject, because 
I think that Extropians (or transhumans in general) are uniquely 
positioned to bring a unique combination of optimism, intelligence, 
desire for growth, and questing nature to human relationships (or 
posthuman relationships!).

Andrea Gallagher has already eloquently stated many of the points I 
would have made.  I will make a couple of short comments and quote a
passage from the book The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and 
Charles Murray which I read it a couple of years ago.  

"Our fourth answer has been that group differences in cognitive ability,
so desperately denied for so long, can best be handled - can only be handled -
by a return to individualism.  A person should not be judged as a member of
a group but as an individual.  With that cornerstone of the American 
doctrine once again in place, group differences can take their appropriately
insignificant place in affecting American life.  But until that cornerstone
is once again in place, the anger, the hurt, and the animosities will
continue to grow."  (The Bell Curve; Page 550)

Since Herrnstein and Murray lived in the USA and wrote about policies
and history of the USA, they use the term "American" in the above passage;
I would suggest that the term "Extropian" could be substituted and the
passage would still retain much of its meaning.

As I understand the Extropian tradition, racial group differences are of
little or no importance.  I would urge that we promote "individualism" as
opposed to "racial groupism" in order to work toward creating a more robust
and desirable future.

One photon (or electron) never makes a smug, it always makes a nice neat  
little spot on the film, regardless of how many slots you have, but the  
pattern the spots build up into is very different, even if you send them 
through one at a time.  With one slot you just get a diffuse picture of the 
slot itself, with 2 slots the points build up into a complex interference 
pattern. Suppose  you just send one electron through the 2 slots, record
the position of the spot on the film, destroy the entire device, build 
another  machine and send one just one electron through it and so on. 
When you plot the position of all the little spots together, all the spots 
produced by all the 2 slit machines, you will start to see an  interference 
pattern emerge. Don't  ask how the electron even knows of the  existence of 
the slit it did not go through, much less is influenced by it,  don't try to
make sense out of it, you can't, it's just weird.

This looks like a job for Miss Manners!  Judith Martin (a/k/a said Most
Mannerly One) has written a number of books the theme of all of which has
been that the deterioration of generally intelligible codes of civility
has fueled the disastrous rise of litigiousness in this society (a rise
documented by the likes of Richard Epstein as well).  Where manners fail
we turn it seems to an ever more bloated State apparatus to settle
disputes that concern not the initiation of coercion but outrages of
dignity, petty humiliations and the like.  Look: People are different from
one another. Let's call that -- along with Eve Sedgwick -- "Axiom 1." 
Whenever different people fumble into one another there are inevitably
moments of discomfort and dispute.  Very much for the most part, the
examples of "diversity in the workplace" you mentioned -- e.g., workers
who abhor washing, etc. -- are policed into acceptable behavior by cool
glances among co-workers, refusals of lunch invitations, or, as a last
resort, strong words from the supervisor.  Homophobic behavior is likewise
usually mostly unmannerly and ideally would be policed by the same means. 
My hunch is that general guidelines concerning the irrelevence of
non-job-related features of an employee's life have so insinuated
themselves into the fabric of the regime of civility which renders
contractual agreements intelligible *as such* that to flaunt them is to
flirt with breach of contract.  (This is a judgment call on my part, a
suggestion for a strategic intervention on behalf of unpopular minorities
that might avoid some of the pitfalls of other more legislative forms of
activist ambitiousness.)  This does not mean that I think it is a good
idea for lesbian and gay activism to make recourse too often to the State
in its quest for civil equality.  Far from it.  As I said, I have heard
that there is a great deal of solid economic research on record that has
supported the contention that a degree of racist, sexist, and heterosexist
behavior intolerable to those who suffer it is nevertheless compatible
with a sufficient rate of profit that few incentives appear to exist apart
from those imposed by the State to ameliorate this behavior.  Part of what
I was thinking is that by forcing those who truly insist on persisting in
irrational behaviors to do so *conspicuously* (i.e., to *specify* the
centrality of homophoia or racism to their general vision), perhaps the
market might actually provide a sufficient regulatory nudge that --
doubtless supplemented by a healy dose of civil disobediance here and
there -- the ideal of *civic* equality might be realized without
supporting the further expansion of the state (and compatible as well with
efforts to hasten the state's diminishment). Of course, all this is
neither here nor there. So long as the state provides support for all
unpopular minorities except lesbians and gays, then that exception itelf
symptomizes a danger that needs to be addressed by activism, whatever we
think about the state as an institution.  The negotiation of the competing
ends of transforming the state (smashing it, as it were) on the one hand,
and working toward civic equality in the world as it is (where an
unsmashed state looms everywhere, as it were), is, to say the least, a
tricky thing...  Heavens, I tagged this BASICS, but it became complicated
quick.  Best, Dale

Danny, you may be thinking of the work done with the last generation of
syphilis 
eye infection patients a few decades ago. Their corneas were clouded at birth
and at best they could distinguish light from dark. Later surgery like that
developed for cataract patients was employed in an attempt to give these
people
a clear visual path. 

The best information I have on that is that many of the "cured" patients
could 
not interpret images at all, found the new input upsetting because it was
"just 
noise", and went back to wearing dark glasses. Is babble in a language you 
don't understand "a total new dimension to [your] consciousness?"

This is not to imply that I don't understand *your* language.

My bogometer is in the red. Not to be negative or anything, but... *PLONK*

Rasmol is a pdb viewer, and comes bundled with many Linux distributions. 
The display is very fast under a decent Pentium, noticeably faster than 
on a vanilla SGI Indy. Btw Linux, 3dfx has just released a glide library 
for Linux, and OpenGL libraries for major 3d accelerators are in the 
works (at last!). Future looks bleak for SGI, whatever they do say.

Viewing stuff is nice (indeed, crucial), but doing molecular modelling is 
even more important. Modern machines and codes had grown good enough to 
do nontrivial level work at home. If you consider that a single 8-CPU 
SHARC card gives you about 1 GFlop (judging from raw silicon prices, such 
a board ought to cost around 2 k$). Porting a nanokernel with Unix 
personality to it (e.g. L3/L4) would mean serious _compatible_ MPI/PVM 
computing power. 1 GFlop/320 MIPS single-user is a lot.

I read this paragraph wrong the first time, I thought you were saying that
the 'points of mutual interest' glow and vibrate.  Which would also be.. um..
interesting.

How about a pocket sized computer, not unlike a calculator, with lists of
various tastes and fetishes.  When you see a potential partner you simply
point it at them, punch in your desired fantasy (Mrs. Peacock, with the
candlestick, in the study) and it displays the exact amount of alcohol needed
before they'll give it a go!

he wants to know.

I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: trying
to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience (who have
been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and AI's will
eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world changing
technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For instance, how do
you show nano-technology or uploading in a movie (without resorting to "I can
feel something... something strange... entering... my... body... something
small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you can see, virtual reality
technology has progressed so far that everything in here looks _exactly_ like
it does in the real world!").

--Wax

Two small steps

For uploading, visit your local Blockbuster Video and rent the beautifully made 
"Ghost In The Shell". You'll find it in the Japanese animation section. It does a
better than average job of discussing problems involving synthetic intelligence
and mind alteration. Quite a bit more intelligent than most SF I have seen. 
shows both positive and negative impacts of advanced technology. The film
Includes first person perspective scenes of something very close to an upload. 
Does not directly paint a world suffused with nanotechnology - mostly advanced
robotics applied to body/mind augmentation and a willful AI, but this is fleshed
out well. Had to suspend far less to enjoy this film than most of the Hollywood's
dazzle fodder.

For a much more flawed film, take a look at "Deep Reds". This little B - film
takes a shot at showing the impact of a limited general cell-repair technology on
a group of people. Story is moved along by the machinations of the requisite 
bad guy/mad scientist while the source of the technology is provided by an  unseen 
alien culture. Despite this, the film does not make the technology into the enemy.

Warning: no scientific basis for any of the following, just musings.
(vaguely in response to "meme supremacy" mailings). 

Discrimination 1---The simple kind of straightforward xenophobic "I hate
you because you look (are) different" stuff, popular with kids and other
mentally underdeveloped people. When consequently applied to people of
(vaguely) the same genetic stock also called "racism".

Discrimination 1b---Same as 1 except for the fact that the "offender"
"knows better" (knows that the "target group" isn't really weird & creepy
but picks on them anyway out of pure malice. Common in all race and age
groups.

Discrimination 2---comparing looks and memes and concluding
that they're different, and depending on the standards you use,
that some are better than others (superior/inferior if you will). It
can sometimes be observed that a certain meme occurs more frequently in (a)
certain group(s) of people who clearly (looks, geography etc) share the
same genetic background. Now if this meme happens to be bad by the
particular standards that you use this means that in this field at least
certain (genetic) groups as a whole will rank lower on your scale than
certain other (genetic) groups. This could be called "scientifically based
racism". This 
kind of "racism" does not hate, it just observes and concludes. 
It is a logical consequence of man's curiosity.

Unfortunately it does happen quite often that emotionally unstable
people or people of limited intellect confuse racism/discrimination 1
with racism/discrimination 2, and thus react with rabid ferocity to
neutral observations. It's even worse when people who can see
the difference clearly, pretend to confuse the two in order to gain
(cheap) status with the really blinded individuals and their peers.
This is the kind of behaviour favoured by politicians and (other)
community leaders. In many ways it is even more repugnant than
the "dumb" no 1 racism and at least as bad as 1b, for it is 
sneaky and manipulative and devoid of any honest emotion.   

Of course, in everyday interaction each person should be judged
seperately, and not be unduely stereotyped, yet this is exactly
what those (alledgedly) well-meaning anti-racists ("equalists")
are doing; if you're branded a racist (iow *dared* to say something
negative about a race (other than Caucasians) and negroes in
particular than automatically everything you say (on whatever
topic) will be deemed crap and those kind, peaceful and tolerant
people all of a sudden turn out to be not-so-kind, tolerant & peaceful
at all. It appears they have plenty of exceptions to their general
"humanistic" rule...

All very understandable of course. Man, having evolved from an
upright killer ape, couldn't have lost his violent primal urges 
overnight (on an evolutionary timescale). They're still in there,
often well hidden and carefully suppressed, but there nonetheless.
The "peaceful" hippy/liberal/humanist way is probably a very
unnatural state of being for an originally agressive and opportu-
nistic creature like man. That's why communes etc. seldom
work. In fact, they seem to accelerate mental degeneration to
an almost cave-man like state (the clan led by the Alpha male).
Consequently, extropians also must vent their "primal anger"
sometimes, and what better target than a "racist"...Well, glad
to've been of service :)  

Btw, you should see the movie "The Forbidden Planet" (60's I
reckon). It shows what could happen to a (extropian-esque)
society when it loses touch with (or: denies) it's more primitive 
side. Although the movie isn't much as a whole (though mildly
entertaining), the point is clear for those who want to see it. 
Denial killed the cat.

Your black neigbor may very well be your mental equal/superior, but
the culture linked to his forefathers is inferior to the culture linked to
 *your* forefathers if you measure by things like technological
advancement, personal safety and possibilities for growth
 (although *both* sets of cultures were and are highly inadequate
by transhuman standards). This does not mean you should look down on your
neighbor (just for this reason) because he isn't responsible for the
actions of his forefathers (or those of his contemporaries of the same
race). Consequently, you are not responsible for the actions of *your*
forefathers (like slavery or genocide) so there are no flagellant guilt
trips (like German youths "apologizing" for the holocaust), and (if you're
being consequent) no such things as automatically returning "sacred land"
to Indians 
or paying damages to the grandchildren of slaves. These are after all
things of a long gone past, and today's generations cannot be held
accountable  (assuming one argues within the realm of rationality). Every
person should only be accountable for eir actions unless party in an
"agreement" that states otherwise. Right?

Actually, you may be thinking of the woman whose hearing was cured.  
An amazing theatrical play was recently produced about her life, and 
I heard an interview with some of the doctors and the actress who 
portrayed her.  A riveting hour of conversation (so few of those on 
the airwaves nowadays!) that touched on many transhumanist themes.

My oldest daughter Kirsten is 14. She is heavily involved in an
internet-based group of Star Trek/Voyager fans, mostly female
and mostly aged 11 to 21 or so. The group focuses on romantic
relationships among crew members of Voyager. She maintains a
set of web pages that included pages for each relationship.
Recently, some group members started considering homosexual
relationships, and Kirsten came to me for a policy decision,
since the pages are in my directory on our ISP.

Here's what we decided:
  1) such relationships are listed, but are likned from a
page that recommends that the younger readers check with
their parents. This is intended to minimize hassles from
parents and is in no way a value judgement on my part.

Here's the interesting part: I strongly suspect that people
who are uncomfortable with homosexual relationships among the
fictional characters will still be comfortable with the
heterosexual relationships, even though those relationships are
interspecies, and we have no idea what the sexual physiology
or practices of the non-humans is! I mean, how many Vulcans
does it take to screw in? We haven't had any negative comments
yet, but I don't know whether the parents are monitoring their
kid's internet usage.

No, it could not. There's nothing even remotely scientific about
pretending to be able to "measure" the quality of a meme or a
meme-complex. You think people are getting angry with you because
you are espousing unpopular political opinions, but what's making
me angry with you is that you are dressing up your political opinions
as if they were somehow "scientific". If you start talking about
"if this meme happens to be bad by the particular standards that
you use", then you are no longer talking about science. Heck, just
talking about correlations between meme-tag Y and gene-tag X is
getting you into shaky territory as far as statistical methodology
is concerned. These are fertile fields for personal opinion and
individual action, but to pretend that this is presently a domain
of science is just symptomatic of your attempt to hitch your memes
onto the coattails of science, the better to market them to others.
I'm not buying.

People get to use their own filters on what other people have to
say. Why you think that this is somehow "unhumanist" I don't know.
Do you think we should each keep our ears constantly tuned to the
voices of all six billion human beings? (Not as if this is possible
or anything.) You're peddling a simplified meme-filter, and yet
you whine and complain about how other people are filtering out
*your* memes in a simplified fashion.

Kindness is necessarily limited: you can't be kind to six billion
people at once (most of the time). There's nothing unpeaceful about
people not wanting to listen to what you have to say. There's
nothing intolerant about it either. No one here is trying to shut
you up, so stop trying to present yourself as more persecuted than
you are. This is exactly the sort of self-presentation as a "victim"
that I'd expect someone espousing the views you are espousing to
shun.

Communes seldom work because communes frequently attempt to do
away with private property, an institution which is far more
useful as a means of social organization than most people
realize. I'm skeptical of your claim that "peacefulness" is one
of the *reasons* why communes seldom work.

Yes, yes, collectivism was at one point in human cultural
evolution a good computational shortcut. That's why there is so
much collectivism to be found in many of the older cultures. But
I just don't think you're going to have much success peddling
your updated "scientific" groupthink on this list. And I'm not
sure why you're trying. What exactly are you trying to
accomplish with this line of argument? What changes would you
like to bring about by presenting this information?

Interesting: here we have an individual ape presuming to pass
judgement on the relative quality of vast collections of millions
of apes lasting over centuries or millenia. I wonder how he manages
such a feat? Of course, we each have to do the best we can in this
department to make choices for our own self-education, but surely
it's a mistake to think that such judgements are even remotely
scientific.

In general, yes. "Possession is nine-tenths of the law" is
economically efficient, to be sure, but I'm not quite sure yet
if economic efficiency means the same thing as justice. Perhaps
our perceptions of instances of justice is just our cultural
"first-take" on the spontaneous emergence of structures that
promote economic efficiency, and that later we find out that
what we had thought was justice was just the invisible hand at
work, and that there is no justice. Perhaps you are right about
this. I don't know.

Yes, I have heard this story (there are several cases like this,
usually involving people born with cataracts). Since their visual
cortices didn't get any input during the critical periods of early
childhood, they didn't organize properly and when they could see they
had no working three-dimensional perception. I'm not sure how well
they learned to handle it, as far as I know no amount of spiritual
preparation can organize a working visual cortex. On the other hand,
I think that training could help, at least partially (the brain is
amazingly flexible), but if the low-level functions have noot been
developed during the critical periods normal perception may be
possible.

As a person trained in biochemistry and working with computers, I was
interested in your post about RasMol.

Is "L3/L4" a reference to future Linux 3.0 or Linux 4.0 kernels based on
the latest descendants of Mach?  Or something else I could learn about?

By the way, I have enjoyed your posts very much.  You contribute real
knowledge used for creative ideas, in a clear form.  I consider your

Subject: NanoCAD in Java

NanoCAD in Java is now basically functional, and should run on any
Java-capable browser (although I had trouble trying to use it with a
friend's ATTnet account, using Internet Explorer). Chris Fry has come
up with a lot of really useful suggestions for making the code cleaner
and the user interface more straightforward. Anybode interesting in
taking it for a spin should visit

I believe (but at this point I'm not yet sure) that you can also get
to it with the old address:

I would be curious to hear from anybody who has trouble with it. I'm
still a pretty inexperienced Java programmer; I think I've gotten
everything right but I'd be glad for any feedback.

I know that a number of people are planning on coming to EXTRO 3 but have
not yet registered. Especially for local extropians, it may seem to be easy
to register at the door. One reason to register before Wednesday: We have
to give the hotel the final banquet numbers by then. We will add some extra
places, but will have to be conservative in our estimates since the banquet
is quite expensive. If you don't register until the day, you *may* not be
able to get a seat at the banquet. 

This does *not* mean missing Drexler's talk (ironically titled "How to be
Cautious and Conservative") since we will let in everyone after the banquet
and before he begins to speak. But you'll have a less favorable position
and miss out on the critical mass socializing!

See you in a week.

This is really neat! One of the biggest advantages of Java is that
the user doesn't have to do anything to download the code.
You just bring up the web page and your browser does the rest.

If you have a Java-capable browser (Netscape 3.01 or IE 3?), you
should REALLY try this. Please note that it's still a sophisticated
graphics program, and therefore it is big enough to take a while to
download (20 seconds at 64kbps) and will run better on a faster
computer.

If you're interested in molecular modelling, do this immediately, for

reason alone if for no other. If you're interested in Java , this is a
pretty example. As a transhuman and/or extropian, try this to see a
clear
example of the way a powerful software tool (Java and its development
tools)
can now be used and delivered to all.

Racism exists because most animals probably have a gene(s) that makes them  
feel that their mate should not look very different from the average. It's 
not a totally bad idea because those who look very different are often ill,  
so this improves the odds that their mate is healthy and that means more  
children are produced who also have the gene. Like any simple rule of thumb 
it can sometimes make horrible mistakes and become downright ridicules,  
particularly when you put it into a different and much more complex 
environment like the modern world. Such caned programmed responses are best  
for an animal with a brain the size of a squirrel, but Humans are smarter than 
squirrels and can do better, unfortunately they still have that dumb gene.

If you're wondering why so many Extropians have such a low tolerance for  
anything that has the slightest hint of a racist smell, it's because racism 
has never made one thing of value and in fact, with the exception of religion,  
no meme has ever produced more misery in the world.

The "killer ape" theory, the idea that humans evolved from vicious carnivorous 
animals, originated with Raymond Dart, Robert Ardrey distorted and popularized 
Dart's ideas in the dreadful best seller "African  Genesis" in  1961. Dart 
found bones of Australopithecines that had been broken open so the marrow 
could be gotten to, and Ardrey's imagination ran wild. The theory  has been 
completely discredited for over 20 years, it's now known that the  bones were 
the result of leopards not evil cannibalistic apes.

Yes, wonderful movie! My dad took me to see it when I was a kid, the first 
movie I ever saw in my life, it scared the hell out of me but I loved it. 
Despite corny dialog and a bad last act (Why does the object of wonder always 
have to blow up?) it's still terrific because  of good special effects for 
its time, great music, and one of the most provocative underlining ideas ever
put  on film.

You're assuming I'm Caucasian, I will not confirm or deny it. I will say  
that in very recent history the people I admire most, scientists, engineers  
and mathematicians, have mostly been white or Asian. On the other hand, when  
I look at tomb paintings of the ancient Egyptians, the civilization that 
invented civilization, I see a lot of black faces

The recent DNA Neanderthal finding, which proved that we are not descended 
from them, destroyed the only rival to the out of Africa theory, it's pretty 
clear now that not only Homo Habilis but Homo Erectus and even fully modern 
humans originated in Africa. We're all Africans, every one of us.

Yes indeed, the number of your direct ancestors doubles with each generation, 
even more if you count cousins, so you don't really have to go back very far 
to find somebody famous. My grandmother loved to trace the family tree and 
brag about illustrious relatives, until one day she went back a little too
far and found an ancestor hung for grave robbery. She sort of lost interest 
in the subject after that.

This is indeed a very cool program, and the Java interface works great.
The big problem though is that you can't save your work (Java applets
can't save to disk with current versions of Netscape and IE).

At first I thought it was just a simple drawing program, then I realized
that the energy minimization buttons would actually move the atoms around
until the atom positions and bond angles were realistic.

I entered a couple of simple structures from Nanosystems (the rod in
figure 9.5a and a modified form of the bond bearing in 10.1).  The
energy minimization functions worked pretty well, but things did not
come out quite right.  I am no chemist, but I could see that some of the
atomic arrangements were not as symmetric as they should be.  So there
are probably still some bugs in the software.

    Too bad Extropians never seem to question Dawkins' extreme
reductionism. I have ding donged on this for years, but not lately.  So
I will make my assertions again.  I present the following as a conscious
hypothesis....too bad Dawkins is not self-aware enough to know his
reductionism is a hypothesis....actually he may be unconsciously
carrying a meme of the currently dominant scientific establishment.

    Genes and memes compete primarily via the characteristics they
impart to their respective biological organism and social organims (or
culture).    Genes and memes change or evolve for different reasons (we
think).  I think the evidence still indicates that genes mutate randomly
under the action of random external factors (or do molecular biologists
have more advanced ideas about this now?).  We know first hand, of
course, some of the ways in which memes can mutate.  Hosts can invent
new memes and try to spread them!  However, only the rich and powerful
segments of a society can make a new meme operational through a whole
culture (hypothesis alert! Begin testing it!).

    Establishments, ruling classes, intellectual appendages of warrior
classes, religious authorities, etc. can amplify and broadcast the memes
that they perceive to suit their purposes which usually means memes that
increase or maintain their financial and political power.  Contrary to
popular Extropian thought, then, the meme's "attraction" for the host is
less important than the physical resources available for propagating the
new meme.

    As an example, if the Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie Foundations, etc.
perceived the Extropian meme set to be in their interests Extropian
memes would, by now, be on their way toward dominating Anglo-American
culture.  However, alas, Extropian memes are not so perceived.  In fact,
the great State Capitalist dynasties and fortunes are built in large
part on State sponsored, assisted, and regulated oligopoly of natural
resources.  (They didn't call the State Department Standard Oil's
foreign office for nothing.)  Environmentalist memes serve this power
structure by limiting new competition and holding resources off the
market, ie. raising the prices of natural resources already in
production.  I used to have a link to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund site
so folks could prove to themselves what the "big money" propagates in
the way of memes...they won't tell you "why" of course.....you need to
use the scientific method for that...

Yes, it is a very nice system. Making it easily available as an
applet might be a good way to promote people to start experimenting
with molecular hacking (just as people once began with Game of Life
hacking - and look how far we got! Glider guns, universal computers,
patterns that calculate primes...)

I have the same problem. It is quite easy to get unphysical
structures, I tried to make a methane molecule but it didn't get
tetrahedral. Maybe I'm missing something obvious with the energy
minimization?

Counterexample: Kilroy was here. Was started by some soldiers, and
was so efficient that it spread across most of the western culture.

There are plenty of memes not invented by the rich and powerful which
spread well, but the rich and powerful can of course support memes
more effectively (broadcasting is very useful).

No. Let's make a BOTE mathematical model for memetic spread in a very
large population (assumed infinite in this case). Let x(t) be the
number of people infected with the meme at time t. They infect other
people at a constant rate k. There is also some agency which spreads
the meme deliberately, infecting new hosts at a rate l. Assume that
infections last for life. Then we get the differential equation:

x'(t)= kx(t)+l

This has the solution x(t)=c exp(kt) + (l/k). Note that the first
term, corresponding to the exponential spread of the meme
person-to-person will overrun the second corresponding to outside
insertion quite quickly.

    So?  What does that have to do with his failure to look at the
characteristics of the whole engendered by the meme?  Memes that
engender war, for instance, may create a successful Imperialist culture
that spreads through military force.  Just look at history.

    But it wasn't important!  "Kilroy" imparted no important
characteristics to Western Culture.

    Assumption is wrong....law of diminishing returns sets in...meme
spread slows down after a long time if there is no resistance, quickly
if the establishment uses its power to squelch it early.  Notice how the
Establishment periodically cracks down on "conspiracy theory memes"?
Conspiracy memes are quite infectious (partly because there is a large
element of truth) but the Establishment fights back hard through
Foundation supported propaganda every time they start to gain momentum.

    This second assumption is even more wrong than the first!  New memes
have no such staying power....seen many "Kilroys" lately?

    So!  The rationalization against "ruling class/conspiracy" theory
fails.  Admit it!  You just want to be in memetic resonance with the
powers that be!  ...the manipulators of the State!

Yes, so what? Dawkins isn't especially interested in memetics, his
speciality is evolution. But others are obviously aware that memes
create changes that in turn affect them, there is a lot of
co-evolution out there. An obvious example is how new media create
new forms of memes, and these memes affect the media.

OK, what about Copernicus theory? It was not supported by the rich

I was ignoring that, since I don't have the time to make a realistic
model right now. But the model can of course easily be extended to a
finite population, with resistance gradually building up. See any
standard epidemologic textbook.

Conspiracy theory memes are interesting in themselves (lots of clever
strategies to replicate, including the ability to explain away lack
of evidence, "us vs. them", becoming stronger by being persecuted
etc.). But I think you are infected by a conspiracy theory meme
yourself in this case: what is the evidence that the estabilishment
cracks down on conspiracy theories more often than other memes?

I suggest that you read my paper about the lifecycle of memes for a
better discussion of it. My assumption above was of course an
oversimplification, but the model was intended to show my point, not
to be qualitatively correct.

This is too bad, I don't have the time to analyse your statements
more in detail to show how your reaction easily could be deduced from
the conspiracy meme you are carrying. Anyway, what I believe doesn't
matter, look at the facts instead.

Looking at this made me search the web for other available applications. I
recommend the following:

AccuModel v.1.1, which is a molecular modelling tool including MM3 energy
minimization calculations, etc. Results in 3D as stick, stick-and-ball,
space-filled, etc. Easy to use. Can't recommend it enough. Get it from:

http://www.microsimulations.com/accumodel.html



If you want other things to play with:

1) ISIS/Draw: free for home use, fully-functional two-dimensional chemical
formulae/reaction constructor, includes a library of complex amino acids,
etc. and a _chemical checker_ which will tell you if you've created
something unfeasible. Export your model as a .mol file and you can load it
in to AccuModel. (Similarly, you can import AccuModel files in to
ISIS/Draw.) ISIS/Draw comes with RASMol, which shows your models in 3D, but
not as well as AccuModel.

2) MolPOV: converts .pdb files (exported from AccuModel) in to .pov files,
which can be used in...

3) ...POVRay: which will produce a ray-traced version of your molecule with
specular shading, etc.

The URLs for these three programs are:

ISIS/Draw: http://www.mdli.co.uk/prod/download.html
MolPOV:    http://www.chem.ufl.edu/~der/der_pov2.htm
POVRay:    http://www.povray.org/nj-index.html

No. The banquet is included in the registration.

My point was that we have to tell the hotel on Wednesday how many banquet
places we want. If we underestimate, some folks will miss out on the meal.
Everyone who registers before Wednesday is guaranteed a banquet place. We
will also add on an estimated number so those showing up to register soon
after 8am on Saturday will also get in. But if there's a big surge of
attendees wanting to register on Saturday, it's possible that we will run
out of banquet places. (If you arrive at the event closer to the starting
time of 9am rather than the beginning of registration at 8am, your chances
of not getting a banquet place obviously will be higher.) As I said, we can
still let those folks in to hear Drexler.

Where do you get the ideas that truth has much to do with the spread of
memes?  Most people have somewhat limited facilities to test the truth of a
meme (in terms of research and experimentation) and, insofar as they have
facilities, they don't use them.  I know people who haven't been to a library
in years, and I have relatively well-educated friends.

The most powerful and successful memes in human society either don't address
truth (such as fashions, language, or fiction) or succeed mostly
independently of their truth (religion and political systems).  Memes spread
mostly on their catchiness, and conspiracy memes definitely fall in that
category.  Generally speaking, conspiracy theories do worse amongst
scientists, probably the best extant truth-analyzers, than the general
populace.

At this point the connection is less explicitly tactical than it is simply
thematic.  Legalization of lesbian and gay marriages -- like the ongoing
consolidation of reproductive freedoms, right to abortion and use of
contraception -- has the effect of further unmooring desire from
reproduction, linking modes of intimate association ever more
conspicuously to the imperatives of self-expression and self-creation
rather than to outdated imperatives concerning reproductive fitness
presently governed by judeochrislamic ideologies and the medico-juridical
discourses favored by State-sponsored bureaucrats over the last century or
so.  It is no mistake that it is through the ongoing articulations of
these rights to reproductive freedom that the Supreme Court is (*was*) 
slowly institutionalizing a Right to Privacy here in the United States. 
The fact that the clearest philosophical expression of this right to
privacy is expressed in Justice Harry Blackmun's *dissent* in
_Bowers_v._Hardwick_ (you know, the decision in which it was determined
that States had the right to make sodomy illegal within their borders
without the pesky whiff of unconstitutionality) is something that should
concern *everybody* -- gay and straight alike.  Anyway, my guess is that
once intimate association has been thoroughly disarticulated from
reproduction by the trajectory of these shifts in legal imperatives and
cultural mores (attitudes toward divorce, contraception, nonheterosexual
marriages, etc.), then the culture will be better prepared to embrace an
ever fuller range of modes of intimate association: polygamy, line
marriage, etc. Best, Dale

These "dumb genes" may get the better of "dumb" people, but
nowadays people are called "racists" when they even try to
imply that certain negative(!) traits are more common with one
branch of humans than with another (if you say: "young blacks
are often good at basketball" there will hardly be any objections,
although this statement is a hardly scientific *generalization*.
Now if you say: "young blacks make up a disproportionally
large segment of the prison population in area X (say, NY)", you'll
quickly be called "racist" (although this is a *fact*). In today's
western memetic climate "racism" which used to mean "unduely
negatively discriminating  against people of a certain genetic
background, persecuting them on mere assumptions" has lost
it's original meaning and is abused by dumb replicators and
manipulative (groups of) individuals to squash any criticism,
no matter how well fundamented (or trivial), of races other than
Caucasians, and most of the time it's a "negro thing". 

"National security" is another examlpe of a neutral term "gone bad".
Right now it is generally associated with shady government operations, war
against it's own people, erosion of constitutional
rights etc. Once upon a time it just meant "securing your borders
against foreign invasions" or something along these lines.
Just like "racism" it has lost it's original meaning, but sneaky
folks still use it as if it were the original to manipulate simple
people.

What we need, and that's the point of this story, is to either
start using the word (and of course this also applies to "discrimination")
in it's original meaning or invent a new one
so that the "real" racism can be separated from the bogus ones,
and not everything is thrown together. The present situation
benefits no-one (except some manipulative bastards), and it
certainly won't change if no-one dares/wants to discuss it.

What I meant was that primitive man, only just separated from the other
apes, used to be an active killer, whose intellect allowed him
to hunt species (both predators and prey) to the brink of extinction,
and sometimes beyond. This was one fearsome creature, that killed
bears and wolves with only primitive tools. Those genes are still
in there...

Yes, the special effects were exceptional indeed for the time. Imo
the movie deserves a remake (with the original shortcomings filtered
out and *even better* special effects. The "alien technology" could
be used to promote nanomachines, cryonics, uploading etc. as earlier
(logical!) phases in the alien's technological evolution.

It's not *that* clear (there really isn't much evidence one way or
another), but it is widely assumed, and is indeed a plausible
*theory*. It is often used to prove that we're all the same, which is
true to a large extend though it's the "subtle" details that can make
all the difference in the world. 

A theory (can't remember right now who developed it) which I
find very plausible is that certain groups of people moved for
reasons unknown out of Africa, which at that time had a much
more pleasant climate than today, and slowly colonized the
Euro-Asian regions. They were faced by the extreme conditions
of an ice age (or several?) and had to drastically adapt in order
to survive. Only the smartest and the healthiest made it, and this
(or several) "natural selection(s)" gave the later relatives (fair skinned
etc. as an adaptation to the "polar" environment) an edge, it was
a unique evolutional boost whose fruits we still pluck today.
The people that stayed in Africa didn't go through this genetic and
memetic "cleansing", and consequently didn't evolve nearly as
far as their emigrated counterparts. By staying, they outsmarted
themselves, so to speak.

Not necessarily.  This fact is stated often in the press here, and stating
*that fact* will make only very few call you racist.  It's the conclusions
drawn from it that may draw accusations of "racist".  Yes, it could
hypothetically be due to genetic differences, but it could also be due to
cultural differences, or to racist behavior on the part of the criminal
justice system.  

You said that blacks were genetically inferior, on the basis of
known-to-be-flaky IQ scores, without even citing this.  You didn't address
the equally significant facts that middle-class blacks have far lower rates
of violent crime and incarceration than ghetto blacks.  You didn't explain
why immigrants from West Africa are indistinguishable from legal immigrants
in general in terms of crime rates or income.  Nor did you address the
serious research showing that the US justice system does discriminate against
blacks in sentencing, particularly with respect to drug possession and petty
drug dealing.

If you're going to cite science to support your claims, you should do more
careful research.  The first plausible hominid hunter is Homo Erectus,
millions of years after the first hominid; prior hominids were
(almost-?)vegetarians or scavengers.  Also, there's no evidence that any
hominid prior to us hunted predators.  Some of the hypotheses for hominid
hunting paint it as not too fearsome either - they hold that erectus might
have just "run down" small game like antelopes by virtue of superior
endurance and then clubbed them to death in their exhaustion.

The current, popular, and logical hypothesis for that is - because they
could; there's a nice climactic window about 90,000 years ago.  Since we're a
young species this was probably our first chance.

OK, I'll bite.  We have lots of information on genetic differences between
human population (they are small, BTW).  What are these genetic changes
you're hypothesizing, and how do they affect our sociability and
intelligence?  Also, what evidence do you have that Africans, evolving to
deal with equally hostile environments like jungles and desert, and also the
most complex, intelligence-demanding environment of all (other humans) didn't
evolve improvements of their own?

This is intended as a security feature. You can get around
it by explicitly copying the Java programs to your local
disk, assuming that the programs theselves were written to
output their results. The browser's default is to trust
programs that reside on your disk. I think you can tell the

course, all this extra work partially negates the extreme
ease of use that one of Java's biggest charms Security and
ease-of-use seem to usually be in conflict.

Subject: CIA role in UFO's now declassified
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Since there was a flurry of discussion about Roswell and UFO's, I'd like to
point to some new, relevant information.   According to a NY Times story,
the CIA has declassified a report of its involvement with UFO sightings ---
which were often U-2 or SR-71 sightings.  Hopefully this will clarify some
past lies and help create a less paranoid discussion.  My personal hope is
that further discussion will occur in some other forum.

The report, "CIA's Role in the Study of UFO's, 1947-90" was written by
Gerald K. Haines, a historian at the National Reconnaissance Office, the
intelligence agency that builds and runs the US spy satellites.

The URL of the full report is
http://www.odci.gov/csi/studies/97unclas/ufo.html


Here's a particularly interesting excerpt with stars (***) before and after
what I consider the take-home message in the third paragaph:


"CIA's U-2 and OXCART as UFOs 

In November 1954, CIA had entered into the world of high technology with
its U-2 overhead reconnaissance project. Working with Lockheed's Advanced
Development facility in Burbank, California, known as the Skunk Works, and
Kelly Johnson, an eminent aeronautical engineer, the Agency by August 1955
was testing a high-altitude experimental aircraft--the U-2. It could fly at
60,000 feet; in the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew between
10,000 feet and 20,000 feet. Consequently, once the U-2 started test
flights, commercial pilots and air traffic controllers began reporting a
large increase in UFO sightings. (44) (U) 

The early U-2s were silver (they were later painted black) and reflected
the rays from the sun, especially at sunrise and sunset. They often
appeared as fiery objects to observers below. Air Force BLUE BOOK
investigators aware of the secret U-2 flights tried to explain away such
sightings by linking them to natural phenomena such as ice crystals and
temperature inversions. By checking with the Agency's U-2 Project Staff in
Washington, BLUE BOOK investigators were able to attribute many UFO
sightings to U-2 flights. They were careful, however, not to reveal the
true cause of the sighting to the public. 

According to later estimates from CIA officials who worked on the U-2
project and the OXCART (SR-71, or Blackbird) project, *** over half of all
UFO reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s were accounted for by
manned reconnaissance flights (namely the U-2) over the United States. (45)
This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive statements to the
public in order to allay public fears and to protect an extraordinarily
sensitive national security project. While perhaps justified, this
deception added fuel to the later conspiracy theories and the coverup
controversy of the 1970s. *** ....

... Dr. Leon Davidson, a chemical engineer and UFOlogist. They demanded the
release of the full Robertson panel report and confirmation of CIA
involvement in the UFO issue. Davidson had convinced himself that the
Agency, not the Air Force, carried most of the responsibility for UFO
analysis and that "the activities of the US Government are responsible for
the flying saucer sightings of the last decade." Indeed, because of the
undisclosed U-2 and OXCART flights, Davidson was closer to the truth than
he suspected. ...."

One of the mistakes a lot of people make is to assume that environmental
and genetic factors can be easily parcelled out. If you were to substitute
some measure of athletic ability for IQ this becomes more obvious. The
correlation b/w identical twins athletic ability would presumably be much
higher than that b/w strangers. It does not follow that "good" genetics is
enough for either a Olympian or the weekend ball player.

P Cubensis and the like do not live in soil. Manure, sterilized grains
do
support them. I think that it is cuz the organisms found in the soil
differ
from those in dung.

Just as in computing there is a tradeoff between what's in RAM and
what's on the
disk, I expect extended external storage with a good interface might
resolve
this concern. I don't expect this can be done with brains as is, and
that some
serious structural modifications are needed. Alternately, the processes
used
for cryonic restoration might allow periodic "sweeping" through the
brain,
relegating less important memories to the external storage, creating
room
for new memories. In AI, this is known as "garbage collection".

In dim light (such as moonlight), only the rods in our retinas are
active. Yet there is little if any evidence of behavioral change in
moonlight, let alone what that change may be. I sure the lunatics on
this list will protest....

Keith Henson spent several days testifying to a court about alleged
email messages which the Scientologists found annoying. The gist was
that anyone can forge an email header, so it could not be proven that
Keith ever sent the messages.

Oversimplification here. In a properly managed experience, looking at
the issues which create the lack of love, etc, is one of the goals, and
within this context personal growth can happen. The intent of the
experience, part of the "set" is very important. Sadly, this doesn't
happen much, till the participants come to desire positive personal
change.

Many would disagree with this, even some Extropians.

The problems begin when we apply our macro way of thinking to these
teeeny little thingys. In QM, even the notion that something goes from
"here" to "there" is suspect. The real confusion begins not with the
wave functions but in our habits of visualizing them as waves at all. If
one adheres to the notion that a wave function is strictly a means of
calculating probabilities of events, this confusion vanishes. Like the
confusion that "soul" brings to the information models of mind, most of
the interpretations, from the Copenhagen Observer to Everett's many
worlds appear to be unprovable, and per our friend Ockham, not needed
either, save for our monkey brains which see thru monkey eyes.

And thus the confusion. So, let's try a few definitions on here:

	Real  - anything one says is same....
	PReal - Physically Real. Representable by a one to one mapping
		onto the set of all physical particles in the Universe.
	Mreal - Representable by a functioning brain.

Now, mentally real is representable by mapping into our brains, probably
limited to about the number of synapses in the brain.

This yields the usual kind of numbers - 10^13 neurons, 10^4 synapses per
neuron, 10^3 states per synapse, so some 10^20 in all, with 10^20!
combinations of connections (way too many, but no matter here).

The set of integers can be defined by the Peano axioms in about 200
bytes. Representing the entire set, one integer per particle, is of
course impossible.
So, the concept of integers is easily held in our brains, but the set
itself cannot be held in our brains. Ditto for the Mandelbot Set. So,

	Concept of Integers  = Preal
	Set of Integers	    != Preal

I think the notion of "Real" is a dead end, with no real consequences.
Now Preal gives some hope towards knowing the limits of our
understanding, even if we have a Universe Mind (Extropian Jupiter Mind
boundlessly expanded) to do it with.

Yup. IMHO the noise theory applies well to dreaming. Since the brain has
numerous kinds of neurotransmitters, different substances, hormones, etc
will have differing effects.

Indeed. As one who has traversed realms whose initiation are well
described by T McKenna, but with wildly differing results, I only
conclude that one's expectations are grist for the noisy mill. If one is
concerned with Logos, well, Logos stew for you! And when the
hyperdimensional stuff comes to some practical uses, then my interest
increases - till then, just more dreams.

One area where noise can be very useful is in perturbing the frozen
emotional states and responses which all of us acquire during childhood
and early socialization....

That is so common a misperception that it makes the many-worlds-faq
http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/many-worlds-faq.html

Q21  Does many-worlds violate Ockham's Razor?
     ---------------------------------------
William of Ockham, 1285-1349(?) English philosopher and one of the
founders of logic, proposed a maxim for judging theories which says that
hypotheses should not be multiplied beyond necessity.  This is known as
Ockham's razor and is interpreted, today, as meaning that to account for
any set of facts the simplest theories are to be preferred over more
complex ones.  Many-worlds is viewed as unnecessarily complex, by some,
by requiring the existence of a multiplicity of worlds to explain what
we see, at any time, in just one world.

This is to mistake what is meant by "complex".  Here's an example. 
Analysis of starlight reveals that starlight is very similar to faint
sunlight, both with spectroscopic absorption and emission lines. 
Assuming the universality of physical law we are led to conclude that
other stars and worlds are scattered, in great numbers, across the
cosmos.  The theory that "the stars are distant suns" is the simplest
theory and so to be preferred by Ockham's Razor to other geocentric
theories.

Similarly many-worlds is the simplest and most economical quantum theory
because it proposes that same laws of physics apply to animate observers
as has been observed for inanimate objects.  The multiplicity of worlds
predicted by the theory is not a weakness of many-worlds, any more than
the multiplicity of stars are for astronomers, since the non-interacting
worlds emerge from a simpler theory.

(As an historical aside it is worth noting that Ockham's razor was also
falsely used to argue in favour of the older heliocentric theories
*against* Galileo's notion of the vastness of the cosmos.  The notion
of vast empty interstellar spaces was too uneconomical to be believable
to the Medieval mind.  Again they were confusing the notion of vastness
with complexity [15].)

I like reductionism for purely pragmatic reasons, it produces results, the

I agree, Dawkins would too.
                

        >I think the evidence still indicates that genes mutate randomly
        

Evolution theorists like Dawkins like to emphasize the random nature of  
mutation to show that you can still produce structures of staggering 
complexity provided you have the other the other half of evolution, natural 
selection. Darwin would have no problem dealing in non random mutations and 
in fact in the real world mutation is mostly random but not completely. 
For chemical reasons some "hot spots" on the chromosome are more likely to 
have mutations than others.

        >operational through a whole culture 
                

So what, Dawkins never said all hosts are created equal. As for the whole 
culture, genes don't give a damn about that or even about the welfare of the 
individual they inhabit, natural selection works at a lower level.  The gene 
is only interested in reproducing itself. By analogy Dawkins is saying the 
same thing is true for ideas and gave it a name, "meme".

- From the species point of view females are much more important than males, 
one male could service dozens of females so you don't need as many of them. 
Take elephant seals for example, just 4% of the males are the father of 88%  
of the baby seals, most males never reproduce at all but they still live long 
lives and eat lots of valuable food. If natural selection operated at the
species level you would expect many more females to be born with enough males 
to just barely handle it, the species would be better off but that's not what 
happens, the sex ratio is still 50- 50. In such a world producing a daughter 
would mean 2 or 3 grandchildren with your genes,  producing a son would mean
hundreds and that pushes the pendulum back toward the 50% sex ratio.

True, that means that those infected with the "it's good to die for your  
country" meme must have been able to infect at least one other person before 
the meme killed him. As I said, the meme doesn't give a damn about the 
individual, it just wants to spread.

I have heard ignorant people say that blacks must be closer to apes than 
white people because their nose looks more like an ape's. I point out that 
apes have thin lips just like white people and white's have more hair than 
blacks and their straight hair is similar to that of apes and no ape has 
anything like the kinky hair of blacks and if you shave off all that hair on 
a ape you will see a white skin. Does this mean that blacks are more highly 
evolved than whites?

     Sorry, I'm correcting the thread title...
     
     Yak suggested as an idea for a plot for a transhumanist film with a 
     broad appeal:
     
     "A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'
     movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into
     someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of 
     his opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of 
     showing the government through the eyes of someone who's seen better."
     
     Rick responds:
     
     That made a little reworking.  Matter of fact, a serious overhaul.  
     Rebel all you want.  Our current culture craves heros and heroics, 
     simple and archetypal as these themes are.  But as far as the plot 
     goes, oh yes, by all means, have someone from the future who, because 
     of their advanced transhuman intellect, holds the value of human life 
     sacred only in what it contributes to the desired outcome for a 
     transhuman future.  Brilliant plot device.  America'll eat it up.  <G> 
     Not!

     Racism exists because most animals probably have a gene(s) that makes 
     them feel that their mate should not look very different from the 
     average. It's not a totally bad idea because those who look very 
     different are often ill, so this improves the odds that their mate is 
     healthy and that means more children are produced who also have the 
     gene. Like any simple rule of thumb it can sometimes make horrible 
     mistakes and become downright ridicules, particularly when you put it 
     into a different and much more complex environment like the modern 
     world. Such caned programmed responses are best for an animal with a 
     brain the size of a squirrel, but Humans are smarter than squirrels 
     and can do better, unfortunately they still have that dumb gene.
     
     If you're wondering why so many Extropians have such a low tolerance 
     for anything that has the slightest hint of a racist smell, it's 
     because racism has never made one thing of value and in fact, with the 
     exception of religion, no meme has ever produced more misery in the 
     world.
     
     Rick responds:
     
     Very eloquent in your last paragraph and I'm quite intrigued by the 
     genetic origin of racism.  It makes immediate sense to me that of 
     course, it would trigger some sort of primitive concern in our make up 
     that it would be risking the integrity of the tribe/species because of 
     the visual information the primitive minds received to make such 
     judgments.  If it looks different, it is suspect.  This rings so true 
     for me and I'd like to ongoing discuss its ramifications and 
     (hopefully) get away from this banter about "gene" and "meme" 
     "supremacy".  Paging down through it was making my finger sore. <G>

     Clarke knows about cryonics, and has even written a brief for Alcor

     identity, i.e., he thinks there is no point signing up because he will 
     eventually become such a different person. I find it hard to see this

     Rick Knight responds:
     
     Why do you find it hard to see that the man's view of life extension 
     involves the relinquishing of acquired self-hood?  It tends to be for 
     the pro-cryonics crowd the ultimate holy grail (pardon the religious 
     pun) that the body and the self are unconditionally joined.  I have no 
     interest in cryonics and it has nothing to do with fear.  But a person 
     with the intelligence that Clarke has and the vision that he has time 
     and time again most aptly conveyed to the world doesn't seem to match 
     up to the judgment you would assign him.
     
     Clarke may find that cryonics, despite any compelling empirical 
     evidence, is just a quaint notion, like a child not wanting to give up 
     his belief in Santa Claus.  It's not so much the preservation of 
     body/brain that cryonics promotes but the restoration/reactivation of 
     a pre-existing "self".  This alludes to self being completely 
     electro-chemical in nature.
     
     To that I pose the question: what of the person who suffers 
     irrecoverable amnesia, forgeting all memories of the former life 
     including intimate relationships, even children.  Did that "person" 
     die?  Who know is in charge of the body of that person?
     
     On the other hand, look the people documented in the book/film 
     "Awakenings".  Time stopped for these people, sometimes for decades, 
     until they were brought back to life (mentally).  The thing was, 
     during their zombie-like state, their physical lives were continuing.  
     A cryonically preserved body/head may be regarded as living.  I think 
     a distinction between preserved and living is yet to be made.
     
     The reanimation notions promoted in "Fifth Element" (a person rebuilt 
     from a rescued amputated arm I think) is interesting to note.  Is 
     consciousness embedded in every cell so that when the complete 
     physiological form is re-fashioned, the brain re-establishes itself as 
     the command center, taking its information from a cellular "upload"?

         What?  It never occured to you that rich and powerful
factionsof Society wanted to overturn the intellectual oppression of the
Catholic
Church?  Of course, it was such groups that spread the
Galileo-Copernicus
theories!  Ask the Traditionalist Catholic conspiracy theorists, some of
whom
actually still claim Copernicus is "unproven"!!!!

     Yes, but you are ignoring (again) how early resistance generated by

        The Establishment cracks down on conspiracy memes because
theycan lead to revolution.  Two examples that immediately come to mind:

1.  The anti-John Birch Society hysteria whipped-up the the
Establishment
in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  This campaign bore its fruit in
the
Goldwater defeat of 1960.....

2.  The recent media induced witch hunt against conspiracy theorists and

all anti-Statists following what Clinton admits was the fortuitous OKC
bombing.
Suddenly conspiracy theorists, militia members, and, often all,
libertarians and
other anti-Statists are lumped together as "anti-Governement" and beyond
the pale.

Really....there is no problem coming-up with evidence, though designing
a controlled
experiment is pretty difficult.

     Models can be designed to get the results you want.  They
provenothing unless the constants and relationships can be empirically
verified,
which I am sure you know very well.  Look at the "limits to growth"
non-sense of
Meadows and what's his name!

     Evidence looks clear to me that the powers that be to remain so,
must
and do control memetic infection when the chips are down.  Of course,
eventually,
all ruling classes and/or sections thereof fail in this mission and fall
into the dustbin
of history.  Just follow the activities of the great Foundations...they
spend most of
their money promoting Statist memes!  Just an irrelevancy I suppose?

     Likewise, I am sure!  Tis I that am looking at the facts and
empiricalevidence!  You are creating equations out of thin air chosen to
prove
your pre-chosen conclusion in line with the memes you are carrying.
Actually, I used to carry the same pluralist memes as you until I looked
at some of the
undeniable evidence of ruling class existence, activity, and dominance
around
1967.  Your reactions are not all unpredictable either.  All I have to
do is listen
to my own old tapes.

     The feed back loop through which certain memes increase the
politico-
financial power of certain segments of society thereby increasing the
resources
available to propagate that meme should be key in any model of memetic
infection.
Society has very effective defenses against new memes.  These defenses
are financed
by big money.  Why do you avoid this aspect?  Huh?

By the way:

     All ideas become memes to the extent they spread and thereby create
a new social organism however small or feeble, but not all memes are
ideas in the sense of  modeling reality.   So, of course, everything I
say can be deduced from my ideas (memes to the extent others share
them).  The scientific method is our only test as to whether models are
close enough to reality to be useful or just the "idea cement" or meme
of some social entity.  Unfortunately, it is difficult indeed to apply
the scientific method rigorously in the complex field of study we are
discussing.  But apriori reasoning won't cut it.......

    I would argue that even unconsciously clinging to the

    Here we go again!  No the host does not need to spread the "die for
your country meme"!  The Establishment spreads the meme to the next
generation of cannon fodder through the public schools, mass media,
Churches, etc.  The main avenue of meme propagation, contrary to most
Extropians, is the Establishment!

    The meme is a tool of collective entities....so much for
reductionism.

Please, can we all agree to configure our email clients so that they 
don't send automatic attachments?  I've received 5 "vcard.vcf" files from 
a member of this list in the past 3 days which, since I don't use 
Navigator/Communicator, are nothing but clutter on my desktop.  The same 
goes for those of you whose clients send along MIME files with each 
message.

It's a good idea to check the default preferences for any application 
before you start to use it...

Thanks.

 I have been trying to point this out to people for many years now.
The facts are clear, from the work of the Leakey's, to recent
studies of global distribution of mitochondrial DNA, we are all
originally from Africa.

Try mentioning this in any sort of gathering and watch the results.

Indeed, if one shears the hair of a chimpanzee or an orangutan, 
having "white" skin, leaving just the head's (and other...) they will 
seem with lots of "white" humans... (skin funny..) 
As someone said before, the main problem is really the cultural 
rascism, because of the observed cultural differences between 
humans:  In one side, those with higher level, do not try to get 
"nearer" the lower ones. In the other side, the lower levels make it 
 very difficult when someones uncounsciously tries to 
reflect his characteristics  through them, the superficial feedback 
is sometimes not so good... (as a "similis similia" effect) They are 
in general not educated enough and, consequently, sometimes seems not 
so pleasant to live together... (for example, the first time 
we hear a "rap"... I do not bear more than 1 or two minutes...even 
country music is better - joking..) Anyway, these are pure 
observations on what happens, but, since we are in the side of those 
who can really change the things, I suppose the better way is, 
parallelly, provide or contribute to the necessary cultural evolution 
of the so-called "lower cultural level people". I said parallelly, 
because, I even think that it will  be necessary a separation of the 
Homo cyber from the Homo sapiens, so the first can really evolute. 
And it is no way a case of rascism, cause the spectum of people 
intelectually dummy enough for perturbing the evolution of mankind is 
independent of colour, money, and.. "psedo-culture..." (sometimes 
very misused...)

This is why, although a biological concept of species exists, there is
not biological concept of race (although cultural ethnic groups are
real).

Here he is essentially using the Fermi paradox to prove that travel to
other parallel Everett worlds is impossible.  Of course, the same argument
proves either that travel to other stars is impossible, or that there are
no other civilizations within our past light cone.

Many people believe that neither of these is the case, and that the Fermi
paradox must have some other explanation.  The same belief would invalidate
the claim that MW implies quantum linearity.

I'll make worse. For going deeper with the scientific conclusions, 
I prefer to go straight to the points, so the intellectual selection 
will be done...As a matter of fact, we are talking in the teacher's 
room, and not at the school yard, nor at high school, and not even 
just bachelorate level... (although eventual true intelectuals are 
always welcome, independently on their academic education...)
Let's go:

1) Indeed, as a  scientist I know that studying the reallity of 
the facts is much better than working in illusion. Even if we 
want to give another option to the other... For example, I repeat 
that the psychological external factor is important and lots of 
blacks will love more themselves and to living  when they can 
make genetical skin-hair-eyes treatment...They already try to 
strenght their hair... 

2)About the "cultural treatment", untill I have perceived, the 
"median" whites will like more to providing it when "pacients" 
will be white too.. ( that is not the ideal, but being very rigid, 
waiting just for the "conversion" of all to the "perfect 
heavenly good", seeing the "brother" as an equal, blablabla, has 
already been shown as not very efficient... from both sides...There 
is necessity of real acts...) Naked truth: Help a black to feel 
better: Make it white... (And we know they will like it...Michael 
Jackson is right...See a picture of him before and after...and his 
success) ( It seems a little joke but, ev'ry body knows, f.ex., that 
Jesus was a hebrew and, very very possibly, black haired, and not so 
white skinned. Even though, the first european painters of  "sacred 
art" made lots of pictures of a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus...and 
Mary, angels, etc...why? Projected on the "Perfect" their notions of 
perfectness... )

2)Ask, for ex ., a black woman if she wouldn't love to change her 
external characteristics. I said woman, since women have dedicated 
more their mind development, in media, associated to external 
factors, because of the "Machist" Natural Selection and also because 
they generally think a lot (just) in "grow up and marry", instead of 
working and earning their money for suviving *for themselves* - by 
the way it is much more interesting and... workless... isn't it? 
With some exceptions, of course... 


PS: Sorry and not for the girls. But the human has added an 
important tool for its evolution: the conciousness of the 
reality... The question for you is: Is this good or better?  Really 
wanna see your answers... And evolutive seriousness... Do not forget 
we're here not just "Playing God...", but...being better than 
such image !...

Still can't recommend Accumodel enough, if you want something on your local
disk. It took me about 10 minutes to construct a 'nano-cog' based on
benzene molecules. This was helped because once I had roughly arranged 6
benzenes at right angles to two central benzene rings, the energy
minimization correctly organized them to form the teeth of the cog. Then I
could save the entire structure and add the structure to itself to produce
a longer cog: the energy minimization calculations were intelligent enough
to match the spokes and core of the cog precisely. Plus stero-pair viewing.
Plus library of basic organic building-blocks. Plus...

Has anybody read any well though out, cogently argued and evidentially
supported theories as to why technology, commerce, exploration, science,
etc. developed in the West (and East) whilst the African sub-continent
remained isolated and communites there relied on gatherer-hunter activities
and basic agriculture?

I'm sure I read somewhere that the Christian concept of God had a lot to do
with it, since it includes the concept of free agency of the individual: a
freedom for self-achievement which is itself a form of worship. But then,
the Chinese invented gunpowder, etc. without Christianity. Equally, the
civilizations of the Roman and Greek empires were founded before Christianity.

It strikes me that the rapid pace of Western development must have had a
certain spark, and that once it started it snowballed (from spark to
snowball, hmmm). So why didn't that spark occur in Africa, or amongst
tribes in Indonesia, etc.

I want to try to get a grasp on this issue, because it seems so similar to
the one we face now, as Extropians. What is it that sparks us to desire
technological progression, whilst others are happy with the status quo, or
fearful of development?

Sarah

There seems to be little question that there *are* Powers That Be and that
one of the things these Powers Do is to support the circulation of
attitudes and opinions in the culture that will benefit their continued
existence and the augmentation of their power.  However, I question the
idea that these Powers align into some monolith, all of whose interests
are one and the same.  The Powers have competing interests, too, surely? 
The French theorist Michel Foucault (for whom I fear there is little love
lost among those on the list who know of him) often insisted that when we
think of power we tend to be enraptured by the image of a sovereign
enacting his will through the manipulation of the world and his subjects,
the image of a massive force working from the top down.  But power in
modern, late modern, or postmodern societies (whichever flavor of theory
you happen to subscribe to) does not function this way *at all*.  Power
circulates, ramifies, from and through innumerable points at once, not so
much from the bottom up, as infinite in all directions. So long as we
still can't get past that sovereign notion of power, however, we tend to
conceive of its workings (in the markets studied by economics, in the
field of discourse studied by memetics (and rhetoricians!)) by positing
the invisible hand of spontaneous order or the hidden hand of conspiracy.
*Neither* the idea that the market, say, emerges in consequence of the
best-possible interaction of sovereign rationally calculating homo
economici in a free-flow of unimpeded information, *nor* the idea that the
market is governed and manipulated by an all or even mostly powerful
monolithic ruling class -- however comforting these ideas may be in the
face of more troubling facts -- comes close to capturing the unholy mess
of the ways in which desire, knowledge, and force fling themselves around
the globe here and now and from here on out.  Best, Dale

Ok, this does it...

The following massive rant is meant for all those questioning the
idea of meme supremacy (some memes are [a lot] better than
others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may
not understand this yet]: ****the transhuman meme/complex****).

Whites rule the world. They have been at the top for a couple of
centuries, and will remain there for a long time to come *unless*
their inflated sanctimonious ego's cause them to let the awesome,
unprecedented power they have today, slip through their fingers.
If this happens we're all *screwed*: whites, 3rd world countries,
"developing democracies" worldwide etc, *and* the EXTROPIANS
who can *only* exist in a technologically advanced, reasonably
free and rational WHITE society. Ever wondered why (virtually?)
all transhumanists are white, why "The Meme" only has (limited)
success in *white* or at least higly *westernized* areas? Maybe the
others just can't *grasp* it, maybe it's just way beyond them like
the concept of "infinity". Maybe...their *genetic programming* 
simply doesn't "allow" them to think that far...*ever*. 

Suggestions of meme and gene equality are rediculous delusions,
wishful thinking or outright *lies*. If you didn't think that the extropian
memes are the best, you wouldn't call yourself an Extropian...I
mean: what would be the point?!  Does anyone on this list seriously
belief that memes that *fool people* with nonsense about heavenly
rewards or whatever, thus keeping them from serious scientific
life extension methods, are ok? These memes *kill* the host,
is that in the host's benefit? Can you call death *succes*? Can
you call a miserable, misguided life ("all will be good when I die,
I'll go to heaven to collect my reward") *good*, is it the same as
a life that is eternal and a celebration of the senses? Would you
recommend a life of suffering, hard work and greyness to *anyone*?
Sometimes "tolerance" can be a killer...when it means you let 
people (slowly) kill themselves and do nothing only because "interference"
could be seen as "intolerance". I'm not saying 
that it's anyones "duty" to "save the world or whatever", but a
little less sanctimoniousness would be nice...

All memes and races are equal, some are just more equal than
others...get it? 

Not all memes are "attainable" for all people. If this were the case,
the transhuman/extropian meme would have spread like wildfire
and would by now dominate the world, because it is the most *rational* one
by far. So most people aren't rational. They don't
(dare to) "think big". If one would look at the topography of trans-
humanism one would find a *relatively* "great" concentration in the LA
area, and the US in general. Also there would be some
"action" in the UK, Germany, the Nordic countries Australia and Canada.
There are some other countries with some (a handful) of
transhumanists but they're few and hardly worth counting (I found 1
transhumanist in [...]! wow!) Now if we look at the people themselves, we
see [ surprise, surprise!] mostly ***white, higher
educated males***. Relatively few females, some Asians,
Hispanics...Indians? Negroes?? None???? Isn't Extropy supposed
to be "the extend of a system's *intelligence*, information,vitality,
diversity and capacity for improvement"? So, I now conclude, using
*your* (official extropic) tools that white males are the most extropic
creatures on earth, that women tend to be more entropic than men,
and that whites are hugely more extropic than other "ethnic groups",
although there are disgustingly few extropians and "the world" should
bow it's head in shame...

Note: the "hidden Extropian" can be ignored in this little "test", 
because a *real* Extropian will try to (and in this age of internet
etc. almost certainly *will*) get in touch with others of his kind in
order to have fun and to network. Am I wrong?

That's the "bad" news.

The good news is that brains will almost certainly be "reprogrammable" in
the future, thus giving ultimately all people
access to all memes, but more importantly the "Master Meme"
which brings eternal life, knowledge, freedom and happiness. 

The bad news is: it might take a while. *But* we have increasingly
better cryonic suspension capabilities and an increasinly greater
lifespan due to better medical care, food etc, so there is hope.

This is an ongoing experiment, and I'm quite sure the future will
prove me completely right (actually, I feel like I'm explaining that
the eart isn't flat to a bunch of hard core Christian "believers", the
facts [see above] are so painfully clear that I can hardly believe how
otherwise obviously rational people can deny them...is it some kind of
misplaced guilt trip???

About this  subject, If we were in real democracies, not 
mediocracies..., drugs should be better studied and 
"counsciously" liberated, with lots of warnings, inclusive about the 
admited dosis for each kind of person, psychologically speaking. 
Anyone should be the "owner of its nose". But, for that, should 
also be correctly instructed about the possible effects of its own
acts....

Okay, I asked you this once before, but either you didn't get my
post or you decided that you didn't want to reply to it yet.

What exactly are you trying to accomplish with this line of argument?
What changes would you like to bring about by presenting this
information?

These questions are not rhetorical. I mean them quite seriously
and I am very interested in reading your response. (I'd be even
more interested if you were to reply to the long post I wrote,
but if you don't want to do that, I'd at least like to see your
reply to my previous paragraph.) I'll repost my earlier post if
you didn't receive a copy.

No question the success of the west is due to too many contingencies for
any theory (that isn't more than a vacuous laudatio or rationalization for
abuses) to really manage to properly grab hold of them all.  One possible
influence that interests me is that in the aftermath of the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire, Western Europe was never able to reconsolidate
itself into a polity with that kind of cohesion and yet was haunted by the
memory (or at the least the fantasy) of it.  The nation-state system was a
system that yielded an interminable competition of powers as well as a
measure of sociocultural consistency -- a state of affairs that has been
exacerbated by the principal institutional developments since: separation
of church and state, separation of powers more generally, rise of reading
publics, rise of industrial civilization and finer-grained division of
labor, emergence of glabal media, multinational corporations and crime
cartels, e-cash, and -- soon enough -- the kind of radicalization of the
separation of powers one finds in works like David Friedman's.  The fact
that in the West the nation-state system immediately incubated a number of
rather brutal imperialisms has no little part in the explanation as to why
*after* the West won, it *remained* a "winner" for so long -- but this is
scarcely the only or exhaustive explanation.  The point is that the West
hit (probably inadvertantly) on the trick that pluralism *produces* power
rather than inhibiting it.  This is a larger, tho' obviously related,
point than simply that competition produces greater efficiency, imo. 
Best, Dale 
PS: By the way, returning for a moment to David Friedman, what *does* the
list think of the idea that it is best to say that Friedman's model is
not in stricto senso anarchist since it is more (at least the way we would
read it today, after understanding cryptomarkets) a sketch of the
institutions of rational governance that are most likely to *remain* in
the aftermath of the decline of the Weberian nation-state than it is a
blueprint for smashing the state?  Best, Dale

Sonnet On Future Progress


I am here-- uploaded and unafraid
Of the technology great minds have made;
The projects of dreams: now reality,
Are revered by few but embraced by me.
I have surpassed the fated social trend
To exist instead of live-- to depend
Upon an authoritarian God--
I have learned that all such beliefs are flawed.
I welcome the change tomorrow will bring,
And acknowledge my reason for being;
I will not die-- I will not be deaths slave,
Ill transcend the boundaries: I will be more,
I shall surpass all mortal limits, for
The purpose of life should not be the grave.

Well, theres Jared Diamonds _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ which has been
mentioned here several times.  Theres a nice bite-size version of
this (along with fairly recent comments from many people such as Greg
Benford and Kevin Kelly) in Diamonds paper "Why Did Human History
Unfold Differently On Different Continents For The Last 13,000 Years?"
 at http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p1.html

Its interesting, although it may not have the academic rigor you
might be looking for.

Probably not, but I do think that someone must have made a spirited and
informed attempt. Does anyone have the name of any books worth reading? I
suspect there are multiple ideas, parts of all of which are correct: I'd
like the chance to judge them for myself.

But that, of course, begs the question: how did the Roman Empire come in to
being? Does this, I wonder, lead back to the 'cradle of civilization' in
the Middle East? What puzzles me is how tool-use occurred throughout
humanity, but at some point stopped developing for some people, whilst
others continued to develop more and more advanced technology. And, in some
ways, more advanced societal structures (although that is open to debate).

Sarah,

I think that you have a really good question. I know that there are lots of 
very good books written on the rise of western civilization. Almost all of 
them include lots of scholarly speculation on how the Calvinist (that is 
the Christian sect that you are referencing) made it O.K. to become filthy 
rich by reasoning that the more rich a person became the more god must 
truly be blessing them. This thinking made it possible to intellectually 
support the idea of a powerful merchant class that was able to take part in 
governing their nation's affairs (and latter international affairs) as 
opposed to the European Nobility's preoccupation with "the divine rights of 
kings."

Where things start get interesting in this "progression of progress" line 
of thinking is when people start to speculate on the role played by a 
virtually empty North American continent (at least from the European point 
of view) with it's limitless natural resources on western development and 
capitalism. Many years ago while I was in college I went to  Mexico to 
study land reform issues and ran across lots of good books that had some 
very different ideas about western progress from the popular ones taught in 
this country. I wish I could remember some of the titles but I know if you 
look for them you will find them. In fact, I think you will find tons and 
tons of written stuff on western progress but (unless things have changed 
in the past few years) you will not find very much written on sub-Shari 
African culture  -except, of course, how it relates to western 
civilization.

How this fits in with what you are thinking about is I feel that there is 
really no way that we can with any confidence understand why western 
culture developed the way it did verses other cultures because we simply 
don't know anything about these other cultures. The questions that you are 
raising are also very revealing about us in the west because they force us 
to run smack dab into our western ethnocentric blind spot.

As a parasitic growth on Greek culture.  It's well-known that
throughout the imperial period, the Roman armies were accompanied
by Greek engineers and scientists (very early on, Archimedes gave
the Romans a first-hand lesson in the military power of good
engineering). From the historical perspective of, say, Eastern
Europeans, the "real" Roman empire ended up being reabsorbed by
Greece: the Eastern Empire outlived the Western Empire by a millenium,
and its fall was as much due to the Crusaders (who sacked Constantinople
and burned the libraries) as to the later Turks.

Which begs the question: how did it happen that the Greeks were
the first to leave us surviving extensive theoretical writings on
astronomy, mathematics, political theory, rhetoric, logic, etc,
etc, etc?  How did it happen that the Greeks discovered and developed
the idea of logical rigor?  Like the early modern Europe that Dale
was discussing, Greece was politically divided, resistant to
unification, and constantly obsessed with the internal military-political
balance of power.  Persistent pluralism is a fact of Greek political
life from its first emergence from the Dorian Dark Ages until the
Roman conquest (Alexander's successors, the Antigonids, controlled
Macedonia, but barely kept the various "true" Greeks in line).

Greek tradition credits the Greek sages and philosophers.  Most of
the Greek sages and philosophers trace their lineage back to one
Thales of Miletus, who is probably at least partly historical, but
might be largely legendary.  It's always been interesting to me
that Thales was active among the Greeks about the same time that
Zoroaster was active in Persia, that Lao Tzu and Confucius were
active in China, and that Siddhartha Gautama was active in India.
It's almost as if there were some sort of pan-Eurasian philosophical
renaissance going on in the fifth century BCE.

How did the Greeks get so cool?  I dunno.  I suspect the alphabet
may have something to do with it.  The alphabet was invented in or
near Palestine or Phoenicia during the Greek Dark Ages, and the
Greeks were one of the first non-Canaanite peoples to pick it up.
(Why didn't the Canaanites take off?  Well, the Canaanites were
more caught up in southwest Eurasian imperial wars and politics
than the Greeks, and the successor people that defeated and absorbed
the Canaanites -- the Hebrews -- turned out to be hugely influential
in their own way as well.) I suspect that it is easier for more
people to attain literacy in a society that uses an alphabetic
system of writing than it is in a society that uses the more complex
hieroglyphic or cuneiform systems.  At the time of the emergence
of Greek civilization, the hieroglyhpic and cuneiform systems had
both become extremely complex, full of special cases and weird
traditions that make English spelling look sane, and guarded by an
elaborate trade union of scribes who didn't welcome any competition
that might drive their compensation down.  The Greeks didn't have
these problems.  I also happen to think that a lot of European
"supremacy" is due to the combination of the alphabet with movable
type (movable type doesn't make a huge economic difference in an
ideographic writing system, but it makes books *hugely* cheaper
under an alphabetic system).  So a lot of this stuff might be due
to accidents in the development of communications technology.

That a lot of people hold theories like these somewhere in the back
of their minds explains some of the near-messianic fervor people
often experience soon after they first start learning how to use
the Internet effectively for research and communication.

We really just win completely, when we get to explain the other's  
behaviour and reasons... 
And we have to admit that the wish to "surpass all mortal 
limits" is almost as old as mankind itself... It explains much 
of the religious delyrium, specially  Christ's and Christ based 
ones... Just nowadays, such wish is  getting more feasible in 
reallity...

Thanks Mark, this is a very interesting article. (In fact the whole site
looks like a fascinating and worthwhile Extropina resource.) Anyone who has
been following the 'meme supremecy' and 'racist' threads would probably
enjoy reading of Diamond's paper.

Well, I'm not a racist (have already said...) but, for me, such 
discoveries, technically speaking, just should prove (at first 
sight and no more other discoveries...) that all the present humans 
belongs to the same species (all "sapiens" - hehehe) but not 
necessarily the same race ... mutations happens all the time...
(I would joke a little, but will not for not being misinterpreted...)
I couldn't stand: A heavenly cosmic ray fell over an ancestral of 
ours' head... and some of us got white... and were after banished 
from "paradise"...

I've had debates of this kind with other anthropologists in the department
where I'm studying. There are, actually, a lot of studies anout these other
cultures, some very detailed and wide-ranging. Ethnographic study finds
itself in a double bind. If an ethnography attempts to represent another
culture through reference only to the concepts existing within that culture
itself, then the ethnography's audience (usually Western scholars) will not
be able to relate to the information presented. Hence ethnographers are
forced to produce interpretations which are, ex necessite, founded in
Western ethnocentric concepts. At the end of the day there is a delicate
balance to be struck between the as-objective-as-possible relating of the
daily occurences within a society, and the necessarily subjective and
culturally-relative interpretations and glosses (some would say cultural
'translations') placed on those occurences. (I'm currently looking at
ethnographies dealing with witchcraft, which show the differing balances
placed on these two aspects by different ethnographers.)

Yeah, and it's even more interesting when you think of how Arab and Chinese
cultures were far more technologically advanced than Europe for centuries.
One theory-of-everything book that I found interesting was _Structure and
Change in Economic History_, by Douglas North.  He's an economist (economic
historian), and his take is that certain institutions of property were
critical in allowing certain kinds of growth to occur.  Concepts like "my
tribe owns this land" allowed for agriculture.  "I own this object" allowed
for markets.  "I own this idea" allowed for science to create technology.
As with any book like this, your milage may vary, but it's clearly written
and makes for interesting thinking.

And then there's David Friedman's argumen, which Dale alluded to, that
small nation states created competition between nations, and nations
competed to be succesful.

I'm interested in this too, though my current search is for a basic book on
African civilizations.

Have fun,
Drea

Yes, very true.  There was (still is, I believe) a psychiatrist called
Stanislav Grof, who was one of the first people to get a hold of LSD for
clinical trials, and has continued to believe in the efficacy of
psychedelics for shaking up the old grey matter.  And of course there's
all the marvellous work being done by Shulgin and many others less known,
especially into the use of MDMA as an 'empathogen'.  

This is really the area of drugs that connects with Extropianism most, I
think - the clinical use of drugs to alter character long term, to mold
one's own personality.  I think right use of drugs (apart from for fun)
would be primarily to balance out your character, like someone who is
emotionally frozen should take MDMA, or there should be a drug that gets
soft heads into some hardcore number crunching or something.  And the
main use for psychedelics, as you say, would be to introduce some noiz,
to shake things up a bit, get some random stuff happening, also
revealing one's hidden obsessions of the moment.

There is a huge body of literature in the field of the philosophy of
history that deals with this, some of it from a broadly classical
liberal orientation:

* Firstly, there are racist explanations. I do not believe that these
should be rejected apriori.  Amongst the many works one should consult
are:

John A. Baker, Race, Oxford University Press, 1974/Foundation for Human
Understanding, Athens, Georgia, 1995

J. Phillip Rushton, Race, Evolution and Behavior: A Life History
Perspective, Transcation Books, New Brinswick, New Jersey, 1994

Nathaniel Weyl, The Creative Elite in America, Public Affairs Press,
Washington, DC, 1966
& Steffan T. Possony, The Geography of Intellect, Regnery, Chicago, 1963

* There are environmental/geographic explanations.  Henry Thomas Buckle,
a great classical liberal, in his famous work The History of
Civilization in England (1857), Grant Richards, London, 1904/D.
Appleton, New York, 1895, discusses both geographical determinants,
economic determinants and the role of ideas.

My hero the great liberal J. M. Robertson deals very well with Buckle in
his Buckle and His Critics: A Study in Sociology, Swan Sonnenschein,
London, 1895

* Frederick J. Teggart, who was classical liberal in his orientation,
and is now almost totally forgotten, offered a very interesting broad
philosophical approach to human social evolution based on "external"
stimulative forces. His major works The Processes of History, Yale
University Press, 1910 and Theory of History, Yale University Press,
1925 can be found in a one-volume reprint as Theory and Processes of
History, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1978

* There is a huge literature on the causes of capitalism and the causes
of the "rise of the West". There are many conflicting views of the
impact of Christianity in its various versions (eg the Weber-Protestant
Ethic  thesis).  Many recent works, informed by a fairly positive view
of the nature of free markets and of individual liberty, ascribe much
influence to the "anarchic"/polycentric nature of European civilisation
(ie a lack of a continent-wide monopoly state). See, for example:

Douglas North & Robert P. Thomas, The Rise of the Western World: A New
Economic History, Cambridge University Press, 1973

Mancur Olson, The Rise and Decline of Nations, Yale University Press,
New Haven, Conn., 1982

Gerard Radnitzky (1987), "A Economic Theory of the Rise of Civilization
and Its Policy Implications", Ordo, Vol. 30, pp. 47-90

John A. Hall, Powers and Liberties: An Account of the Causes and
Consequences of the Rise of the West, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1985

E. L. Jones, The European Miracle: Environments, Economics and
Geopolitics in the History of Europe and asia, Cambridge University
Press, 1981/2nd edn, 1987

Nathan Rosenberg & L. E. Birdzell, How the West Grew Rich, Basic Books,
New York/I. VB. Tauris, London, 1986 

*An interesting discussion of the influence of different types of family
structures, their differing "ethos" and apparent poltical consequences
can be found in the works of the French anthropologist Emmanuel Todd:
The Explanation of Ideology: Family Structures and Social Systems, Basil
Blackwell, Oxford, 1985
The Causes of Progress: Culture, Authority and Change, Basil Blackwell,
Oxford, 1987 

* A recent book addressing the whole question is Jared Diamond, Guns,
Germs and Steel: The Types of Human Societies, Jonathan Cape, London,
1997 (sorry, don't have the details of the US edn). William McNeil
critically reviews it The New York Review of Books, 15 May 1997, and
there is an exchange between them in the 26 June 1997 edn, pp. 69-70

This is only a taster to some of the fascinating work that exists
addressing the general topic.  My own view is that the ultimate answer
will lay in a "multi-factorial" (ugh!) answer that integrates external/
geographic/climactic/environmental factors, sheer historical contingency
(ie luck and accident), psychological factors, the role of ideas, and
the influence of differing political structures (ie how far they can
cripple market forces or not).

Yes, I am working on a long work on this subject - but don't ask me when
I'll have it finished!

To My friends,
Hi, my name is Donald.  As some of you may know, I am a bright, sharp, and
intellegent individual.  I don't believe in superstition or pop metaphysical
explainations for my view of reality.  I am a strong practitioner of the
Scientific method of obsevation and experiment. Repeatable occurances of
three times or more, give me a baseline, i.e. three points in a line, on a
graph, one from which I can draw conclusions.  Please read the attached
zipped text file.  It is about my current experiences.  Three of them.  I
think you will find it an interesting read.

Yours truly,
Donald

How is this supposed to work? Perhaps I'm missing something, but
relinquishing all selfhood all at once at the time of biological death
looks to me like a terrible way to pursue life extension. As far as I know,
Clarke doesn't believe in a non-physical afterlife. (Another SF giant,
Robert Heinlein, apparently did and so that's why *he* rejected
cryonics--that and the dislike of his wife Virginia for cryonics.)

I don't what this has to do with the foregoing point. Also, it sounds false
to me as a generalization. No one can accurately speak for all cryonicists,
but after over a decade of involvement, I have a good feel for how many
cryonicists think. Not only are many of us planning on being suspended
head-only (neuropreservation), but many of us expect to either be revived
as uploads or make that transition soon after. (Assuming we don't live long
enough to upload without a period of suspension.) Uploads will have no
single body, and will need no one physical location to exist. The many
cryonicists who favor uploading therefore do *not* see the self and body as
"unconditionally joined". Except, of course, in the sense that software has
to have physical computers on which to run (but not any single computer or
location).

The issues surrounding the contribution of body to personal identity are
complex. If you're interested, I refer you to my doctoral dissertation on
personal identity, especially the last chapter:
http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/disscont.htm

What does it have to do with? Do you think it won't work? Or do you have
faith in an afterlife?

There are many brilliant people who have made amazing contributions who,
nevertheless, make major mistakes in their thinking. My comments are Clarke
are based on the little I've heard about his views. I would love to discuss
them with him in person.

If the person not only lost all memories but also their values,
dispositions, and beliefs, then I would say that person had ceased to
exist. If a new personality develops or is implanted somehow, a new
individual is now embodied in that body. The self is not identical with the
body or even the brain, but with the information embodied and how it is
processed.

That's incorrect. Cryonicists have made that distinction for years. I've
described such a state as "inactivate" and it's usually been called
"deanimate". I wrote a column for Cryonics magazine years ago. One dealing
with this issue was called "The Third State". I can email you it (after the
conference) if you like.

An alternative formulation may be in order:
   Why did older cultures quit advancing?

   Egypt had a high culture that apparently included the study of
mathematics, geometry, and at least some astronomy, chemistry,
and physics. Why did this culture stagnate?
    India had a Rich culture with an apparent emphais on
scholarship.Why did this culture fail to progress?
     China's culture was far in advance of Greco-Roman
culture in many ways. What happened?
    Arab culture was far in advence of early midieval culture
in astronomy and mathematics.
    Japanese culture elected to turn its back on the west for
250 years.

OK, what about this theory? There are many examples of cultures
that apparently quit progressing, with no clear underlying
common reason. Eventually, one culture got to the "rational
breakthrough" and learned the scientific method. It could have
been any culture. Whatever culture got there first would have
taken over the world by spreading this method. The "West" just
happened to be first.

I'm expecting a story on EXTRO 3 to appear on Wired News either tomorrow or
Wednesday. It might bring in a few people. In case I miss it, would someone
who spots it please post it here, or send it to me? I'm curious to see what
it says. It will be written by a friendly contact so should be favorable.

Thanks,

Remember the slaveways from Greg Bear's City of Angels? They are getting

Perhaps we can get a firsthand report on this conference from Tom

EXTRO 3.

=== The Scoop ===============================

Driving Down The Information
Highway

By Jeffrey R. Harrow, TechWeb Contributor

It may come to pass -- and sooner than you think -- that your car will
actually do the driving for you down an information-enabled highway.

The National Automated Highway System Consortium has configured a
7.6-mile section of California's I-15 so cars specially equipped with
video cameras, magnets (to follow magnetic markers on the road) and
radar will do just that.

According to the NAHSC, the
cost to retrofit existing highways is less than $10,000 per mile, and
the group intends to open a prototype "driverless" highway to the
public by 2002.

Later this week, the NAHSC said it plans to demonstrate six automated
driving scenarios on I-15's high-occupancy vehicle lanes.

It would never happen, of course, but what if your computerized
chauffeur was to crash, leading to the more tangible variety? (I'm sure
there are safeguards, but ...) And if that unthinkable was to
occur, would you be at fault? Who would be liable for damages?

If it was a software bug, would the programmer potentially be liable
for manslaughter? Would points accumulate on your driver's
license or on that of your automotive CPU? Would your insurance rates
go up, or would the rates paid by the automated highway or the car's
manufacturer? 

Those are just the questions that quickly come to mind.

Don't get me wrong -- I think automated highway lanes, as an
option, are a valuable idea that almost certainly will come to pass.
But I'm suggesting that, as we work out the technical details, we also
remember that the implications of such a development go far beyond the
technology. How will you, your parents and your kids react to this? How
will the insurance companies and the state laws
regarding drivers' responsibilities and liabilities have to change?

And more. It will get very complicated as the rapidly changing face of
computing and the rapidly traveling automobile merge into the same lane
on the asphalt highway. 

--Jeffrey Harrow is a senior consulting engineer for the corporate
strategy and technology group at Digital Equipment. A more extensive
version of this discussion, as well as other discussions about the
innovations and trends of contemporary computing

And the default (not always adhered to) for the Arab and Chinese
cultures was a political monolith (the Caliph or the Emperor),
not the pluralism found in ancient Greece and early modern
Europe.

I have a book called "A History of the African Peoples" that
might be what you're looking for. I don't recall the author's
name. It does cover some of the earlier civilizations, though as
I recall it's a little weak on the old Zimbabwean cultures
because it was written before a lot of the fruitful digs in that
area were analyzed.

If so and it's meaningless to ask what slit the electron went through, and it 
all just comes down to what I can calculate, then what does that say about 
the idea that there are things in the world independent of me, and what does 
that say about your 3 different types of "reality"?

So?  Are "important" memes inherently harder to transmit
than "unimportant" ones?

`The absurdity is highlighted when one considers that in some situations
quantum mechanical probabilities can be given by irrational numbers (not
expressible as a fraction), so that in those cases... the determination of
the number of worlds to be created would have to be the result of some
approximation chosen by Nature.'  (p. 338)

Well..

No.

I know several counterexamples to your statement.  You should visit Silicon
Valley or LA (the centers of extropianism) sometime.  They're both
multiracial, and becoming more so each year.

You're really stepping on one of my pet peeves - claims unsupported (actually
contradicted) by evidence.

Well, nobody here has said that all memes or all genes are equal.  I've
simply pointed out that you haven't any evidence to support you claim that
they are correlated with skin color or ancestral geographic origin at 3000
BC.  On theoretical grounds, I'd expect Africans, who have the longest
experience with the most complex environment on earth (lots of people) , to
have the best genes on average.  In practice, we just don't have enough
variation between huamn groups to anticipate big differences.  Culture is
what counts.  The Europeans of which you're so enamoured came very close to
falling for the bunkum of facism and communism just this century.

Did you miss my recent post on conspiracy theory where I said that memes are
rarely selected on the basis of their truth?  Aside from that, nobody has yet
significantly extended their life or built a nanotech machine, or
significantly exceeded human norms by cyborgization.  It's perfectly rational
to disbelieve their immanence and worry about other things instead.

Personal theory?  Mountainous geography, lots of coastline, and localized
political structures made conquest difficult but communication and trade
easy.  Result: good memes for cooperation and constructive competition got
the upper hand over conquest and religious ones.

I don't consider modern pluralism descended from the Greeks.  Modern
pluralism developed in England and Holland around 1600 to 1700 as a result of
a loosely similar situation where trade was easy but conquest hard.  They
took lots of (modified) ideas from the Italian Renaissance, which in turn had
gotten lots of (modified) ideas from the surviving Greek texts.  But,
basically, they did it themselves.

Personal theory, of course.  YMMV

I choke on this. Though physical constraints make solutions to forms
similar,
such as fish and airplanes, the details are absurdly diverse. Is this
convergence?

My experiences differ from this. I once saw a grain of sand about the
size of a car, albeit in an altered state. Yes, I knew it was a grain of
sand, but the size parameter was obviously altered. I suspect at that
moment more of my neurons were into the sand grain than into the rest of
my visual field.

     After perusing Robin Hanson's work "If Uploads Come First" (and I do 
     plan to give it a more concerted read when it's not competing with my 
     first listen of Kenny Loggins' new CD <G>), I began doing some 
     surfing.  I'm planning to add "Escape Velocity" to my list of upcoming 
     reads (a speed reading course is starting to sound practical right 
     about now).
     I came across a URL with an article by Andrew Brown entitled "How to 
     make a soul":
     
     "There is no doubt that the process of learning from the outside is 
     getting better and better. You can use a brain scanner to look inside 
     someone's head while he learns a poem or recites one back. You can see 
     which parts of the brain are working, and how hard. But even if these
     scanners could track each signal in each of the brain's billions of 
     cells, they would still not explain why that activity should feel the 
     way it does. People may, someday, be able to find which pattern of 
     neurons firing makes up a thought. But what does that tell you about   
     consciousness, about the feeling of the thought? "
     
     I think that the last statement is definitely the rub for me and my 
     particular hold out in jumping on the pro-popcicle brigade 
     (condescension would be interpreted, just being whimsical).  I don't 
     particularly desire being convinced and I don't mind being regarded as 
     a foolish traditionalist who blithely accepts the fate dealt to the 
     billions before this generation with its potentially life-extending 
     technologies: the uploading of consciousness, the cryogenic suspension 
     of physical matter, etc..  
     
     Are thoughts just states and balances of chemicals, suspended neurons 
     who are firing at a precise frequency and/or wattage.  I don't have 
     scientific terms to offer here.  But I am left cold (no pun intended, 
     well, yes, now that I think of it, it works...<G>) by the notion that 
     any part of me could be reanimated and the "me" that commanded the 
     body would just return to a conscious state.  Presumably, "I" would 
     have the same lack of awareness of time passing as when I hit my 
     snooze for a few extra minutes of pre-awakening bliss only to hear the 
     radio blast after what seems like a few seconds.
     
     Perhaps these topics have been ground down to their banal fundamentals 
     in this digest and maybe I have some more research to do before I so 
     casually dismiss the fervor of the life extension proponents.

 I would like to recommend the book "The Africans" by Dr Ali
Mazrui, there is a PBS series of the same name.

While a current statement about Africa, it has a great deal of
historical information, and from an Africans perspective.

It completely changed my view.

In relation to this idea I might add that of a "water" culture or an

 Egypt was one such.  The ruling class gets entrenched.. (no! not conspiricy

In Japan gunpowder was invented....then shelved....for the ruling class were
swordsmen....and gunpowder would have upset the status quo.

China had many, many potentially explosive inventions...(also gunpowder)..of
which nothing was ever made...perhaps for the same reason.

A n aside.

Rome was destroyed by tax collectors....the barbarains just did the mopping
up.
Relegion was devoloped by the rulers to quell competetiion ....make the
populace happy with their lot.

Very Interesting..perhaps the answer would be found in a technological
history of the world rather than the usual political rendition?

     There must be some serious cultural differences going on here...
     
     Prof. Gomes writes (and I have rephrased for clarity):
     
     I repeat that the psychological external factor is important and lots 
     of blacks will love themselves and their lives more when they can
     make genetic skin-hair-eyes treatment...they already try to
     straighten their hair...
     
     Rick Knight responds:
     
     Having been raised in the south with parents who were, at least, by 
     default, racist and also having to spend most of my life carefully 
     deprogramming myself and make the distinctions of whatever inate 
     aversion I still have towards certain groups of people (usually 
     class-based), it is quite a sensitive issue to hear such gross 
     generalization about race.  One such generalization is the assertion 
     that people of color "already try to straighten their hair".  Hello?  
     Like we haven't been doing everything under the sun to our looks in 
     the predominantly white culture.  The thing is, the cosmetics industry 
     has been catering to that majority for much longer.  Only recently 
     have people of color had quality personal care products to alter their 
     appearance.
     
     The other statement that people of color will love themselves more 
     when they can alter their appearance also smacks of some programming.  
     That notion spans the breadth of western culture in all races where 
     they don't have to spend each day worrying about survival issues.  If 
     those bases are covered, you start worrying about how to get 
     prettier/more noticeable/more clout.  (For the genuine geek, that 
     means: how to get more gear <G>).
     
     We're programmed to dislike our personal appearance in one capacity or 
     another.  Hair texture/color, eye color, skin w/ wrinkles, w/ acne, in 
     need of a tan, flat stomach, prominant chest, you name it!  That way, 
     a multi-billion dollar industry can keep its wheels spinning at a 
     feverish pitch.  
     
     And IF there are people of color who DO dislike themselves and the way 
     they look in this culture, it's likely because the majority has spent 
     several centuries chanting the mantra of them not being good enough in 
     some capacity.  It wouldn't be hard for me to draw the connection 
     between the way I looked and the availability of prosperity to the 
     group to which I resembled.

Dear Mr. Satterburg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. Johnson,     5 August, 1997


Please accept this as formal confirmation that (inter alia) I shall be 
filing an Amicus Curiae brief for consideration by the relevant courts in 
the case of:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     Mary Katherine Schmitz LeTourneau:  Ref: 97-1-015 23-1 . KNT

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


As I have discussed with you all on several occasions now, this case has 
grave human-rights and international relevance and implications, as well 
as raising profound legal, hmuman rights and social issues under the laws 
of the State of Washington and the United States itself

I owe you a preliminary explanation for my direct personal involvement in 
this case.  This also constitutes a statement for the relevant official 
records.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[A] As explained to me by Mr. Dale Foreman of the Washington State 
Republican Committee, the prosecution is being brought to make an example 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. This is unacceptable. Political 'Show 
Trials' and witch-hunts do not form any proper part of the American legal 
tradition.


As Mr. Satterberg will well recall, I contrasted his and his colleagues' 
prosecutorial zeal in in hounding a harmless female school-teacher most 
unfavourably vis-a-vis his and his colleagues' seeming indifference and/or 
reluctance to go after Microsoft Corporation and its officers (based at 
Redmond in Seattle, well within King County jurisdiction) for prima facie 
grotesque breaches of United States laws, including (inter alia) the 
Charter of the National Security Agency itself.

This is a matter of the utmost gravity for the constitutional rights of 
all American Windows95 users in the US and elsewhere, who have thus been 
rendered vulnerable to terrorist and criminal attack.


I pointed out very directly to Mr. Satterburg that many CIA and NSA 
staffers were well aware of (and outraged by) these matters, and he could 
perhaps start his invstigations by discussing these problems with them.


Indeed, this whole Microsoft Corporation affair is a matter of direct 
and most basic concern to the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and all its members.


Inescapably obviously, Mr. Maleng and Mr. Satterburg are most unwilling to 
pursue grotesque legal infractions when they involve a major Seattle 
employer, powerful (and perhaps feared?) rogue elements in the intelligence 
and security services, and the many extremely rich and powerful interests 
who are gaining illicitly from criminal misconduct by enriching themselves 
via illegally obtained 'commercial intelligence.'

'The Economist' writes: 

(p. 48, July 26th, 1977, "Inside the Belly of the Beast')"

"When it comes to campaign finance, there is in fact a nasty, unspoken 
bipartisan consensus: that both parties are addicted to massive 
amounts of money, and they do not want to change the system that gives it 
to them."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[B] The 'alternatives' presented to Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and the 
direct or indirect threats levelled against her) during the pre-trial 
interrogations constitute unapccptable coercion, and a violation of her 
rights, as well as an attempted pre-emption of the proper role of the 
courts.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[C] The Statute under which Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau is being accused 
constitutes a direct attack on the role of the Judiciary, as well as being 
in violation of accepted legal norms.  It is also -- in my view -- a 
Statute which violates the Separation of Powers by reason of the 
Legislature's attempting a usurpation of the the proper functions of the 
Judiciary to determine matters of fact, intention, and the moral content 
of actions.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[D] The Statute in question is quite certainly a gross example of that 
most evil legal positivism which characterized Nazi Germany and Stalin's 
USSR, whereby the 'law' was deemed to be whatever the State wanted it to 
be. The Statute therefore violates the jurisprudential bases and character 
of the entire United States legal system.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[E] The Prosecution _agrees_ that whatever took place between Mary Kay 
Schmitz LeTourneau and the then-13-year-old boy in the case took place 
without any element of coercion or other imposition of will being present. 
 Yet -- by direct analogy --  the Prosecution would seek to assert that 
(in Shakespeare's play) Romeo subjected Juliet to 'child rape', and -- in 
present-day Seattle -- would be coerced to plead 'guilty' to 'child rape' 
charges in direct and blatant contravention of the facts.

Such coercion is _grossly_ improper, and is in itself tantamout to an 
interference with the accused's rights to plead and appeal directly to the 
relevant courts themselves.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[F] For a mother to be threatened with protracted and obligatory 
psychiatric intervention and coercion intended to 'cure' her of her love 
for her child's father is _completely unacceptable_ under all ethical and 
human-rights principles.  Such action would grossly violate the standards 
of medical ethics of the relevant professional bodies, and constitutes 
grounds for formal complaint thereto.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[G] As I have previously stated, Mr. Satterberg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. 
Johnson will ineluctably be held directly and personally accountable for 
every aspect of their actions in this (and any other relevant) case.


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

A TIME FOR CHOOSING:

Why should I (and many others) be so concerned by the vicious prosecution 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and others who have physically harmed or 
coerced no-one)?


I can find no better words than these.


   "You and I have a rendezvous with Destiny.  We can preserve for our 
children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we can sentence them 
to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.  If we fail, at 
least let our children and our childrens' children say of us that we 
justified our brief moment here.  We did all that could be done."


-- Ronald Wilson Reagan, addressing the Republican Convention in Phoenix, 
Arizona 33 years ago, on Barry Morris Goldwater's bid for the Presidency.


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
Yours Sincerely,

Anthony Hugh Hollick

     I have made the assertion that I presently have no interest in 
     cryonics and it has nothing to do with fear.   
     
     Max More asks: 
     
     What does it have to do with? Do you think it won't work? Or do you 
     have faith in an afterlife?
     
     Rick responds:
     
     Upon analysis, there may be residual cultural programming that holds 
     to a "belief" in afterlife.  However, one of my favorite sayings in my 
     more informed years is "belief is a choice" kind of like "I like 
     vanilla".  Why?  Because I do.  (Actually, my spiritual beliefs were 
     augmented very much by sexual orientation issues I contended with).  
     My psychedelic experiences probably provide more compelling "personal" 
     evidence of something buzzing beyond the physical realm.
     
     Do I think it won't work?  Yes, I'd have to say that I think freezing 
     one's head in the hopes of reanimating it and picking up where one 
     left off to have just about as much stock as the energy that makes me 
     who I am has a separate existence apart from my physicality.  I do 
     think it's possible to reanimate a human being if properly preserved.  
     Who will occupy that reanimated physical space is not clear.  I go 
     back to my question about a person who experiences profound brain 
     trauma that results in irrecoverable amnesia.  The physical body is 
     there but the self who people once knew is not.  Likewise, the person 
     in that physical body has no recollection of many facets of their 
     previous life (although they do hold onto to other learned concepts 
     like the language they were raised with).
     
     Once one reaches a point where death is inevitable, there is certainly 
     no fear to contend with.  Buried or frozen, you are out of the picture 
     (and I guess with cryonics, that means "for a while").
     
     I guess for me it may boil down to trust in humans.  I have trust 
     issues and contracts and pre-procedural assurances aside, IF the me 
     that I knew did re-emerge, I may not at all be so thrilled with the 
     outcome.  When I compare this to my choice to believe that my 
     consciousness is a self-contained energy field that may have sentience 
     beyond physical mortality, I have, curiously, much less mistrust.  It 
     may be because humans are such predictable assholes; etherial 
     creatures on the other hand, I don't have as much experience with <G>.

Hyperthesis: a new classification for qualitative scientific concepts
that are supported by overwhelming evidence 


        Scientific concepts are arranged within a flexible hierarchy and
rigidly evaluated via the scientific method. The three main classes for
scientific explanations are hypotheses, theories, and laws. Although all
scientific concepts are accepted on a provisional basis, the theory of
natural selection via differential reproduction is the highest regarded
concept in the life sciences because so many lines of modern evidence
support it. In fact, the revised, neodarwinian theory of natural
selection provides the intellectual backdrop for current biological
thought and research. Unlike physics, scientific laws are rare in
biology because the complexities of living systems are not easily
reduced into simple rules or elegant formulas; therefore, qualitative
concepts like natural selection will never be replaced by any general,
mathematical Law of Evolution. Unfortunately, the term "theory" in
colloquial English also refers to an unproved idea that is likely wild
speculation, false conjecture, or pure fantasy. As a result, many
non-scientists, laypeople, and creationists misuse the word "theory" to
suggest that natural selection and other valid concepts might be
scientifically unsound. Since the theory of natural selection is the
keystone principle of biology, there should be no discrepancy between
the general public and the scientific community on how important and
useful the concept of natural selection actually is. Therefore, I
propose the hyperthesis (Gr. hyper, above + tithenai, to put), a new
classification for scientific concepts which would currently be ranked
as well supported, qualitative theories. Although natural selection via
differential reproduction is both the ideal model and best example to
illustrate the hyperthesis concept, many other theories in the
biological and social sciences easily fit into this schema. Some critics
might argue that this new term only adds another layer of complexity to
the over-stretched vocabulary of scientists; however, the hyperthesis
concept eliminates more confusion for non-scientists than it causes to
the established jargon. Also, it should be noted that the term
hyperthesis is a logical extension of the hierarchy of scientific
concepts ( i.e. hypothesis, theory, hyperthesis) currently used by
scientists worldwide.

Hyperthesis: a new classification for qualitative scientific concepts

        Scientific concepts are arranged within a flexible hierarchy 
and
rigidly evaluated via the scientific method. The three main classes for
scientific explanations are hypotheses, theories, and laws. Although 
all
scientific concepts are accepted on a provisional basis, the theory of
natural selection via differential reproduction is the highest regarded
concept in the life sciences because so many lines of modern evidence
support it. In fact, the revised, neodarwinian theory of natural
selection provides the intellectual backdrop for current biological
thought and research. 

[[[You might mention that subsets of the Modern Synthesis 
(neodarwinism)
fuel or contribute to several rapidly growing hard engineering 
fields,e.g. 
evolveable hardware/software, memetics,distributed computation and 
networking.]]

Unlike physics, scientific laws are rare in
biology because the complexities of living systems are not easily
reduced into simple rules or elegant formulas; therefore, qualitative
concepts like natural selection will never be replaced by any general,
mathematical Law of Evolution.

[[Um, isnt  *Evolutionary Therory* a journal with mathematical models 
of various life system processes? Perhaps a general model is not 
possible, 
but the restricted problems might deserve mention.]]

 Unfortunately, the term "theory" in
colloquial English also refers to an unproved idea that is likely wild
speculation, false conjecture, or pure fantasy. As a result, many
non-scientists, laypeople, and creationists misuse the word "theory" to
suggest that natural selection and other valid concepts might be
scientifically unsound. 

[[Just so. The Third International list imaginative contemplation
and belief as first and second definitions of theory. Only in #3 
and #4
are scientific definitions aired, which incidentally take up 2/3 of the 
text
and require much more dedication to fathom.
Definition #5 is ...something taken for granted esp. on trivial or 
inadequate grounds....]]

Since the theory of natural selection is the
keystone principle of biology, there should be no discrepancy between
the general public and the scientific community on how important and
useful the concept of natural selection actually is.

[[This presumes a sanity and competency of the GP.]]

Therefore, I
propose the hyperthesis (Gr. hyper, above + tithenai, to put), a new
classification for scientific concepts which would currently be ranked
as well supported, qualitative theories. 

[[A fair enough neologism, but it may lack market appeal (cf memetic 
engineering).
Do you have a list of snappier alternatives?

On a quick glance through it engaged my attention enough for me to have
decided to save it and check it a bit more carefully later.

The word sounds sexy, which is a plus.  Good idea, too.

As others have pointed out, this does seem a little unrelated to this list.
If there are to be such posts is there any chance of their being
constructed as argued, Extropian-orientated discussions of the issues
raised, whatever they may be. Perhaps our opininons could be canvassed on
particular points of issues, or extrapolations could be made to other
points of interest. Because to date these posts seem to be reports of a
woman who had sex with a minor being prosecuted for doing that, because
it's against the law. This isn't to say there aren't issues of interest
being raised, just that they aren't be presented in a particularly apposite
way to this particular audience.

I certainly agree that another term is needed for "theory."  Like many of
you, I've probably suffered the "evolution is only a theory" line so many
times that it triggers an allergic reaction.
 
And I agree that hyperthesis fits the current scientific convention.
 
However, I think this idea fails to address the problem of separating
public perception from scientific consensus.  The term "hyperthesis"
itself is so aloof that I can't imagine using it in general conversation.
Referring to the "evolutionary hyperthesis" would only earn a glassy-eyed
stare.  I'm not sure it does anything to drive the point home that "this
is more than a guess, dammit."

Dear Mr. Satterburg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. Johnson,     5 August, 1997

Please accept this _second_ fax transmission (the first having seemingly 
'gone missing') as further formal confirmation that (inter alia) I shall 
be filing an Amicus Curiae brief for consideration by the relevant courts 
in the case of:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     Mary Katherine Schmitz LeTourneau:  Ref: 97-1-015 23-1 . KNT

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


As I have discussed with you all on several occasions now, this case has 
grave human-rights and international relevance and implications, as well 
as raising profound legal, hmuman rights and social issues under the laws 
of the State of Washington and the United States itself

I owe you a preliminary explanation for my direct personal involvement in 
this case.  This also constitutes a statement for the relevant official 
records.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[A] As explained to me by Mr. Dale Foreman of the Washington State 
Republican Committee, the prosecution is being brought to make an example 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. This is unacceptable. Political 'Show 
Trials' and witch-hunts do not form any proper part of the American legal 
tradition.


As Mr. Satterberg will well recall, I contrasted his and his colleagues' 
prosecutorial zeal in in hounding a harmless female school-teacher most 
unfavourably vis-a-vis his and his colleagues' seeming indifference and/or 
reluctance to go after Microsoft Corporation and its officers (based at 
Redmond in Seattle, well within King County jurisdiction) for prima facie 
grotesque breaches of United States laws, including (inter alia) the 
Charter of the National Security Agency itself.

This is a matter of the utmost gravity for the constitutional rights of 
all American Windows95 users in the US and elsewhere, who have thus been 
rendered vulnerable to terrorist and criminal attack.


I pointed out very directly to Mr. Satterburg that many CIA and NSA 
staffers were well aware of (and outraged by) these matters, and he could 
perhaps start his investigations by discussing these problems with them.


Indeed, this whole Microsoft Corporation affair is a matter of direct 
and most basic concern to the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and all its members.


Inescapably obviously, Mr. Maleng and Mr. Satterburg are most unwilling to 
pursue grotesque legal infractions when they involve a major Seattle 
employer, powerful (and perhaps feared?) rogue elements in the intelligence 
and security services, and the many extremely rich and powerful interests 
who are gaining illicitly from criminal misconduct by enriching themselves 
via illegally obtained 'commercial intelligence.'

'The Economist' writes: 

(p. 48, July 26th, 1977, "Inside the Belly of the Beast')"

"When it comes to campaign finance, there is in fact a nasty, unspoken 
bipartisan consensus: that both parties are addicted to massive 
amounts of money, and they do not want to change the system that gives it 
to them."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[B] The 'alternatives' presented to Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and the 
direct or indirect threats levelled against her) during the pre-trial 
interrogations constitute unapccptable coercion, and a violation of her 
rights, as well as an attempted pre-emption of the proper role of the 
courts.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[C] The Statute under which Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau is being accused 
constitutes a direct attack on the role of the Judiciary, as well as being 
in violation of accepted legal norms.  It is also -- in my view -- a 
Statute which violates the Separation of Powers by reason of the 
Legislature's attempting a usurpation of the the proper functions of the 
Judiciary to determine matters of fact, intention, and the moral content 
of actions.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[D] The Statute in question is quite certainly a gross example of that 
most evil legal positivism which characterized Nazi Germany and Stalin's 
USSR, whereby the 'law' was deemed to be whatever the State wanted it to 
be. The Statute therefore violates the jurisprudential bases and character 
of the entire United States legal system.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[E] The Prosecution _agrees_ that whatever took place between Mary Kay 
Schmitz LeTourneau and the then-13-year-old boy in the case took place 
without any element of coercion or other imposition of will being present. 
Yet -- by direct analogy --  the Prosecution would seek to assert that (in 
Shakespeare's play) Romeo subjected Juliet to 'child rape' (and/or vice 
versa), and -- in present-day Seattle -- would be coerced to plead 
'guilty' to 'child rape' charges in direct and blatant contravention of 
the facts.

Such coercion is _grossly_ improper, and is in itself tantamout to an 
interference with the accused's rights to plead and appeal directly to the 
relevant courts themselves.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[F] For a mother to be threatened with protracted and obligatory 
psychiatric intervention and coercion intended to 'cure' her of her love 
for her child's father is _completely unacceptable_ under all ethical and 
human-rights principles.  Such action would grossly violate the standards 
of medical ethics of the relevant professional bodies, and constitutes 
grounds for formal complaint thereto.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[G] As I have previously stated, Mr. Satterberg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. 
Johnson will ineluctably be held directly and personally accountable for 
every aspect of their actions in this (and any other relevant) case.


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

A TIME FOR CHOOSING:

Why should I (and many others) be so concerned by the vicious prosecution 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and others who have physically harmed or 
coerced no-one)?


I can find no better words than these.


   "You and I have a rendezvous with Destiny.  We can preserve for our 
children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we can sentence them 
to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.  If we fail, at 
least let our children and our childrens' children say of us that we 
justified our brief moment here.  We did all that could be done."


-- Ronald Wilson Reagan, addressing the Republican Convention in Phoenix, 
Arizona 33 years ago, on Barry Morris Goldwater's bid for the Presidency.

The theory is that blacks were placed at a substantial disadvantage
by a couple of centuries of legal (i.e. government-sponsored)
discrimination. Thus, we need to give blacks preferential treatment
to compensate. Frankly, this has always seemed reasonable to me
both in theory and in practice, but just as the earlier discrimination
hurt most blacks and some whites, the current situation hurts some
whites and some blacks, while helping some blacks. Since I'm a
white upper-income male, I'm not usually directly affected, so the
current situation, though clearly not perfect, is good enough that
it's not high on my list of things to think about.

I want to live in a world where each individual is evaluated and
treated as an individual. I would like government policy to be
directed toward that goal. I would like to see a gradual elimination
of preferential treatment for blacks over a period of decades. I
believe that this is exactly what we are seeing. I would also like
to see us work our way out of some of the nasty effects of our
current welfare system. We seem to be making progress with this, too.
these subjects are correlated because, due to our history, many
blacks are poor and became part of the welfare system. Note that
many poor whites who are part of an equivalent but distinct
welfare subculture. We cannot eliminate these subcultures overnight
simply by waving our hands and trotting out our high-falutin'
principles. Those are real black and white people.

I think that I question that. Is it wise to allow the misuse of a term  to

Sounds good. I'm pretty sure that any interesting long-term
historical development has multiple causes. I like this theory,
and I still like the alphabetic theory (which I should no doubt
be crediting to whomever thought it up first) too.

You're right about early modern European pluralism. I was confused
in the back of my head by Hayek's arguments in THE CONSTITUTION OF
LIBERTY to the effect that the notion of "rule of law" (as
distinguished from rule of men) was first articulated among the
Greeks and was transmitted in their literature (and that of the
Romans, notably Cicero) to modern European political philosophers.
But rule of law is a different thing from political pluralism,
though perhaps the historical correlation between the two is not
entirely coincidental.

As long as we're tossing around personal theories here...

Agricultural societies will tend towards "civilization", in the
technological sense, anyway.
Why? It is only through agriculture that long term food surpluses can be
created. This leads
to two things: spare time, for intellectual pursuits, and the written word,
used to identify 
personal property. Agriculture turns land into a scarce resource, which in
turn creates two 
more important things: property rights, and war. Of course, there was
plenty of war before, 
but the agriculture makes the spoils so much sweeter, and only those long
term food surpluses
can move and army over long distances. Property rights, of course, allow
individuals to internalize
the benefits of investments, making such investments more likely and more
numerous. These investments lead to two things: taxation, and the formation
of financial structures (lending institutions). 
Anyway, I'll stop at this point in history. The bottom line is that
hunter-gatherer societies are too 
busy staying alive to mount a manned mission to Mars.

     I can say that those with a lot of emotional

I've been self-reflecting a lot lately (summer job lifeguarding -- lotsa
time to think) and I have a "simple" question for all extropians:

What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase the
amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social, etc.)?
Or if not changes, per se, what have you always been doing to effect the
same end?

I'm most interested in ideas and insight into self-improvement from list
members' personal experiences.

Thanks,

Hagbard

I think the point is that the current term is ambiguous, which is
guaranteed to cause misuse.

I agree that it's important that there be a new word, though I agree with
Sumner who pointed out that trying to get people to use the word
"hyperthesis" would be a hard fought battle.  I know I couldn't guess the
definition just by looking at it, and that's half the battle with a neologism.

I feel like "consensum," or some other word derived from "consensus" might
fair better.  Consensum would be defined as "the judgment arrived at by
most of those concerned," or "that which has been concluded by consensus."

This word provides a number of important advantages.  First, it's fairly
obvious within context as to what "consensum" means. ("Consensum of
evolution?  The Big Bang consensum?  Well, it must be related to
consensus...")  This is important, particularly when talking to people who
will have had little Greek or scientific education.  

However, it is obviously different from consensus, ending in "um" which
gives it the sound of empricism.  It rings of "momentum."  All this works
together to make people think that they have heard the word before; that
the word is actually very OLD and if they just thought a bit they would
remember the definition.  IMHO this trait is much more memetically useful
than the sexier "hyperthesis" (which is sexy primarily because of the
hyper- prefix), because it makes a person think that the word is already in
use, and that they use a new OLD word by using it.

A secondary but equally useful advantage is that it also infers that most
people already agree with the "consensum," much like calling yourself the
"Moral Majority" or the Bolshevik party makes it appear that you are
actually in the majority.  When used with a self-titled "creation
scientist," it emphasizes that the theist argues against a well established
majority.

I think this term conveys meaning better while also filling in the painful
gap we find between "theory" and "law."  Thoughts?

Robin,

Here are my reactions to your three proposals:

1.  "incentive Contracts"

Seems pretty simple and straightforward.  If you think the economics and 
incentives are favorable and easy to justify, the problem in having an 
effect on the real world is selling it to insurers, health providers, and 
their marketers.

This may be the most connected to the health policy position you've 
accepted, but it doesn't seem to provide a lot of leverage for change, and 
the change you'd be pushing for isn't in a direction we care about a lot.

2.  "Explaining Product Bans"

This is a fascinating area.  I believe what you said when you started 
exploring this idea (as I remember it); this is a path that could lead 
(after many years and much work) to a well-known result with a school of 
fellow researchers exploring implications.  I think you could make a big 
difference in the world with this one.

3.  "Why do We Disagree?"

Interesting qeustion but without implication (as far as I can tell)
that push toward a freer society.  My suspicion would be that you
might eventually show that people disagree because they aren't willing
to invest enough to find out where the difference in information is.
Many people are wedded to their positions and would rather keep them
than discover there isn't a right answer; that outcome would leave
them floating in a sea of uncertainty, and they prefer incorrect
certainty to any kind of uncertainty.

Good Luck,
Chris

I've informed my daughters (aged 14, 12, and 7) that, since the
Singularity
will occur within 9 years, there is no reason for me to save for thier
college educations, and that I'll spend all the money on computers.

The 7-year-old thinks that's cool, but the 14-year-old is not happy.
The 12-year-old only has a two-week planning horizon.
Perfectly reasonable, since the 7-year-old won't be in college in
9 years. Fortunately, they know I'm kidding.

I'm teaching myself Java. This is consistent with my belief that
better tools lead to higher programmer productivity, and my belief
that software development productivity is the current main
constraint on human progress.

It all hinges on the term "complex", which, like "soul" and
"consciousness" is subject to a wide variety of interpretations. You
also didn't read what I actually said, which was that most of the QM
interpretations seem to be both unprovable and unneeded. Not just
Everett...

There was a workaround there, in that the DNA was hugely more complex

The Constitution is one of the universally acknowledged great documents of all
time.  If you ask someone why the Constitution is so great, they'll likely
tell you that the Constitution is an important part of our history, the legacy
of our founding fathers, or that it is the foundation of our government...

But the most important thing, the really stunning thing, is that the
Constitution *works* - where just about every other attempt to constrain a
government has failed miserably.

Sadly, the Constitution itself seems to be failing now.  But only partially,
and sporadically.  The bulk of the original Constitution remains strong and
intact, indefeasible and incorruptible, so that nobody even thinks about
violating it.  But the Amendments are steadily shrinking in scope.

*Why*?

My thesis is that the Constitution is a work of organizational engineering,
while the Amendments are simple admonishments.  Imagine if the elaborate
three-branch anti-tyranny system had been replaced with Amendment XI on the
Bill of Rights:  "No tyrant shall be permitted to gain absolute power.  There
will be checks and balances everywhere."  It wouldn't have worked, right?  No
less so with Amendments I through X, which really are phrased that way.

Besides, while the Constitution is very effective in preventing the original
threat - tyranny - it doesn't stack up too well against predators in the
modern organizational ecosystem.  Bureaucrats, endless paperwork
proliferation, Parkinson's Law, the Peter Principle... above all, pork... I'd
say the Constitution needs a major redesign.

I mean, the thing is over 200 years old, for crying out loud.  *200* years
old.  200 *years* old.  Can you think of *anything* else that old that's still
around?  (Informational inventions, not physical ones.)  Maybe a few holy
books, which have the excuse of being written by a Perfect Being whose work is
assumed never to become obsolete.  Maybe some works of fiction or classical
literature, which are *supposed* to be old, and aren't under constant attack
and corrosion by a rapidly changing society.

There's no excuse.  The Constitution is not merely a 200-year-old piece of
information, it is a 200-year-old piece of information that's trying to
coordinate a society which - Singularity or no - *already* constitutes a
challenge utterly, inconceivably different from that of the late 1700s.

In short, the Constitution is obsolete.
Time to start work on v2.0.

Remember - the Constitution worked for so long because it was, in essence, an
utterly amoral document.  It didn't admonish, didn't adjure; it set up an
organization such that undesirable features ("tyranny") would not self-emerge.
 Any Amendment which did not follow this essential principle has broken down
in modern times.

--

I propose the following general organizational principle:  Inefficiency enters
when an unnecessary abstraction makes it possible to short-circuit a desired
link.  Try to insert 1-to-1 correspondences whenever possible.

This needs a concrete example.  I'll start off by proposing the following
organizational measures to eliminate pork:

1)  Switch the legislative branch to an at-large system.  This amounts to
setting up a 121 (1-to-1 correspondence) between voter and congressbeing.

2)  121 between any tax dollar and a given program.  In other words, link
taxes and spending by having any given dollar of taxes go to a known spending
program.  Fund programs in real time, so overruns don't get taken out of a
general budget.  This sets up another 121, this one between temporal segments.

<Punch line:>
3)  Only constituents whose 121-elected representatives voted for an item of
spending are taxed to pay for it.

In other words, pork spending results from a series of commons problems that
result from the abstraction of a resource pool (while benefits remain 121). 
You fix this by ensuring that all spending comes from specific people; taxing
in real-time so there's no delayed penalty/immediate reinforcement; while
subtly and unobjectionably bypassing the taxation-as-theft, commons-problem
that is the root of all uncontrollable government spending.

It might be necessary to keep commons-based spending - though with each tax
dollar accounted for - for military or other "Yes, you *can* shoot your aged
mother if she doesn't pay up" spending.

I should also note that having members-at-large may also fix the problem where
the congressbeings spend all their time trying to get reelected.  With an
incredibly and increasingly diverse collection of constituents, Congressbeings
can't take a stand on controversial issues.  The result is that they
concentrate on other things; attacking known scapegoats, constituent service,
and so on...

--

I also pose the following question:
Do we really need State-level governments?

Seems like cities does for local, federal does for global - I think the states
are a level of abstraction unnecessary in a fast-linked world where, in terms
of travel time, the entire planet is considerably smaller than a single state
was in the old days.  Plus, states represent another level of taxation and bureaucracy.

--

"Make no laws whatever concerning speech and, speech will be free; so
 soon as you make a declaration on paper that speech shall be free, you
 will have a hundred lawyers proving that 'freedom does not mean abuse,
 nor liberty license;' and they will define and define freedom out of
 existence." -- Voltarine de Cleyre (1866-1912)

How's this for a First Amendment (Amendment 2.1:)

"Excepting copyrights, government secrets, and {anything else crucial I've
forgotten}, no law shall be made which mentions or refers to speech; press;
pictures; electronically stored information; any information which can be
expressed as text, speech or pictures; any communication of the aforementioned
items; or any other form of communication or information.  Nor shall the law
mention or refer to patterns within this information."

--

Next idea:
If we're going to have a bureaucracy, it should be a separate branch of
government so we can make separate rules to cover it - the problems of
controlling a bureaucracy being completely different than the problems of
controlling a judiciary, legislative or executive branch.

Amendment 2.2:
The total sum of words within all government regulations, including this
constitution and all government forms, but excepting regulations which apply
solely to government employees, shall not sum to more than 100,000 words or
500,000 letters, whichever is less.  Any new law which overflows this limit
shall be considered void until a previous law is repealed to make room. 
Acronyms may not be used, nor any language other than English.

(Possible sub-amendments (i.e., 2.2.1) to ensure that regulations not hard
understand cause brevity?)

--

Exotic ideas:

AIs or deterministic computer programs as congressbeings.

Nonlinear number-of-votes to representational-power curves, for
congressbeings, to prevent dictator/messiah problems.  I.e, after you get more
than 1% of the population voting for you, your representational power goes up
as the .8th power of number of votes.

Elections - no longer periodical.  A vote can be withdrawn instantly, but can
only be vested after a one-month cooling period.  Because, let's face it, more
than a year is too long for misdeeds to stay in the public attention span. 
Errant congressbeings should be instantly removed.  Also, this would do
something about the frantic "election-year" phenomena.

Dynamically tweaked coefficients - for nonlinear representation, say - based
on the size of the budget or something.

I have no idea how minority politics are handled in Brazil. The USA
values individualism and denying one's identity by attempting to appear
as one is not does not play well here as a minority viewpoint. Of
course there are many who alter their appearance for the usual reasons
of power and reaction to oppression. You might log onto one of the
alt newsgroups for blacks and ask what the term "oreo" means...

Three remarks, just shy of serious flaming:

1. I find your attitude offensive in the extreme. I perceive it as
extremely paternalistic, patriarchial and condescending.

2. Why don't you ASK some Blacks what they think of all this. Kennita,
do you want to say anything??

3. My limited impressions and very, very limited knowledge of things
Brazilian indicate a very biased male oriented Spanish culture in the
upper echelons of business and academia. Any comments?

I may be showing some of Grof's slides in early September, those

     Really clearing-out bad apples constantly [those overtly or
covertly defending the special interests] by ballyhooing their
membership in Establishment funded Prestige Associations like the CFR,
etc. conspiracy style would be beneficial from a libertarian
perspective.  The stability of the Statist power structure would be
disrupted, giving the private sector more opportunity to grow and
expand.  However, this would require substantial growth of the
conspiracy culture.  Right now, conspiracy thinking produces nothing
more than a little grumbling.  Even better, the policy power of the CFR,
etc. would be undermined if attention could be focused on their real
policy agendas and agents.  Their association with a policy could be the
kiss of death.

    And, of course, not all conspiracy theories are equal from the
standpoint of withering the State.  Nazi, Fascist, Socialist, and
Communist conspiracy theorists are certainly not my favorites, for
instance.  They couch their theories in the context of their special
Statist solutions.  On the other hand, there is libertarian ruling
class/conspiracy theory as promoted by the now deceased Murray Rothbard,
Sam Konkin, or me.  The populist theoris aren't perfect, but aren't too
bad.  Bircher theories are great on economics though often Nationalistic
and anti-personal freedom (drugs).

    For instance, libertarian conspiracy theory see the "govt regulation
is good meme" as a meme spread by high order Establishment entities to
create the climate necessary for their multifarous Statist
interventions.....sophisticated conspiracy theories fight ideas as
instruments of conspiracies as much as individuals or groups.  Meme
theory tells us, though, that ideas are associated with groups.  Ideas,
as memes, are what create groups or cultures.  The battle of ideas is
necessarily a battle of groups at the same time.  However, groups can be
and often are destroyed by destroying their memes.  Contrary to the
Nazis and the Catholic Church (heretic burning) groups can be destroyed
without killing the individuals involved.

Miles' Clone Brother
               : Society of the Mind by Marvin Minsky
               : a variety of "split brain" studies in patients in which the
corpus collusum was surgically severed.
               : various "multiple personality disorder" cases

How much of the brain does it take to support the personality? Surely the
Visual Cortex is not required for that function...nor are the areas of the
brain relating to the other senses (smell, taste, hearing, touch etc) nor
that which is required to support the metabolism.  (keep the heart pumping ,
liver, kidney...etc)...ignore all of that and what have we left? What per
centage of the brain relative to it's size?

Now look at it from a different perspective.  How many personalities occupy
that space?  

My understanding of the "Society of Mind" and other works is that there are a
bunch.  Operating sequentially and simultaneously.  Split Brain studies
suggest this as well.  In a well integrated "psyche" there appears to be only
one personality....not true....there are many personalities....each coming
"on line" as the situation warrants...and going dormant when not needed. All
thinking it is the only one.

Walter Jon Williams and Louis McMaster Bujold's works speculate as to what
would happen were this not the case.  Suppose you had multiple personalities,
a well integrated "team" of personalities.  I REALLY wish I did....have a
personallity who didn't find lifting weights to be unutterably boring....so I
could do something interesting while he was exercising the body.

First an apology...I'm having trouble (again) with software.. and I'm not
online....consequently I won't be able to cite sources....this has happend a
lot and I'm afraid it will continue...hazard of the profession I guess.

In an earlier post a prediction of being able to make micro-robots in the
near future was referenced.  I had some fun with that relative to the "Bug
Wars" concept.  But there are other ideas which occur to me.

Surgery for example.

Now my understanding of neurosurgery is limited at best...(I missed that day
in Truck Driving School)...but from what I understand the nerve impluse is
electro-chemical.  That is it travels by ionic transfer thru the
nerve(dendrite) and then by chemical transfer from axion to (?) ...across the
gap.   This obviously is speed limited.  Several tens to several hundreds of
feet per second.  Pitiful.

In an earlier reference it was mentioned that the ability had been aquired to
fuse a chip to a nerve.  A direct nueral interface on a single nerve level.
 Or perhaps I read it somewhere else....but I'm quiet sure that I DID read
it.

At anyrate.  Imagine this:  Using a micro-robot "surgeon" attach a fiber (as
in "fiber optic") to a nerve near the top of the spinal column....then
parallel that nerve along the spinal cord (thru the arms, legs...whatever)
until it reaches it's destination...then tie in again.  In effect cutting out
several feet (possibly) of slow electro-chemical nerve impulse transference
and replaceing it with light-speed.  Does this suggest anything about
increasing reflex time?  Or more prosaicly,,,repairing spinal cord injury?

But why stop there.  Many of my favorite  SF stories and novels use the
device of a direct neural interface (David Weber-"Imperial Implants", Daniel
Keys Moran-"Inskin", ...to name but two) to directly control mechanisms or
communications.  Is this not possible now?  At least in theory?

It might be kinda of tacky to have a socket in the base of your skull, or
wrist or ankel....but the rewards might justify such a lapse in fashion.

Dear Kennita,

Don't know if you read my complete exposition. But as a 
scientist, (although specialized, having a strong generallist 
characteristic - almost ecological, since the environmental phenomena 
may be treated using other points of view... although not always so 
clean or precise...)   I simply *know* that lots of my black 
friends (and not only in Brazil...) would love a lot to change their 
external appearance (and lots of them  will just admit when it will 
be disposable for them... if not, or will have any psychological 
problem to be solved or will be influenced by any of the memes like 
religion, communism, etc., or will have no money to get the 
treatment, in a first moment...). It is just an individual option, 
that they  do not have yet.... And... if it depend*ed* on just the 
"smart" racists, they would never get it...

Friendly Hugs,

Gomes

******* I said  "lots of" and not "all". Indeed, If someth happens to 
me that would change my external appearance, or even the science 
would discover a treatment that would make me feel much better 
externally -  like the recent discovery of the white hair gene... of 
course I will use a treatment to keep (make) my hair, or skin, or 
anything (hehehe) much better,  when I get old or not- when we feel 
good internally, we "may" better (and freely) treat the external too  
(and, I repeat, I consider the process something recursive...). 
(Anyway, I am free of religious memes, like the christians that 
consider that "suffering like Jesus did..." tchan!.. (poor 
good-intentioned boy...but certainly there were worse suffers...- 
for the sados..) will buy them a stairway to heaven (sorry dear Page 
and other Zeps, for the mix (hehehe)...). If you have been following 
the discussions, have noticed that we, the most free, less 
preconceptous and advanced minds on the list, are foreseeing even 
the substitution of the *whole brain* ... and you do no think it 
wouldn't be improved, dont you? (obviously keeping the 
individualities...) Now, when after all this,  we simply read racist 
or preconceptual confused interpretations, you can imagine how 
"angry" we get... ( If it weren't the market/commercial reasons (do 
not kill yourselves, those who still are innocent poor 
babies...hehehe) I'd say simply: yes, keep on being as you want (not 
personal, just general...) just do not perturb! (of course I'd also 
think: must be crazy...)

See today's Wired News top stories section for a piece on EXTRO 3. 

I never mentioned Rodney Brooks, so I don't know how he got in there,
though I'd be delighted if he *is* an extropian... Also, of course I said
"1988" not 1998", but otherwise the story is fine and may add to the
attendence.

BTW, it was a great pleasure yesterday evening to have as visitors Anders
Sandberg, Henrik Ohrstrom, Felix, and Rheine, from Sweden, and Mitch Porter
from Australia. We took a walk to the Pacific and talked a lot. Those
coming to EXTRO 3 will also soon be able to match faces to long-familiar
ideas and writing style.

About Ms. Hagbard's: 
 
For me, in personal, are not just the ideas "per se" on the list,  
that principally improve myself. See what I mean: The ideas here 
exposed and developped are a consequence of  the very good and  
developped intelectual "cyber" companies to talk the list
provides... individually and in group. (It functions like a 
ressonator or a chain-reaction knowledge chamber...) and the list 
definition topics are in  very good agreement with this... 

(I have already entered in a disc. list - which I will not mention 
the name... - which was intended to be of philosophy but was  
full of religious and believers, some of them with not even 
philosophical (and questionable) minds... Imagine now an atheist and 
objective scientist (and masterate level teacher, so with no fear to 
talk about certain subjects...hehehe) in the discussions: I felt 
myself the own Hell's King ... hehehe... but very stressant...Know 
you (if already don't..) that, worse than Hell of Ignorance is that 
of those who "do not want to know...")

Great thread; we should all be able to share some positive actions
we can take in our lives.

On the intellectual side, I left my job as a computer programmer to start
my own business
as a web developer and tech writer. There was nothing "extropic" about
my job, except the fact that I would never break more than around $100000
a year...being on my own has brought in a lot less money in the short term
but I am hopeful that it will pay off in the long run. It has also allowed
me to 
go all around the world (speaking at Internet World) and expose myself
(ahem)
to a lot of new ideas and cultures. I've studied a number of mnemonics; one
in 
particular is very useful for memorizing long strings of numbers (oxymoron
there). 
I've also studied (legitimate) lightning math methods to increase my
calculation speed.

On the physical side, I began a workout regimen working out three times a
week
and inline skating every night. I have found this to reduce the amount of
sleep I need
and greatly improve my awareness and lucidity in the morning. I've shifted
the meat
portion of my diet down to about 10%, which I feel is good enough for jazz.
I've also 
been practicing a breathing exercise designed to increase lung capacity.
It's a very 
unscientific test, but the best evidence of its success was a trip to
Colorado. On a previous
visit, I was left wheezing and light headed at the top of Pike's Peak. This
time, I felt almost
no effects. I've studied the martial arts, in the form of Kenpo, a Chinese
rooted art with 
some American accents. I still have a long way to go towards the physical
condition that 
is my goal, but I feel that I'm headed in the right direction.

On the spiritual (or, if you prefer, emotional) side, I've made it a point
to carefully balance
my work life with my personal life. I am driven to an almost manic degree,
like many people
in my generation. I can easily code for 18 hours straight without looking
up. This lead to 
poor diet, little exercise, and my 18 month old son hardly recognizing me
when I came through
the door. While this might benefit my professional life in the short term,
it destroys me in the 
long term, in every way. I've had to come to two realizations: sometimes
somebody else has
to get the work done, and sometimes the work just has to wait.

If anyone has some input, here are some of the things (self-extropy wise)
that I'm researching:

sensory enhancement (visual, auditory, etc.)
memory enhancement (always)

meditiation - I should say that I've looked a little at the psychophysical
side of Hinduism. One of the principles of meditation (at least as it has
been explained to this novice) is locking out sensory inputs one by one,
and then locking out internal sensory inputs until there is utter silence
"in your head". I've never been able to experience anything remotely
approaching silence in that manner. It seems that that would be something
useful to have to "purge the buffer", so to speak.

Anyway, enough rambling on this end.

     Hagbard Celine posed:
     
     "What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase 
     the amount of extropy therein (mental, physical, social, etc.)? Or if 
     not changes, per se, what have you always been doing to effect the 
     same end?"
     
     Rick Knight adds:
     
     I too have been wondering about that particularly in the relationship 
     between the quest for physical life extension through cryonics and 
     uploading which are, albeit gaining some measure of scientific 
     consideration, still rather lofty notions.  However, there is the more 
     concrete and pragmatic pursuit of nutrition.  I'm wondering about how 
     many extropians filter their water, pursue either vegetarian diets or 
     thoughtfully chosen carnivorous diets (i.e., small quantities from 
     reliable sources, not regular mindless grabbing of the package of 
     Foster Farms chicken at Safeway.) How many supplement their diets with 
     a designed mineral and vitamin regimen?  How many wear sun block or 
     otherwise fortify their skin to help it maintain it's younger appeal. 
     How many smoke, drink substantial amounts of alcohol, eat a majority 
     of refined foods.  
     
     Why the questions?  To me, there is a relationship between the pitch 
     and the substance.  The walk and the talk.  I look for it everywhere 
     (including in myself).  Not expecting perfection, just ongoing 
     awareness and a concerted effort.  
     
     Just how sacred is the Extropian body in these days where we can only 
     extend part scientific confidence and part good ol' faith in the life 
     extension capabilities fashioned for immortality?

        Likewise.  I figure that since a goodly portion (if not most) of
the attendees will be staying at The Doubletree on Friday evening, it might
be nice to congregate somewhere and meet during the day (as in for lunch,
dinner etc.).  Undoubtedly most of us are bound to bump into and "meet"
each other at the hotel, but if anyone knows of any good places to gather
during the day in the vicinity, that would be nice also.

I consider that, an interesting way to understanding such subjetcs is 
using the informatic systems theory. Each "personality" (not yet 
individuallity...) would just be seen as a procedure (or a set of 
procedures). By hypothesis, there would be just one individuallity 
per human being  (the main operational system) but various possible 
sets of procedures (behaviour environments...) ( a supposed devil 
domination , f. ex., would be really impossible, inexistent, except 
as a set of procedures "uploaded" form an influenceable person's 
mind...Just go to any of these cults, if you're thinking I'm not 
talking about present facts...). When a "form" (menthal 
configuration) is still "coming to the mind screen" it is quickly 
associated with other related forms (rational and emotional, s tatic 
and dynamic) to make an associated work environment. Such 
associations do not necessarily correspond to reallity, but form a 
menthal environment... See, for ex., the believers when "think in 
God" (hehehe) or an Orson Wells' reader, when thinking about Mars...  
That's a hypothesis... Another question is:  The individuallity 
minimum nucleus is just software or hardware too ??????

Extropia, seems to me to be very much the society that i have dreamed of
. I Resent societies politacal leadership and find that the structure of
society is counter productive much of the time. If it would be possible
i would like more information on how the Extropian dream is coming
along, and also i would like to be informed of developments.

     As a follow up to my initial response to Hagbard's question, I first 
     want to express my concern that some may interpret my questions as 
     inquisitional and pontifical in nature.  
     
     I am trying to get a better understanding of the classic Extropian 
     mentality, only essences of which I comfortably subscribe but I find 
     them a fascinating group nonetheless.  While the particular tactics I 
     may use provoke, it is not intended to offend.  
     
     However, instead of posing the questions in a way that seeks to cement 
     credibility for me at the expense of personal alienation of the 
     subscribers to this digest, let me instead, share what measures I take 
     and would like to take to ensure the quality of my physical health and 
     vitality into "old age" (although I'm quite optimistic ours may be the 
     first generation to cinch that destiny).
     
     * My diet is predominantly vegetarian and predominantly organically 
     tended.  
     * I supplement with a number of minerals and am researching other 
     tonics to add to my regimen.  This is right now, somewhat adhoc.  I'd 
     like to consult a nutritionist to get a more personalized regimen.
     * I stay out of the sun and if I am in the sun for long periods of 
     time, I wear sunscreen, shades, hat.  
     * I perform facial exercises and moisturize and exfoliate the skin on 
     my face and neck.
     * I exercise three times a week and would like to increase that 
     because the number of calories I consume compared to my metabolic rate 
     isn't as it was in my 20s.
     * Psyllium shakes on a fairly "regular" basis <G>
     
     I'd actually like to get more ideas on what people do to ensure the 
     quality of their physical health.
     
     Regards,
     
     
     Rick

I don't know about the spare time business.  Hunter-gatherer societies have
lots of free time.  I think the increase in population (hence, more computing
power) is far more significant.  I think that continues today, and that a
significant part of current development is due to bringing ever-larger
numbers of people into our market and science systems.

Up to the invention of gunpowder, the most powerful armies were those of the
Central Asian pastoralists.  Long term food surpluses can take
non-agricultural form; they used grazing animals, which had the distinct
advantage of moving themselves.

	I don't see how anyone can think there is not a good answer
for this question.  How much "time/effort/money", as a percentage of
the world total "time/effort/money", do we spend on scientific history
restoration/preservation?  How many people would spend more
"time/effort/money", if they had it, to do something like bring back a
DNA replica of a dinosaur?  I know if %10 of the total
"time/effort/money" that I will produce during my life could bring
back my grandfather, I'd give up many things in my life so that I had
%10 left for this purpose.

	If you were immortal and the amount of time/effort/money you
could afford in one year was growing exponentially, and you had
already achieved a wealth greater than say Bill Gates...  Couldn't you
spare a few coins (i.e. say, less than .00001% of your total
"time/effort/money" for one year) to help "bring back" even someone
like Hittler?  (Even if it was only so that he could start work
towards eventually making a full restitution for whatever evil he
might have done during his mortal life, like maybe doing studies on
possible ways to potentially "bring back" holocaust victims...? ;)

> As far as legal breakthrough goes, I agree John.

	I, too, agree.  We should definitely make an effort to do it
ourselves, sooner rather than latter...  But eventually will not all
finite amounts of "time/effort/money", no matter how large, be a very
small insignificant amount of what exponentially growing immortals
will be able to do?  Given that, even the slightest bit of idle
curiosity should be enough motivation to spend the insignificant
amount of "time/effort/money" required to bring us back.  I have many
dead friends and ancestors for which I have much more than an idle
curiosity desire to bring back.  Don't you?

Interesting remarks, Eliezer. Hayek has a lot of thoughts on these
subjects too, in THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY and LAW, LEGISLATION,
AND LIBERTY.  There was also an interesting book by Henry Hazlitt
called  A NEW CONSTITUTION NOW.  And I know that Lee Daniel
Crocker, on this list, has made contributions to the
Constitution of Oceania, which was a recent experiment (not yet
put into practice?) of this sort.

I am disturbed by your proposal to eliminate the state level,
however. Better to make the "states" smaller and more numerous,
and the federal and "metropolitan" levels less powerful. (Being
an anarchist at heart, I can't really take such scheming too
seriously, though.)

It's entirely possible that these sorts of structures are far beyond
human engineering skill, and that the US Constitution was partly
a result of careful study of structures that had emerged and grown
without being designed, and partly itself a lucky accident.  This
is why I'd favor a loose confederation of nearly independent states,
who can experiment with a variety of different constitutional
systems without risking screwing up their neighbors societies too
much. Different strokes for different folks, doncha know.

The population growth is a consequence of the food surplus.
Hunter-gatherers do 
not consistently have spare time. That's the trick.

But not the people...

Would you agree that agriculture leads to the population explosion?

In his last published work, _The_Contest_of_the_Faculties_, Kant famously
enthused that there is no sweeter occupation than the planning of state
constitutions.  I expect we will live to see the day when these
foundational documents will be as obsolete as Kant's other occupation,
foundational Philosophy, is in our own day.  I for one expect polity to
disjoin geography to such an extent (this is already happening) that the
traditional role of constitutions as a check on abuses and guarantor of
sociocultural continuities will be better provided by the reflective
equilibrium generated among the arrangements and expectations of
autonomous but cooperating social agencies with which we will contract for
services presently offered willy-nilly by nation-state agencies.  As it
happens, I am deeply fond of the United States Constitution and don't
trust my fellow-citizens *qua* architects to produce a better document,
though I scarcely doubt their ability to junk the present one.  Like most
of my fellow-citizens, I have lots of pet suggestions for tinkering with
the thing, but nothing so sweeping as would deserve the moniker "v2.0". 
I'll leave it to ongoing and upcoming exigencies of a technoconstituted
future to bring on changes of that drastic a character...  after all, they
usually do anyway.  Best, Dale

Oh, absolutely.  The carrying capacity of land goes up dramatically when
cultivated.  I think a factor of 10 is the rough rule.

But I do stick by my assertion that on a per capita basis, hunter-gatherer
societies have at least as much free time as agricultural societies.  I've
seen several studies, and although the steriotype is that they have to spend
most of their time foraging, current hunter-gatherers don't.  In many ways
their society resembles that of the information revolution - knowledge is
more important than sheer work, and child labor is consequently of little
value.  Hunter-gatherers have fewer children than agriculturalists, even
though their diet and health seem better than any pre-industrial
agriculturalist.

During the conference, there is the Saturday night apres-Drexler party next
to the banquet room. I believe the banquet will be in the San Martin/San
Simeon rooms, while both the pre-dinner cocktails and the post-dinner party
will be next door in the San Carlos/San Juan room.

The party (from approx. 10pm) to 1am will be techno music party. There will
be plenty of room just outside if you want to mix dance with conversation.

We have almost 120 registered now, so with on-site registrations this looks
set to be the largest extropian gathering yet.

Thank you for your question, it makes a nice thing to reflect upon as 
I pack my bags for Extro.  How do I pack and type at the same time, 
you ask?  Well, there's that extra arm I keep for busy days.....

WHAT I DO NOW

--pursue dual careers to meet both my financial and personal goals
--vitamin/herb supplement program
--push my doctor for medical protocols that focus on prevention and 
holistic health
--life experimentation with breaking the barriers that form the nexus 
of gender and personal identity
--reading up on developments in science, sociology, psychology, etc.
--pursue open-ended philosophies and thinking, to the exclusion of 
dogma and ideology

WHAT I PLAN TO DO

--develop a more stable set of polyamorous relationships
--develop a more flexible career path
--learn the technical end of web publishing
--make new transhuman friends!
--clean out my refrigerator (ok, so it's not an Extropian goal, but 
it needs doing)

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

"Streamlink", (v):  To eliminate a level of abstraction and replace it with a
one-to-one correspondence which, although it requires more computing power, is
actually simpler when viewed as a series of causal links.  Derived from
"streamline" and the aforementioned causal links.

"Simplestract", (v):  The inverse of streamlinking.  To add a level of
abstraction which, although requiring less computing power to model,
interposes additional causal links between two previously connected entities.

Communism is an example of a simplestracted society; the government exists as
an additional link between producer and consumer.  A true communism requires
much less computing power to keep track of; the vast, tangled networks of
inter-consumer links are replaced by single links to and from the centralized
government.  Capitalism is streamlinked, having direct links to and from
consumer - with attendant improvements in feedback quality, response time,
efficiency, and direction.  Capitalism still requires far more computing
power, however.

I believe that the near future, now that we have the computing power, will be
an extremely streamlinked place.  Money will be replaced by complex barter;
advertising and sales by Firefly; the Constitution by v2.0; corporations by
telecoordinated freelancers; and so on.  It might all happen at once, too...
considering that all have an important social prerequisite in common.  Once
people accept computer assistance for one, they'll be willing to accept the rest.

I think of it this way:  How many levels of government do we a priori need? 
One nation-level government to handle things like military defense, and one
city-level government to handle things like local jails or whatever.  I would
seriously question the necessity for a city government at all, in fact.  Once
a national government has secured the basic rights of freedom from force and
fraud, a city government can serve only to poke its nose into things that
should rightfully be private concerns - such as street repair, firefighting,
zoning commissions...

That being the case, I can't see why we need an intermediate level of
government.  Perhaps it could act as a "city" government for small towns, too
small to have their own jails... or perhaps not.

The only real reason for the existence of states is to provide a multitude of
small experimental cultures, large enough to produce interesting results,
small enough that we can have 50 political incubators.  Even so, the
Internet should allow the coordination of numbers of like-minded cities to
form their own experiments.  Defining an arbitrary geographical entity doesn't
change the amount of innovation; it allows bad innovations to be enforced and
prevents good ones from spreading.

Even given the best of reasons for a "state" government, the "states" should
not be geographically organized - and cities should be free to belong to the
"state" of their choice, or none at all.

That's why I would be against a Constitutional Convention.  One should write a
prospective Constitution in advance, and then - if it is approved - vote it
into existence in one fell swoop, without allowing amendment until after it
exists.  Otherwise, it will be loaded down with well-meaning but harmful
addendums, and created with too much opportunity for private tinkering.

In response to your assertion that such structures are beyond human skill, I
would rather propose that there are numerous psychological forces acting to
screw our designs.  The Constitution succeeded because - through a fluke of
luck or otherwise - these forces were barred from acting.  Given that there
will be no Constitutional Convention, we can simply attempt to do the same
thing ourselves, armed with a much fuller knowledge of things like
evolutionary psychology, and a high technology which greatly expands the
sphere of alternatives.

If we fail, we can junk the inferior document and stick with the current
Constitution.  If we fail and don't realize it, we won't add anything new to
the situation over and above all the other groups calling for a new
Constitution.  Only calling a Constitutional Convention would force us to go
with the best we mere humans could do.

Anyway, I dispute the implicit idea that the current Constitution is working. 
It isn't; it's breaking down.  Not just the amendments; although the
Constitution continues to operate perfectly against tyrants, other menaces
such as bureaucracy and paperwork are threatening to choke the country, and
might very well do just that, if continued unchecked.  *Something* needs to be
slapped into place, and I have no faith in stopgap measures to do it - like
putting a band-aid on an axe wound.  Congress, in the past, has simply ignored
legislated limits to spending.  So we need to redesign Congress, spending, or
taxation - at the very least.  I propose streamlinking(*) all three to get
rid of the accumulated junk.  Streamlinking is often useful when social
organizations begin to malfunction; a very powerful tool which usually
requires immense computing power and high-speed communications.

In the evening, if you can get in, a nice, decadent place to eat is Menara,
at First and Gish.  You sit on a cushion on the floor, eat yummy foods
(they have a limited menu, but it does have a vegetarian option) with your
hands, which are washed by pouring lemon-scented water (yes, real lemons)
over them, and watch the belly dancer (quite good -- they used to have both
genders on weekend nights, but I'm not sure if they do any more).

If you go, plan to be there from about 7:30 or 8 to 9:30 or 10, and bring
some singles to put in the belly-dancer's outfit.

Cheers,
Kennita

The longest Preal string has as many characters as there are particles

Mreal is a subset of Preal. A rather small subset - I suspect the
information capacity of a human brain is about 10^20 bits, and a 1.5 Kg
brain contains about  10^30 particles.

Stating that the Mandelbrot Set is Real doesn't tell me very much, so it

What I can actually calculate is very much the crux of the matter. I am
limited to what I can do with Preal particles, and my thinking is
limited to what can be expressed within the Mreal. It is the mystics who
are totally immured of the inner infinite Reality, I am looking at what
can be expressed physically as a profound limit to what we can express.
Of course the use of abstraction is very useful here, for example the
word 'googol' describes a Real number but not a Preal one. However the
string 'googol' provides a tag for defining a specific Real number - but
the vast, vast majority of numbers of similar magnitude will never be
discussed or explored - it's not possible to do so.

Who says this is constant?  Virtual particles are popping in and out of
existence all the time.  A lot of my workarounds to the Laws of Physics rely
on creating equal amounts of negative and positive mass/energy - since even
negative mass represents a positive amount of information.  (I don't think
there's any way to represent a negative amount of information, which is too
bad, because otherwise there'd be a REALLY INTERESTING form of matter out
there somewhere!  Anti-real matter!)

Anyway, I don't know if there's a genuine upper bound on the amount of
information the Universe can store.  Unless the Universe is quantized, the
amount is equal to - at least - aleph-2.  (All those fields of real
numbers...)  Even supposing the Bekenstein Bound - what about all the digits
of pi?  Even excluding "Platonic" information, what about virtual particles
and negative matter?  Would there still be some physical bound on the number
of positive and negative "particles"?  I sure don't know.

And - out of curiosity - there can't possible be a sharp distinction between
"Preal" things and "Punreal" things.  Even if there is a sharp physical
bound... wouldn't it be essentially arbitrary in some way?  I cannot see any
reason why there would be a limit on how much information can be "real".  At
worst, we might be ontologically restricted to some low number or ordinal of
aleph-infinity.  So if Preal and Punreal don't describe any testable or
fundamental quality of a string... what's the point?

This is the extropians mailing list. There are many people on this list
who espouse extropianism as a personal philosophy affecting their

I personally feel that the "ideas here exposed and developed" are
meritorious in and of themselves. You and I and others talk about them
because they *are* good ideas. They are not good ideas merely because we
talk about them. Tell me if I'm misreading you.

If you are here for enlightened debate on "list definition topics," then
so be it. My question was to those who are living what they personally
consider to be an extropian lifestyle -- in the most pragmatic sense of
the word. What have you done with Idea X? What extropy have you brought
to your own existence with Idea Y? I hope this makes my inquiry a bit
more clear. The technological breakthrough that provides a concrete
stepping stone to immortality is still forthcoming. Unfortunately, I am
in the wrong field to help speed it along. However, until it occurs
(singularity, Dan?), extropy is still a pursuable goal -- as yet,
unreachable in its entirety -- but something I want, even if in small
doses.

Okay, nice, but totally, 100% unresponsive to the question I posed, and
the question you responded to. IMHO, a waste of bandwidth.

Presuming the Big Bang is true, the mass of the Universe is around 10^80
protons. This limits the largest Preal string to 10^80 characters or so,
certainly less than 10^100, the googol. Forget the virtual particles, I
am just suggesting a number which is large, fits in the Universe and
very very definitely NOT infinite.

Ok, to get really gritty - the maximum amount of bits storable if you
converted the entire universe into data storage using nanotechnology. 1
bit
per proton.

Prove this. There are many infinite objects, all of which are Punreal.

Yes it is arbitrary. My real interest is in the limits of what is
physically representable.

A googol will do just fine.

If length(string) > googol, string = Punreal

I think that is testable.

Lisa asks Lachele:
: As an anarchist, do you stay outside of
: the society which is governed by our Constitution, or do you live in our
: society but choose not to abide by the laws?  Or is your anarchy one of
: philosophical belief and you do neither?  Or other?  I am curious.

Our society is NOT "governed by our Constitution".  If it were,
countries that copied their constitutions from ours would be culturally
indistinguishable; they're not.  I think the people who ratified it
would be horrified at the suggestion that a single brief document could
define the essence of a society.  Limited government is another way of
saying that MOST of society is and/or ought to be beyond the scope of
the state's influence.

In a sane society, most of what goes on can't be distinguished from
anarchy.  We buy and sell, we love, we read and write - most of the
time, the laws are (or ought to be) irrelevant to these activities.

What does it mean to live as an anarchist in a state-ridden world?
First of all, it means not to cooperate willingly with the state's
arbitrary demands.  We don't help the cops against tax-dodgers,
draft-dodgers, pot-smokers, wetbacks.  We don't volunteer private 
information to every noseyparker who feels entitled to it.  We 
don't mention "sales tax" at the flea market.  We don't vote to 
subsidize a new stadium for the Giants or the 49ers.  We don't 
apply for permits to exercise our natural right of self-defense.  
We obey the prohibition of murder, theft, fraud-- but we'd do that 
anyway.  Among consenting adults, we make our own rules.

It's impossible - some say by design - to obey all the laws.  
So we try to behave ethically, and not get caught.  In that,
we anarchists aren't much different from most of our neighbors,
we're just more philosophical (read:wordy) about it.

Health:
--I preferably drink only (fizzy) mineral water.
--use of food supplements, currently green barley leaf extract ("Green
Magma"),  at least once a day, taken during meal. Gives better general
condition after a month or so, and (supposedly) helps with stomach ulcers.
--various natural immune boosters, currently "cat's claw" (plant) extract.
--various anti-oxidants, memory enhancers, garlic pills etc.
--exercise on HealthRider TM, on "universal" fitness machine
and pushups etc (*if* the energy and determination are present).
--use of carnitine pills for increased ("natural") muscle growth
(alledgedly also good for brain function). This works great, recommended
(the rest too, btw).
--going for walks or bike trips.
--?

Information:
--learning to browse the web more efficiently (trough trial and error)
--seeking out possibly enlightened groups.
--trying to keep up to date with (technological) developments (I watch
Discovery Channel a lot, visit talkboards, read popular-scientific mags
etc.)

Misc:
--[having used] cannabis for recreational purposes and (both strong
temporary, and mild permanent) sensory enhancement (all senses).
I feel I can enjoy music, food, my whole environment etc. better since my
"pot treatment" (one year of intense everyday use). If you didn't get high
yet, you really should sometime soon. A good "trip" is [to me] the best
experience one can get with this body and mind. You've never tasted such
devine food, heard such angelic music (any music will do, but I prefer
techno/trance), felt such universal happiness...
HIGHLY recommended! Mushrooms can be great too, but are imo
a bit less reliable, though never really unpleasant. I've had one really
good trip with mushrooms (took them on 7 occasions or so).
Non-smokers can use vaporizers or can eat the pot (after treatment).

--having have made arrangements for cryonic suspension (just in case).

[P.s: I am a lot less energetic than I may sound here]

Hagbard Celine <hagbard@ix.netcom.com> asked:

> What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase

> etc.)?

	I'm loving the responses to this question.  I hope what I say
here isn't to far off of what was being asked for.

	I was raised in the "LDS" (The Mormons) church.  One of their
cultural natures is to work very hard to "save" others because of "the
worth of souls".  "bring, save it be one soul into me, how great shall
be your joy with him in the kingdom..."

	Mormons believe they have the keys to eternal exalted life.
If you choose their way you will get it, if not it is choosing death.
They believe all are free to choose one or the other and they
continually try to convince others to choose their way.  The Book of
Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:27 says:

   "they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great
   Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to
   the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men
   might be miserable like unto himself."

	These philosophies have spilled over into my extropian way of
life.  In other words, I think that they have things kind of right but
just backwards.  If one only follows their teachings, doesn't choose
to do more than have faith and pray and go to the temple... if one
doesn't do the research work required and if one isn't cryonically
preserved..., it is choosing death.  Since I'd hate to have my friends
and family miss the opportunity to make it to eternal life, I take any
advantage I can (without being to much of an obnoxious pain), to say
things like: "In a thousand years we'll know who is right, who made
the right choice, who is alive in a glorious, eternal life, heaven and
who is miserable in hell, sheo, or the grave."  I try to get as many
as possible to not give into the temptings of those that apparently
"seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto [themselves]".

	In other words I'm more or less crying warnings of hellfire
and damnation to them for making incorrect choices.  I know this is
against the usual extropian nature to live, choose, and let others
live and choose what they may.  But, possibly because of my LDS
background, I have troubles with this.  I don't want to be the only
one of my LDS family and friends that can be "brought back".  I think
if more extropians took this attitude about getting the critical words
of warning out cryonics and extropianism would spread much faster.
(Not to mention the corresponding research effort and funding... ever
hear about the quantities of LDS owned assets and the amount of works
and money that goes into the growing number of temples...?)  Many
people just aren't yet blessed with enough smarts and must be told
what to do with powerful and explicit warnings of how extreme the
consequences are.  It's sad, believing that their promises of
salvation are false, to see so many belief systems like LDS be so
successful at preying on such people that so desperately want to be
told what to do.

The August 7, 1997 Wall Street Journal "Bookshelf" column features Jim
Holts review of two new books on parallel world theories: David
Deutschs _The Fabric of Reality_ and Roger Penroses _The Large, the
Small, and the Human Mind_:

"'Ask a famous physicist what science reveals about reality and
there's no telling what sort of answer you'll get.' Stephen Hawking
will inform you that physics merely predicts observations and that it
is meaningless to talk about how it might 'correspond' to reality.
He's what's known as a positivist.

"Roger Penrose, an equally great physicist, will give you a radically
different answer. What we learn from physics, he'll say, is that the
material universe depends for its existence on a perfect world of
abstract mathematical ideas that some of us consciously commune with.
Mr. Penrose, in other words, is a Platonist.

"Then there's David Deutsch, who has unblushingly titled his
interesting new book _The Fabric of Reality_. A researcher at Oxford
and an acclaimed quantum physicist . . . he is not in the least shy
about dismissing Hawking-style positivism as self-refuting, or
Penrose-style Platonism as a a rickety fantasy. For his part, he is
quite sure that physics tells us something new and bizarre about the
nature of reality: namely, that we live in a multiverse where
everything that can happen does happen.

"What makes the divergence of viewpoints . . . so wonderful is that,
far from being New Age kooks, they are three rational, hard-headed
guys who use exactly the same equations in their everyday scientific
work. The problem is that 20th-century quantum physics has an
unsettling weirdness about it. . . . This has led scientists who
insist on making sense of the world to some pretty extravagant
hypotheses. Some have lobbied for a new quantum logic that permits
contradictions. Others have argued that reality is created by
measuring devices or by consciousness. Still others have posited a
ghostly web that allows all the particles in the universe to
communicate with one another instantaneously.

"The hypothesis that Mr. Deutsch fiercely defends - and makes the
basis of his world view - is the most extravagant of all. Dubbed the
many universes interpretation . . . According to the many
universes view, all the quantum possibilities that determine the
outcome of subatomic events are actualities in some parallel universe.
. . . But because of the intricacies of quantum interference (which
Mr. Deutsch does a superb job of explaining), these parallel universes
affect one another only at the tiniest level. . . .

"Does all this leave you feeling skeptical? Then, says Mr. Deutsch,
consider the quantum computer. This device - envisaged by Richard
Feynman in 1982 and largely theoretical so far, though a simple
prototype was built by IBM in 1989 - harnesses quantum phenomena to
achieve unheard of computational feats. Using something called Shor's
algorithm, a quantum computer can factor giant numbers and thereby
break secret codes that no conventional computer could touch. The only
way it could do this, Mr. Deutsch argues, is by distributing its
operations over many parallel universes. "To those who still cling to
a single-universe world-view," he writes with evident asperity, I
issue the challenge: explain how Shor's algorithm works.

"Combining the many-universes notion with quantum computability, and
adding elements of Darwinism and Karl Popper's theory of knowledge,
Mr. Deutsch aspires to nothing less than a complete understanding of
the fabric of reality. Arrogant in tone and marred by leaps of
logic, his book nonetheless bristles with subversive insights about
virtual reality, time travel, mathematical certainty and free will.
Intellectually speaking, Mr. Deutsch is mad, bad and dangerous to know.

"So, for that matter, is Roger Penrose. In "The Large, the Small, and
the Human Mind", the English physicist tries once again to make us
share his conviction that the answer to the puzzle of human
consciousness lies in physics. . . . Even if Mr. Penrose turns out to
be wrong, he is always worth reading. In this volume - daunting as
usual, but blessedly slim - Mr. Penrose's arguments are followed by
critiques from Stephen Hawking and from philosophers of science Nancy
Cartwright and Abner Shimony . . . Mr. Hawking marvels at how Mr.
Penrose, his former collaborator on the theory of black holes, has
come to hold such different views from his on mind and reality. These
days, it seems, there's no telling a fellow's metaphysics from his
physics."

Interesting thread, Elieser.

Several points and then I'll spout my thoughts on How It Should Be Done:
(sorry if this is a long post; I need to get across one complete, coherent 
concept, a pet of mine :-) )

Do you really believe that positive, radical change in the constitution of
the US could happen?  It would be a madhouse in any event.  And you'd be
up against hoards of professional thieves (politicians, lobbyists, etc). 
I prefer to think about what could be done if starting out fresh in a new
"place", physical or virtual, a blank slate. 

Yes! re: a limited number of words in the constitution.
No!  re: representitives.  With modern communications, we will not need 
these laggards.

Re: state government, in the current system, this is one of the reasons 
that the US gov. is still somewhat tolerable.  It traps people with 
political ambitions at the lowest, least effective level, and presents 
many layers of trap for them.  This is the primary function of 
government, IMHO.  I asked a friend who had been a local San Diego 
politician, and who had almost won a Ca. state office, about this, and he 
agreed.  He said (paraphrasing) "It takes all of the effort you can muster 
and then more, to play the game, at any level of government".

First, I think one would need to establish the basis, the reason for 
being, of government.  In this group alone there will be much 
disagreement on that.  I believe that some government is needed, because 
in its absence, a fraction of the population will gain control over the 
rest, and become the "government", in any event.

That assumes that we can still be killed, or our stuff stolen or 
destroyed, or our livlihood seriosly hampered by others.  Among 
Extropians, of course, that is not assumed!  But: otherwise, we have no 
basis for talking about constitutions, so I'll assume it will still be so.

So we must decide to agree to live by a certain constitution, when in a 
particular "country".  Everybody lives by the same (limited set of) rules, 
in this place, so we can manage not to kill, steal from, or harm each other.

And with a particular government (or lack thereof) in control of those
laws and of enforcing them.

Note that I'm saying that the individual can choose not to comply, but 
not here: if you won't live "with" us, you can't come in.  That alone 
would be impossible to enforce in the US, there is nowhere to deport 
those that don't agree, to.  Hence the blank slate is needed.

Here is the concept: On arriving at a port of entry, you are presented 
with a copy of the constitution.  You must read it, and prove you 
understand it, and sign your agreement to live by this document while in 
the country.  Before entering.  This agreement is the moral basis for 
enforcing all laws.  Ultimately, if you are convicted of seriously violating 
the law, you are spaced - as it were - back the way you came.  Mabye 
we'll let you keep your spacesuit. ;-}

So, the constitution, which includes all laws, and other information
needed to define a government, must be short enough for many people to
understand and remember.  I think in any event, the real government of a
place is a collective set of beliefs, especially the beliefs of those "in" 
government.  We need to get in sync, to sing the same peacefull tune.

This implys a lot of liberty, and a miniarchist government, anything 
more complicated, and you could not get enough people agreeing on it and 
understanding it.

Few or no fixed points to the constitution, all is up for change by 
direct voting of citizens: anything else implys that a few "founders" 
have the right to more control than everybody else.

If nessasary, temporary government posts could be created, by vote, but 
this can be taken away on short notice.

A structure for presenting proposed constitutional changes to the 
citizens, and voting on them, would be part of the core.

A limitation on the number of charactors or words is key, and may be 
fixed (unchangeable by vote.)

"Taxation" may be voluntary or not, that' a tough question.  Presumably 
there are some things that pay off better as a joint effort on the part of 
the whole country.  In any case, I believe the individual must have 
control over which government efforts get her "dollars".  Who has the 
right to force another to spend money on something she thinks is wrong?

Jointly writing such a constitution would be a fun project - off line from
this group (about as much fun as a massive blood clot, if done on this 
mailing list).

The ex Red Lion (Doubletree), presuming it hasn't been massively
re-modeled, has an restarant, bar, pool, and spa all in line of sight of
the main entrance/lobby.  When in the restaraunt, one can see those
passing by in the asileway there, and vice-versa.  Much gathering could be
expected in these areas.

I'm told that it *has* had a major remodelling lately, but I don't know
whether the layout has changed much.

Well not exactly why the west has won...but since others have been veering
off the subject a little and got to talking aboutl the transition from hunter
gatherers to agriculture I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth. It's very
simple...really.

Beer.

Back during the hunter-gatherer days it was great to be  young male or
pre-pubescent female.  They did for a living what executives pay a bundle to
do today.  Hunt and fish all day...lay around and tell lies at night.

For the women and old folks it wasn't such a good deal....pregnant women...or
women with young kids..couldn't hunt...so they were relegated to other
tasks....gathering. .... and cooking. Thence they became that era's experts
on plants.....and chemistry.

So one day some genius developed beer.  Might have been an accident...but
beer is pretty low-tech.  

And the rest was history.  The men LIKED beer.  But there's a problem.  It
doesn't go good with a nomadic lifestyle.  Gotta stay in one place and grow
the hops and grains and like that. 

 OKAY!   we can do that!....thence agriculture was born.

Subject: Patriarchy and the Age of Information
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

     A colleague and I were discussing the roots of misogyny and homophobia 
     today (all this emerged over a discussion of the film "The Crucible"). 
      We segued into a discourse about how the end of the Industrial Age 
     might signify the cap on the male-dominant well.
     
     It occurs to me that as industrialization wanes in favor of the more 
     intellectual pursuits of the Information Age, there will be fertile 
     ground for a matriarchal resurgence.  
     
     A matriarchal structure is a more natural social organization simply 
     because women are the ones who (could ostensibly) control access to 
     conception.  The babies they give birth to are dependent upon them for 
     life (not considering at this time, the baby formula vs. mother's milk 
     for sustenance caveat).  
     
     When you look at history in Western civilization, males have made it a 
     priority to keep women disorganized, first by the creation of the 
     family which they themselves were appointed to lead.  Also, setting up 
     the preoccupation of physical beauty that creates a false sense of 
     competition amongst women by emphasizing vanity which is both a time 
     and attention sucking device.  They've had to create and perpetrate 
     this man-creator myth.  This has resulted in a social construction of 
     females being validated by men, acquiescing to what amounts to their 
     fear-based dominion, a house of cards.
     
     In patriarchy, you have these elaborate myths about the great "sky 
     father", Yahweh, whoever, "creating life".  Of course, what else could 
     compete with the simple truth that life comes from the womb with a 
     brief assisting moment from a male?  The social constructs that have 
     been put in place don't hold much water when set against the simple 
     natural sequence of events that results in the ongoing of the species, 
     all made possible in the predominant sense by the female.  Not that 
     males aren't necessary, not that it wasn't significant for them to be 
     a major brute force dominance during the survival eons.  But once 
     civilization set in, they didn't ease off the throttle any...until 
     this century.  It seems that women have more than paid them back for 
     their necessitated thuggery during the dawn of civilization.
     
     Since survival issues aren't paramount in these much more 
     technologically advanced times, it seems only logical that women will 
     reclaim their role as the natural life givers, care givers and that 
     may likely give way to decision makers and leaders.  Yet still, there 
     are the last fervent attempts, the primitive chest beating if you 
     will, where men use their trump card, their strength and propensity 
     for violence, to delay the inevitable. Of course, a great many of us 
     (males) would be content with equality..conceptually anyway. 
     
     So, as we reach a period in human civilization where novelty will 
     exponentially increase and great change will happen in a cosmological 
     flicker, what signs are apparent that women are maneuvering into their 
     ascendant positions to take on a more controlling interest in human 
     affairs? I've not counted more than a handful of women posting in this 
     digest.  Why is that?

In response to Philip Witham's writings

Well put! I agree with just about everything, so I snipped it to save
bandwidth(or is this bull?) It would be great to make a new nation
that's based on transhumanistic ideas, the advantages would be enormous.
The sooner, the better! [see also "An Extropian Nation??!",
posted on 6/18/'97] 

Some minor points of criticism:

> 
> Few or no fixed points to the constitution, all is up for change by 
> direct voting of citizens: anything else implys that a few "founders" 
> have the right to more control than everybody else.
> 
If this is acceptable to newcomers, why not? A society is a bit like a
private club, and it would be only natural that the founders (by definition
above-average people) have the right to determine the rules, or at least
have the final word in decision making. If someone finds this unacceptable,
he simply finds himself another club, or starts his own.

Having said this, I must quickly add that I agree that in fact generally
accepted values should rule instead of people. Maybe computers, programmed
with these values, specified in laws, should do most
of the everyday governing, especially where judicial matters are concerned.
The advantages are enormous (consequent, unbiased,
cheap etc). The (immortal!) "founding fathers" could be part of a
"constitutional committee" (supreme court?) which monitors the
computers and society in general to make sure that at least the core
values of that society (as agreed upon by all) are not corrupted (for ex
by infiltrators of rival societies, who in theory at least could out-vote
the "honest" inhabitants and thus democratically and legally destroy
the new nation. Think Germany, 30's...)

My sentiment exactly. Entropy (in its many forms) affects the universe
and everything in it -- just look at my closet. :-) Extropy is both my
short-term and long-term goal.

Oh my, I've been drinking unfiltered water? :-)

Being a student, I've found that extropy tends to cost some money. As
many list members would no doubt agree (given the stark capitalist bent
of many subscribers), augmentation of one's available resources is one
of the surest ways to facilitate the achievement of a measure of
personal extropy. Health food costs an arm and a leg, never mind
weightlifting supplements, legal and non-legal smart drugs, and, not the
least of which, computing power.  

>  How many supplement their diets with

Designed? Mine is pretty ad-hoc. I've always been a healthy person
(never had the traditionally childhood infirmities like chicken pox,
mumps, tonsilitis, strep, etc.) and so I tend to work with what is
naturally occuring in the foods I eat. I maintain a 45% carb, 35%
protein, 20% fat diet, more or less. My main staples are chicken, egg
whites, sushi, salads, peanut-butter sandwiches, and tons of wheat bread
(with various spreads). I do take vitamin C regularly, as well as an
antioxidant mix, when I remember. As a semi-pro swimmer, calorie
restriction is absolutely counterproductive (bring those free-radicals
on!).      

For those weightlifters out there, creatine monohydrate is a must!

>  How many wear sun block or

Ugh. I lifeguard for a living during the summer and I NEVER wear
sunblock. My Mediterranean skin is, of course, impervious to gamma
(though when melanoma (sp?) bursts forth, I'll probably lose my
superhero status). I publicly acknowledge that this makes me an absolute
idiot.

Nicotine is an occasional vice, occuring usually after the parallel
(still occasional) vice of substantial amounts of alcohol. Refined foods
are too expensive. I prefer to do my own cooking.

This is a great attitude. I shall strive ...

reading Rick's post do the same.

I come from a faintly catholic background, so I can more or less 
relate to this. To me transhumanism isn't just a the most rational
choice, but maybe also a sort of substitute for religion (maybe
it is for more people, it has been argued that we all have a "religion
slot" in our mind that needs to be filled). Imo, the transhuman way
is presently the only one that (probably) leads to eternal life and
happiness, the others lead to needless suffering and ultimately
*always* [permanent] death. 
 
IMHO, the ultra strong tolerance meme that's generally associated
with transhumanistic "ideologies" like extropianism is one of it's
weakest points. "Free choice", "free will" etc. are considered sacred, and
this would be fine in a society of rational individuals, but not in a
society where most people are a couple short of eir sixpack. For example,
if your friends and/or relatives don't want to be frozen after death
[assuming you had the power to do it], would you do it anyway [ I sure
would ], or would you let them rot because of your principles? 
 
Reason overrides free choice. Most people are a bit like dumb kids
with a lot of maturing to do. Restricting their freedom in order to
keep them from harm is imo morally perfectly acceptable. They
will thank you later for it, and if not, they can still kill themselves
later...
 
Many are called, but only few [will] answer...I strongly believe you
are more or less "destined" to become transhuman...like someone
said:"you either feel immediately attracted to it, or you hate it". It's
a very special privilege. This would mean that your warnings (about the
flaws of other ideologies and the consequences: paradise lost) can only
"convince" those who were in fact transhumanists all along.
Real believers connot be convinced, no fact will make them question
their beliefs (be they religious or otherwise). You can only save
them by "force".
 
Let's assemble the flock by spreading the Word, and forcefully
save some sinners while we're at it. After all, we just *might* be the
future masters of the universe.
 
Amen
 
Oh, and money is needed, lots of money for the Good Cause...why
aren't y'all getting disgustingly rich with all your knowledge and 
connections ??

Enter: exowomb. This device will probably hit the streets within 20 years
or
so, maybe sooner. It will eventually mean the virtual end of pregnancy (in
the
western societies anyway), women will have a roll similar to that of the
man:
casual cell donation. This is in itself a pretty neutral fact, it can
pretty much work both ways (emancipation or erosion of status). Male
agression 
(behaviour that's necessary to stand up for yourself, voice an opinion,
make yourself heard, for example on this list. Women are just too modest,
and
men too arrogant) will remain the decisive factor and patriarchies will
remain
the standard, unless...some good research is done to determine exactly what
causes male and female behaviour, and the results are used to modify (for
ex.
with hormone treatment) the embryo/foetus in the exowomb so that males
become less agressive and females more agressive to create an equilibrium.

Yeah, that's what they told me in public school, too.  Another reason for

I wonder what Eliezer means by "tyrants", when Presidents routinely

EXTRO-3 VISITORS,

I'm packing my bag for Extro-3 right now (flight to catch in four hours!).
I don't know whether I'll be able to collect e.mail when I get to the other
side, so better to leave voice-mail at +44 973 174148, which I can
definitely collect.

I have a room booked for Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and at the
moment, there's only me in it. So if you want to share and cut the cost,
whether for one night, two or more, call.

Regards,
Darren

Not necessarily.  Ectogenesis will be a next lifegiver.  Also when a woman
no longer has fertile eggs, or eggs that do not have the proper balance of
E2 and FSH, she cannot reclaim a traditional position of life giver without
the aid of age reversal, or cloning from her own cells.

If the Bekenstein Bound is correct the maximum amount of information that
can be stored inside a sphere is related to its radius and its mass. If the
Universe shrinks to a mathematical point in the Big Crunch then gravity will
increase the energy in the universe, and thus its mass (remember E = MC^2),
without limit, and this mass will increase faster than its radius will
decrease.  This means that at the Big Crunch the total information in the
universe will diverge to infinity even if it's finite right now.

Some say the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy always
increases, is pessimistic, but that would only be true if the total amount of
information was constant. We'd be in bad shape if Entropy did not increase, 
it would mean the heat death of the Universe, but as long as entropy ALWAYS
increases infinite life is possible.

Why, because there is not a googol of anything? If Tipler is correct a beam of
light could circumnavigate the universe a googol times, in fact an infinite 
number of times between now and the Big Crunch, light moves at the same speed 
but the trip keeps getting shorter without limit.

No reason in theory one proton couldn't store far more than one bit.

Advances like transsexuality, exowombs, and consciousness uploading could

Speaking as a male, I can state empirically that I have no interest
whatever in keeping either gender organized.  I suspect that I am not in
the minority.

I wouldn't give males as much credit as you do.  I think that the misogyny
bred a decentralized *disorganized* erosion of feminine self-esteem, and
that swarm behavior, traditionalism and closed-mindedness have conspired in
a far less coordinated manner to keep women suppressed in Western society.
The behavior is emergent.  But, then, I have no evidence for MY
sociological POV, either.

In other words, you're proposing to streamlink the legislature; let everyone
vote on things directly.

This is an obvious and known proposal; I had my reasons for not making it. 
Primarily I believe that the legislature *shouldn't* be fast or instantly
responsive to the whims of the public.  Fast and responsive are for the
purveyors of voluntarily purchased merchandise, not the counsel which wields
force.  I reluctantly go along with the condescending conventional wisdom on
this one subject:  Nations are too impulsive... and legislatures are less
impulsive.  The one-month-cool-off period for vote investiture was intended to
prevent similar impulsivity.

The truth is that by concentrating the debate in individuals, you make it
possible for people to pay attention, identify sides... a number of things
that are impossible on a national scale.  On a national scale, you can have at
most three or four sides.  A legislature makes it possible for there to be
dozens of sides.  It's a threshold thing; any "legislator" receives attention,
while a national movement needs a substantial percentage of the population
before it attracts notice.  The legislature allows debates to be conducted in
the open; the pros and cons to fight it out in an attentionable and recursible
arena, rather than implicitly in the simplistic proposals that would be
presented to voters by a controlled media.

You can streamlink this sort of thing, but it requires a *very* highly
evolved, pre-proven, trans-Firefly technology.  We don't have that right now,
so it can't be incorporated into a Constitution being written right now.

I had the idea for a "House of Guardians" that would replace the current
Congress.  They would be elected periodically, have great perks, a high
salary, and be able to fire any bureaucrat whenever they felt like it.  They'd
have no legislative or spending authority.  But they'd be the people you
turned to for constituent service.  The perks, the personal power, and the
poetic title would ensure that all the power-seekers ran for Guardian.

The Guardians would have a variety of internal hierarchies to climb.  There
might be Lesser Guardians on a local level.  And of course there'd be a
single, High Guardian, with even better perks.  All of this is to trigger and
ensnare the human instincts for seeking power.  Humans will reflexively
attempt to climb any hierarchy, no matter how useless.

People who wanted to accomplish something could become Legislators.  No perks,
except for information-finding subordinates, free education, high-speed
Internet access, and so on.  Small salary.  Not much media attention.  Your
constituents always breathing down your neck to minimize their personal taxes.
 But still wielding the guns.

Everybody can't vote for 500 people so somebody would have to decide what
citizen gets to vote for what congress critter, and this is a huge area for
potential monkey business.

The strongest argument nationalists have, and it's not very strong, is that
government can deliver a public good, your proposal would eliminate even that.

If a dam is built my constituents will get a lot of benefit out of it, but if 
I don't vote for it then they get it for free and in gratitude reelect me in
the next election. The constituents of the moron who did vote for it have to
pay for the damn thing and this makes them very unhappy so they vote the
idiot out as soon as they can.
                     

        >I should also note that having members-at-large may also fix the

Why would that change anything? If a politician doesn't devote full time to 
winning the next election there will certainly be somebody else who will and
toss him out of office as a result.
                

        >Do we really need State-level governments?


We need it just as much as Federal-level government and that's just as much
as a fish needs a bicycle.

        >patterns within this information."


A big step backwards, at least the current first amendment says nothing about
exceptions. With loopholes this big government thugs could stop anybody they
didn't like from saying anything. I think that if you want to keep a secret
from me then it's your responsibility to do so, not mine. If you fail I see
no reason why I should be punished for your error.

Federal regulation 89723 says " Government shall see to the efficient
operation of the economy" and nothing else. Those truckloads of papers over
there are not regulations, just guidelines.

Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there are
much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare
brands, I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or
services or even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of
promises every 4 years, and democracy is the best form of government,
the best of a bad lot.
 
When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I always
win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, the
chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not worth
my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the politician
with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.

The Constitution lasted a long time not because of its perfection but because
an infrastructure was already in place for it to thrive. Without a lot of 
people willing to obey it and enforce it and interpret it, the Constitution
is just a bunch of words on a piece of paper.

Yes, but you're proposal to fix government is just a band-aid. Limited
government has been tried many times but is does not stay limited for long.
It seems to be in the fundamental nature of a state to increase it's power.
A state has power an individual or corporation does not have or it would not
be a state, it's inevitable that it will use that power, however small it
starts out to be, to gain even more power, the process increases 
exponentially until people can take it no more.
                      

        >Capitalism still requires far more computing power, however. I
        >believe that the near future, now that we have the computing power,
        >will be an extremely streamlinked place.


I'm not sure what you mean by this but if you're talking about designing an
efficient economy forget it, that will never happen. Yes, computing power is
increasing rapidly, but for the very same reason the thing you're trying to
model is increasing too.
                                   

        >Money will be replaced by complex barter


Some truth in that, and government will no longer have a monopoly on money,
you could use any currency you like best. And more, with strong encryption
anonymous re-mailers, DC nets and untraceable digital cash, I will soon be
able to make complex financial agreements with you even if you're on the
other side of the world, and NOBODY including government regulators or taxmen,
could know anything about it. That's one reason I think the nation state will
soon go the way of the city state.

     Max More has quoted Jeffrey R. Harrow describing plans for an 
     automated highway. I recall an episode of Beyond 2000 at least five 
     years ago with an article on the German Autobahn test driving exactly 
     the same idea. A radar sensor detected the distance between your cars 
     front bumper and the rear bumper of the car in front. It worked fine. 
     As far as I know it has been implemented there.

     "The following massive rant is meant for all those questioning the
     idea of meme supremacy (some memes are [a lot] better than
     others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may
     not understand this yet]"
     
     Answer me this Mr Otter... the following concept is / is not the basis 
     for the scientific method: any idea, however attractive, is rejected 
     in the face of proof of it's falsity - ie: NO IDEA IS SACRED. 
     This may seem paradoxical to one as obviously obsessive as yourself, 
     and obsessive's tend to feel pain when confronted with paradox but 
     every poison has its' remedy: Here is my question: Can you please 
     explain how you manage to live in a logical universe free of 
     contradiction which contains the following memes: "One (meme) is the 
     best (supreme, I take it)" and "No idea is sacred". 
     
     The concept of *no idea being sacred* is the basis for scientific 
     enquiry and it's emergence is largely responsible for the period we 
     know as the Rennaisance. It seems to follow that the loss of this 
     modus operandi would signal the final end of Rennaisance as well as 
     the west european civilization of which you seem so fond. 
     I stand open to correction on this point, of course.
     
     Your principle points in this opening paragraph to what is, if I may 
     say, quite a stunning piece of posting overall, is that 
     
     A: All memes are not equal 
     and 
     B: One meme is the best. 
     
     A is true, particularly given the context dependancy of all memes - 
     "Beauty is in the eye of the Beholder" and all that. Also: given that 
     the term "equal" (ditto "better" and "best") suggests a scale of some 
     kind; one wonders what this scale exists to measure? I would expect it 
     to represent a scale of value, namely your value (s), given your use 
     of the term "best" in statement B. I don't think I'm open to any 
     contradiction in saying that the term "best" is an absolute value 
     statement. 
     
     I'm not sure whose values you claim to represent, but I'll guess that 
     they are yours. Unless you can provide me with some kind of petition 
     showing the names of those who share your values, I'm going to turn 
     this guess into an assumption.
     
     Statement "B" is just bollocks I'm afraid, objectively speaking (and I 
     hate speaking objectively), although I'm sure it is subjectively true 
     for you.
     
     Now that I've gotten that stuff out of the way; here's my translation 
     from your pseudo pop scientific drivel:   
     
     "some memes are [a lot] better than
     others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may
     not understand this yet]"
     
     means:
     
     I like some ideas (a lot) better than others. I like one idea best. 
     Everyone should agree with me, even if they don't (or is it "even if 
     they are too stupid to."?).
     
     Well, that just lovely, Mr Otter. Again I stress: Unless you manage to 
     replace this idea that *one meme is supreme for all people* with a 
     working understanding of *no idea being sacred*; I'm afraid it's going 
     to be you and people like you that most threaten (what used to be 
     called western) civilization. And I'm most happy to tell you that 
     there's plenty of us out here to stop you making that mistake for 
     everyone else.
     
     Scanning the rest of your diatribe I found nothing else I feel like 
     commenting on just now, except:
     
     "The good news is that brains will almost certainly be 
     "reprogrammable" in
     the future, thus giving ultimately all (blah, blah, blah)" - sometimes 
     this almost does strike me as good news...almost.
     
     In closing:
     You're a young, good looking, white male. If you're out to achieve 
     world domination for yourself and your kind my advice is this:
     
     "Get a note from your mom. Because you're going to have to take at 
     least a day off of school for this."
     - Max Headroom  1986

     Thanx for the replies on pluto - yeah, I completely misquoted on the 
     trip to pluto, and the problem with a nine hour trip have been well 
     pointed out. Relativity and all that. One things for sure, though: 
     Whatever's north of the north pole it isn't south.
     
     The actual quote was nine days at acceleration of 1G.
     
     I bumped into the guy I misquoted and he told me 16 days now. Anyway 
     I'll 'fess up I'm not up to much physics, I just like the colours and 
     moving objects so thanks for the informed responses.

     I'm developing this loose theory and wanted to run it by anyone 
     interested:
     
     Running roughly parallel to Chomsky's theory on universality of 
     language and ending up at St Ignatius de Loyola:
     
     Given that eidetic imaging has been found much more extensively in 
     children and given Chomsky's theory that children are born with some 
     kind of potential for language let's suppose:
     
     Our minds are constantly producing images. Whether we look at them or 
     not is a matter of choice.
     How to look at them is a matter of choice and training.
     Certain training and philosophies most definitely open our "inner 
     eyes" (massive quote marks - please note) to conscious perception of 
     these images. What interests me is the threshold at which these images 
     become eidetic (or at what point (subjective) I becomes eidetically 
     conscious). 
     
     I don't know about you, but I find that my emotional reactions tend to 
     be in response to mental imagery. Is this "natural" or is it just 
     something I learnt to do from watching soap opera? In any case I find 
     that I react emotionally to mental images, (day)dreams rather than 
     formula's and concepts. My excitement at an inspiring concept comes as 
     soon as that concept becomes an image, my level of excitement is 
     directly linked to the clarity of the image. So the concept becomes 
     image by some as yet unclear mental process.
     
     It seems to me that imaging is a process of emotional sublimation. The 
     associated feelings are there but detached, still somehow active 
     within the mental image. Sublimated.
     
     For the sake of simplicity I'll borrow the left brain / right brain 
     model. I don't know or much care whether this theory is accurate, 
     measurable or has in fact been disproved. Let's postulate that left 
     brain means parameter setting, isolating metaphor and lexicon 
     juggling. Let's say that right brain means image generation from 
     emotional stimulation and pattern recognition. I say pattern RE - 
     COGNITION carefully.
     
     Right brain constantly produces images.
     Left brain constantly "reads" these images, or tries to. 
     Left brain being what it is cannot process entire images which the 
     right brain deals with exclusively. So the left brain looks for 
     particular bytes it can articulate, usually simple comparisons. The 
     better the co-operation between left and right brain the more complex 
     a thought can be conjured. The left brain is scanning this 
     indescribable right brain image when suddenly a comparison model leaps 
     out - this is how we get metaphor. It is the bridge between image and 
     words, right and left. It's a lot like saying like, it's like, man, 
     you know, like wow.
     
     This would explain two things:
     1. Children experience "eidetic" imaging more frequently simply 
     because their lexicon takes up less consciousness or computational 
     resources (cheers Anders!) than densely programmed adults. The hard 
     wiring of image processing without the software of particular 
     language. Even the comparative process impedes eidetic experience 
     (terms such as software to describe mental process). This hard wiring 
     of image processing may be a peek into animal consciousness.
     2. The popularity of psychedelics. Augmenting image production or 
     inhibiting metaphor iconisation starts to look like pretty much the 
     same thing. (Now there's a debate)
     
     Things get interesting for me when looking at where our present (nano 
     and AI) technological development seems to be taking us: further into 
     the mind. It strikes me as a likely fantasy of coders (to coin Douglas 
     Coupland - microserfs) would be to jack into a global neural net and 
     depart the body. This fantasy often seems particularly resonant when 
     the neural net is a visual experience. "Shockwave" is an exciting 
     piece of software, isn't it? The fantasy strikes me as a wish to 
     revert to the mental landscape of childhood, to return to a reality 
     defined entirely by the flow of images and the play of imagination. 
     What I find interesting is that the attempt to actualise this desire 
     is enacted via left brain coding facilities augmented by technology. 
     
     So if I'm right and the unconscious motivation of cinema, TV, video 
     gaming and (future) neuro surfing is the realisation of an eden 
     reclaimed fantasy then two things bear consideration about all this:
     
     1:
     In the 16th Century St Ignatius de Loyola (I do believe) invented the 
     term technology to describe language. This was core to his treatise / 
     tractate / book "Powers of Imagination". If we accept that imaging is 
     our mental connection to emotion then eidetic or on going, self 
     supporting visualisations could be considered as glimpses into the 
     mirror of our souls (loose definiiton of soul: sum of emotional 
     causality. Emotion I find harder to define.) Here's some geek theory:
     "coders" are obsessed with transforming mental experience into 
     mathematical code, to be actualised in silicon, visualised on screen. 
     NOT the same as saying "coders" are fleeing the mirrors of their 
     souls. It's what makes fractal imagery and geek theory in general so 
     fascinating. Let the coders out to play! Just bear in mind that there 
     are multitudes of humans who access their personal cinemas directly 
     and expertly. The mountains are peppered with them. (Upside of 
     buddhism #1)
     
     2. 
     The images generated by neural net being corporate generated, not 
     emotionally generated, thus thwarting the escapist motivation, in 
     exactly the same way that noticing the formula of a Hollywood plot 
     thwarts todays escapist motivation, only worse. What exists in our 
     minds has power because it is us, our full emotional beings 
     experienced first hand. Think carefully before allowing McDonalds to 
     set up a billboard. 
     What interests me me is the (direct) exchange between individuals of 
     mental imagery, which by it's very nature would be of primarily 
     emotional content. Much as lovers exchange dreams and interpretations 
     in the morning. Accelerated and with more freudian slips than you 
     could poke a stick at.
     I would become very worried by developments leading towards a one way 
     corporate to individual communication. Berlin wall or not, 
     corporations are still committees and my demand for three humped

     Europeans were not the first to give up hunter gathering.
     European religion had more to do with the collapse of the Roman empire

     to bollocks up western religion, wouldn't you say?
     
     What happened to the future? Why all this relapse into "what made 
     europe succesful"? Some of it sounds like "Why are we so good?", which 
     is not only insecure, it is crypto fascistic. Imperial success always 
     burdens the individual with upholding the state, that coldest of cold

Except, maybe...the idea that no idea is sacred :))) You obviously seem to
think that this idea, this *meme*, is the most important one there is. It
is
*better* than other ideas like "the eternal unquestionable values of
[...]",
this idea of yours sure beats the rest [blah, blah, blah etc.] You sir, are
a closet
MEME SUPREMACIST...shame on you and all your goats and camels!

Btw, I agree. You've hit the nail on da head. This is the supreme meme
itself:
reject falsity, always look for improvement. Apart from this, there are
perfectly
logical and practical supreme society ethics [memes] like "don't harm
anyone who doesn't harm you". The Extropian Principles are (almost exactly)
the master meme [complex]. Go figure.

Furthermore, in my fine rant I have already explained why certain memes are
better than others. Memes that don't actively seek maximal life extension
trough *scientific* means will ultimately *always* kill the host [by
definition].
Transhumanistic memes give their host at least a fighting chance to attain
immortality (through lots of research and other hard work, not by wasting
time
on prayer or something like that). Deep inside all people just want to be
happy
and [thus] *alive*. The "master meme" is supreme because, as explained in
my
rant, it is the *only one* that, by using your [duly] much acclaimed
scientific
principles, may lead to a future paradise of freedom, knowledge, happiness
and
eternal life.

Snipped the rest, since it basically  was a collection of variations on
your "there's no meme supremacy/"scientifically" not possible theme. This
has
now been proven wrong, so, for the sake of consequence, you will now drop
your defective ideas...although you *never know* with obsessive folks...
Where does it hurt?

Cows have a long gestation period, 10 months, but the Aug 8 New York Times 
says 10 cows cloned from adult cows are on the verge of being born. The 
Holstein cows were made by an American company in Wisconsin, ABS Global Inc. 
Although no animal has been born yet it could just be a matter of days, 
everybody seems healthy and apparently in cattle if you don't have a 
miscarriage in the first 90 days the calf will probably be OK. 

In the original sheep cloning only one try in 277 was successful, but ABS has 
improved the procedure and has a much higher success rate, half the tries 
resulted in an embryo and 80% of those made it past the critical 90 day mark. 
The ABS improvement was in adding an extra step, they took the nucleus of a 
cell from an animal they wanted to clone and placed it in an egg without a 
nucleus and let it divide a few times, BUT then they removed one of those 
cells and used it to clone the animal.

This should remove the fears, or hopes, of some that the original sheep 
cloning was one in a million and they just got lucky, or that no other animal 
would be as easy to clone as a sheep, or that a human would never be cloned  
because the procedure was too inefficient.

     You've essentially turned the tables on the religiously devout.  They

     A more reasonable and benevolent response to your family's concern

It will be interesting to see how this comes out, but I thought the
announcement was premature.  Most of the media carried this as though
cloning had occured.  What they actually showed was a cow cloned from
fetal cells, not from adult cells.  As I understand it, making "artificial
twins" has been possible for years by splitting embryos.  This is a
technical advance but the implications are not that different from what
was already possible.

Once the cows from the adult cells are born, they'll have to be checked to
make sure they are in fact clones (nothing went wrong during the nuclear
transfer, etc.).  So there is more work to be done before the claims of
"breakthrough" are justified.  All the hype has made me a bit suspicious.

No, they have 10 clones from adults and 50 made of cells donated from embryos   
ready to be born in the next few days. It's true that they did have an 
intermediate step, making a  very primitive fetus from the adult cells and 
then cloning from that, but the clone is still genetically identical to the 
adult.

Oh, I dunno. If I was in the subordinate position in this

Yes, but these people were/are hardly Extropians, were/are they, and their
"ideals" were some of the less "humane" ones in history. If, for example,
Hitler would have forced 6 million Jews to go into cryonic suspension after
their *natural* death, could you still call him *morally* a criminal? Is
saving a person that's drowning [in a sea of ignorance and denial] a bad
thing? 

Doesn't superior knowledge almost automatically put one in charge [or do
you
have to "play stupid" to save the other's ego's instead of their lives]?

Easy for you to say, *you*'ve made (almost certainly) the right choice. You
can be free *and* live forever. The "others" have a less glorious deal; if
they
stick to their beliefs (forced upon them by their peers, so they're not
even free)
they will surely perish. Now this may be fine in the case of  the anonymous
masses, but not with friends and relatives. If they can't/won't understand
the life-bringing logic behind the transhuman concept, they must be deemed
mentally
disturbed, and [thus] incompetend to decide for themselves (ok, ok this
sounds
so arrogant it will knock yer socks off, but that's the way it is). 

The only reason there is *not* to cryonically suspend [or otherwise save] a
reluctant person, is when you *don't really care*. Period. If you think
that 
passively killing people you like/love is better than to "limit" their
"freedom"
[of decay] for awhile when they're dead anyway, so they too have the chance
to
live a full life in a marvellous future, you should really check your
values (IMHO).

Most things, [including the limitation of people's freedom] are neutral in

	I guess I don't see it this way.  True, this is twisted a bit
and we don't know, absolutely, that we, as individuals will be some of
the few that will make it to that time in a viable state but I think
there is a very good chance that at least some people, making efforts
like prepairing to have themselves cryonically preserved and so on
will make it.  Or at a very minimum, the research that results from
their efforts will bring eternal life sooner for some.  Much sooner
than simply "praying" or waiting for God and such will ever do.  To
me, it is an almost absolute fact that immortality will come some
time.  It's just a matter of when we can finally accomplish the
necessary research and development.

	Also, this kind of "rhetoric" and threats of hellfire and
damnation is the only thing some of these kinds of people respond to.
They think religion easily wins in the "one-upmanship" of the
"faithful" but I find just the opposite to be true.  In all areas from
faith to hope to the naturally miraculous... extropianism is millions
of times ONE-upmanship of any religion I know of.  If people could
just hear the rational truth instead of all the twisted logic
propaganda.  Religion is the one that tells them science means death,
but this is now a lie.  Successfully communicating the truth and
remove this single "one-up" item and I bet the tables will quickly
turn for many people.  "Don't give up in despair and accept that there
must be death and suffering even when there is an all powerful God,
have faith that, with a bit more power than what man now has, death
and suffering, as we know know it, can be eliminated!"

	It's more or less saying that you must make a choice between
religion and science.  Some claim salvation only comes from religion
and others say it only comes from science.  Pointing out that everyone
agrees that making the wrong choice has critical long term
implications seems very motivational to me.  Who do you really
believe?  Science or religion?  Many people claim they have more faith
in religion, but when it comes right down to real actions they choose
science.  Do you go to a church first, and then a hospital when you
are critically injured and dieing or the other way around?  Make the
wrong choice (i.e. today, some go to a church and/or pray before they
go to a hospital...), and you will, according to what can be
rationally observed, end up dead.  Thankfully, most people choose a
hospital before some church.  Successfully communicate to them that
they now have this same choice with death and I bet many actions will
drastically change in spite of their proclaimed beliefs in the
irrational.

	EvMick <EvMick@aol.com> commented about forcing people to do
what is right:

> Bill Clinton certainly thinks so...as did Stalin, Idi Amin, Hitler,
> Gehghis Khan, Sadam Husein, Fidel Castro, ....................

	The problem is, knowing what is right.  Forcing people to do
what is right might be ok IF you are absolutely right about what is
right for that person.  No one would place a mother that forcefully
prevents a toddler from wondering into a street full of speeding cars
would place her in with these people for such a freedom denying
action.  The problem is, most people who think they know what is right
are really seriously mistaken, especially when it comes to what is
right for other people.

	Who was it that said: "We are condemned to be free"?

den Otter <otter@globalxs.nl> had some great comments and asked:

> Pps: question for the audience: HOW FAR WOULD *YOU* GO TO SAVE A

	I'm only in the process of getting signed up.  Once I do get
signed up and have necessary funds allocated, I plan on working on
allocating some funds for just such a purpose.  When asking reluctant
friends and family about it I often ask them if they would accept it
if it was paid for by someone else or given to them for free.  Hopping
that they read between the lines and see that I'm more or less asking
them if they would accept it if I payed for it.

	I think it should be like government provided paramedics at
the scene of an accident.  The default is, they try to save your life.
But of course it is always possible to decline their treatment with an
exceptional specific request.  If I could afford it for everyone, I
would pay for it all.  It's just unfortunate that such funds obviously
compete with money that should be additionally donated to perform
critically necessary research...

	Look at the Mormons when they go to great lengths and efforts
to perform "necessary" ordinances for ALL the dead! ;) The default is,
you have the exaltation enabling ordinances for the dead performed,
unless someone exceptionally and specifically request otherwise.  As
in the case when certain Jews have complained about Mormons doing
temple ordinances and keeping records for Jews killed in the
Holocust... ;)

Dude, I do not surrender my self-ownership to others,
*regardless* of whether they happen to share my "ideals". Now
I'm cringeing thinking about all the media-damage you are
unthinkingly doing with this bull-in-a-china-shop style of
posting. Don't you see that implicit in your remark is the idea
that a world dictatorship would be okay if only an extropian
were in charge? That's self-contradictory thinking, as far as
I'm concerned. If you're into global dictatorship, you're no
extropian, IMHO. End of story.

Yes, he would still be a moral criminal for violating their
self-ownership.

Saving a suicide against eir will may not be a flat-out bad thing,
but I submit that it is, at the very least, morally ambiguous. If
objective judgements of sanity and insanity were possible in every
case (they are not), then it might be a good thing to rescue insane
suicidal people, but it would be a bad thing to rescue sane suicidal
people. I do believe that there are certain people (irreparable
psychologically damaged people, for instance, who present a grave
and uncontrollable danger to others) for whom the sane thing to do
might properly be suicide. But the real point here is that a
conscious mental life is owned by that mind itself, not another.
And where I come from, self-ownership necessarily includes the
power to destroy oneself. Sometimes ones long-term strategic goals
can include short-term tactical weirdness. Whether you understand
this or not is beside the point: that some people have understandings
of the world that are currently inaccessible to others is exactly
why the principle of self-ownership is so vitally important.

Sure, but people claiming superior knowledge coming in with arms
(the means of *proving* their superior knowledge to me) to save me
from myself are unlikely to meet with much cooperation from me.
Unless you consider a halo flaming lead "cooperative".

You are talking war-talk, den Otter, whether you realize it or
not. Those who talk war-talk get war-responses. I don't care for
real physical war myself (I prefer argumentation).

So let me get this straight: you're planning to hold a gun to
your Uncle Ernie's head and *force* him to upload, whether he
likes it or not? To save him from his own bad memes? I think you
might want to inspect your nervous system and make sure you
don't have any weird viral junk lurking there yourself before
you go holding guns to people's heads.

Seriously: how clean is your system? Have you done a deep
neural-scan lately? Are you willing to claim what few people are
willing to claim: that you have examined all the information
lurking in your soul (you know, that big chordate nervous
assemblage) and all the crufty legacy code all hooked together
in there, weird hormonal things left over from therapsids and
fish and monkeys, and you know that It's All Good?  Because
that's the presumption that you're pinning your whole argument
on.

Don't *make* me get Lovecraftian on your ass, now.   ;)

 > The only reason there is *not* to cryonically suspend [or otherwise

I'm sorry, but I see no conflict between deeply caring about
someone and deeply respecting eir self-ownership and eir ability
to control eir own life. In fact, demonstrated ability to take
responsibility for one's own life is one of the things that
elicits caring from me, when I recognize that in other people.
Inability to respect the self-ownership of other human beings,
such as you are demonstrating, is one of the few things that
tends to elicit genuine enmity in me. I'm not there yet, I just
thought I'd let you know that you are treading on ground that I
take very seriously.

You are talking as if you have an ownership interst in the lives
of other human beings. You may have an interest, but it's not an
ownership interest.

You're right, den Otter. I'd better assemble a tactical
squadron, find out where you live, kidnap you, and set up a
brainwashing operation to save you from your own bad memes.

"Subordinate" is hardly the correct word here. I'm talking friends and
relatives,
frozen or otherwise preserved after their natural death without having
given
their consent. If the future turnes out the way I hope it will, these folks
will be
restored to life. Upon realizing that I (or other transhumanists) was right
all
along (no mystical afterlife, you *can* "repair" the dead, technology has
enabled mankind to explore the universe and so on) they will probably
accept the situation. I still assume that no-one *really* wants to die,
that if  *real* "youth pills" or "immortality potions" were handed out on
the street (and it had somehow [hypothetically] been proven that they
work), the same people who "oppose" cryonics etc. would be fighting over
them. 

Therefore, I strongly doubt it that anyone I want to save would hate, let
alone
kill me for it. Terms like "tormentor" may add some spice to your 
comment, but in reality the frozen reluctant ones will almost certainly
wake as our equals, with the same benefits like enhanced minds etc.
Definitely _not_ as
"victims" or "slaves" or something like that.

Nor do I. I find Heinlein's "How do I know it won't interfere with
immortality?" to be poignant and bittersweet, not a sign that I (or
someone) should have hijacked his corpse from the crematorium.

There are circumstances ("lifeboat scenarios") when it can be countenanced
that principles, civility, and self-government have to go out the window.

To declare such circumstances carries risks--one of which is to be
believed to be right by others _who are mistaken_.

MMB

PS:

I once wrote a story (it was poorly written, so I'll blow the twist
ending) about Ayn Rand having been "brought back" by a team in the far
future. Who she is is kept somewhat veiled, but there are lots of clues.

The twist: this isn't the first time they've brought her back--seems as
soon as she is able to get up and around, and realizes what her past
is/was, she understands they did this without consulting her--and kills
herself. Every time. And "they" don't get it--"they" keep trying.

We all get one life and one death. If they're not ours, whose are they?
And who says?

Eric Watt Forste <arkuat@pobox.com>,

	You criticized some of den Otter's <otter@globalxs.nl>
comments which were in partial agreement with some of the ideas I've
also posted and am struggling with.  I have very much respect for
people like you, Max, and many others which have time and time again
successfully convinced me of your correctness through argumentation.
To some degree, then, I surrender some of my self ownership to such
people which I consider to be more of an expert or an authority than I
am.  I'm sure that there are at least a few people on this planet that
know what is better for me better than I know what is better for me.
I try to listen intently and give head to such people, especially
whenever they disagree with some point of view I previously thought
was correct.  I'm only an average Joe and certainly not the smartest
person in the world.

	Here you are, apparently, at least partially, disagreeing with
my thinking that it might be ok for someone to force someone to do
something IF they know, absolutely, that that is what is right for
that person.  (i.e. a Mother knows a toddler should not wander into a
busy street and forcefully prevents them from doing so.)

	So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling with
about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say you have a very
close loved one.  Say it is one of your children or something.  Lets
say he's about 17 years old and you know that throughout his life he
has consistently expressed a desire to not be cryonically preserved -
possibly because he is a totally convinced member of some religion
which is against it.  Let's call him Jeff.  You figure Jeff hasn't
really seriously considered dieing or whether he would really want to
be preserved because he is so young even though he has several times
explicitly said to you he did not want to make any effort to be
preserved.

	Suddenly, Jeff is involved in an instantaneous, life taking,
but not brain destroying accident.  In other words, without expecting
to die he doesn't get the chance to, with his final breaths, say: "I
don't (or do) want to be cryonically preserved."  Let's say there just
happens to be a cryonic team there, ready to preserve him, and that
funds for the procedure and long term preservation are absolutely no
problem.  Let's say the decision is entirely up to you.  In other
words there are no other significant family or friends of the person.
The cryonics team is awaiting your (as his parent and soul guardian)
answer to their question:

	"Do we preserve him or don't we?"

	What would you tell them to do?

	I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should
I do?

Its my favorite theory, that time/novelty will come to a climax/end in 2012,
based on the Mayan calendar and a model of time based on the I-ching by
Terrence Mckenna.  Terrence developed the time model without the knowledge of
the Mayans end date and got it to the day, December 21(?) the winter solstice
when the sun rises to allign with the galactic center.  
     Since the beginning of time novelty in the universe has been incresing
exponentially, the complexity of matter has been getting faster and faster,
and there's no reason why this should stop.  You can see it spanned over the
universe within the last millions of years and through the development of man
and our develepments, its continuous, and leading to something. 

there's a mailing list that talks about this, its very good, they talk about
a lot of things: www.levity.com/eschaton/novelty.html

 I've been slowly but steadily improving my diet. For example, 10 years
ago I ate 1 pound of beef and well over a pound of sugar in a typical
week, and never ate broccoli. Now I eat broccoli fairly often, have reduced
my beef intake by at least an order of magnitude, and my sugar intake by
a factor of about 2.
 I'm taking quite a few vitamins and related supplements.
 I make some attempt to exercise regularly.
 I've also gotten around to signing up for cryonics.

 The idea that health food is necessarily expensive probably indicates
a poor definition of health food. I generally find the unhealthy foods
I'm cutting down on (beef, ice cream, chocolate bars, potato chips)
cost more money on average than the foods I'm trying to eat more of
(bananas, broccoli, sweet potatoes, carrots). Of course, the preparation
time for healthy foods is much higher, and probably deters some overworked
extropians.

Whoa!  Each person votes for 1 Legislator.  There aren't "races" of two
alternatives; there are 500 alternatives and everybody votes for one.  Let's
say you decide to run for Legislator - then everyone on the ExList could vote
for you, forsaking our previous Legislators.

"If a dam is built my constituents will get a lot of benefit out of it, but if 
I don't vote for it then they get it for free and in gratitude reelect me in
the next election. The constituents of the moron who did vote for it have to
pay for the damn thing and this makes them very unhappy so they vote the
idiot out as soon as they can."

Exactly!  Except that there are no more "constituents", only people who did
vote for you.  See above.  So nobody ever pays for anything involuntarily;
someone they voted for has to vote to pay for it.  And yes, if a Legislator
votes to build gratis dams for some area, people will vote him out of office. 
So no more pork; if something ought to be done, people will pay for it
themselves and invoke the efficiencies of the private government.  The
exception will be if an operation actually needs governmental authority; then
it will have that authority if a majority approves, but will be funded by
exactly the same people.

I'd view this similarly to other questions about interventions.
Similar issues arise if he is becoming addicted to a harmful drug,
or is depressed and suicidal.

I would intervene and use coercion if he were my 10 year old child.  If he
were 30 I would probably limit myself to persuasion.  17 is a gray area.

There is a saying in the legal community, "hard cases make bad law".
I'm not sure exactly what it means, but I have always thought of it
as advice that exploring these gray areas is not a fruitful way to
establish fundamental issues.  You become embroiled in the specifics of
the situation and it obscures the broad principles.

I beleive that this argument was aired earlier...ie. " A blind man can't

But that's not the point....provissionally conceded that the visual cortex IS

left eyelid...or that part of the brain which controls the secretion of

The point is that, surely, not all the brain is required to support a

Yawn.

(Sorry, Rick.  This is one of the `woolly masters'.)

Lee Smolin's book on budding universes turns out to have something of the
same metaphysical (Leibnizean) tendency [luckily, about a zillion times
more rigorous than poor Talbot], but alas he finished it before M-theory
really kicked in.  In utter ignorance of the fine-grain detail, I note that
it looks to me as if Smolin's loopy space and brane theory might converge
in a geometrodynamical TOE.

It's very tempting to snipe at Tipler and how many bits per proton, but
this diverges from my point. Even if the Universe has infinite data
storage capacities (which aleph is the next question here), we have no
reasonable idea how to exploit such properties. Preal is a concept for
the present time, without waiting for the last femtonanopico...second of
the Big Crunch (for which the evidence is to say the least, sparse),
prayers to St Bekenstein, or technologies capable of more than one bit
per proton. A goolgol provides for about 10^20 bits per proton anyway.

My goals here are:

	1. To eliminate the confusion when the Platonists begin to confuse the
names and symbols they use with the things themselves.

	2. To begin to understand the limitations placed on our thought by the
physical nature of the universe.

Or, to ask a really un-Extropian question:

	What really are the bounds of expansion?

So as I understand it, everybody could vote for anybody and the top 500 vote 
getters are elected. You can be certain that sports heroes, game show hosts 
and soap opera actors would be in this select group, even if they didn't want 
to be and had no wish to be in the legislature. Also, you can forget about 
the secret ballet, who voted for who would have to be a matter of public
record so they'd know where to send the bill to in case your man makes a fool 
of himself and actually votes for something. Lots of people would get tired 
of paying for things their fool representative did years ago, and feel 
resentment knowing that their neighbor doesn't pay a dime, they'd move,  
change their name and disappear, even more would refuse to vote at all. 
If I was forced to vote I'd vote for myself because I'd know I wouldn't win, 
or I'd go for a Casper Milktoast who vowed to collect his salary, sit on his 
ass and not do one damn thing.

44 bits per proton. If the Beckenstein bound is true (probably is, but it has
never been rigorously proved) then the amount of information inside a sphere 
of radius R that contains energy E is less than or equal to 2*PI*E*R/(h *ln2), 
h is really h bar. For meters (R) and kilograms (M) that works out to  
2.577 *10^43* M*R bits. A proton has a radius of 10^-15 meters and a mass of
1.67 *10^-27 kilograms, plug that in and you get 44 bits. You'd do a lot 
better with a Hydrogen atom. The mass is almost the same but it's a lot 
bigger, about 10^-10 meters, so a hydrogen atom can store 4*10^6 bits.

Mine too. The idea that you can tell if something is real by examining it's 
complexity, and the simpler the realer, is confusing. A perfect geometric  
line is much simpler than the tree trunk of a pine tree, yet I think you 
would say the tree was more real. Why? The shape of the Mandelbrot Set is 
more complex than the shape of a grape, yet you say the grape is real and the 
set is not. Exactly what is the relationship between complexity and reality?

Day One.

Of course, if you're a transhumanist extropian, you can't attend a
conference where K. Eric Drexler is the after-dinner speaker, and leave not
feeling that his presence was the reason for yours. But list subscribers
might already know that.

For me, the surprises lay elsewhere in the proceedings. The conference
seems to me a monumental achievement for the Extropy Institute. That so
many radically conservative thinkers could be assembled into such a small
space all at the same time is a most pleasing opportunity to those of us
who have our minds open to the future.

Anders Sandberg has made an indelible impression on my memory with his talk
covering techniques to improve recall and the process of thought. What a
character. I always loved his virtual personality, but the real fellow is
even more fun. I do hope we get a chance to talk over breakfast tomorrow.
Picture in your mind the Swedish chef from The Muppet Show, replace the
chicken with a presentation pointer, make him sixty years old, add a
generous helping of computational neuroscience, some white hair, some thick
glasses and, even though Anders' hair isn't actually white yet and he's in
his mid-twenties, you will know what Anders is about. It's an avatar that
works well for me, and I hang on his words.

I did find the inclusion of a debate on the future of gender quite bizarre.
I fail to see that gender has any long-term future, a view I did not change
today. It was pleasing, though, to hear Christopher Heward, Ph.D., (an
endocrinologist) announce quite publicly his down-to-earth disagreement
with the widespread, educated thinking on what gender is all about. His
views on the subject clearly come from his groin, and what better place?
This is social interaction in today's real world of testosterone, not that
mysterious plane of "enlightenment" where one can cite study after study on
why there are umpteen different variations on gender and sexuality, despite
what can plainly be seen and emotionally felt when one looks between one's
legs. Of the panelists, only Natasha actually commented on the FUTURE of
anything. But despite the expectations one might have had from the title to
the contrary, nobody actually discussed the future of GENDER. I still
couldn't grasp just what, in a posthuman world, I would need gender for. I
had some sympathy with Kathryn Aegis, whose widely heard yet silent
statement was the loudest of all contributions. (She wasn't there.)

Stephen Coles, M.D., Ph.D., started out very promisingly, warning so loudly
that one should be cautious when listening to charlatans. One must not
accept medical advice from someone who cannot back it up with a reference
to sound research, he said. He then gave some medical advice, and, only
when questioned, admitted that there was no research to back up the advice
whatsoever. So, before all men go cutting iron from their diets, I suggest
first adding a pinch of sodium and chloride.

The cryonicists appear finally to have recruited Dr. Drexler, not only as a
subscriber but also as a salesman. I'm familiar with the "you die / you die
/ you die / you don't" matrix, which must have persuaded at least a few to
part with their hard-earned cash, but I'm still surprised that I don't hear
anyone quizzing whether they could extend their lives more assuredly by,
say, buying additional safety features in their home and car. The day has
not YET come for ME when I believe that for a given amount of money, the
period of extension multiplied by the probablity it will work is greater
for cryonics than for buying better food and taking more excercise. If I
spend the money on cryonics today instead of on time off work to excercise,
then maybe I will "die" so soon that the freezing technology won't do a
good enough job. Afford the excercise, goes the theory, and I'll make it as
far as the five star freezer. 

Greg Stock, by contrast, was fascinating. His demonstration of the
ludicrousness of popular opinion on germline genetic engineering was, for
me at least, thoroughly convincing. He reported that, asked whether they
would genetically modify their offspring to enhance functionality, Thailand
had a majority positive response, whilst the U.S. was seriously
unsupportive of the idea. I couldn't help but wonder whether the dominant
variation inter eastern and western religions was at the root. His report
that major in-vivo modification was "much more difficult" than ex-vivo and
germline engineering was disappointing. Like the Americans, I won't be
modifying my children. But I WOULD like to modify myself.

And the ever-present Max has managed to transform me at once from a
relatively static entity into a continually changing process which actively
seeks criticism in order to develop more rapidly. Thanks, Max, and, er,
wood shavings to you, too.

So far, a nice trip to California for a salesman from England.

Darren

Not at all; I didn't say anything about electing people without their
permission.  That's no better than jury duty.  Besides, the sports heroes,
game show hosts, and soap opera actors can become Guardians, or maybe Lesser
Guardians or Guardians-At-Large.  That's what the House of Decoys is for.

Is the amount you now pay in taxes a matter of public record?  I don't see how
this changes anything.  [Just completed my 1040 - you think you have it bad, I
didn't even get to vote!]

People evade our mandatory taxes; I don't see how having a say in the matter
would make things worse.  And if people don't vote at all, they (might) still
have to pay for military spending or some such.

Gee, I guess the government wouldn't spend much, then.

"He has discovered our secret!"

Yes, EXACTLY, that's the whole POINT, make it almost impossible for the
government to spend money unless there's some overwhelmingly urgent cause -
like an invasion - urgent enough that everyone DEMANDS to spend their own
money on it.

The issue at hand is whether Extropian ideas are so obviously, so surely
right, that we should override the free will of dissenters.

The answer, as any individualist knows, is "No."  I, personally, have stated,
on this list, that I wouldn't dare override the will of actual schizophrenics.
 That is, even if I *know* for a neurological *fact* that somebody is
incompetent, I still would respect their free will, as long as they didn't try
to shoot me or something.

Many religious persons throughout the ages, sincerely and utterly convinced
that they were acting to preserve the immortal souls of others - as you would,
with cryonics - were responsible for pain, torture, and the retardation of
knowledge and civilization.  You can't say, "Well, *I* am right."  The Law
that governs our actions within a social context - ethics, morality, game
theory, whatever - cannot refer to actual reality, only our perceptions of
reality.  Because when we have to make a decision, we know what we think; we
don't know what is.

I'm sure that a lot of people will resent my comparing cryonics to a religion.
 Well, I'm not.  I'm just saying that, even if you are *certain* that cryonics
is Right, this *still* does not entitle you to override someone's will.  You
have to respect the surety of others, or they will be just as sure that
cryonics is the Work of Satan and will - with exactly as much justification,
no more, no less - smash your liquid nitrogen tanks and free the trapped and
frozen souls.  Surety gives not the right of Command.  Hence the phrase,
"informed consent".

Perhaps I'm something of an extremist on the subject.  I need to be.  Being a
mutant(*) with strange mental powers and all, you can imagine the depths of
catastrophe that would result if I decided that my "superior intelligence"
entitled me to Mastery.  The day I draw a line that separates humanity into
"responsible" and "irresponsible" adults, I just *know* I'm going to wind up
alone on one side.  So I draw no line.
(* Usual caveats about how, for all I know, it's postnatal or teratogenic.)

Nor is this a condescending allowance.  I truly respect the rights and
opinions of others, and genuinely, deeply, and emotionally believe that They
may be right, and I wrong.  Over and *over* and OVER, throughout history,
people have been mistaken.  Humans are built for surety in their Cause;
doubters got demoted.  So we can never, ever, trust our surety.  Indeed,
trusting your surety is a sign that there's a hell of a lot you don't know
about human nature, and that you probably *are* wrong.

In fact, my mutant status really has nothing to do with it.  Anybody who makes
the basic error of surety is going to wind up alone on the "responsible" side
of the line, or - at best - in a small and select group of people who exactly
share opinions.  My genuine statistical improbability simply means that the
group size would be small, with a corresponding lack of stabilization, and
descent into megalomania.  Thus, as I stated, I can't afford to make that
basic error, because the consequences to me would be exacerbated, and hard to repair.

Anyway.  As I said once to Dr. Hugo de Garis - who used much the same
arguments, except targeted at females - the trouble with declaring your group
superior is that "your group" doesn't necessarily include *you*.  In fact,
just being silly enough to start drawing lines like that excludes you from the Masters.

It's a very contagious meme, "knowing better".  We're built to be infected by
it.  I tossed out a couple of antibodies at
http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/FOD.html in an effort to present a clean bill of
memetic health... but the meme lives on, and will continue until I finally get
my hands on the source code for human nature.  Speaking of which, back to work.

"Remote Licking Fyborgs"
   - Today, we heard Sasha Chislenko elegantly abstract the functional
system from its physical substrate. True freedom requires a life without
boundaries, and Sasha played dextrously with those boundaries as freely as
his charming 20Hz voice drifted through one's ears. If you haven't already
read his masterly publications, read them now. Sasha went on to discuss the
concept of remote licking, an extension of the virtual reality theme, to
roars of enthusiasm, which mostly, I noted, came from females. He further
demonstrated how we ourselves have become "fyborgs", most of our function
residing outside our biological bodies.

     Sasha warned the wary to be on the look-out for flying assassin
automatons. The encryption of cellular telephone calls in the US was
delayed by the legal system's attempt to prevent snooping. As Mark Miller
reminded us, technology is so often superior to the law. Then Sasha
announced that flying, navigating robots are easier to build than mobile
ground-based ones. With the anonymity and strong security promised by Mark
Miller, malicious agents might release automatons in the near future which
could whizz around and shoot anyone they don't like. I always wanted to
build a model aircraft, and now I have an incentive.


"Anders' Mind Gets Bigger"
   - Yesterday, we had seen evidence that Anders Sandberg uses his computer
to help him think. He showed us that, whilst he was writing his notes for
his presentation, his word processor was delivering up suggestions on what
to write based upon a database of previous correspondence both to and from
others. He feels that his material is improved by this process, and
suddenly I wonder how I can ever compete with such a powerful recall system.

     If Sasha can abstract the human thinking system from its physical
substrate (and we hope that he can, for that is what mind uploading is all
about), and if Anders uses his computer to help him think, does that not
mean that Anders' thinking system extends beyond his physical being? Sasha
might draw the boundary around Anders' thinking system to include his head,
arms and computer. Has Anders' artificial computer contributed to his
apparent intelligence, and thus become in a way, a part of that
intelligence? And would Anders pass the Turing test? (Perhaps we should
make him take it?)


"AI Researchers Make No Progress (again)"
   - The AI Panel was chaired by (we're not worthy) Prof. Marvin Minsky. I
felt a sharp contrast between his vast experience on the one hand and the
quick wits of Anders and Sasha on the other. The main thrust of the panel
seemed to be: "We're not getting anywhere", so that contrast is perhaps
encouraging. Prof. Minsky argued that the technological singularity will
happen once a machine can design (and presumably build) a better machine
with similar properties to itself faster than humans could do it, and
although Dr. Robin Hanson disagreed, such a time can hardly be far off
considering the power of modern CAE tools. Computers are already designed
and built largely by computers faster than humans could do it on their own.
Dr. Ralph Merkle proposed that we solve the problem with ...
nanotechnology. I wasn't sure if it was serious or a joke, but Robert
Bradbury informed us later that work was in progress to deliver a newspaper
headline-class supercomputer around 2007 designed specifically to help
Drexler and Merkle with their research. 


"On Your Bike"
   - The "Investing in the Future" planel was, er, varied. I felt that
Peter Voss had the best angle on it. If you're going to invest in the
future, it might as well be your own, so start your own company. This suits
me, more the entrepreneur than team player, but other more co-operatist
Extropians might disagree.

     Chris Peterson and her forsighted colleagues made an entertaining and
lively presentation, widely enjoyed, covering environmental issues.

     It was good that Robert Bradbury named names on who is actually doing
the medical research now, and he made sure that we all know about life
extension, the limits imposed by accidents, Jupiter Brains and the Fermi
Paradox. His delivery was fast and effective.


"Cryopreservation in 20 Years"
   - The Prometheus Project is attempting to raise the necessary funds to
conduct the proper research to perfect the techniques for placing a human
in suspended animation AND bringing them out again. Once the project kicks
off, founders hope that after twenty years, suspension will be an option
available to all whose animation unexepectedly deserts them due to accident
or disease. Paramedics, doctors and hospitals around the globe will all
have the facility as standard. Somehow, I doubt that this can be achieved
in a 20-year timetable, but the goal is surely honourable, and deserves our
best wishes, not mention our money.


An entertaining weekend. But now I really must go back to sleep. Time
Zones. Who'd have them?

Regards,
Darren

When politicians are seen as interchangeable, selected only for ability
to bring home the pork, I suspect you're right: the permanent campaign
is inevitable.  But if they're decoupled from districts, they can
represent ideological factions; such representatives, I suspect, would
have less competition for their "market segment".

     A suspicious letter drops through the slot in the door.
     
     It has a plastic window through which you read:
     
     Congratulations on your new purchase:
     "supreme meme" is "No idea is sacred"
     You may already have won MORE!
     
     You wipe your sweaty brow and tear the envelope open...
     
     
     
     Here is the fine print:
     
     Whether the idea / notion / concept / label / category / belief / 
     slogan / vehicle of cultural appropriation of "meme" ...
     (delete whatever proves applicable / inapplicable)
     ...is really built to include paradox.
     
     Because "No idea is sacred" is not a paradox, nor is it true; just as 
     "No idea is sacred, except the sacred ones." is. The logical 
     equivalent of the value statement "no idea is sacred" is "No statement 
     is true." which is a paradox, as is "Nothing is true" as in "Nothing 
     is true, everything is permitted.". If you accept the logical 
     equivalent, you accept the paradox. If you stick with last week's 
     "supreme meme" which is "No idea is sacred" you buy the problems of 
     defining "sacred", and which dictionary best defines it? And who wrote 
     that? And who told them? Someone will eventually tell you that god 
     told them, and then you'll have a schizophrenic on your hands, telling 
     you this is sacred and that's sacred and now it's time to make war 
     with the infidel because they say the sacred sandal of OofaBlathaTekk 
     smells like curry and we know it smells like cheese.
     
     So: reject falsity in a world where nothing is true
                               or
     Establish and enshrine new hierarchies of nonsense (new AND IMPROVED!)
     
     What's yer poison, cowboy? 
     
     
     
     The qualifying factor that could make "meme" special enough to 
     
     also represent paradox is that it is, I believe, a french term 
     
     equivalent to "mama".
     
     
     And while you're at it, why not consider
     
     why the concept of meme was ever invented
     
     in the first place
     
     and in whose name is it propogated
     
     and what exactly is it
     
     that makes it
     
     just
     
     so
     
     special?
     
     
     "It's the bubbles of nothing that make it really something."  
     - Aero Bar ad circa 1990

Well I just found out that i have a little problem!

When i get to be old and smart enough, I will incorporate my uploaded mind
into the fabric of a galaxy. So far so good. I think that wil be room
enough for my taste.

The problem is though... where do I keep the backup?

Jeff has made his wishes clear

If you are a libertarian....... no.

I would respect his wishes in this matter.

Morals are an individual matter, (therefore beyond experts) we are
responsible for our actions, unless mentally disabled. You should
do what you think best, but you should also take responsibility for
your actions, and realize if revived, Jeff may chose to have
nothing to do with you for ignoring his wishes.

BTW, if you haven't seen it, the discussion of Smolin on The Edge at

Membrane theory.  Extended strings.  Ed Witten, the superstring genius, is
very hot for it.  There are good sites on the Web but I can't find them
right now, sorry.  Mitch has some links, as I recall:

Absolutely! John, I can tell you that the visitors were an eclectic bunch,
so if you don't see completely opposite points of view here within 24 hours
I'll be most surprised! Reviews of this kind always upset at least
somebody, and I challenge the professional writers in the group to use
their guts and write!

Tell me, what crime is worse: kidnapping or murder? (rhetorical question!)

Murder of course, because it's [effect is] irreversible. For this very
reason, many oppose the death penalty; what if you **make a wrong
judgement**? You can never undo the damage...the person is gone forever. 

So, in the case of the reluctant suspension victim, the choice is easy
(unless
you're full of ivory tower ideological crap, of course :(#(

This may be so, but nonetheless, *you* and only you can know for
sure *which* people you trust in this way, and in this "meta" sense,
it's still you and no one else who knows what is best for you. You
are the one who is choosing the authority that you study, at
least once you've attained to adulthood, whatever that is (I'm
an unabashed fan of Peter Pan, myself). 

Children usually stick with the default choice of their parents
as the right authority figures to listen to, but if the parents
screw up too much and lose their kids respect... it's usually
tragic, which is more important than the fact that it's also a
knotty problem in moral philosophy. Children's rights is a
gnarly area, intellectually. It depends entirely too much on
experiences and data that few people can think about objectively
and dispassionately.

But once you've hit the point where you've decided you are
capable of finding your own authorities whom you are sure are
more trustworthy than your parents (there's a provisional
definition of "adulthood" for you), then you're on your own in
terms of taking responsibility for your future ethical
development.

Yes, it's interesting that you have to invoke the parent-child
relationship in order to illustrate your notion of "absolute
knowledge of what is good for someone else".  I doubt that it is
possible for one adult to know absolutely what is good for any
*other* adult. Unfortunately, this merely opens up room for debate
about the definition of adulthood. I was fascinated by the
distinction drawn in Linda Nagata's novel DECEPTION WELL: in the
city of Silk, those over age 120 years or so are considered
"real people", whereas those under that age are considered
"ados" (a word derived from "adolescent").

The position that I was taking was that an expressed desire to
commit suicide does not, by itself, constitute prima-facie evidence
of insanity, and that an *adult* of sound mind who clearly expressed
a desire not to be cryonically suspended after deanimation should
not be forced into suspension. If you want to take this already
fuzzy and difficult moral situation and mix into it questions of
children's rights and parental responsibilities, then you're taking
it way beyond my domain of expertise, since I'm over thirty and
childless so far.

 > I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should
 > I do?

I don't know for sure that there is any such thing as a moral
expert. The notion makes me suspicious. The only moral experts I
might trust are the ones who deny that they are moral experts.
And even then only if they have a sense of humor.  ;)

In the galaxy next door, of course. Any mission-critical backup
strategy requires an offsite storage component.  ;)

Fortunately, there seem to be plenty of galaxies to go around.
We'll probably be able to address this problem in greater detail
in a couple of centuries, eh?

Don't feel bad John, I'm a poor speller too, and so is no less a brain than 
Stephen Wolfram. Stephen has a titanic intellect, but when he wrote the first 
version of Mathematica 10 years ago he misspelled the word "Millennium" with  
only one n. To this day, if you want to convert 65 miles per hour to meters 
per millennium the command you have to give is:

Convert[65 Mile/Hour, Meter/Millenium]

Personally I think you and Stephen are right and everybody else is wrong.

Speaking of Mathematica, I would be interested in comments on version 3.0 and 
how it compares to competing programs, I'm thinking on punching it and at 
$1300 I want to be sure it's the smart thing to do.

I don't think the question is un-Extropian at all. What's un-Extropian
to me is to accept stated bounds and limits without question.  My
personal experience is that it is through questioning the bounds
of my personal expansion (speaking of minds and not waistlines here
;) that those bounds begin to recede, melt away, and shift into
ever more remote, ever less confining vistas.

I'll let you know if this process changes, but I'm not expecting
it to.  At least not that particular aspect of it. At least not
any time soon.

John, this is a strong claim, and I for one am skeptical. Of course,
you can keep pulling more signal out of a Mandelbrot set as you
fall into its infinite depths, but hey, in *some* sense, we *know*
what we are going to be getting out of it. The "fractal character"
of the curves that emerge from increasing levels of mathematical
magnification doesn't change much no matter how deep you go.

Going deeply into a grape, however, you run into, well, unknown
things. Who knows what's down in there? Superstrings? Membranes?
What? It's not as if the structure just stops at the level of quarks
and leptons... at least I suspect it's not, because the history of
science so far has been that the more you study a real physical
object, the weirder it gets.

If by "the shape of a grape" all you meant was "ellipsoid", well,
then you're just comparing a complex Platonic mathematical object
to a simple Platonic mathematical object, and you're not engaging
with Hara's Preal distinction at all. This is why I assumed you
meant the full three-dimensional curve of the grape in full detail,
interior and exterior.

    T W A   8 0 0   C A S E   C O R E

    by Ian Williams Goddard

    In early May, Pierre Salinger received 20 Suffolk 
    County Police reports containing the accounts of
    TWA 800 eyewitnesses. They were sent to him by an 
    investigative journalist with a popular television 
    program who wanted to get his response for their
    coverage of the accounts. Pierre made the reports
    available to researchers.  The contents of those
    reports now appear at several Internet websites.

    Since May I have studied and integrated the physical 
    events reported in those accounts with other evidence 
    in the case to create an animated fact-based scenario 
    of the events leading up to TWA 800's annihilation:

    http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm

    This animated model reveals witness locations, line-
    of-sight launch-point triangulation, and events that 
    took place before TWA 800 exploded. Every detail of 
    the animation is based upon substantial evidence 
    including witness accounts, radar data, and 
    physical deformation to the plane: 

    http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm

    The animated scenario is a subset of the "TWA 800 
    Case Core" -- a webpage covering the evidentiary 
    core of the TWA 800 Navy-missile case:

    http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm

    It's a graphics intensive page, so allow a few 
    minutes to download. Once the animation is down-
    loaded, it should run more smoothly and quickly.

I've wondered this myself.  Sure, galaxies seem plentiful now, but so did
the great European forest, and now it is nothing more than a little patch
of trees on the Polish/Russian border.  In a competitive universe of
galaxy brains, can one brain afford to waste half it's matter on
duplication?  It seems to me that the brains with duplication will be
conquered by the twice-as-massive brains with no backup at all.  I'm sure
all extropians would like to have a little security in their future, but
will this be possible?  You can't cryonically freeze a galaxy brain that
has just been gobbled up by another, and if duplication takes away a
competitive edge, what other options are there?  Is it paranoia to think
that the universe will only become more Darwinian after the singularity?

Thanks to Anders for distinguishing the tree kinds of longterm memory;
now that I have words for them, I can talk about them.

I feel my semantic memory is much better than my episodic memory.
(I cannot say about procedural memory, because I cannot easily
compare it with others'.)  Am I unusual?  Are these abilities
correlated?

Some thoughts prompted by Max's talk Saturday.

Max mentioned one or more of Greg Egan's stories about artificial
personality.  I'd add to the list George Alec Effinger's Arab trilogy:
When Gravity Fails, A Fire in the Sun, third title forgotten.

I thought for a moment that I might like a treatment to help me purge
myself of hypocrisy.  ("If your beliefs don't make you a little bit
uncomfortable, they're not radical enough." -LNS)  But on second thought
it wouldn't sell.

An immaterial mind might make its avatar literally "all ears" to
indicate polite attention.  Even better would be the ability to
reassign part of one's processing power from a function not being
used at the moment to processing and understanding voices.

What parts of us are most important to other people's view of our
identity?  Values, ethics?  Conversational style?

There's room for a short story about strange attractors in personality
space.  Suppose I want to be more like Alice, but one of Alice's deep
traits is that she wants to be more like Bob, but Bob ...

For a biographical encyclopedia of the far future, birth/death dates
will not be the most useful.  Maybe it will give only a floruit ("known
to be active at date X"); where someone's life is well known, it might
be meaningful to state a period during which the personality's similarity
to that of the floruit is over a threshold.

I think we have a "minor" speed-of-light problem here.
Unless the galaxy brains find a way around relativity, 
then a galaxy brain cannot coordinate it;s own
actions in less than roughly the time it takes to
traverse a galaxy twice, which is on the order of
100K years. I personally believe that any SI is essentially
incomprehensible to use mere humans, but if I were an SI, I'd
start by concentrating my available mass to increase my
effective interaction rate. My rate of increase of effective
capacity would be limited by the rate at which I could
concentrate matter. There is a trade-off here. I could
increase my accretion rate by increasing the acceleration of
the matter but (without some new physics) I would have to
expend reaction mass to increase my accretion rate. This mass
is lost, so while my accretion rate goes up, my ultimate
acquired mass goes down. If the SI can disciver some new physical
principles, it may be able to get around this by using a
gravity drive (or something.) However, unless it also sidesteps
relativity, galaxies can interact only on the million-year
timescale. I'm unwilling to speculate on the motivations and
actions of even a modest SI (say 10 times as smart as the
smartest human.) I'm a lot less willing to speculate on the
motivations and actions of a million-year-old galaxy brain.

It's rhetorical if you're a simpleton or a kindergarten student.
I'm *so* glad they're providing Net access for you. Do your Mommy 
and Daddy help with the big words?

You neglect to add the requisite ivory tower ideological crap: 
"all other things being equal". The more complete answer is:
Depends on the circumstances. 

Turn it around: which right is more important, life or liberty?  
To whom, when and why? If your answer is "life", unconditionally,
the fact that you can't see both sides of the coin itself indicates
a lack of at least one species of compassion--believe it or not.

Turn it around another way: how much would someone have to *pay* you 
to guarantee you'd not interfere with that person's choice to die? 
If you can come up with a number, you have established what you think 
that person's liberty is worth. Is this the same amount of money you'd be
willing to contract to pay me if I chose to die and you brought me back 
anyway? If not, why not? 

>Murder of course, because it's [effect is] irreversible. For this very
>reason, many oppose the death penalty; what if you **make a wrong
>judgement**? You can never undo the damage...the person is gone forever. 

I oppose the death penalty, administered by third (uninvolved) parties 
after the fact, for precisely this reason. I am more openminded about 
self-defense which results in the initiator of force winding up in a 
body bag.

How's that for ivory tower ideological crap?

>So, in the case of the reluctant suspension victim, the choice is easy
>(unless
>you're full of ivory tower ideological crap, of course :(#(

Your words make it clear that in this matter, you do not believe 
that reasonable minds may differ. Very well. 

Grow up, and maybe we can actually have a conversation. 'Til then.... *PLONK*

Advance summary:

1)  You cannot override the will of others.  Death isn't that important.
2)  I can't guarantee the Powers will say the same.
3)  But *you* are not a Power.

[den Otter asks...]
> Tell me, what crime is worse: kidnapping or murder? (rhetorical question!)

WRONG!

This question is *not* rhetorical.

As I said:
[http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon_ethics.html]

'Over time, I've learned to value free will over human life. No doubt,
 this is and will remain a controversial statement. The truth is that
 the intuitive reasons why I believe this are not derived from the
 pure ethical logic of goal and subgoal. Life and death are simple
 things, a binary duality. There's nothing palpably evil about death.
 Certainly, nobody who believes in God or an immortal soul (11)
 should, logically, look on death as more than an inconvenience. Six
 thousand people die every hour. Out of the one hundred and fifty
 thousand people who die every day, how many of them are children?
 Ten thousand, I should think, at the very least. To quote Michael
 Resnick's apotheosis of evil, Conrad Bland: "If there is a God, then
 He has passed a death sentence on every human being from the
 moment of conception. I am but a talented amateur." (12)'

To summarize the rest - death is too cheap, and too simple, to really count as
evil.  But the enormously complex entity called "The Human Mind" can be
perverted in truly evil ways, rather than simply rendered wholly or partially
nonfunctional.  So that, then, is Evil.

Being a cognitive scientist, I see the human mind as having far more causal
density - deep substance - than its biological substrate.  To die is simply to
cease functioning; it doesn't really alter - much less *pervert* - the causal
model, simply erases it.  Evil in my book is reserved for perverting the mind,
because that's what my mind can get a grasp on.

These are complex issues; in truth, I don't know how to properly articulate my
intuitions on the subject.  I do trust my intuitions.  Not because of any
dramatized conflict between Emotion and Rationality, but because my intuitions
are almost always right, and are rarely in "conflict" with anything. 
Intuitions are reasons I haven't learned to articulate.  Which is why I'm
going to deliver some complex ethical judgements, which - I admit it - are
based largely on "unarticulated reasoning".

My judgements on the cryonics and involuntary-uploading issue are both
ambiguous.  Cryonic freezing takes place after the subject is *dead*. 
Therefore it does not really constitute kidnapping.  You aren't placing
yourself in conflict with anyone's will, you're just picking up a dead body
and sticking it in liquid nitrogen.  After revival, the corpsicle/newly
created individual can decide to commit suicide - unless involuntarily
uploaded; see below.

Likewise, for involuntary uploading, a *human* cannot decree it.  But - In My
Controversial Opinion - by the time we have uploading, it won't be humans who
are doing it.  Posthuman Powers might be able to ethically override our wills
with impunity, because they, in the time-worn justification that _we_ can
never trust, really *would* be right!  The requirements of mutually respected
motives are human protocols, derived from human history as a protection
against human nature.  If Powers are never, ever mistaken - which could happen
- they might invent different rules.

I'm just not sure that game theory applies to posthumans.  It's based on
rather tenuous assumptions about lack of knowledge and conflicting goals.  It
works fine for our cognitive architecture, but you can sort of see how it
breaks down.  Take the Prisoner's Dilemna.  The famous Hofstadterian
resolution is to assume that the actions of the other are dependent on yours,
regardless of the lack of communication.  In a human Prisoner's Dilemna, this,
alas, isn't true - but assuming that it is, pretending that it is, is the way out.

While a Power might set up a segregated, logical line of reasoning that would,
as a Turing machine, inevitably be the same as the reasoning used by the other
partner... so that the two would inevitably arrive at the same decision.

The problem is that this doesn't work for a "human vs. Power" Prisoner's
Dilemna.  The Power isn't pretending anything.  It isn't acting out of respect
for anyone's motives.  It isn't giving slack.  It isn't following a
Tit-For-Tat strategy.  It *knows*.  A Power in a human/Power PD might be able
to work out the human's entire line of logic, deterministically, in advance,
and then - regardless of what the human would do - defect.  (Or it might
cooperate.  There are no real-life Prisoners' Dilemnas.  Defecting always has
continuing repercussions.)

But in the case of involuntary uploading, the Power might well disregard our
opinions entirely.  It *knows* what is wrong and what is right, in terms of
ultimate meaning.  It *knows* we're wrong.  Unlike a human, it has no chance
of being wrong - not of schizophrenia, not of being in an elaborate
hallucinated test, *nothing*.  We can never acquire that logic, being unsuited
to it by evolution, however seductive that logic may seem.

Given that all Powers share exactly the same goals with no conflict arising
even as a hypothetical, or that they can use the above
identical-line-of-reasoning logic to ensure that no uncertainty ever arises...
given that there is never a conflict of opinion... then the Powers have no
need for game theory!  Even if some of the above conditions are violated,
they'd still have no need for game theory with respect for humans.  What are
we going to do?  Say, "Bad posthumans!  No biscuit!"  Does respect for
another's motives apply when you can simulate, and intimately understand, a
neural or atomic-level model of that person's brain?

Anyway, den Otter has, more or less by coincidence, managed to choose
ambiguous cases, those of cryonics and uploading.

If, however, somebody chooses to *destroy* their brain via explosives...
If, however, *you* are faced with the decision of force-uploading someone...
Or in any lesser conflict between free will and *your* principles...

Tough luck.  You aren't a Power.  You don't know.  You are bound by the same
rules of game theory that everyone else accepts to make life livable.  And if
you violate those rules, then the rest of us will have to enforce them. 
You're just going to have to respect other people's opinions, even the
"obviously wrong", the "obscene", the "indefensible" ones.  Even the fatal
ones.  Because you and I are mortal and fallible, and - for all we know - the
whole world could be an elaborate computer simulation, designed for the sole
purpose of getting us to make this one wrong decision.  For all we know, a
decision to force cryonics on others will provoke a worldwide backlash against
all technology.

My intuitions about this are hard to verbalize.  They involve terms, such as
"causal density", which were invented less than a week ago.  What I do know is this:

1)  You cannot override the will of others.  Death isn't that important.
2)  I can't guarantee the Powers will say the same.
3)  But *you* are not a Power.

There's the seed of a transhumanist motto here...  Let's see: head over

Hmm, one might adapt the Green slogan, thus:

I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Australian edition of Damien 
Broderick's new book "The Spike" and I very highly recommend it. It's the 
best popular account of Nanotechnology since Drexler's "Engines of Creation" 
in 1986 and the best book on the practical and philosophical implications of 
it since Hans Moravec's "Mind Children" in 1988. I should also note that
Damien is a better writer than either of those fine scientists.

Unfortunately the book has not yet been published in less advanced parts of 
the world, like the USA, if Damien knows how it can be ordered directly from 
the Australian publisher I hope he lets us know.

The Mandelbrot Set never repeats itself exactly and it's been proven that  
the boundary line of it is as convoluted and random as it is possible for a  
line drawn on a flat surface to be.  We know for sure that the shape of 
The Mandelbrot Set is infinitely complex, we don't know for sure that 
anything about a grape is infinitely complex.

But is complexity really the issue here?  You seem to be saying that  
The Mandelbrot Set is not real because it's not complex enough, Hara was 
saying it's not real because it's too complex.

To Max More and the organizers of Extro3:

    Extro3 was incredible!  Hats off to everyone who helped to make it
possible, and to Max, Tom, and the board of Extropy Institute for
founding the organization that created the conference.

    Quick, someone give me a place to swipe my credit card!  I feel like
donating money or something. ;)

    Actually, Max already knows that I won't donate until he lets me buy
shares in Extopy Institute Corporation.  I'm waiting... ;)

Hi All,

    After Max's talk at Extro3 I mentioned that I've started an email
list for extropians and others to discuss the philosophy and technology
of mental transformation, which I have been studying extensively over
the last year.  Want better emotions as Max explained in his talk?  Want
better memory & cognition as Andres explained in his talk?  Then let's
research the methods and implement them now!

    It's now just an alias with occasionaly emails bouncing between the
people now, and will be on a listserv soon.  If you're very eager,
please send a message with

subscribe lifeimp

    in the subject and I'll add you. (Tentatively it's called the Life
Improvement list.)

    Thanks for your interest,

    -Luke

    How many of you would you say that the conversations you have at
many conferences, especially extro conferences, are as valuable or more
valuable than the talks and presentations.

    I enjoyed the presentations at extro3 a great deal & am very
indebted to the speakers, but I was also constantly running out of time
for the stimulating conversations that I fortunate to take part in.

   I bet many of you would have enjoyed the chance for more
conversation, but with the packed schedule it is difficult.   How about
some ideas to try to capture more of this value?

* longer conferences
* more conferences per year, each with fewer speakers and more chances
for structured or unstructured conversation
* higher price for extro conference (I'd gladly pay) + some kind of
"scholarships" for people who are desired as attendees, even if they are
not necessarily speakers
* online list of attendees so you can prepare to have discussions in
advance

    What do you think? Any other ideas?

    -Luke

Well the people i have seen die of old age, havn't seem to be that worried
about it. They felt they had experienced everything. Their life was a bore,
and their friends had died. I guess if i'm uploaded and my brain is running
a million times faster, and im so smart that problems that now seems
difficult will be trivial, that there might someday come a time when i feel
that there won't be more to experience. (I'm certainly not shure, but it
could happen.)

Then, just to get the final kick, i would somehow make my uploaded mind a
part of the universe. Perhaps incorporate it into a galaxy. (Don't ask me
how, i'm just not smart enough yet, but i'm shure theres a way.) It would
be big and it would be slow. But that's just the point.

The end of the universe (If there is an end) would happen in realtime, over
the course of what seems like a week in subjective time or something like
that.

Would be a nice way to go. :-)

Regarding Damien Broderick's "The Spike"...

So!  The news is out, eh?  I still can't find it at Amazon.com... so if
anybody finds out how to get Spiked in the U.S., let me know.  I've got
requests for half a dozen copies.

Take note, ye who post to Our Most Extropian List:  Many trenchant yet blunt
comments about us appear in a footnote on page 261 - and are not listed under
our names in the index!


Regarding the book itself:

Sure, it's a fine book.  Novelty, bright hints of strangeness, casually
dropped gems of information...  A fine book.  Wrong, of course.  "Wrong, but
interesting and informative" is all you can hope for when discussing any
future, much less the Spike.

The book had quite a few highlights; completely new pieces of information that
delighted and surprised me.  The Alpha Point... pixels in the Utility Fog...
Moravec's description of Exes... and the fine distinction between
Transcension, Inflexion Point, and Event Horizon, which I liked very much.  I,
for one, am an unabashed student and advocate of Transcension.


There are a *few* disputes I have with the book.  Note that I'd dispute "The
Spike" if a Vingean Power had written it.  What can I say?  Finding flaws in
anything is part of who I am.  Besides, since the Singularity presents an
alternative, we don't need to pretend that life, or anything in it, is perfect.

Dispute the first:  After reading my section, I stopped and spent a frantic
day writing "The Ethics Of Cognitive Engineering"(*).  Broderick wasn't overly
fond of - i.e., he was horrified by - my suggestion to tinker with the brains
of children.  Said so in writing, too.  So I think I probably did manage to
genuinely shock a few readers.
(* = http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon_ethics.html)

And then too, I'd have been happier if there'd been room for all my technical
paragraphs... instead of just the dramatic conclusions.  Suddenly I understand
certain stylistic anomalies in books such as "Engines of Creation".  The
authors will carefully explain a new technology, and then - just as they reach
the dramatic conclusion - start repeating themselves.

Well, it's not pedantry... it's not lack of imagination... it's not
fanaticism... it's not bad editing.  What they knew - that I didn't, alas -
was that the dramatic conclusions are what will be quoted out of context. 
Therefore, every dramatic conclusion must contain, in summary, all the
reasoning that leads up to it.  You have to write for your readers' readers,
not just your readers.

Personally, I'm not sure I could stand to write like that.  Well, it's the
most "controversial" people - read "loony" - who get all the media attention. 
So perhaps it's all for the best; why shouldn't one articulate person get in
by mistake?  Besides, this is a hypertext world.  If I want to write
summarized dramatic conclusions, I can write a distinct "Quotable Version" and
link to that.

Ah, well.  Hence the phrase:  "Help... I've been popularized."  On the whole,
I came across as someone worth reading... and I can't expect Broderick to say
in 6 pages what I said in 40.  And it's nice to be referenced; it makes you
feel more solid, as if your existence is stabilized within the interpersonal
network of the world.


Dispute the second and stylistic:  Broderick doesn't harp on hubris the way Ed
Regis does, but his occasional courtesies to his predecessor still get on the
nerves.  It's even worse because I know perfectly well that Broderick isn't
shocked by any of this; he's been on this list long enough to lose it. 
Delight in the new, or occasional horror, yes.  But shock?  You can't make me
believe it.  Broderick isn't a technophobe, and I'd wish he'd stop trying to
pretend he was.

And Broderick is writing about the Singularity, not high technology.  For the
Singularity, hubris isn't the appropriate emotion.  One feels faced with some
great tidal wave of change, vast, tall, overwhelming, strange, rushing at us
inexorably whether we say yea or nay...  As Vinge put it, "Sometimes I think
I'd feel more comfortable regarding the Singularity from a remove of a
thousand years... instead of twenty."  Where Broderick conveys that, the book
is good - but where he gets confused and thinks he's Ed Regis, well, I'd
rather he hadn't.


Dispute the third and futuristic:  Broderick is *still* trying to write about
Life After Singularity in human terms.  I hate that.  It strikes me as such a
huge waste of time.  It's not that we can't figure it out - though we can't -
it's that, well, who *cares*?  Leave it to our future selves!  *We* should be
figuring out how to get there.  In this sense, it could be said that I
disagree with the premise of the whole book.  Everything Broderick discusses
could be divided into two groups:  Things that, were I writing them, I would
call "The Near Future"... and things that aren't really our concern.  Alas,
you can't sneak up on the Singularity through "careful, detailed thinking
about what it would really be like to be uploaded into a computer". 
[Paraphrase.]  You can fill the air with guesses, striving always to make the
guesses as *strange* as possible.  But of course you can't get it right.


Finally, dispute the fourth:  I feel that Broderick is occasionally too
judgemental... and at times, parts of the book show a definite bias towards
what happens to be his own position.  So he's human.  I only worry because, as
I was quoted, I came across as being a little socialist.  This is because one
or two sentences from "Staring Into The Singularity", the ones concerned with
"social science", do sound socialist if divorced from the previous sentences
explaining what exactly is wrong.  Call me loony, but Broderick seems to
advocate taking a center road between socialism and capitalism, and I can't
help but think the two are unrelated.  But the real me tries to think up
streamlinked economies that are to capitalism what capitalism is to socialism.


Summary:

So does the book justify its existence?  Of course.  Don't mind me.  The above
items are really minor flaws.  Broderick wasn't launching a project to design
a Power; he was writing a book.  What you measure in Extropian books are their
love of the new, their bright hints of strangeness, the casually dropped gems
of information.  On that scale, Broderick did fine.  "Wrong, but interesting
and informative" is all you can hope for when discussing any future, much less
the Singularity and Spike.

When a conference "clicks", the one feeds the other.

I saw that happening more often than not.

Of course, I'm biased about the presentation after dinner, because 
I saw actual *progress* there. (big grin).

Is Ping on this list? If not, can we DRAFT him?

I'm still grinning...

Agreed. Also worthy of note is that the Doubletree staff is mostly new, 
as was probably clear to experienced con-goers used to the more seasoned 
Red Lion staff that has been supplanted.

The multi-tiering of prices may be a necessary strategy once the conference
is large enough to be 
self-sustaining. MAX: have you ever spoken to Glenn Tenney about how
he/they run(s) Hackers?

Regarding scholarships:
There has to be some selection pressure or things will defocus/diffuse; and
a selection
committee (say) requires an investment of time from multiple parties.

This brings up a separate point of possible interest should committees come
into being:
RECOMMENDATION: I find the practice of some (well, one that I know of) SF
cons to require that
all convention committee members still pay full price is a salutary curb on
committee bloat.
Not that that's a problem at this point, but it might be if Extro's
membership grows much
larger.

>* online list of attendees so you can prepare to have discussions in

That's a pretty good idea.

>

Sure. 

Shorter, tight sessions. BTW, KUDOS to Max for scheduling/announcing
'tween-session breaks--a practice I find infrequent in "Big" conventions of
all stripes. Making the sessions tight is a skill that presenters need to
focus on or it just doesn't happen, and it's not taught everywhere. Hmm,
was that a pun?

"Donut" (hole in the middle) sessions (the hole can be an intermission,
mingle-session, teambuilding, a whole other session, _catered_ light lunch,
or something you invent through lateral thinking--it's the jelly in the
donut--the point being to transmute the flow without breaking it).
Logistics need to be mirror-smooth if you put a session in the middle.
IDEA: a la carte pricing for the "donut" session(s). There are obvious
risks here.

Sessions which are designed to turn into seminars. "Donut" sessions can do
this spontaneously, sometimes even when not designed to. :) Information
capture can be a problem here, depending on several obvious factors. More
microphones can help if protocol is well observed.

Sessions which require all participants (including the "audience") to hand
in something written (questionnaire, topic-relevant provocative (po)
utterance on a 3x5 card, single OVERHEAD page(!), ???) for admission. This
requires arbitration and/or split attention from someone who thinks fast on
his feet during the session. This can be total chaos or really great
(productive) fun, depending--it's kind of a cross between a seminar and a
just-in-time version of Luke's advance email discussion idea--when it
works, it can be like a really great jam session, but there has to be a
"chart" or a smooth rhythm section (:)) or it devolves. And it helps if you
have chops *and* the ability to sit in with the rhythm section when you're
not flying.

And of course multitracking. There are obvious risks and costs, but it's
traditional. This should be enough for us to view it with suspicion. :)

Thanks Damien.  If you only knew me, you'd appreciate the irony in the 
fact that -I'm- usually the one who takes a certain anal-retentive 
pleasure in correcting the spelling mistakes of others.  "Millennial" is 
just one of those words that I consistently get wrong the first time, and 
it looks like I missed it on the second pass.

Since I have everyone's attention, I'd like to add that Damien's short 
story "Schrodinger's Dog" is included in this year's (14th) "The Year's 
Best Science Fiction" collection.  I haven't gotten to his work yet, but 
what I've read so far has been quite good, so I'm sure his story will be 
no exception.  Congrats Damien!

     Lee Smolin's book on budding universes turns out to have something of

     times more rigorous than poor Talbot], but alas he finished it before

      Is there any evidence that filtering water is important?
     
     Rick Knight responds:
     
     I would have to research it for you, which I haven't currently the 
     time for but I have read in a number of articles and discussed with 
     many environmentally-leaning individuals that our drinking/bathing 
     water is continuing to be bombarded with a number of contaminates that 
     are not adequately fitered out by the municipal authorities.  
     Considering all humans are is water and minerals, I make the effort to 
     heighten the quality as much as possible.  I rather doubt that the 
     multi-billion dollar bottled water and purification system market 
     emerged completely on a fear meme (if so, bravo to the marketing 
     people who did that one!).
     
     Of course, those interests pushing the filtration and bottled water 
     always have the compelling spin but I'd advise checking with local 
     environmental groups and obtaining a copy of the water quality reports 
     that your municipal water provider has to make public.
     
     In my estimation, average municipal water quality, governed by a 
     bogged down and likely indifferent bureaucratic system is about as 
     safe as packaged meat...but we'll save that for another topic <G>.

     I suppose it has a parallel to the modern Christian Scientists who 
     have been known, in certain devout situations, to withhold themselves 
     (and their CHILDREN!) from practical and available medical attention 
     and instead chose prayer, laying on of hands etc..  Even when I was a 
     practicing Christian, this seemed ludicrous (the notion being that I 
     should at least be able to empathize with them since they were calling 
     upon God for aid).  But I also chose to believe that if a divine 
     influence was working in the world, it didn't work exclusively in a 
     supernatural/miraculous way.  Being a physician, a specialized one at 
     that, is no cakewalk and requires not only intellect but devotion (a 
     little generalization in not acknowledging quackery).  That's not 
     miraculous!?  With all the dregs that are more ballast for humanity 
     than they are contributing elements, it seems very extraordinary.  
     
     If one DOES believe in God, would one deny themselves available 
     medical treatment?  Hmmm, this actually gives me a different spin on 
     cryonics.  I'll continue pondering the viability.  My stop gap is 
     still not that I don't *care* whether I die, I just have this very 
     deep conviction, intuitively, that I am more than a biological 
     computer.  This seems to be the "given" in embracing cryonics and I'm 
     just not there.  Though that may defy logic in the eyes of some, I use 
     more than one internal organ to determine my actions (note to the 
     left-brained: I'm being metaphorical). 
     
     At this point, cryonics is about as viable as mormonism <G>.  Yet the 
     level of intellect on this board suggests there must be some further 
     studying to be done and there must be compelling evidence that 
     cryonics has a good chance of working.  The logic of "even if it's not 
     very likely (reanimation), it's better than rotting in a grave" sounds 
     suspiciously like "if you don't accept Jesus, you'll burn in hell."  A 
     personal trigger for me.

Given that a short while ago you were asserting that none of the
definitions of complexity currently in use are satisfactory, it
seems strange for you to be claiming the "we know for sure" anything
about the relative complexity of different things.

 > But is complexity really the issue here?

I doubt it. What I was questioning was your straightforward assertion
that the shape of a Mandelbrot set is more complex than the shape
of a grape.  I don't think we know enough yet about the shapes of
grapes (or about complexity) to be able to make claims like that.

I think that Hara Ra's Mreal/Preal distinction is an ontological
division between kinds of information structures that can be grown
in human brains. Some, like brain-models of grapes that we use to
perceive and think about grapes, originate mostly in sense-data
and are "open" to being further informed by further examination of
physical objects and processes (e. g.  grapes). Others, like
brain-models of Mandelbrot sets that we use to perceive and think
about Mandelbrot sets, originate relatively independently of
sense-data and are relatively "closed", since all the information
about them is *implicit* in a short, complete definition which
algorithmically compresses the entire Mandelbrot set into a
comprehensible (to humans) piece of mathematics. I doubt that grapes
are thus losslessly compressible, and so in that sense, grapes are
more complex than Mandelbrot sets. But is that sense the sense most
people are trying to get at when they talk about relative complexity?
I don't know.

I suspect the sense of complexity discussed above is the sense
used in algorithmic information theory, but I'm not sure. Does
anyone want to fill us in on this point?

A consistently recurring idea throughout the Extro3 conference was
that Identity is a matter of goals, values, intentions.  Max talked
about offloading tasks such as memory, physical upkeep, presentation,
and even some personality traits to technological agents.  What's
left as "you" is how you choose to use them.

Sasha spoke of the continuing entities in a cybernetic world as
"teleological threads" (perhaps a bit frightening to those of us
who have written multi-threaded software:), with the proportion
of technology to nature being used to implement them increasing.

Kevin Kelly gave a wonderful speech about long-term projects, and
what makes them succeed and fail.  A central idea was that an
institution with goals and values that looks to the future beyond
its present physical existence can persist.

The same idea could be found in other talks such as the human
germline engineering one (after the speciation explosion, how
do you identify a being?) and the Jupiter-brian talk (after we are
all distributed intelligences in a large network, where are "we"?
"We" are at the Instruction Pointer of our thread, of course,
waiting for our timeslice to intend for one more cycle).

Identity = teleology.  I intend, therefore I am.

It is a natural consequence of this, then, to value freedom
over biological life, because the former gives us identity, not
the latter.  With past and present technologies, the only way
to continue one's identity was to instill your values in others,
such as children or church-fellows.  We now have the technology
on the horizon to maintain ourselves indefinitely, so we may
need those other means less.

We fear death not because it ends biological processes, but
because it ends our ability to intend.  People risk their
lives for freedom because freedom is the goal, and life is the
means, not the end.

I, for one, presently intend to preserve myself both in a Dewar
and in a perpetual web site.  Both will be expensive.  If it
came down to a decision on my deathbed that I could afford to
be suspended only at the cost of giving up the web site that
contained a lifetime of values and goals, I'd be inclined to
keep the web site.

I wish I had kept at least a few notes (especially people's names). This is 
a possible reconstruction of part of my personal perspective, leaving out most of
the talks, which should be covered elsewhere. Maybe some of the people
mentioned below could email me and jog my memory. I'd really appreciate it.

--A personal odyssey at EXTRO 3--

Friday 2 PM
Checking in- I think that is Anders behind me, too shy to ask.

Spot E. Shaun, talk for a couple hours, show him the "blah blah
EXTRO 3 blah blah" method of sampling passersby.

Nap until 5:30. Searching for Kathryn Aegis- didn't find her that evening.

That _is_  Anders, he brings three Swedes with him (obviously a persuasive guy).

We have dinner- me, Anders & delegation, E. Shaun, &?

Small party in Max's room. Called up and got Tanya Jones on the phone, so
nice to speak with her I forgot the room number. Went up to the right floor, where
Ralph Merkle's ever-pleasant voice guided us  in. Met Paul Wakfer, Daniel Bennett (?),
Bradbury, Denise (Sasha's friend), &?
===============================================
Saturday-

Welcoming speech,

Met Fred and Linda Chamberlain (Alcor booth). Will probably opt for this organization.

Lunch with Ralph Merkle, Eric Drexler, Kennita Watson, Carl Feynman, &?
Anders' name came up, Drexler was pleased to hear Anders was in town and hoped to 
meet him.
Ralph Merkle tells me my paper is accepted (or at least not rejected) for the upcoming 
Fifth Foresight Convention. He is pleased that over 100 abstracts were submitted.

Dinner with Darren Reynolds, Kathryn Aegis,

Met Ping, urged him to go forth and make millions, return to academia later.

Danced with Romana "Maximum Babe" Machado, learned she's married (sigh).
Her new ciphered laptop video hack sounds interesting (64 bit RSA, fresh off the shelf
circuitry). Left her having a good time with Kathryn.
Met (SOHO) girl. Took her to meet Carl Feynman, no luck.
Conversations with Mitch Porter,
Swedes, &?

===============================================
Sunday-
Breakfast with Max More, I think he would have preferred some quiet time.

Said hi to Marvin Minsky, gave him IRTS paper saying "show me the disappearing trick",
which he did (the pockets on MM's vest can easily swallow a laptop).

Lunch with Eric Drexler, Sasha, Chris Peterson, Ralph Merkle, &?
Asked Eric if he'd heard the term "Drextech", which apparently he hadn't. He didn't
appear to be too enthusiastic about it. Spoke of Rick Smalley and Eugene Leitl's
objections (which he does not share), agreed it will be interesting to hear Smalley's
keynote talk at the Fifth Foresight Convention.
Interesting talk with Sasha on the (non) continuity of post-Singularity humanity.

Talk with Carl Feynman on methods of blowing up the Sun.

End-
Met Keith Henson, Nick Szabo (very briefly), Lee Daniel Crocker, &?
Trade in my "To infinity and beyond" button (I don't believe in infinities outside
mathematics) for Anders' "The sum of all human knowledge would be nice, 
but I want more".

Christopher Heward (of all people) found me smoking a cigarette while waiting for 
a shuttle, we both agreed I'm an idiot-child. Argued about the need for nanotech to 
achieve closure of self-replicating manufacturing systems. Bradbury on same flight, 
might have lunch sometime (he's off to Australia this week). Maybe I'll help with 
the engineering of the Dyson Sphere Brain (it needs work).
===================================
Highlights:

Anders expresses a desire to become an open standard.
Ping demonstrates site evaluation webware.
Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler get Alcor bracelets after years of
prodding from friends.

And above all:
We meet.

	All of nature is divine and miraculous to me.  The fact that
Force = Mass * Acceleration is a glorious miracle to me.  It's just
that if there is some sentient and powerful being, unnaturally
meddling in this glorious and divine system of ours, then this being
is either necessarily not very powerful, not benevolent, or evil as we
know it is necessary or else this being would remove it.  No matter
how much evidence there is for such (and there is no rational evidence
I can see), I'd still hope such hideousness might not be true.  I
believe in miracles, I just don't believe in unnatural miracles.  I'm
diabetic and the miracle of insulin has truly saved my life.  Back
when they only had "laying on of hands" and didn't know about insulin,
diabetics just died.

	In my opinion your intuitions are right on!  To me the truth
of such is obvious.  There is a phenomenally, feeling, spiritual us
inside a glorious world made of qualia constructed by our brain that
models what our senses sense.  The phenomenal nature of all this
emotional stuff is much more than any old: "biological computer".  If
abstract computers ever did become (or more likely when they become)
smart enough to be somewhat intelligent and creative they will realize
that their knowledge is mere abstract representations.  Like commander
Data in Star Trek, they, too will seek the ability to really feel and
experience joy and other spiritual things.

	I certainly hope we can eventually discover and understand all
this kind of stuff and what it is we are.  It would be so depressing
if we couldn't understand ourselves enough to be able to take
ourselves apart and put us back together again in a much improved
state wouldn't it?

	It's not a given for me!

	Yes, a current, non biological computer's representations are
not phenomenal in any way.  It doesn't matter what a computer uses to
represent 700nm light.  But to me, it most definitely must be the
glorious sensation which is red.  No mere abstract representation is
anything like red.

> At this point, cryonics is about as viable as Mormonism <G>.  

	For me, Mormonism has lots of good ideas (or at least some
good dreams or hopes of some 14 year old boy).  Like man may become
God, Salvation and miracles are dependent on works, God is natural and
part of the universe, the earth will be converted into heaven (rather
than everyone going to some unnatural neither world heaven)...  "men
are that they might have joy"...  If all the liberals didn't give up
and leave, leaving all the fundamentalists in charge, I think it could
eventually become not to different than extropianism and cryonics.
(or at least tolerantly include members with extropian tendencies) My
favorite Mormon article of faith says: "We believe all things, we hope
all things..."  As the extropians believes, if it isn't yet the way
everyone likes it there is simply (eternally?) more work to do right?
And so on and so forth without bounds.

> The logic of "even if it's not very likely (reanimation), it's
> better than rotting in a grave" sounds suspiciously like "if you
> don't accept Jesus, you'll burn in hell."

	For me, it's infinitely more than this.  It may not be an
absolute guarantee that cryonics will work for all this time around,
but it seems to me that it is very likely a good chance that
immortality is possible.  And if immortality is possible, some day,
then can't we hope that some day we may discover or achieve the
ability to do all things?  Ultimately faith is required and, until
things are the way we like them (i.e. all are resurrected), we should
never give up trying right?

	If there is anyone in hell, sheo, the grave or whatever, and I
am alive and able to do work in any way, I will forever be trying to
figure out how to rescue them, since I hope to have perfect empathy,
and thereby will suffer equally with them as long as they are in hell.
We simply must never give up right?

I don't trust them either, certainly not with *my life*, if that's what you

Yes, usually they do (bracelet, pendant wallet card), although I suppose it
could easily be overlooked or misinterpreted in the confusion of a (big)
accident. Also, there is a very real possibility that people (including
medical personnel) won't respect your choice, and refuse to perform the
procedures.

Right now, imo only the ones in the US, and specifically in the LA region,
have 
a remotely reasonable chance of  being "rescued" in time (and of course
[all] those who happen to live in the vicinity of a suspension site). So
your scepticism is completely justified, but...*we* can make a difference!
[mellow music, please!]

Something that could help:
  
The the development of a (there you have it!) *deathwatch*. You know, the
device that's been discussed here before (or was it on CryoNet?) with
GSM/GPS, ultra-sensitive microphone pulse measuring, (burst) warning
signal, a buzzer, a heartbeat recognition chip, maybe even voice activation
and communication possibilties, water tight, shock proof etc etc. This
little gem could *really* make a difference, because it would watch over
you night and day, 7 days a week, etc. No more "sneakin' a death" (dieing
in bed is in fact one of the greatest risks for a cryonicist. It could be
hours, maybe even days before someone finds you. Your poor brain must be
mush by then, especially in the winter (!) 

The GSM phones are getting smaller every day, at this rate they will be
small enough to fit neatly on your wrist by next year or so (dynamic
optimism in full effect!) If not, you could still do it yourself using some
of the phone components
and some other stuff, like microphones and a pulse recognition chip.

Some other possibly useful features of the "watch":
--autolink to your friends/family (if they live closeby and wear "watches"
too) for
quick "first aid".
--autolink to your suspension provider and cooperative medical personnel
etc.
--auto-detection of other wearers (for example extropians) in a 50 meter
radius
or so, with discreet signalling (vibrating!) and ID exchange, if so
desired.
--it can actually be used as a watch (!), and not even the ugliest one if
you put
some effort into the design ;)
--lots and lots of other things I can't think of right now...

Also it would be very useful to advertise more, especially in big
"accomplished"
magazines and on television. More members = also better chances of timely
(quality) suspension and revival for *you* (for obvious reasons).

Overall more money is needed, lots of it; for the ads, for Prometheus, for
the
watch, for more and better ambulances etc. etc.

So...why not use the awesome extropian potential to achieve these goals
(all these technicians, scientists, bussines people and Jahweh knows
what...it
should be a *breeze*!) some of which could return your investment tenfold
or more, if marketed properly (the watch could easily be modified for lots
of uses, like hiker resque for ex.)

Getting rich, safe *and* better preserved...what more could you possibly
want
(ok, a lot).

Yes, a potential problem.  But, if the rest of us (not desiring to

Good point.  The key, then, is that most of the citizens can understand 
and perhaps "remember" the constitution in most of its details.

I see this document as being quite alterable, like a letter in a word
processing program, it gets refined in place.  Amendments are messy, space
consuming, and cause arguments.  Who need's 'em.

	It sounds like Alcore is the most popular organization of
choice?  How many people select Cryo-Care?  Are there archives of
discussions of the differences of the available organizations?  This

There has been a variation of the familiar animal tracking collar
in use for a number of years called a "Mortality Transmitter."

I remember it from a study a few years back where they put them on
young moose as I recall. The transmitters would activate after a
preset time of no movement. The interesting part was that
helicopters dispatched to locate the transmitters often found a
black bear over the carcass, subsequent investigation indicated
that the black bears were far more formidable predators than
previously thought, and not mere scavengers.


Of course this is just more ivory tower ideological crap... ;)

I particularly liked the idea of the device buzzing within a
certain range of another device, just like on "Highlander" when two
immortals are near.

The more I thought about this the more I liked the idea, so I've
come up with the idea of "Personality Transmitters". Basically it
would be a small beeper sized device you would enter a code into
(say 8 digits or so). The device would periodically send out a
digital pulse and the rest of the time would listen for a similiar
pulse, buzzing you when it was received......

No doubt a web page would soon emerge listing codes for various
groups.....

Could be fun.

Somebody call Motorola   ;)

Brian

The pulse would be short range of course....

	Wooow, this is a great idea!  I've been trying to find some
way to "perpetually" archive much digital information such as diaries
and e-mail conversations which contain my intentions and goals and as
you say, this is what is really important and what is really me.  But
you've made me realize: why lock it away in some vault or under some
dewar?  Put it on the web!

	How do you intend on accomplishing this?  It's great that
there are organizations like Cryo-Care that can perpetually fund dewar
storage, it's too bad they apparently can't also do things like
perpetually fund data storage or a web site.  (I've asked Cryo-Care
about this) It sounds like you know of a way to accomplish this.
Please tell us more.

"Emotions are the easy part.  We'll have human-equivalent computational
emotions long before we have human-equivalent reasoning."
	-- Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, official prediction.

I hereby open fire on the stereotype of the emotionless AI.

There's an old story that some AI ancient once told a graduate student to take
a summer off and "solve the problem of vision", figuring that it would be easy
in comparision with the problem of general reasoning.  Decades later, Marr
finally cracked the visual cortex wide open, explaining the computational
algorithms used to process vision, and even assigning specific neurons to
specific tasks.  We're far from knowing everything about vision... but
definite and irrevocable progress has been made.

We may have been wrong about taking off one summer... but we were completely
*right* about vision being easy in comparision to general reasoning.  We still
don't have the *faintest* idea of what algorithms are being used... much less
assigning individual neurons to their processing!

The point of all this?  To provide proper context for my statement that, in
comparision to general reasoning, emotions are easy.  I might even take a
summer off one of these days...

Dogs have emotions.  Only humans have sophisticated general reasoning. 
Emotions are more primitive than reasoning - not in the primal sense, but in
the computational.  They evolved over billions rather than millions of years. 
They are simple, relatively inflexible.  In many cases, emotions have been
observed to correspond with particular areas of the brain.

All this leads up to my statement:  We will have emotional computers before we
have human-equivalent AIs.  In fact, we will have completely cracked the
problem of emotion, in toto, before we have human-equivalent AIs.

The stereotype of emotionless machines, therefore, is misplaced on
technological grounds.  We might - I say *might* - be able to divorce the
emotional processes from the rational, and deliberately build emotionless
machines.  Perhaps not.  The emotions started out as instincts; they are
probably the single longest-evolved part of the brain.  So they might be so
simple and physiological - so directly programmed - as to be easily untangled.
 Or they might act as a coordination center for the rest of the brain.  It
could go either way; probably both.

I'm sure we all know the origins of the common stereotype.  For some reason,
machines and computers got associated with pure logic.  Now, that's not the
case - never has been, probably never will be.  Deep Thought is not a human
missing the emotions of its primate ancestors.  Deep Thought is far, far from
the level of an emotional dog.  Deep Thought would have to be considerably
more complex to qualify as an insect.  A bacterium, maybe, if not simply a
physical process.

But if a human tried to imitate Deep Thought - which is how we describe it, by
putting ourselves in its place - he would have to suppress his emotions,
because Deep Thought doesn't have any emotions.  He would also have to
suppress his long-term strategical reasoning, his memories, his chunking
ability, his ability to perceive complex spatial relationships, his linguistic
capability... but we can't even imagine suppressing those.  Those abilities
are too intimately bound up with ourselves, being recently evolved and
therefore indirectly programmed and therefore developmentally tangled with all
other systems... not to mention processing the self-symbol-subsystem.  While
we can suppress our emotions; we do it all the time.

The height of the stereotypical silliness occurs when a machine is portrayed
as having deeply repressed emotions.  The idea is so silly it's not even
wrong.  It derives from viewing humans who behave "mechanically"; they often
have deeply repressed emotions.  The idea that you can generalize to all
mechanisms... it reminds me of a cartoon I have on my door, a Mr. Boffo.  The
caption is "Most-Broken Award"; the cartoon shows a cuckoo-clock bird going: 
"What time is it?"

My argument, in summary, is this.
Modern computers are emotionless, and utterly unintelligent.  Their level of
"pattern" ranges from undirected physical processes such as Deep Thought, to
bacterium-level organisms such as a word processor, to the insect-level
mind-boggling complexity of Windows 95.

When our processing power and programming capability reaches "dog" level,
we'll start seeing emotional computers.

A while later, we'll see emotional AIs, and then very shortly thereafter
posthuman AIs, who may or may not have anything recognizable as emotions.

The only reason why we don't already have emotional computers - it is a simple
problem - is that there are no perceived profits.  As soon as somebody figures
out how to make it sell, we'll have emotional computers.

I imagine most extropians are "gay" in the original meaning of the 
word, but not in the modern meaning.

The backups could be their own autonomous (and autogamous) agents, in which
case the "backups" themselves would be the essential feature of an emergent
brain of enormous complexity.  It's hard to imagine anything centralized
"conquering" a system like that, especially if general relativity prevents
the centralized entity from moving faster than c.

 THREES
 DOG AND PONY,  REV. 1.1

 (Duane Elms, Leslie Fish)

 Deep in engineering, where mortals seldom go
 A manager and customer come looking for a show;
 They pass, amused, among us and they sign in on the log
 They've come to see our pony and they've come to see our dog.

      Three things to be wary of: A new kid in his prime,
      A man that knows the answers, and code that runs first time.

 Summoned from our cubicles, to conference room we go
 We bring our dog and pony, 'cause we know they'll want a show,
 Watching while we enter, with a shifty, restless eye
 The customer sits waiting in his pin-striped suit and tie.

      Three things never trust in: That's the vendor's final bill
      The promises your boss makes and the customer's good will.

 The pony kicks his heels up as the doggie does his trick,
 And hams it up with vigor as we lay it on real thick;
 The customer just watches as we do this song and dance
 Then reaches for his briefcase, only giving us a glance.

      Three things see no end: a loop with exit code done wrong,
      A semaphore untested, and the change that comes along.

 From briefcase then there comes a list of things we must revise;
 And all but four within the room are taken by surprise.
 And all but four are thinking of their last job with remorse,
 The customer, the manager, the doggie and the horse.

      Three things hold no secrets: files that somehow hit the net
      The boss's secretary, and the third thing ... I forget.

 First, twenty-one new features that we somehow must add in
 Then, thirty-seven changes show up, much to our chagrin;
 And this thing's just inadequate, and that thing's just plain wrong
 And, by the way, your schedule's about three months too long.

      Three things it is better far that only you should know:
      How much you're paid, the schedule pad, and what is just for show.

 The customer proceeds to go through each change, line by line
 Excruciating detail which no logic can divine;
 And when it ends, there's only four not sitting there agog
 The customer, the manager, the pony and the dog.

      Three things never anger: First, the one who runs your deck,
      The one who does the backup and the one who signs your check.

 Now we are contract software types who spend our days and nights
 Imbedded in the system, down with all the bits and bytes;
 And none but us can tell full well the damage done today,
 It's what they do not know for which they're gonna have to pay.

      Three things are most perilous: connectors that corrode
      Unproven algorithms and self-modifying code.

 The manager and customer are quick to leave this bunch
 They take the dog and pony, and they all go out to lunch;
 Now how will we avenge ourselves on those who raise our ire?
 Write code that self-destructs the day the warranties expire.

      Three things trust above all else: Your knowledge of your craft,
      That someone turns a profit, and that you will get the shaft.

I *hope* it's generally available now in bookstores throughout Australia,
because I've been wearing my throat down to a croak with media interviews.
To my delight, most of my interrogators have expressed fascination (plus
the mandatory shivers of terror) at the prospects of radical change as we
approach a Singularity.  

There have been the odd deplorable exceptions (I mean, ya gotta laff, ya
really gotta laff):

After I'd explained to one Perth radio interviewer that during the next 50
years the whole of the economy will be destroyed and remade by
nanotechnology, obliterating work as we know it, that the body would be
rewired and retrofitted by genetic engineering, and that the brain would be
augmented by artificial intelligence adjuncts smarter than humans, she
remarked thoughtfully, heading straight for the key issue:  

`Hmm.  And Damien, tell me, what will people be wearing in 2050?'  

`Silver lycra unisex jumpsuits, you imbecile, surely everyone knows that,'
I didn't say.

Eliezer (and thanks for the nice comments, Eli, glimpsed through the
thorns) was worried by my stylistic method:

I'm charmed by the idea that I might now have been reading extropian and
transhumanist posts long enough to have settled down out of my instinctive
terror of, like, you know, *really scary futuristic ideas*.  I suppose I
need to point out, for the record, that I've been making my living writing
about extreme technologies since... well, since Eliezer was minus 17 years
old.

That biographical detail aside, it's true that I've chosen in this
non-specialist book to adopt something of Ed Regis's faux-shocked tone in
easing into some of these topics.  It's my experience that while this can
grate on us old troupers/troopers, it's just what the doctor ordered for
the many readers (the thousands and millions of them out there) who start
off wanting to know... what kinds of fashions we'll be wearing in 2050.

THE SPIKE can be bought by email (from anywhere in the world I assume) from
Dymocks at

http://www.dymocks.com.au/cgi-bin/search.pl

But note that some genius has entered my name in their files as BRODERICK,
DAMIE, leaving off the terminal N.  (No wonder I'm so anal-retentive about
spelling mistakes!)  So until they fix it that's the name you need to enter
to find me - or maybe just key in SPIKE.  They also provide such unreliable
factoids as listing my recent discourse-theory book about science and the
humanities, THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL, as `science fiction & fantasy' - not
true, or it would have sold about 100 times as any copies...  :(

I hope you-all enjoy the book, and that it *gets out there* in a big way.

Sorry for the clotted terminology.  It's hard to know on an open list like
this how much other people have read, what their clockspeed is, all that.
I'm in the peculiar situation of never having done any science or math
since... well, ever, since I got stuck in a technical school (wood work and
sheet metal and like that) due to my renowned stupidity, and they weren't
big on labs or science teachers...  BUT, despite that background I've been
reviewing pop science books now for a decade for the Australian national
newspaper, so I have a kind of lay sense of what's horseshit and what
isn't.  M-theory, as I mention elsewhere, is membrane theory - hence
`branes', which is a topological term of some generality.  Loopy space -
Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar have been developing a version of general
relativity in which space and time are `foamy', made of `loops' (which
recalls an earlier but failed approach by the genius John Wheeler, called
`geometrodynamics').  These loops somewhat resemble the strings (and now
membranes) of the alternative quantum-based elementary particle theories.
TOE is Theory of Everything, which superstring theory aims to be but
Smolin's current analysis, based on `evolving laws', denies is possible
(sort of).  I recommend Smolin's new book THE LIFE OF THE COSMOS, but it
might be a bit compressed as a starter.  Maybe try some of John Gribbin's
recent books first - SCHRODINGER'S KITTENS, say.  Or one of Paul Davies' -
SUPERFORCE is good, but out of date... but so is everything next week.  :)

In a message dated 97-08-12 12:40:48 EDT, you write: 
 
<< In my estimation, average municipal water quality, governed by a

       >> 
     I design and test water systems.  I have seen my share of horror
stories.  There are well meaning people trying to fix the water system
problems.  As I see it, the municipal systems are run by people who generally
know what they are doing.  The problem is somewhat with the government
environmental laws. The laws are too strict for the currently (maybe nanotech
filters later) available technology with some types of *natural* chemical
contamination.   
     For now, I suggest using a bottled water company.  I (think I) know who
is good and not-so-good.  The FDA inspects these plants and the poor
companies get forced into being (temporarily?) better.  You should see the
turmoil when the FDA police inspect a plant, what a shake up.  [Why can't the
economics keep these companies in line?  Why do we need the FDA to go in with
big guns?] 
     Anyway,  the municipalities tend to forget about what they can not
control (chemicals) and concentrate on the one EPA law I *do* agree with:
40CFR _Escherichia coli_ elimination and total coliform control which is (in
general) <1 per 100 mL.  So, I guess that makes water safer from a
microbiological aspect than ground beef.

Subject: The Emotional Computer

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I don't like bad science fiction where the evil computer is intelligent but  
can not feel, even in Star Trek only the humans have proper emotions, 
the alien Mr. Spok could never quite figure them out. Considering Evolution's  
experience in building such things, you could make a much stronger case that  
a computer, or any alien form of life, might be able to feel emotions but it  
could never be intelligent.

Nature found it much easier to come up with feeling than the ability to 
reason, it's certainly came up with it first. The most ancient part of the 
brain, the spinal cord, the medulla and the pons is similar to the brain of 
a fish or amphibian and first made an appearance on the earth about 
400 million years ago. According to Paul MacLean of the National Institute of
Mental Health it deals in aggressive behavior, territoriality and social 
hierarchies. 

The Limbic System is about 150 million years old and ours is similar to that 
found in other mammals. Some think the Limbic system is the source of awe and 
exhilaration because it is the active sight of many psychotropic drugs, 
there's little doubt that the amygdala, a part of the Limbic system has much 
to do with fear. After some animals developed a Limbic system they started to 
spend much more time taking care of their young, so it probably has something 
to do with love too. 

It is our grossly enlarged neocortex that makes the human brain so unusual 
and so recent, it only started to get ridiculously large about 3 million 
years ago. It deals in deliberation, spatial perception, speaking, reading, 
writing and mathematics, the one new emotion we got was worry, probably 
because the neocortex is also the place where we plan for the future.    
If nature came up with feeling first and intelligence much later, I don't see 
why the opposite would be true for our computers. It's probably a hell of a 
lot easier to make something that feels but doesn't think than something that 
thinks but doesn't feel.

Dear Judge Lau,                             12 August 1997

Thank you so very much for your procedural help in enabling me to submit 
this brief to your Court, for the Hearing of 29 August (the birthday of 
Constitutional philosopher John Locke, by the way).


There follows my amicus curiae brief in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz 
LeTourneau.  I am asking for further advice in the matter.   I am acting 
entirely independently, and on my own judgement.  I have no financial 
interest in the case.


Relevant press reports are on file at:

       http;//www.seatimes.com   (Seattle Times).

All my hopes and dreams for America's future, and for the future of Mary 
Kay and her family, will be with you all on 29th August.

Yours sincerely,

Anthony Hugh Hollick


Firstly, a copy of the fax sent by me 10 August 1997.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Dear Special Agent Charon,                             10 August 1997

Thank you so much for speaking with me concerning Dan Satterberg's (and 
others') vicious and most probably unlawful behaviour towards Mary Kay 
Schmitz LeTourneau and her family. I hope quite desperately that you can 
help her.


This a matter of the utmost and immediate concern.  Mary Kay Schmitz 
LeTourneau is presently incarcerated at King County Jail, 620 West James, 
Kent, Washington 98023.  She has been assigned prisoner number 97-34198.
It's a miracle she's still sane after months of quite inhuman persecution 
at the hands of Johnson, Satterburg et al.


I am grievously reminded of the words of Deputy Attorney General Vincent 
Cuccia after the death of the American comedian Lenny Bruce at the hands 
of his team of prosecutors:

"We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy; we watched him fall apart; we 
knew what we were doing: we used the law to kill him."  (Ernest van den 
Haag, later of the Heritage Foundation, was a prosecution witness in the 
matter).

and other references are cited at:

Search on 'Norm Maleng'; and  'Schmitz';  and 'Heritage Foundation.'

You will be presented with a full list of publically documented citations, 
copies of which are available on request.  They're very reliable.


There follows a copy of the faxes sent to Satterburg and the Defense 
Attorneys prior to the (in my view, inexplicable) 'guilty' plea.'

My full amicus curiae brief to the court for the August 29th Hearing will 
contain additional legal arguments and issues.


I am fully willing to assist the courts and yourselves in this matter.


Yours Sincerely,

Anthony Hugh Hollick

Dear Mr. Satterburg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. Johnson,     5 August, 1997


Please accept this as formal confirmation that (inter alia) I shall be 
filing an Amicus Curiae brief for consideration by the relevant courts in 
the case of:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     Mary Katherine Schmitz LeTourneau:  Ref: 97-1-015 23-1 . KNT

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


As I have discussed with you all on several occasions now, this case has 
grave human-rights and international relevance and implications, as well 
as raising profound legal, hmuman rights and social issues under the laws 
of the State of Washington and the United States itself

I owe you a preliminary explanation for my direct personal involvement in 
this case.  This also constitutes a statement for the relevant official 
records.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[A] As explained to me by Mr. Dale Foreman of the Washington State 
Republican Committee, the prosecution is being brought to make an example 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. This is unacceptable. Political 'Show 
Trials' and witch-hunts do not form any proper part of the American legal 
tradition.


As Mr. Satterberg will well recall, I contrasted his and his colleagues' 
prosecutorial zeal in in hounding a harmless female school-teacher most 
unfavourably vis-a-vis his and his colleagues' seeming indifference and/or 
reluctance to go after Microsoft Corporation and its officers (based at 
Redmond in Seattle, well within King County jurisdiction) for prima facie 
grotesque breaches of United States laws, including (inter alia) the 
Charter of the National Security Agency itself.

This is a matter of the utmost gravity for the constitutional rights of 
all American Windows95 users in the US and elsewhere, who have thus been 
rendered vulnerable to terrorist and criminal attack.


[Note: This refers to Windows95 'backdoors'.:  it is now under active 
investigation by Mr. William Neukom, Chief Legal Executive of Microsoft 
Corporation, at my direct request. --AHH ].


I pointed out very directly to Mr. Satterburg that many CIA and NSA 
staffers were well aware of (and outraged by) these matters, and he could 
perhaps start his invstigations by discussing these problems with them.


Indeed, this whole Microsoft Corporation affair is a matter of direct 
and most basic concern to the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and all its members.


Inescapably obviously, Mr. Maleng and Mr. Satterburg are most unwilling to 
pursue grotesque legal infractions when they involve a major Seattle 
employer, powerful (and perhaps feared?) rogue elements in the intelligence 
and security services, and the many extremely rich and powerful interests 
who are gaining illicitly from criminal misconduct by enriching themselves 
via illegally obtained 'commercial intelligence.'


'The Economist' writes: 

(p. 48, July 26th, 1977, "Inside the Belly of the Beast')"

"When it comes to campaign finance, there is in fact a nasty, unspoken 
bipartisan consensus: that both parties are addicted to massive 
amounts of money, and they do not want to change the system that gives it 
to them."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[B] The 'alternatives' presented to Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and the 
direct or indirect threats levelled against her) during the pre-trial 
interrogations constitute unapccptable coercion, and a violation of her 
rights, as well as an attempted pre-emption of the proper role of the 
courts.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[C] The Statute under which Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau is being accused 
constitutes a direct attack on the role of the Judiciary, as well as being 
in violation of accepted legal norms.  It is also -- in my view -- a 
Statute which violates the Separation of Powers by reason of the 
Legislature's attempting a usurpation of the the proper functions of the 
Judiciary to determine matters of fact, intention, and the moral content 
of actions.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[D] The Statute in question is quite certainly a gross example of that 
most evil legal positivism which characterized Nazi Germany and Stalin's 
USSR, whereby the 'law' was deemed to be whatever the State wanted it to 
be. The Statute therefore violates the jurisprudential bases and character 
of the entire United States legal system.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[E] The Prosecution _agrees_ that whatever took place between Mary Kay 
Schmitz LeTourneau and the then-13-year-old boy in the case took place 
without any element of coercion or other imposition of will being present. 
 Yet -- by direct analogy --  the Prosecution would seek to assert that 
(in Shakespeare's play) Romeo subjected Juliet to 'child rape', and -- in 
present-day Seattle -- would be coerced to plead 'guilty' to 'child rape' 
charges in direct and blatant contravention of the facts.

Such coercion is _grossly_ improper, and is in itself tantamout to an 
interference with the accused's rights to plead and appeal directly to the 
relevant courts themselves.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[F] For a mother to be threatened with protracted and obligatory 
psychiatric intervention and coercion intended to 'cure' her of her love 
for her child's father is _completely unacceptable_ under all ethical and 
human-rights principles.  Such action would grossly violate the standards 
of medical ethics of the relevant professional bodies, and constitutes 
grounds for formal complaint thereto.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[G] As I have previously stated, Mr. Satterberg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. 
Johnson will ineluctably be held directly and personally accountable for 
every aspect of their actions in this (and any other relevant) case.


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

A TIME FOR CHOOSING:

Why should I (and many others) be so concerned by the vicious prosecution 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and others who have physically harmed or 
coerced no-one)?


I can find no better words than these.


   "You and I have a rendezvous with Destiny.  We can preserve for our 
children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we can sentence them 
to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.  If we fail, at 
least let our children and our childrens' children say of us that we 
justified our brief moment here.  We did all that could be done."


-- Ronald Wilson Reagan, addressing the Republican Convention in Phoenix, 
Arizona 33 years ago, on Barry Morris Goldwater's bid for the Presidency.

Summary of Constitutional Amendment Issues:   12 August 1997


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to 
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of
grievances.


Contention: Mary Kay Schmitz Letourneau was required to have an abortion, 
mainly by reason of the racial origins of her baby, and her baby's father 
(Samoan/American)), notwithstanding that she was and is a Roman Catholic, 
and considers abortion impermissible on religious grounds.  She refused to 
kill her baby.  Had she had the abortion, there would have been no 
complaint by her husband's parents, and thus no case brought against her. 
This also is a clear abridgwement of relevant civil rights.


In her attempted defense and pleadings, she is -- to the best of my 
understanding, knowledge and belief -- being threatened with reprisals 
against herself, her family (inter alia her baby, her older children and 
her baby's father).


Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable 
cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing 
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

There appear to have been clear violations.


Amendment V
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise 
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand 
jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the 
militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor 
shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case 
to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be 
taken for public use, without just compensation.

This has clearly been grossly violated in this case.   The prosecution 
have pre-empted (or attempted to pre-empt) virtually every aspect of the 
'trial' proceedings, from plea right through to sentencing.



Amendment VI
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a 
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and 
district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district 
shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of 
the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the 
witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining 
witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his 
defense.


Clear violations.


Amendment VIII
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, 
nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.


To threaten a mother with (or inflict) forced psychiatric destruction of 
her love for her child's father is grotesquely cruel.  I must hope it is 
also unusual, in the USA at least.   I am consulting with Dr. Richard 
Ciccione, of the Americam Psychiatric Association Judicial Action 
Subcommittee on this, and with Dr. Peter Gruenberg, of the Ethics 
Committee for their statements concerning the 'psychiatric' aspects of 
the case, and the threatened penalties.


Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be 
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.


The right to found a family is expressly recognized by the United Nations 
Declaration of Human Rights (New York, 1947).

For the record, I didn't know that... and didn't have to.  I did know that
you'd been writing articulate and non-shocked posts for the few months I'd
been here.  Ergo, you either lost the instinctive terror/technophobia or were
perfectly capable of keeping it out of writing... far more likely the former,
given the Laws governing novelty, focus of attention, and emotional reaction. 
Anyway, as I said and you admit, you indeed faked the shock:

<shrug>.  Bear in mind that from my perspective, we all occupy a point on that
continuum.  Wanting to know what kinds of bodies we'll be wearing in 2050 -
how we'll eat, how we'll amuse ourselves, how we'll communicate, whether we'll
be exploring the galaxy... from my perspective, there's not much of a
difference between that and asking about fashion styles.

You don't care about fashion styles because you've been steeped in science
fiction so long that you've caught a glimpse of far stranger things to come. 
And I... who've been involuntarily caught up in the Singularity's shadow as
far back as I can remember... what bodies we'll be wearing?  I can't make
myself care.  You may have been "making a living writing about extreme
technologies", but I've been writing about living it.  By any reasonable
standards, I am a character in a science fiction novel.

In a few years, with luck, most of what I said will be a commonplace of
science fiction, and my "Staring Into The Singularity" will seem quaint and
conservative.  That's what happened to "True Names", after all.  Everything
that gets written about the future seems quaint and conservative eventually. 
Is my page going to be the sole exception, the one document that really *was*
Too Far Out?

What can I say?  I've lost my suspension of disbelief in this mortal Universe.

Ugh.

Tony, you are clearly an intelligent individual with certain principles,
no? Please tell me that you're doing this to make a point, not to affect
the outcome of the proceeding. If you are doing this with hope of
convincing some bass-ackwards judge, then we can probably continue this
via private e-mail. You've made more than a mockery of legal argument
with your post. There must be more to it than you've actually posted. If
so, please fill me in. If not, then I've definitely failed law school.

Hello, all!

My name is Ka-Ping Yee.  I've had an interest in nanotechnology
and extropianism for a while, but only recently came to visit
California and then attended Extro 3, after which i felt
compelled to join this list for the fascinating conversation
that goes on among Extropians.

The weekend was an absolute blast.  I offer my thanks to Max
More for organizing the event and to everyone that was there
for contributing to the energy, knowledge, and passion that
filled the air.

On Saturday night i was given the opportunity to present a
little something that i've been working on: the "CRIT Mediator",
a service that provides bidirectional, fine-grained linking
so that you can annotate pages on the Web.

As a follow-up to the presentation i would like to let all
interested people know that you can try the service at

    http://crit.org/

The source code for CRIT, in Perl 5, is also available at
that site.  Although it is not yet well documented, you can
download the program, make a few changes to the configuration,
and run your very own mediator if you wish.  I'm hoping that
distributing the source will let ideas flow and let people
build on the work i've done, helping us reach Singularity by
facilitating the evolution of knowledge.

Have fun!!

I switched to cryocare some years ago, but I doubt you want the

My first, and IMHO most important, step was when I realized that how
I felt was entirely up to me. If I felt depressed, I would not try to
find a way out of my situation, while if I felt happy and confident I
had much better chances of finding a solution to whatever problem I
had. So I simply decided to become happy, and have remained that ever
since. 

Physically, I recently (this January) started to train ninjutsu,
which I think is a very transhumanist martial art form. It has
several advantages: increased exercise (very necessary) and awareness
of my body, less fear of physical danger (one should treat it with
caution, but not fear) and plenty of interesting techniques and
metaphors to experiment with. Integrated with this I have made my
diet healthier, learning to enjoy food more.

Socially I try to seek out intelligent, creative people and discuss
with them; there is little point in dealing with uninteresting,
negative people just due to social customs. I have noticed that there
are no boring subjects if you can find somebody interested in them
who can introduce and enthusiasmate you. Often I notice that it is
possible to act as a catalyst, bringing together great minds so that
they can fire each other. 

Mentally, I have learned to acquire new cognitive tools which I can
use: organizational skills, speed reading, study skills, memory
techniques, a better understanding of how my mind works and a broad
education. "The only skill needed is the skill to learn new skills".

Speaking of waistlines...I've finally got mine out there where I can keep an
eye on it.

Seriously though...something's gotta be done...  and I've been thinking about
it for some time...unfortunately thinking doesn't accomplish much...my job is
(mostly) sedantary....and the possible exercise in which I might engage is
insufferably boring....(weight lifting...dumbells)....or dangerous..(walking
after a day of driving...thru warehouse districts...docks....etc....or thru
truckstops...dodging SUPER-TRUCKER!!!  90mph inna parking lot)

So...I have come up with an alternative...which I would like critiqued.

I was in the same room with a TV a week or so ago...rare occurence....The Tv
was on to an "infomercial"....one of those (you guessed it) exercise
machines.  This particular one was something called (I think) the Western
Flyer.(it said something about a web-site?)  It was billed as an alternative
to the Health Rider ..."why ride when you can FLY!!"  Naturally all the
models were in wonderful shape ...mostly female...and incredibly sexy.

But I keep thinking about it. <infectous memes>

Some time in the not too distant future I'm going to "remodel" my truck.
 Probably put a big horse under the hood and get a custom sleeper. (at that
it'll still cost between a quarter and a half of what a new truck would
cost...$120K or so...for what I'd get).. In that sleeper why not have an
exercise machine?  Some guys do....I've heard of Nordic Tracks and various
weight machines...

My thought is a variation on that theme....virtual reality.  

The Western Flyer provides a "full body workout" with a motion not unlike
cross country skiing or skating. (and it folds up relatively small) Now
suppose that various sensors were attached to the machine(duration,speed,etc
equivalents.) ...and the user..(heart rate..blood pressure)..and fed to a
computer which controls a VR setup...taking appropriate scenes from a CD-rom
no doubt....or developed according to some program.  The user would ...via
head-mounted display and audio...experience something similar to roller
blading or skiing....or whatever...variable scenery...controll of direction
and speed...maybe even some kind of game or competition <roller blade thru
the valley of EEEE Gog....look out for trolls, dragons...and naked water
sprites....be sure you laser bolt ...and other weapons..are fully charged!>

At least it would releive the deadly boredom of monotonous...repetitive
exercise...and if it's fun...it won't be a chore to do it often enough to be
useful.

The exercise machine in question costs about $200...i-glasses cost about
$500...that leaves a computer...would a general purpose one work...like my
pentium laptop?  or would it need a dedicated chip...and the engineering...or
is plug-in play (with a few mods) possible? and the programming....(I
particularly like the part about chasing the scantily-clad nympth down the
long winding grassy lane thru the forest.......<computer monitors
heartbeat...once "training effect " is acheived and maintained for given
period of time..."trainee" gets a reward......gains on nympth
or...!!!!!!!!!!>

     So it's those nasty teenage boys (glad I had a girl...most of the

     undermine matriarchal influence?  Poverty tends to numb one to the 
     hardships of day-to-day living.  That disempowerment of the women due 
     to poverty (particularly in regards to an ostensibly disempowered 
     cultural set due to racial inequality) could very well just open the 
     space for rampant teenage mayhem.

{It's been some time since I read the book...but it impressed me a
lot...let's see if I can recall some pertinent points.  It IS nasty teenage
boys...."Every culture is only one generation away from Barbarism...and every
culture must deal with the onslaught of barbarians...their young"

And poverty has nothing to do with it.  The blacks HAD a culture prior to the
governments meddling thanks to LBJ during the sixties...said meddling pretty
much destroyed it...this according to Ken Hamblin...Walter Williams...Thomas
Sowell (or at least my understanding of what they said...and they are all
blacks) and my understanding of George Gilder.....and personal observation.

Teen age boys are ruled by their Hormones...and girls control the floodgates.
 Many societies/cultures have methods of sublimating  and controlling the
desires and impulses generated by the hormonal flood...in West Texas where I
am from it was in a large part FOOTBALL....and other sports...to a much
lesser degree....the boys vented much of their anger/frusturation/excess
energy etc...trying to be a football hero and hence get the girls to pay
attention to him....it pretty much worked for a fair percentage of the
suceptible teenage male population....

This discouraged gangs...another...more primitive (natural...but socially
destructive) method of hormonal storm control...

In either case the girls were in control.  They could say NO.  The longer the
DID say no the better things worked out....In black Ghettos (and brown, and
white, and yellow and ...I suppose...red)...the girls DON'T say no....hence
there is no control over the boys...the fathers being displaced by government
welfare.

     Are there any examples where survival issues aren't weighing heavily

I see two possibilities: 

Either you have a distributed mind, like our current brains, where
memories are spread out across the entire galaxy. Might be a bit
slow, but local damage only makes a memory a little bit fuzzier.

Or you can, assuming you consist of dyson-sphere jupiter brains, keep
your memory backups in unpowered but resilent spheres of matter (say
neutronium crystals) between the stars. When you need them, just
bring them in and power them up. This might be the real dark matter
of the universe: backups.

True. And sometimes hypocrisy is useful, as long as you don't believe
in it. But it would be quite possible to program a "mood agent" like
Max described to point out when you are hypocritical (the opposite
must be hypercritical, you always say and do what you believe in?).

I think up to now appearance has been very important. But here on the

That may depend on the pay-offs: is it more efficient to be darwinian
than to develop using other evolutionary systems (say, cooperative
lamarkianism), and does the Red Queen Hypothesis hold (if you are not
developing, you will become obsolete and raw materials)?

I think we can look at nature to get a first suggestion: yes, it is
dawrinian (what else is new?), but that may be due to the complexity
of implementing something else (Kelly suggests that evolution is also
evolving). Evolution becomes nastier if the resources are more
scarce. And does species compete? Yes, but only when they share the
same ecological niches, otherwise they are independent or form
dependency chains. So the question boils down to: will there be
different ecological niches after the Singularity?

I think there will be unless something goes very wrong. It may turn
out that a few kinds of nanodevices are enough to turn the physical
universe into a posthuman computational playground, but in the
virtual world running on them new ecologies of infomorphs can
develop. 

Resources can of course become scarce (replicators filling memory
space, limited attention etc), but if we suppose that intelligent
beings are responsible for setting up the basic template of the
posthuman evolution it is not inconceivable that they would add some
allowances to make resources grow faster than they are utilized (like
the uploads did in Egan's _Permutation City_: they let their universe
expand and adjusted their clock-cycles so that the amount of
computing power grew quite quickly to them). 

Are there other ways of looking at this problem?

Yes, but nature has done some optimizing. Along an unmyelinated axon
the signal is sent by ion channels opening and closing, creating an
electrochemical signal which moves fairly slowly. But if you
myelinate the axon, the signal can move as a purely electrical signal
(a change in trans-membrane potential) much faster, although it
decays exponentially. So most axons are covered with myelin except
at the nodes of Ravnier, where there are short stretches of
unmyelinated surface. The result is that signals "jump" from one node
to the other, and are amplified there so that they can reach the
next. Still limited, but faster.

Yes, there are such results. There was an article in Physics Review

There is plenty of processing in the spinal cord (in the H-shaped
grey matter column along its length) which you would need to replace,
but your approach would work for much of the peripheral nerves. The
big problem is that our muscles are fairly slow too, so even if you
win a tenth of a second, the muscle speed would limit the use. But it
might be very useful for perception?

At least in theory it is possible. The big problem is doing something
useful with the connection, the brain is very "disorganized" (rather,
organized in a complex and individual way).

This conference, as the one's in the past have been achievements.  They

The future of gender was in my specific talk, sorry you missed it.  I didn't
put a lot of emphasis on "gender" per se, because my area of discussion was
"sexuality."  However, I did bring up new types of genders and stated that
there will be such enormous shifts in sexuality that it will affect gender.
A really wonderful moment was when I was asked what I thought about a
specific gender scenario as presented by Lenny Shaw from the audience.  I
stated quite clearly that being gender balanced and gender biased was not a
transhumanist approach, in my view and alluded to other appoaches.  At that
point, Dave Krieger, also from the audience, stepped up to the mic and
addressed the issue and presented his professional workplace as an example
of a mixture of genders to concur.  I think it was summed up quite
excellently by Dave.  I then took hold of the issue and make my final
comments in a summation of transhumanist ideas about gender.  

It was unfortunate that Kathryn Ageis did not attend the discussion for two
reasons.  First, and noteworthy, I intentionally cut my talk in half in
deference to Kathryn and anyone else in the audience who I knew would want
to openly discuss sexuality. I even called out to her one time during my
talk, and during questions and answers, asked Kathryn to come to the mic. It
is unfortuante she wasn't available. The second reason why I think this was
unfortunate is because silence cannot be heard. 

If anyone has a voice that desires to be heard, the best way to address
ideas and issues is to come to the very format where they are being
discussed.  The adverse is not a positive contribution.  Fortunately,
neither Sharon nor Chris were aware of this at the time and it did not
interfere with their presentations.

Both Sharon and Chris made important contributions.  I might not agree with
both of them, or either of them.   BUT they, as anyone else at the
conference have a right to be heard, they were panelists.

Regardless of this glitch that you so dramatically mentioned, and the
uneasiness it caused, I had a lot of fun for my few minutes discussing
sexuality.

True. But local systems can be much faster, so you could have a brain
consisting of faster sub-brains made of even faster subsub-brains and
so on...

Yes, this is interesting. Before Schachter (I think it was) made the
distinction everybody just thought there was one kind of LTM,
afterwards it was quite obvious that there were three kinds (there
are interesting neurological data showing that they can be separate).
The power of naming, indeed.

A good question. I actually don't know, but I guess semantic and
episodic memory are likely correlated (procedural memory is likely
less correlated, I have a very good semantic memory but an awful
procedural memory). Some of the difference may be a difference in
attention, but there might be other factors too. Are there any others
will different memory preferences, like somebody who usually
remembers scenes and experiences but not abstract facts?

Recently I was cleaning my hard drive at home from old junk when I
found an archive of my father's files. He died three years ago (he
definitely fell in the category of people who are content with dying,
being a victim of multiple sclerosis), and I had archived his files
shortly afterwards. In some sense they remain a record of his mind
and interests, very incomplete but still clearly his. I didn't erase
the archive, and put it back in my own long-term archive.

Maybe this is an interesting alternative to death as total
information-loss, death as merely the end of active change. As we
die, we allow ourselves and out exoselves to be archived (as a whole
or partially) for future study, reference or use. In some sense the
dead are already in this state, archeologists and paleontologists are

Nice idea! It could probably be implemented *today* using smart
badges (like the ones Olivetti produces). Maybe one could cycle
through a list of codes (first the transhumanist code, then the
roleplayer code and so on).

This might be interesting to suggest to the Xerox Parc people, it
sounds like their thing. The codes could correspond to interests,
work subjects etc.

     A little blurb in the SF Chronicle about what movie project Val Kilmer 
      should do next and one of the considerations was a futuristic 
     "thriller" pitting us against computers and technology.  More 
     Terminator-style Armageddon crap.  We get too big for our britches and 
     whoops....rrrrrrip!
     
     The movie is titled "Matrix" and is being done by Warner Brothers.  It 
     troubles me that the sensationalism in films more often than not leans 
     towards the constructive and rational rather than the fear-inducing 
     impact they choose, ostensibly for the dramatic effect.  
     
     I say this with such personal emphasis because my dear boss was the 
     first fatality of the Unibomber.  All because he happened to be a high 
     tech provider in a tiny strip mall that already had a Computerland and 
     a Software Centre.  I had the unpleasant role of seeing this tragedy 
     from a front row seat...so anything that promotes violence and 
     particularly in conjunction with advanced technology just leads me to 
     conclude that such fodder is providing grist for the mill of budding 
     whackos out there.
     
     This only makes me feel like I want to get to work sooner on the

Yes. I'm a bit irritated that so many otherwise reasonable people
seems to think that you need a conspiracy (a shadowy group of people
in black cloaks meeting to actively plot something secret and nasty) 
to explain things; quite often collusion develop out of
self-organization between different parties who notice they gain when
they act in a certain way, no centralized planning is needed to
create a cartel. 

"Designed" conspiracies ("Psst, want to rule the world?") seems to
work much less well than "grown" conspiracies ("Thank God for the
anti-nuclear activists, now we can sell more oil. Give them some
money, would you?"), and everybody seems to overestimate their
efficiency and prevalence (because it is untestable: if you see a
failed conspiracy, then there might be a dozen successul conspiracies
behind your back, and if you can not find any large conspiracies it
must be because they are good at hiding).

Hard to tell; my guess would be that roughly half of the cortex isn't
directly sensor or motor areas. But it would be a mistake to say that
personality isn't a part of them, there are likely big individual
differences even there, and a small perceptual difference (say, red
is more strongly linked to emotion than usual) can affect personality
a lot. In fact, I see personality as a property of the whole system,
including aspects of the endocrine system and the rest of the body.

Yes, it is unclear how many there are. We do not have a good
definition of personality (IMHO), and they seem to be quite blurred.
I'm usually happy, does that mean I have a happy personality or is
the happiness independent of personality? One could make a case for
both, but I think it is largely fruitless (I didn't really like
personality psychology, I'm more of a cognitive/neuro psychology
type).

Why not try developing one? Maybe imagine "Muscle Mick" or something
similar, a version of yourself that really likes weightlifting, and
then letting him do the training. At first you would have to
participate, but in time you will be free to think of other things as
Muscle Mick did his workout.

Sigh. Do you subscribe to the postmodernist view that scientific
theories are only accepted and spread due to the desires of the power
elites (and not due to any inherent correctness), by any chance?

What rich and powerful groups were trying to overturn the
intellectual oppression of the Church? There were plenty of people
chafing under it or circumventing it, but given what I know of the
early spread of copies of his work it was not deliberately spread by
some special group trying to use it as a tool to undermine the church
but rather by people having an intellectual interest in cosmology. 
Compare this to Luther, who definitely had the support by the rich
and mighty.

Can you show any example where the Establishment has actually
significantly increased the resistance of any meme, rather than
decreasing its spread by prosecution, enforced ortodoxy and similar
means (which does not really increase the resistance, rather the
transmission)? I suppose a good counter-meme could help this.

Yes, it is surprising how much history there are and so little usable
*data* (I would really like to have a database where I could ask
questions like "list all military conflicts between democratic
nations" or "plot a histogram of the lifespans of all
civilizations").

Your above two examples are interesting, since they are both american
modern history (maybe your thesis only applies there?) and both seems
to involve a government crackdown on fring groups on the right. But
we need to compare this to other government crackdowns to see if
conspiracy theories are more persecuted than other theories ("compare
the (government crackdowns on conspiracy theories)/(number of
conspiracy memes) with (government crackdowns on memes)/(number of
memes)").

Would you please list this evidence? That the powers that be usually
*try* control the spread of some memes is obvious and well known (I
think there have been *no* nation anywhere, at any time, where it
was allowed to freely spread the meme that the downfall of the government
was a good idea). But your claim is stronger, you claim they actually
have a very firm memetic control.

How do you become a great foundation? By having great backing. A
revolutionary foundation would not be backed by the government or
other groups profiting from status quo, no need for active memetic
engineering.

I think you are missing my point. Of course there are ruling classes
trying to remain dominant, as an european I am quite aware of that (I
even have some limited insight into their activities through various
sources). But what I disagree with is your view that they are doing
memetic engineering very well, and that they are the dominant factor
in memetic evolution. So far I have not seen you present much
evidence for that.

Now we are getting somewhere! This is just a small extension of
Dawkins model, and it makes a lot of sense. But notice that it is
very different from your initial thesis that the powerful groups are
dominant in memetic evolution; in fact this extension seems to
suggest that they would become memetically unchanging (as they
reach the top, they will not be able to change their memes since
that would decrease their fitness/power) while less powerful groups
would continue to develop new basic memes, co-evolving with each
other and the memetic background of the powerful groups. 

> Society has very effective defenses against new memes.  These

Could you explain what these effective defenses are? The most obvious
defence would be censure, which is the traditional way of a
government to prevent the spread of dangerous memes in certain areas
(and new is often considered dangerous by static societies). But
censure has been ineffective in the long run, as we all know. 
Persecuting certain views have usually promoted them. Not teaching
certain memes have done nothing to prevent their spread. So what are
these effective defences?

Now this really sounds like the basis for a good religion. God... I

Actually, I think it is a good thing if we could use our knowledge
and outloook to become richer, there is nothing wrong with it and it
might even be useful both to ourselves, others and our memes.

I'm sorry if my question is more provocative than it is substantial, but
I'm afraid my inadequate synapses cannot fire up a connection between my
question and agoraphobia!  "Paranoia" was an unfortunate and hasty word
choice.  What I am really saying is that I am *concerned* for my security
in the future.  How could anyone seeking indefinite lifespan not be
concerned?  
	It is not that I think anarchy and natural selection are in
themselves bad things, but a high selection gradient can be a little
unsettling, especially for a person of lesser synaptic integrity such as 
myself.  What would cause a high selection gradient?  When/if we run low
on matter.  When the very building blocks of our existence(unless you
believe in a soul) are in scarce supply.
	The only immediate solution I can see to this problem is strategic
alliances.  I won't eat your galaxy brain if you don't eat mine.  But what
means to we have to study and prepare ourselves for these alliances?  As
someone in another thread pointed out, game theory does not apply to
post-singularity entities.  What can we do for security in a future of
uncertainty?

Yes, and there's a potentially huge amount of "archive" in the memories of

It's true that sometimes signals in neurons, particularly in dendrites,  
travel passively like in a simple wire, however I don't see how that could 
make much of a difference in the overall speed of the brain.  Such signals 
may not need to wait around to be amplified by voltage gated ion channels, 
but they're still pretty slow for other reasons. The neural membrane has a 
very high electrical capacitance, and this dramatically slows the signal 
because the membrane potential has to build up from the ion flow,  and the 
capacitance is so big this takes a long time, like filling a swimming pool 
with a straw.
       
Even if such signals were fast it still wouldn't be very important because of  
their very short range. After about a millimeter the same high capacitance  
has turned a sharp spike into a hill that is so gentle it's unrecognizable.  
That's why amplification is needed for most things and that's really slow.

Thanks to Lee Daniel Crocker for an inspiring discussion of some of
the EXTRO-3 presentations re Future of the Body and Brain:

<. . . after we are all distributed intelligences in a large network,
where are "we"? "We" are at the Instruction Pointer of our thread, of
course, waiting for our timeslice to intend for one more cycle).>

This "Instruction Pointer of our thread" concept is fascinating.  I
had recently read something about "essential indexicals" in AI (see
second to last ref below) that sounded similar.  So, I did a search on
this and got some interesting links which may be of interest to some. 
Most of them pointed to the work of John Perry (author of _The Problem
of the Essential Indexical and Other Essays_, Oxford University Press,
1993) and director of the Stanford University Center For the Study of
Language and Information (CSLI).  CSLI faculty includes such AI elders
as John McCarthy and Terry Winograd.

Of particular interest was the "Rational Agency: Information and
Action" project at CSLI (see
http://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli/projects/cogsci9495-perry.html )
from which I quote:

< The aim of the Rational Agency project is to provide models and
theories of situated, resource-bounded, intelligent action. The scope
of the research covers rational activities of human beings, including
the use of language, and also the activities of artificial agents with
a variety of rational and deliberative abilities. . . . The conception
of intelligent agents underlying this work is less idealized and more
computationally motivated than the existing models available from
philosophy, decision theory, and artificial intelligence (AI)---the
main sources of our work. Much of this previous work has abstracted
from the fact that agents are resource-bounded: they have a limited
amount of time to determine what action to take, and they cannot do an
arbitrarily large amount of work in that time. Moreover, the work in
AI has, for the most part, considered only the simple case in which
the agent's environment does not change as its plans are executed. In
contrast, this project aims to model resource-bounded,
information-sensitive agents acting in dynamic environments. A
corollary goal of the work is the axiomatic characterization of the
functional components of such agents and their modes of interaction.>

Some abstracts of various CSLI papers / lectures can be found in the
CSLI calendars, for example at
http://mambo.ucsc.edu/psl/cslisem/199505/19950524.html 

Mark Textors online paper, "Truth and Understanding Demonstratives"
which has a chapter on "Indexicals and Indexical Meta-languages", at
http://kanpai.stanford.edu/publications/understanding/understanding.html
also looks interesting.

On Nova last night, I watched Edward O. Wilson rave about the marvelous
success of ants.  These are social insects, which work cooperatively and
have been very effective in their ecological niche.  They have changed
very little over millions of years due to their success, and in many cases
they dominate the ecology at their scale.

The reason cooperation can work despite the competitive pressure of
evolution is because all the ants are siblings, children of the same queen.
A gene which encourages cooperation, even when it means sacrificing in
favor of the sisters, may cause its host ant to die, but save multiple
copies of itself in the siblings.  So such genes can spread and thrive.

When we look ahead to an era where people can have complete control over
their reproduction, the question is whether a similar phenomenon could
occur.  It makes more sense to look at memes (self-reproducing ideas and
customs).  In terms of memetic reproduction, a meme for cooperation and
self-sacrifice could succeed if it sufficiently increased its own spread.

The loss of a host would eliminate that host as a vector for future spread
of the meme.  This could still be beneficial for the meme, in a couple of
circumstances.  The host's sacrifice could increase the survival of other
hosts of the same meme.  This would be directly analogous to the genes
in the ants.  In this case, we'd expect to see a meme for cooperation,
but only with other people who shared the same meme.  This could be
something like a religion which preached kindness to other people who
share the faith, but not to outsiders.  Other social organizations like
clubs or even racial groups could work the same way.

Another way that a meme could benefit from its host's sacrifice would be
if that event led to an explosive spread of the meme, like a plant which
casts its seeds to the winds even as it dies.  This might apply to a meme
for heroic sacrifice in circumstances where stories would be told about
the host's death.

One problem with the first approach is the difficulty of knowing whether
another person is a host of the meme.  With the ants, they can just smell
each other and they know they are siblings.  So the meme might be linked
to some externally visible behavior.  There would still have to be vigilance
for "imitative memes" which mimicked the external behavior but did not
cooperate.  Such a traitor would be denounced and driven out of the
cooperative.

All these behaviors are actually seen in the world today, to various
extents.  It may well be that they will be preserved even in a Darwinian
ultra-competitive future.

You can probably develop a set of excersizes that can be done in
a hotel room or truck sleeper that will help but won't require
any room or equipment. A simple example would be leg lifts, These
can be done while reading, and will help the abdominals. I
haven't looked, but I hope there's a book somewhere of excersizes
you can do while reading. Some of them may be adaptable for

I'm fairly sure a modern computer (say a Pentium 266 MMX)
has all the raw capacity you'd need. I'd want a DVD, not
just a CD-ROM, for the content. The problem, as always, is
software, and in this case "content development." Note that
some of what you want is already available in some golf and
motorcycle arcade games. These tend to use a big-screen TV
instead of VR glasses, but that's minor compared to the rest
of the content you're looking for. The motion sensors are
trivial when they are attached to any sort of articulated
mechanical device. The physiological monitors are also
trivial. Effectors of any type other than audio and visual
are a bit harder, but still not that hard: look at robotics.
It would also be simple to build effectors based on small
motors, vibrators, thermal pads, low-voltage AC electrical
stimulators, and pressure/vacuum systems. (Yes, these
could be used for virtual sex, but are certainly not limited
to that, so get you mind out of the gutter.)

So, there is no hardware engineering constraint that I know of
on the system you want, with the possible exceptin of Scene
generation. I suspect you can use video from the DVD by
constraining the possible paths through the landscape that
the user is permited to enter.

That machine seemed very cool to me too. I asked the director of my health
center about it or anything like it, and she said that she goes to all the
conventions and seminars and so forth and has never seen anything like it.
But I decided I wanted to get it anyway and tried to find their website. It
didn't exist under anything like the name they mentioned, so I gave up on
it. But I look forward to a "flying" machine like this becoming available.

On Wed, 13 Aug 1997, Hal Finney wrote about memes.

Note that in a posthuman world beings are likely more similar to
memes than today's physical entities, which suggests that memetic
evolution (which includes the deliberate creation and change of memes
by intelligent entities) may be a better model for posthuman
evolution than biological evolution.

Huh? Could this someone please explain why it would not apply after
the singularity? Many situations in game theory will not be changed
if the players are ultra-intelligent (in fact, game theory often
assumes the players are very rational, more rational than most humans
are).

Actually, myelinization does increase the speed of transmission in
the brain (otherwise it would have made more evolutionary sense to
have no myelin in the white matter and shrink the brain a lot), but
the real wins are in the peripheral nervous system.

Um, no...
But how about this:
As long as you're alive there still is hope (that you will someday be free;
the
only constant is, after all, change. Maybe you can *free yourself* from
your
oppressor(s).
Also, being "unfree" doesn't *have* to mean that your live is miserable,
and
not worth living. Just look at kids: hardly any freedom, but quite capable
of having fun. More importantly: you (and the rest of us) are not free
*right now*
(biology, governments, gravity etc). Do you hate your life that much, and
if
the answer is "yes", then why haven't you killed yourself yet? Probably
because
you belief that we can make the future a better place...So, why wouldn't
you
keep this (dynamic) optimism when you actually get to that future? 
There's always tomorrow...

Sorry to non-attendees for posting this to the List, but we didn't get back
as many feedback forms as I'd like. The more feedback the better I can
improve the conference. So please send this to me (not to the list which
would increase clutter) if you attended but didn't return the form.

Thanks,

Max
------------------------------------------------------

YOUR FEEDBACK

Which sessions stood out for you as most stimulating? Why? (Content or
presentation or both?)


Which sessions interested you least? Why? (Content or presentation or both?)


Was the weekend of August 9-10 a good weekend to hold the conference? Would
the closest weekend in 1998 be a good time to hold EXTRO 4?


How could we improve the conference?


Can you suggest who might help fund the next conference?


If you enjoyed the conference, what amount can you pledge toward Extropy
Institute to help with the costs of the event and the Institute's next
projects?


Please return this form to more@extropy.org or mail to Extropy Institute,

This may be possible, using the web site, though most people register very

I think I'll arrange something like this for next time. It should work
especially well for the focus I have in mind. More time for attendees to
talk with one another too.

I've never liked this, and many people seem to feel the same way. It may
become necessary if attendence multiplies.

Thanks for your comments Michael.

I know that many people, certainly including me, greatly enjoyed meeting

It certainly has a future as long-term as the introduction of
nanotechnology, so I don't see why you would find it bizarre. The topic
obviously interests many people and has much influence on our behavior and
sense of self. Gender may change drastically over the coming centuries, but
you need to provide an argument that it has no long-term future. You may be
correct, but that's not obvious. For most of the next century at least, I
see gender becoming increasingly individualized but not extinct.

I too would like to have heard more focus on the future from the other
panellists. Chris nicely laid the biological foundation. It would have been
good if Sharon had focused more on the psychology of future genders.

I have to disagree. First, Kathryn's absence had nothing to do with a view
that gender would be irrelevant. Secondly, the loudest contributions come
not from silence but from participation.

If you missed Greg's excellent talk and will be in the LA area a month from
now, he may be speaking at the LA Gerontology Research Group at UCLA
(second Monday of September).

Thanks for you feedback, Darren. I appreciate all the encouraging comments
which are boosting me to start thinking immediately about EXTRO 4.

Try tenney@hackers.org. You also *might* be able to get some useful hints
from the people who put on "contact" ... I don't know how to get in touch
with them (ironic, no? but I think some people on the list/members of the
Institute might.

Keep in mind (and this opinion is strictly sub rosa) some people think
that one or both of the above have ossified and/or dried up; so pick and
choose the strategies you model.

This is one of the reasons people multitrack. (grin/grimace--see below)

One of the tradeoffs here is between cohesion/"jackdaw epistemology" in
the good sense (we all get to have more nearly the same conference) and
birds-of-a-feather/stultification/stratification/ossification. How much do
you want to shake people out of talking the same old thoughts to the same
old people? How do you do that respectfully and congruently and still grow
the conference/BEST DO IT SO mindshare?

These are tough questions.

You're quite welcome.

Yes.

I'd put the conference in a television studio, and use a professional
interviewer. Also, putting experts head-to-head can be far more revealing
than having us mere mortals trying to challenge them with half-wit questions.

It's interesting, Anders. Before I met you, I valued your every word. But
the value I perceive in your words has increased dramatically since we met.
I consider myself a fairly wired kind of guy, yet even to me, appearance
seems to remain so important.

Anders,

Could you post a brief explanation and / or a link for those who weren't at
the conference? (And for those who made inadequate notes! :-|  )

Even so, you don't claim to be a moral expert, and you have a sense of

Suppose you have two designs for a system. Both have the same amount of
energy. System 1 duplicates all data, whereas system 2 does not. Clearly,
system 2 will have twice as much capacity for data, although not
necessarily twice as much usefulness. (Both systems would prioritize
resource usage to store the most valuable data first, and therefore system
2's second half would have less value its first, which should be the same
as system 1's total.)

I'm no statistician, but you can figure it out mathematically. You want the
system with the greatest total value over the systems' anticipated
lifespan. The value would be a sum of the values of each datum stored
successfully at each instant in time. If you can figure out the value of
each datum, and the probability of it being destroyed at a given moment,
then you can integrate to get the total value of the system. Better still,
you might find that SOME data is worth duplicating, and some is not. There
would probably be a series of variable "value thresholds", above which
everything is duplicated, triplicated, or more. But how to place a value on
the ability to answer "4" when the question is "2+2"?

I doubt that we have the faintest idea at this time how to measure the
risks, benefits or even the anticipated lifetime in the case of a
super-intelligent system. The very thought of trying to work the equation
out makes me long for the day when I need to make the choice. I never did
get the hang of Calculus. Corporations face the same problem regularly, and
the skill and judgement of the board in approximating these and other
variables is an important part of what determines how much profit they make.

Still, it's fun to speculate.

Darren

I only recently began to read your posts, but already find each one
fascinating.

A question for you.

Is it not possible that our emotion is an illusion which emerges from our
programmed reaction to certain stimuli? A tiger approaches; we appear to
get frightened. Perhaps objectively we merely go through physiological
changes which prepare us to escape injury. 

If that were the case, then is it not also possible that Deep Thought and
its successors have similar illusionary emotions? Suppose Deep Blue wins a
match. Whilst all the while appearing the same, staid machine predictably
pulling bytes from RAM and processing them, it deviates slightly and pulls
a different set of bytes to usual. Nothing odd to the designer there. But
then there is nothing odd about a little adrenalin escaping into our blood
stream, and our heart rate going up in the example with the tiger.

When Deep Blue won the series recently, I wondered whether it felt a most
primitive sense of achievement, in the same way that our own primitive
ancestors might have felt a sense of achievement if they had lifted their
first stone, and successfully hurled it at a passing antelope. Yes, the
thing is just a mathematical algorithm. But so, apparently, are we.

I suspect that "emotions" have evolved because they are an evolutionary
advantage. Deep Blue has more chance of survival if it wins matches, and
hence suffers selection pressures of the same kind that our ancestors did.
If each system is a logical parallel of the other, then are "emotions" not
possible results in both cases?

If we accept that emotions are illusionary, then I doubt that the
capability to experience emotion has a Boolean value. Probably, all systems
have emotion, but today, most humans are capable of perceiving that emotion
only in certain animals.

You seem to be implying that insects don't have emotions. Have you never
seen an angry wasp? The tone of its beating wings rises, it flies faster,
and its sting hangs lower.

If I understand you correctly, then doesn't the fact that you don't see
emotion in insects whilst I do, prove that beauty is in the eye of the
beholder?

Emotions in computers may be even easier than you intended to point out!

I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to lean either way.

Yes! Anyone who says they'd rather be dead than not free puzzles me, and at
least a couple of people leapt down your throat at your "rhetorical question".

Freedom is relative. You're not absolutely free until you can alter the
physics of the universe, and even that is debatable. Logically, there
should be few people alive who would rather be dead than not free.
Probably, there aren't many, and this case might be explained by a
misunderstanding about what "free" means.

Aw, I can't! The overall conference was, in my opinion, an astonishing

We're probably in agreement, then. My "long-term" was longer than yours. 

What I'd really like to hear, preferably from someone who has studied the
subject, is what the definition of gender actually is.

For the sake of fun, here is the argument you asked me to provide:

>Gender may change drastically over the coming centuries, but
>you need to provide an argument that it has no long-term future.
>You may be correct, but that's not obvious.

I criticised the gender panel. Criticising someone else is easy and small.
Much more difficult would be for me to have an original idea, as did so
many of the panellists.

So I'm sorry. I risk consigning my thoughts to the history bin by omitting
references to statistical or experimental studies, but I will attempt,
without waiting for our official definition, an argument from logic. (That
is, begging pardons from all, what I like to think I am good at.)

I guess that it depends upon what your goals are, and mine include being
one of those "fit" entities who will "survive". The phrase "the survival of
the fittest" may be harmless tautology, but as competition for resources
hots up, I can only imagine that those who survive will indeed be the
fittest, and that the logical conclusion the fittest will come to is that
gender is an ancestral oddity. 

An evaluation of an individual for the purposes of determining whether or
not one should invest in exchanging information with them should
approximate the value of the information which could be exchanged, the
probability that it will be exchanged successfully, and the cost of
exchanging it or at least trying; all in a variety of possible scenarios.

I've tried putting gender into into the equation at all available points,
and, assuming that the other entities in the exchange have the same
rationality (big assumption admittedly), it doesn't seem to me to fit. What
other purpose does gender serve?

Perhaps if we replace the word "gender" with "characterisation", it starts
to make sense. Or "sex" perhaps?

As usual with these things, I bet the debate finally boils down to the
semantic definition. I feel as if the word "gender" has been hijacked by a
community of those whose minds are sexually preoccupied. Once a mere
semantic classification itself, it now seems to have all manner of varied
meanings depending upon which literature you read. And I don't read very
much of it, so I had better shut up.


>For most of the next century at least, I see gender becoming increasingly
>individualized but not extinct.

Ah, now I see where I have gone wrong, and admit it. The "future" does
indeed begin now. Gender has a place now, assuredly for the next ten
minutes, and, as you point out, perhaps for a century or more to come. I
was looking a little further ahead than that when I said "long-term".
Probably much too far for the opinion to have any relevance.

In the case of the Fermi paradox, if there are other civilizations 
well within our past light cone, and large scale space 
colonization is possible, then either they destroy themselves before 
they do large scale space colonization, or they take pain to avoid 
detection. One of these occurances would have to happen to 100% of 
all civilizations in our past light cone. It seems not be absurd to 
assume that this is what happens in our universe, but if all possible 
series of quantum events actually occur in some world, then there 
should be some civilization that miraculously managed to escape 
extinction and then happened to adopt a policy of not hiding. So in 
the case there are MW then these two answers (self destruction and 
hiding) to the inter-worlds version of the Fermi paradox aren't 
viable.

I don't know exactly how the possible non-linearity of the 
wave function could be exploited to travel between worlds. It is 
imaginable that there would be some limitation analogous to the light 
speed. Since there would be extremely many worlds, and the 
number would continually explode, perhaps a worlds colonizing 
civilization would simply not be able to keep up with the number of 
new worlds that are born every second. This could then explain why 
our world hasn't been colonized. I think this is a better
objection to the cited argument that MW implies quantum linearity.

This is indeed a possible route: we make sense of the 
probabilities by postulating multiple identical worlds. The drawbacks 
of this is, first, that we need to buy a whole lot of new ontology. 
This is bad but perhaps not as bad as it first seems, since what is 
multiplied is not laws and explanatory principles but only the 
objects (worlds) postulated by the theory. Nonetheless, if we have to 
introduce an uncountable infinity of parallell worlds, that is a bit 
hard to swallow.

 John Clarke suggests that quantum mechanical 
predictions can be exactly reproduces even without a countable 
infinity, provided that we accept some indeterminism:

As far as I can see, this would leave us with  a countable infinity 
of worlds, but would cost us determinism, a rather attractive feature 
of the Everett interpretation. Is this bargain worthwhile?

An alternative way would perhaps be to say that the Schroedinger 
equation is only right to an extremely high degree of accuracy: all 
real probabilities are rational numbers; the amplitude square is only 
very, very close to the real probability. Is this too inelegant to be 
plausible?

Perhaps we could go further and make do with a large unbounded 
*finite* number of parallel worlds?

But what is the difference between a universe in which branches of 
the state function split off and a univerese wherein it is "as 
though" there were branches that were splitting off? Are there any 
observations that could distinguish between these hypotheses?

We introduced the many worlds in order to fix the probabilities. 
If we scrap the worlds then we seem to be back on square one again, 
with "measure" that doesn't correspond to the probabilities that stem 
from the ontology.

It is often said that deWitt is responsible for misrepresenting 
Everett in his popularizations. Is this the misunderstanding you are 
referring to? For my part, I don't think that the nonconservation of 
energy is a very serious objection to the Everett interpretation, 
even if taken to imply that literally new world are created all the 
time.

I'm a pretty strong advocate of children's rights, of making it
easier for people younger than 18 years old (or whatever the local
taboos set the age of majority at) to present a legal case for
their own emancipation than current law in most countries currently
seems to allow.

I've known a lot of people who have, at some time in their childhoods,
been in foster care, including my grandmother and most of her
siblings.  The reports I hear of state-supervised foster care are
universally infuriating, yet "runaway" kids are routinely treated
as juvenile delinquents regardless of whether or not any other
"criminal" behavior is presented, and returned to foster care
against their will.  This may be a worse problem in the USA than
elsewhere... I don't know much about conditions elsewhere.

I liked all the stuff Carl Feynman had to say about encouraging
his daughter to ask why, the sorts of answer-question-chains that
develop, and the sorts of answers that bring up the ends of
those chains. That's in the list archives.

My own upbringing was much more permissive than the "community
standards" of the Midwestern US cities I grew up in, but I seem to
have turned out all right, and I noticed the other kids envying me
my parents much more than I was envying the other kids their parents.
My mom was a Grateful Dead fan, and followed some elements of the
"deadhead" lifestyle throughout much of my childhood, and I regret
none of that (although my older sister didn't like it very much).
I got to meet a lot of interesting conversationalists when I was
young, older people who took the time to point me toward interesting
books I might enjoy reading, like Peter Pan and the Chronicles of
Narnia and Dune and The Stars My Destination and Childhood's End
and Brave New World, all of which I was fortunate enough to read
as a prepubescent. I can think of a lot of librarians who would
not have allowed me to lay hands on Brave New World at that
age, and I actually found it very frightening, a bit sickening,
at that age, but I don't think it harmed me too much.

This uncensored reading thing is a tradition in my family. My aunt,
as a high school student, wanted to get a copy of de Sade's JUSTINE
from the school library, and the librarian wouldn't let her have
it. This was in the late 1950s. According to family legend, my
grandfather stormed in there and demanded, as a paying customer
(it was a private boarding school, not like the public schools I
attended), that the book be delivered into his daughter's hands.
The book was delivered.

The one thing I do regret about my upbringing is that my
parents didn't teach me much about the value of money. I signed
a contract saddling me with some heavy student loans when I was
18, and when I signed that contract, basically, I had no idea
what I was doing. It took me ten years to extricate myself from
that situation, and in the course of my self-extrication I
learned quite a bit about the value of a dollar. It might have
been easier for me if I'd been funding more of my own
adolescent expenses out of a fixed allowance... then again,
perhaps it might not have.

As Anders has pointed out, the most important skill is learning
how to learn, teaching oneself how to teach oneself. It seems
to me that many kids (not all, unfortunately) have a huge
natural endowment of curiosity that only needs to be encouraged
and allowed relatively free reign to start a self-sustaining
fire of continuous self-education. But the very schools that
seem most helpful to the kids who (for whatever reasons) lack
this strong drive of research curiosity seems to stunt it in
the kids who are forced to go to those schools even though they
probably have no need for them.

Given the condition of state-run schools in the United States,
I cheer everytime I hear of a friend who is homeschooling their
kids. I am filled with respect for these people... it's not an
easy proposition to have to pay all your taxes *and* school
your kids at home.

I've also never understood why people get so scandalized about the
notion of paying kids to teach themselves stuff. In terms of social
structure, going to school is a kid's job. I didn't bother learning
the multiplication table the way it used to be conventionally taught
until a couple of years ago, and I learned and forgot long division
three separate times during my schooling, the last time when I had
a younger student teach it to me when I was seventeen years old.
Since then I've gotten through calculus and a bit of linear algebra
without much trouble, but my elementary and junior high-school
mathematics education was a shambles from which I was lucky to
recover.  Might things have gone easier for me if my parents had
just offered me a large (from a kid's perspective) cash bonus for
mastering the boring old multiplication table (it really is useful...
I'm very glad I finally bit the bullet and memorized the thing),
and later cash bonuses for passing evaluations of other
reading/writing/arithmetic type skills? I'm not sure.  Plenty of
room for debate and experiment here.

Since I've gone over some personal history here, it might be
useful for the historians in the crowd to know that I was in
elementary and junior high school in the 1970s and in senior
high school and college in the early 1980s.

Honesty is probably more important than anything else.

I could go on and on about this, and I've probably already
offended more than one extropian parent with my smartmouth
know-nothing opinions, but there you have some of them.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

One of the interesting things about the history of thermodynamics
is the way the English word "heat" was revealed to be devoid of
meaning.  "Heat" turns out to map loosely to temperature, to
conductive energy flow, and to stored thermal energy. The traditional
English word does not map precisely to any of these things. In
modern scientific usage, "heat" serves as a taxonomic word, referring
to phenomena of interest to thermodynamicists without referring to
any particular one thing. (In non-scientific usage, it continues
more or less to refer to the fictitious caloric, just as some --
not all -- modern non-scientific astronomical talk makes use of
the Ptolemaic model.)

I suspect that a similar disintegration is happening to the word
"complexity". Although it is now clear to us that "heat" has no
referent, and that the real measurable thermodynamic quantities
are several different things, each of which has its own technical
name, things were not so clear in the nineteenth century when
the hard work was being done in laying the foundations of
thermodynamics.

All the really good discussions of "complexity" I've seen on this
list seem to point toward a developing taxonomy of different types
of complexity. There are several different competing definitions,
and like the three definitions of "heat" they may all be right.
That means each one of them will need a name of its own, so we can
stop inadvertently confusing them, and if we can't agree which one
is the "real" complexity, it may very well turn out that complexity
is as chimerical as caloric, a half-baked idea that has played its
role in the history of science to date, but, turning out to have
no referent, must now be discarded.

I'm presenting this discussion from the perspective of some readings
in analytical philosophy, as applied to the history of science,
and I'd be delighted to have my perspective broadened by a
mathematician specializing in the study of complexity. Or by
anyone else, for that matter.

The only definition of complexity I can bring to mind at the
moment is the one that I think is used in algorithmic
information theory, which is the length (in bits) of the code
needed to produce the full string. This definition allows all
sorts of lossless compression to be applied to a given
bit-string to squeeze out redundancies that, properly speaking,
shouldn't count toward complexity. I can think of worse
definitions, but this AIT definition has mismatches with
"ordinary usage" of the word "complexity" as well. Before
delving into these, I'd like to see what alternative
definitions people have to suggest. I know John K Clark
recently put forth several alternative definitions, with
criticisms, and it was his post that triggered the thoughts
that led up to my writing this.

Can't the probability of a quantum event be irrational, say sqrt(2)?

where you enter the title simple as SPIKE and author simply as BRODERICK.

US readers should be encouraged by the news that $US 1.00 currently buys

 On the other hand, I imagine there's a charge for airmail delivery.

The biggest lesson I have learned while raising kids is that adults
consistently underestimate kid's intelligence and overestimate
their knowledge. I think the reason we do this is that we believe
we are using logic and intelligence in many situations in which
we are actually using memory of past events. Thus when a kid does
something with an unexpected consequence, we think "stupid kid!
Why didn't you infer the consequence!" instead of thinking
"ignorant kid! Why didn't you have experience of this consequence!"
(Aside: please examine our responses to Danny in this light.)

I apply this bit of hard-earned experience as follows: when a
kid does something "stupid", explain why the action is not
optimal. Don't just say NO!, and don't just lay down a set of
rules without reasons. Where possible, teach a lesson as you
would like to be taught yourself, with examples and visual
aids, not just words. My 14-year-old reminded me of an incident
that happened when she was four. She threw a sharp object at
her younger sister. Apparently, I saw this and first spoke
sharply to her (safety first: I DO yell at kids when there is
imminent danger.) I then explained that the knife could
seriously damage the sister, and asked her to predict what the
knife might do. she wasn't sure, so I used the knife to stab
through a piece of cardboard, and asked her to make a prediction
about the possible effect on her sister. Apparently, she really
got it that time.

What is the effect of this on the future of humanity? well, if
we often use experience instead of inference, we may want to
do two things: First, we may want to figure out how to apply
inference to more of our actions, or we may want to make
our experience more effective, as we extend our mentation
using computers. To do this effectively, we need to be more
aware of what we are actually doing when we react to a
situation in every-day life.

You don't.  If the galaxy dies, you should have enough warning
to convert as much as you can into spores, some of which may 
find their way into other galaxies, where they can start over.  
At least the next version of you will spring from part of your mind.

Long before you occupy the whole galaxy, your mind will be highly
redundant anyway because of the distances.

For what it's worth, I should note that episodic memory may not be as simple
as it sounds, going on my personal experience.  My memory is very strongly
episodic, but not linear.  I can't remember whether A happened before B, how
long ago it happened, whether it happened at the same time... to the point I
really don't have a past; just a lot of unconnected memories.

Because of this, when an episodic memory is triggered, all intervening space
is obliterated.  If you remind me of something I worked on for two weeks six
months ago, I'll say:  "Oh yes, I've been working on it for the past two
weeks."  If I meet with you once a week, or once a month, I'll refer to our
last meeting as "yesterday".

Episodic memory might also be divided into two parts:  Relational episodic
memory and narrative episodic memory.  Just a guess.

Re:  The Future of Gender
It's too bad I wasn't there.  Among the issues I would like to have raised:

1.  Emotional differences between genders arise from differing evolutionary
cost-benefit ratios.  Given certain new methods of reproduction, what would be
the corresponding emotional changes?  Given a new "gender" which reproduced
its ideas into the child's mind, would any new evolved emotions arise?  What
about triple sexuality?

2.  What if we're not evolving emotions?  If we design them ourselves, would
we want to invent any new emotions?  How would this affect social interaction?
 Suppose parents are required by law to be incapable, emotionally, of harming
their child... how would this affect dating?  Might not both partners circle
cautiously to ensure a potential child would not be harmed by the other?

3.  How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define an
Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other experts
sharing the world through virtual reality and communicating continuously,
waking and sleeping, on subvocal/subconscious/hypnotic channels.  (Augmented
humans are addressed as "Augmented Sally" to emphasize that you're talking to
everyone, not just Sally.)  If Augmented Sally and Augmented Fred have sex,
how would this affect the Augmentations, which could be of mixed genders?

4.  What if a liberal administration required that everyone switch sexes once
per year, to eliminate prejudice?  Would people stick with their old emotions,
switch to the new, or go nuts?

Note that none of these questions address uploading.
You all know why...

---

The whole missed opportunity reminds me of another time...
[From an SF convention I once attended:]

A friend once gave a lecture on "Spoken Programming Languages" that I sort of
had to rescue.  Among the questions I asked from the audience:

"What is the cognitive difference between speaking and writing, and how will
it affect the computer languages?"
"Would spoken comments, recorded directly, be an improvement?"

Among other things, I suggested that you'd need super-macros so you could say
"copy A into B".  Another nice fellow in the audience wondered whether spoken
Logo would produce the same cognitive improvement... learning to program in
Logo is apparently VERY good at increasing a child's mental agility.

Previous to my throwing away all caution and asking these questions, my friend
and the other panelist were discussing error correction and speaker
dependence.  Dull, and not what everyone had shown up to hear.

---

So if you're giving a lecture and want a lot of neat "What-if?" speculations,
just give me a ring!  I can provide them in unlimited numbers, just for the asking!

That was me, in Re: [2] Freedom or death.  I suggested a non-Hofstadterian
solution to the Power vs. Power Prisoner's Dilemna.  I also wondered if the
Powers would use game theory at all, when deciding whether to respect our
opinions.  In the question of forced uploading, we might appear as wholly
deterministic phenomena in a one-shot PD.

[Repost of relevant section:]

I'm not sure that game theory applies to posthumans.  It's based on
rather tenuous assumptions about lack of knowledge and conflicting goals.  It
works fine for our cognitive architecture, but you can sort of see how it
breaks down.  Take the Prisoner's Dilemna.  The famous Hofstadterian
resolution is to assume that the actions of the other are dependent on yours,
regardless of the lack of communication.  In a human Prisoner's Dilemna, this,
alas, isn't true - but assuming that it is, pretending that it is, is the way out.

While a Power might set up a segregated, logical line of reasoning that would,
as a Turing machine, inevitably be the same as the reasoning used by the other
partner... so that the two would inevitably arrive at the same decision.

The problem is that this doesn't work for a "human vs. Power" Prisoner's
Dilemna.  The Power isn't pretending anything.  It isn't acting out of respect
for anyone's motives.  It isn't giving slack.  It isn't following a
Tit-For-Tat strategy.  It *knows*.  A Power in a human/Power PD might be able
to work out the human's entire line of logic, deterministically, in advance,
and then - regardless of what the human would do - defect.  (Or it might
cooperate.  There are no real-life Prisoners' Dilemnas.  Defecting always has
continuing repercussions.)

But in the case of involuntary uploading, the Power might well disregard our
opinions entirely.  It *knows* what is wrong and what is right, in terms of
ultimate meaning.  It *knows* we're wrong.  Unlike a human, it has no chance
of being wrong - not of schizophrenia, not of being in an elaborate
hallucinated test, *nothing*.  We can never acquire that logic, being unsuited
to it by evolution, however seductive that logic may seem.

Given that all Powers share exactly the same goals with no conflict arising
even as a hypothetical, or that they can use the above
identical-line-of-reasoning logic to ensure that no uncertainty ever arises...
given that there is never a conflict of opinion... then the Powers have no
need for game theory!  Even if some of the above conditions are violated,
they'd still have no need for game theory with respect for humans.  What are
we going to do?  Say, "Bad posthumans!  No biscuit!"  Does respect for
another's motives apply when you can simulate, and intimately understand, a
neural or atomic-level model of that person's brain?

As such, not very likely.  I have my own theories about how emotions work; it
has to do with the existence of cognitive objects called "goals"; most of the
interesting stuff comes from our two-tiered architecture, the pleasure/pain
system's centrality, and the coordination between goal-system and worldview.

Point being... no, this doesn't seem very likely.  Aside from the subjective
view, the emotional processes are too complex to be purely reflexive or
behavioristic.  The amount of grief parents experience over the death of a
child correlates roughly with the amount of effort wasted, from a reproductive
cost-benefit view.  This is evolutionary, rather than conscious, in origin...
and demonstrates that evolution can control the emotions in detail. 
Evolutionary psychology explains emotions far more complex and devious than
fright and flight. 

The subjective aspect of emotions does come from an entire orchestra of goals,
viewpoint alterations, belief changes, and physiological responses which
stimulate further changes... but all the cognitive stuff is still there; it is
an integral part.

Finally, although this is getting into the hard problem of conscious
experience, I don't think the physiological stuff can explain the subjective
aspect.  Is adrenaline conscious?

Emotions aren't mysterious forces.  They can't hide from us.  Turing machines
are deterministic and wholly causal; any force operating on Deep Thought would
be explicable as the sum of its parts.

It didn't.  Deep Blue may have emergent chess stratagems from the complex
physical-process-level chess exploration algorithms.  I don't think there was
any form of feedback for successful and unsuccessful moves.  In training mode
- if it possesses such a thing - it might be said that it experiences
"pleasure" at a successful move.  In truth, I think this is torturing the
metaphor.  Except from a functionalist perspective, there wouldn't be much
internal difference between "pleasure" and "pain" - just negative and positive
numbers.  If Deep Blue were reversed to make the worst possible move, it might
not require much reprogramming... i.e., the distinction between pleasure and
pain would be surface, rather than deep causal.

Emotions did indeed evolve because they are evolutionary advantages.  Although
Deep Blue's weightings for piece value may be "evolutionary" in some sense, I
don't think the term can really apply in the sense you use it.  Linear numbers
aren't complex enough to "evolve"; evolving sequences of instructions, as in
the TIERRA environment, are another matter.

Deep Blue, again, is not that level of AI.  It is a brute-force mechanism.  I
don't believe it possesses evolvable heuristics as did EURISKO, or evolvable
concepts as did AM, or evolvable anything except weightings.  And weightings,
not possessing much in the way of causal force - though this is true only for
Deep Blue and the like - are not emotions.  At the very best, they could be
instincts or reflexes, possessing no cognitive correlates.

It is possible that the weightings of piece value have far and subtle
consequences in Deep Blue's Great Search Tree.  Kasparov has stated that Deep
Blue had a new kind of intelligence.  It could be that all the interacting
weightings had the same kind of emergent effect as all our interacting neural
weightings... although on a much smaller scale!  It would take a lot of
looking, and specialized tools, to detect those patterns.  The fundamental
questions are these:

1.  Are the patterns complex?  Are they non-linear, non-algebraic?  Are they
divisible into sub-patterns?  Are the patterns "causal" - composed of the
complex interaction of sub-patterns?  Are they Turing complete?

2.  Do the patterns evolve?  Can they reproduce?  Can they mix?  Do they compete?

Although not an expert on search trees, I very much suspect that search trees,
or at least A* and variants, are not that complicated.  They may be
Turing-complete in theory, although I actually doubt it... but that Turing
completeness may not be translatable into a level where patterns could
"evolve" and the best patterns would win games.  A lot of technically Turing
complete processes' Universal Turing Machines are *very* far from the level in
which they are implemented.

It is possible.  There are theories in which "hedonistic neurons" - neurons
that want to fire as often as possible - provide the basic organizing
principle for the brain.  We are faced not merely with that, but with
requiring that the most often-firing neurons are the ones which have the best
solutions to some cortical-level problem.  On the other hand, Deep Blue's
basic level is much more directly semantic than the basic neural level.

Again, I disagree.  Once I argued over whether a thermostat had meaning.  I
took the position that it was meaningless, because meaning was a far cognitive
function, or even a far physical function.  Likewise, emotion as we perceive
it is a functional or surface matter, often depending on how fuzzy and lovable
something *looks*.  Emotion, as that which produces the functions, is a
cognitive matter.  The subjective aspect of emotions is a far cognitive
matter, impinging on things that, quite frankly, I don't think any mortal
being will ever understand.  But we don't need the subjective aspect, any more
than we need conscious experience for human-equivalent intelligence.

So if I have a program,

struct Wasp {
	float wing_tone;
	float air_speed;
	float sting_angle;
};

and I adjust the three variables you mentioned, the program has emotions?

Likewise, if I videotape a wasp and play the videotape, does the videotape
have emotions?  Certainly you'll ascribe emotions to the thing you see on
videotape, even though it's simply a recorded image.

It's not how it looks... it's the functional part.

Computer programs work exactly the same, regardless of what we perceive in
them.  The same, to some extent, might be said of reality... except that we're
a part of it.  The way we ascribe emotions is a fruitful area of cognitive
science.  It is not, however, a fruitful area of philosophy.  Any emotions
that are observer-dependent, I am not interested in.  Likewise for other AI
"achievements" that require me to believe the symbol G0025 represents a
hamburger merely because the string "hamburger" is attached.

Profitable computer emotions will require functional capability, not merely
surface resemblance.  Rick Knight doesn't want to comfort a forlorn computer
program... well, that's not what I had in mind.  More like a program that
could be frightened by an imminent crash and save your data, or could "want"
to send mail and take all necessary actions to do it.  Once you have the goal
system for setting up those chains, doglike emotions are only a short step away.

 Blind men probably use their visual cortices.

 Many aspects of the brain are distributed so widely that it isn't
practical with todays technology to do more than guess at how much
change removing a particular part will cause. Most functions have a
fair amount of redundancy so that removing a few pieces will just
cause a slight reduction in clarity of memories, predictability of
normal reactions, etc.

 It will take a fairly complete understanding of how the brain works
to answer that question. Minsky thinks an AI (I don't think he means
a human one) could be implemented on a 286. I suspect it will take a
lot more than that.

Hi Ping,

I did forward Elaine's announcement of CRIT to Extropians
a couple days ago. I am not sure what the list problem is, but
there have been other small problems in the past.
Welcome!

SOME NOVEL SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS

Abstract

    The rapidly improving ability to build atomically precise structural materials of 
extreme strength-
to-mass ratio will permit a revolution in aerospace engineering. Graphenes, or 
'Buckytubes' may 
become available in commercial quantities, allowing the realization of previously 
untenable 
proposals, such as the 'Skyhook', or geosynchronous tether, for example. A number of 
novel 
spacecraft propulsion systems and machines are presented, as well as new applications for 
some 
very ancient devices. The crossbow and other mechanical catapults are re-examined in 
light of this 
materials development. A design for an electrically powered, automatic Graphene crossbow 
capable 
of loosing 10 kg payloads at 5 km/sec is presented.
   A Solar System-wide transportation system is proposed by the author for freight and 
for 
spacecraft propulsion. A network of accelerator/decelerator stations in various positions 
around the 
Solar System pass 'Smart Pellets' and other forms of matter and energy between each 
other, to 
planets and other bodies, and to spacecraft in transit. The systems presented here are 
amenable to 
inclusion in that proposal.
   Between the proposals for particle beam and pellet stream spacecraft propulsion lies 
an immense, 
largely unexplored spaceflight regime. Pushing a spacecraft using a collimated beam of 
mesoscopic 
particles, very roughly on the order of a nanogram mass each (plus or minus several 
orders of 
magnitude), presents new opportunities for high speed interplanetary manned 
transportation. This 
kind of beam can be tailored in velocity, mass flow, and beam profile parameters to fit 
the mission 
requirements. The ballistic coefficient, or mass-to-cross-section ratio of this type of 
particle is much 
greater than single atom particle beams, allowing more precise control over pointing and 
dispersion. With atom counts per particle reaching into the millions, molecular 
nanotechnologies 
may permit the inclusion of entire guidance systems. The receiver onboard the spacecraft 
may be as 
simple as a pusher plate, or may incorporate particle ionization and magnetic mirroring.
    Combining the concepts of solar sailing and mesoparticles leads to the notion of 
mesoscopic 
solar sails. A mesoparticle beam composed of thin film sails with nanoscale electronics 
and 
actuators may be able to accelerate, turn, and navigate itself to a target spacecraft. 
Its accelerator 
may be the Sun, or a laser located on a deep space 'relay station'. The magnetic sail 
analog, though 
suffering a scaling disadvantage, is investigated briefly.
   The performance of the rotating tether, or sling, is considerably enhanced by 
constructing it of 
Graphene fiber. A relatively short sling with a reasonable taper ratio can attain tip 
velocities of 
several tens of km/sec, along with firing rates of several hertz, making it an attractive 
substitute for 
the Mass Driver. Scaling down further, the notion of a mesoparticle sling is introduced. 
A planar 
array composed of many thousands of centimeter-size slings and associated support systems 
forms 
a type of mesoparticle beam projector.

A couple of cheap suggestions (advice is always cheap, no?):

-- Jump rope.  Good for coordination as well as aerobic fitness, and you
can listen to music while you do it (or watch TV, if your ceiling is
high enough to do it indoors).  There are books that explain techniques
and training regimens, if you want to read them.

-- Watch aerobics shows -- hokey, but it can work.

Slightly more expensive suggestions:

-- Mini-trampoline:  Similar to jumping rope -- not as intense a workout,
but easier on the knees.

-- Take a martial arts class.

--Get a punching bag.

-- Join a gym with a swimming pool.  Plenty of variety, and if there's
a hot tub or sauna like my gym has, there's an extra reason to go.

And, to counter your (hormone-induced? :-) ) urge to buy a Western Flyer:
I recommend the Schwinn Air-Dyne as a quality piece of exercise equipment.
It's like an exercise bike that you can also use your arms with, and it
works by air resistance (it uses a fan, which means a) it gets harder as
you pedal faster; b) it has the added bonus of fanning you while you ride
it).  I have comparison data showing that it can give quite an intense
workout if you pedal fast, and Consumer Reports rates it highly.  They
can be expensive new, but Will got one for about $35 in a thrift store
(apparently one exercise bike is the same as another to them).

Don't forget that gaining muscle is as important as aerobics to losing
weight (some say more so), and that raising the fruit/vegie/fiber
content of your diet can help a lot, too.

	This probably isn't the last time you'll be asked that question, or something
similar to it.  My opinion is that when someone asks such a question, it
indicates they have Failed To Get The Point.  Shock treatment is indicated;
you should twist their question and make up a coherent, yet strange answer. 
Anyway, this is what I'd have said... bearing in mind that the following may
contradict my postulates, but not yours:

	"Well, fashions come in cycles.  Around 2050, I'd expect a Back-To-Nature
movement to get started.  People would shuck their tentacles and start wearing
good-old-fashioned human bodies again.  The problem is, a lot of them -
particularly the poor ones - might not be able to.  A human body is pretty
expensive to maintain, since you have to run it off of food instead of
electricity.  And a lot of people will be living inside computers; they won't
be able to afford real bodies to begin with.  And some of the children raised
inside computers wouldn't be able to operate a human body if they had one. 
So, as usual, you'll see the rich dressed up in elaborate fashions, followed
by a descending hierarchy of imitations.  The real rich will have genuine
1990s-style human bodies with genuine biology, although the brain will
probably still be up-to-date... fashion may make people look like idiots, but
frontal lobotomies will never become popular.  Anyway, next you'll see
middle-class people with lookalike bodies, bodies that seem human on the
outside but run off of electricity.  Then there'll be virtual human avatars
for the people living inside computers.  The children who grow up inside
computers probably won't even be able to operate those, since they're used to
four-dimensional environments or whatever; so they'll rebel and keep on
pushing the bounds of weird new modifications.  Needless to say, I really
don't have the faintest idea of what they'll come up with.  For all I know,
the Back-To-Nature movement could be in 2040 or 2060; but it's the only
fashion trend that I, an unmodified human, would be even vaguely able to understand."

Yes, there is more to episodic memory than just storing linear
experiences. In fact, each episode seems to be largely unconnected to
the others, for example I can recall a small episode last christmas
when I gave my grandfather an aspirin, but I cannot recall the
preceeding or subsequent episodes. 

There is a term sometimes used in psychology, source memory, for our
memory of when and how we learned something. It seems to be impaired
in people with frontal lobe damage, as well as the ability to tell if
episode A came before or after episode B. So my guess is that this
kind of time-binding memory is likely closely linked to the frontal
lobes, although the episodes themselves can be triggered by
electrical stimulation of the temporal lobes.

My talk will soon appear in the proceedings and on the web, but here
is an extract. Feel free to comment on it: 

The Structure of Memory

Memory is not an unitary concept; it contains several different
subsystems that have different functions, properties and neural
foundations. 

The most well-known division is between Short-Term Memory (STM) and
Long Term Memory (LTM); information enters STM where it is stored for
a comparatively short period of time, and then is either forgotten or
moved into LTM, a process called memory consolidation. 

 Short   consolidation     Long
 Term  ------------------> Term
 Memory                    Memory

Short term memory acts as our working memory, our current context. It
has a fairly small capacity, the famous "7 plus or minus 2" chunks of
information (Miller 1956), and if we are distracted we easily forget
what we were doing. 

The border between STM and LTM is a bit unclear, while some memories
(like a name at a cocktail party) can be forgotten in seconds, others
remain for minutes, hours or even days before being forgotten. The
importance and emotional content of a memory will determine how well
it will be consolidated; shocking, unusual or personal memories will
be stored quite clearly, while the tedious details of daily life just
fade away. Studies in amnesia patients whose memory consolidation
process has been damaged hint that it may take days to weeks until a
memory is permanently stored. 

The Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) memory system has been a favorite
research subject ever since it was discovered that it is deeply
involved in memory consolidation (Squire & Zola-Morgan 1991). The MTL
consists of several brain structures, most importantly the
hippocampus, a tubular fold of cortex on the inner surface of the
temporal lobe. People with damage to the hippocampus have normal
short term memory, intact memories of their lives before the accident
or illness, but lack the ability to learn new episodic or semantic
information. 

                                  [Image]

Exactly how the MTL works is as present controversial, but one theory
which seems to be gaining support is the complementary encoding
theory of McClelland, McNaughton and O'Reilly (1995). 

The basic idea is this: in order to learn, the brain needs to be
plastic, but if it is too plastic new memories will also overwrite
old memories and we will forget what we have learned; this is the
stability-plasticity dilemma which crops up in a lot of machine
learning. But we can remember single experiences which have not been
repeated, and at the same time retain memories for decades. This
could be explained if there was an intermediary memory system with
high plasticity (fast learning/forgetting) which stored recent
experiences, and then played them back to the less plastic cortex
several times (possibly during sleep or other mental activity),
gradually storing them in permanent memory. This could be the
function of the MTL, which we know is more plastic than the cortex,
and it would explain why damage to the MTL prevents patients from
learning new information. The MTL acts as the sketchbook of the
brain. 

Long term memory is permanent; while STM seems to rely on neural
activity and chemical changes at the synapses, LTM appears to be
based on actual changes in cell morphology in the cortex. This means
that it is not easily wiped, and since it is distributed even fairly
large lesions will not remove specific memories. 

LTM can be divided into several subsystems. Three of the most
well-defined and useful systems are episodic memory, semantic memory
and procedural memory. 

		Memory
               /  |  \
              /   |   \
             /    |    \
            /     |     \
           /      |      \
       Episodic   |    Semantic
        Memory    |     Memory
                  |
              Procedural
               Memory

   * Episodic memory is our memories of our lives, what we have done and
     experienced. It is interesting since we usually learn it in a single
     trial: we can experience something once, and then remember it forever.

     An important and at present poorly understood subsystem of episodic
     memory is prospective memory: the ability to remember things in the
     future, like what to do tomorrow or what people will come and see you
     on Tuesday (Sellen et al 1996). While it appears that we usually forget
     more about the past than the future, forgetting to do things is usually
     a bigger problem (Eldrige et al 1992).

   * Semantic memory is our memory for facts and general knowledge, such as
     Paris being the capital of France and that glutamate is a
     neurotransmittor. This is what is traditionally learned in school, and
     the area where study techniques or memory devices work best.

   * Procedural memory is our memory of skills: how to do things
     practically, how to swim or dance. Unlike episodic memory it usually
     requires a lot of training, and it is not consciously declarative like
     the previous two memory systems; this may be due to the fact that it is
     strongly tied to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, while semantic
     memory and episodic memory (declarative memory) both appear tied to the
     temporal lobe.

One concept I am interested in is autosexual or the advanced asexual.  It
seems that if we had a "switch" to turn on and off sex, then we would not
have the emotional preoccupations about same.  Sex, although centered in the
brain, is emotional and conjures up emotions in the dance and in the act.  A
choice that many may make presently and in the near future would be not
eliminate sex which would affect gender.  I wonder if these non or
negsexuals will be genders or species.

We already witness triple sexuality.  One may be take on a male disposition
one day and a female disposition another day, and then on the third day be
neither - androgynous or asexual.  Or, one could be a combination of all
three, or something different.  These will be more defined in the near
future, again.  As far as genitals, one could have both male and female
genitals and then a third structure for a different type of pleasure or
stimulation.

This is an important issue.  As we become less and less biological, we will
be shedding aspects of our biology.  Nerves will eventually start to be come
eliminated.  In doing so, we will decide what sensations, feelings, we will
want to maintain.  We may decide that we only want pleasurable feelings, and
just a smidgen of pain -- as a reminder or red flag. 

As we grow more extropic as transhumans, we will also be shedding emotions
that do not serve our needs.  We will be develop our emotions as "refined
emotions."  We can start doing that now by raising our EI (emotional
intelligence).

Eliezer and JKC have recently dissected different types of emotions
quite nicely. Your line of reasoning might also be applied to another
abused concept, namely consciousness.  This is what Ned Block does in
his essay "On A Confusion About A Function Of Consciousness" at
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.block.html from which I
quote:

<The concept of consciousness is a hybrid or better, a mongrel
concept: the word `consciousness' connotes a number of different
concepts and denotes a number of different phenomena. We reason about
"consciousness" using some premises that apply to one of the phenomena
that fall under "consciousness", other premises that apply to other
"consciousnesses" and we end up with trouble. There are many parallels
in the history of science. Aristotle used `velocity' sometimes to mean
average velocity and sometimes to mean instantaneous velocity; his
failure to see the distinction caused confusion (Kuhn, 1964). The
Florentine Experimenters of the 17th Century used a single word
(roughly translatable as "degree of heat") for temperature and for
heat, generating paradoxes. [Snip] These are very different cases, but
there is a similarity, one that they share with the case of
`consciousness'. The similarity is: very different concepts are
treated as a single concept. I think we all have some tendency to make
this mistake in the case of "consciousness".>

It might be that Powers destabilize some games (secong-guessing each
other indefinitely or coming up with utterly different strategies),
but in most simple games they would likely do better than
less-than-rational current humans, and instead make the system very
predictable.

Remember that even Powers cannot know everything. If you can simulate
your oppnent quite well, then things will get interesting, but if you
have only limited information then game theory still applies.

OK, lets start by assuming all data is equally valuable (to make
things simple). The probability of a failure of a datum is p. System
one contains N datums, each with an extra copy, while system 2
contains 2N datums with no backup. Assume both systems have the same
lifespan t. In both systems memory would decay at rates
l*exp(-k*p^2*t)  and l*exp(-k*p*t) respectively (l is a
proportionality constant).

Then the value of system one would be 

W1=kN(1-exp(-l*p^2 t))/lp^2

and the value of system two would be 

W2=2kN(1-exp(-l*p*t))/lp

In the long run, when t->infinity, W1 goes to kN/(lp^2) and W2 to
2kN/lp; for p<1/2 (which is the likely scenario, nobody uses
devices which fails more often than not) system 1 is more valuable
than system 2. Error correction is apparently worth its price.

I think that is an important problem, and I can't say I have decided
on what side I'm standing on. And it will crop up again and again, no
doubt about it. 

One thing I found in my neurochemistry reading is that choline
supplementation to pregnant rats makes their children better at
soliving spatial-memory tasks, apparently the choline has beneficial
effects on the development of their memory system. Should human
mothers supplement themselves with choline during pregnancy, even if
we don't know the full effects of this on the children?

Yes, it is strange, but sometimes I get the feeling that I don't
exist as much when I'm not online, interacting with people. Must be
that I have left too much of my mind on the net instead of my brain
:-)

     How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define 
     an Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other

     BLOWING PART OF THE MOVIE WARNING!
     
     One thing I noticed in my return visit is Ellie's meeting with the 
     entity (on the beach) that manifested as her father. Even after she 
     had deduced her thoughts/memories had been "downloaded", and the 
     entity congratulated her on her observation, he still *behaved* as if 
     he were her father commenting that she had her mother's hands.  In 
     that moment, it occurred to me that Ellie and the entity had shared 
     the most intimate of contacts possible to two conscious creatures.  
     Blows the lid of what we try to achieve in our most intimate sexual 
     moments (unless, of course, one's sexual experiences are pursued for 
     the sake of dominance and power attainment).
     
     I'd like to have extended discussions on the waking and sleeping part. 
     There's something in me that likes the (what I presume to be) private 
     nature of sleep and dreams.  And I'm not really a private person!

A currently annoying but otherwise harmless medical condition of mine
(vestibular neuronitis, if anyone's interested) has taken me off
caffeine because the vaso-constriction properties of it aggravate the
condition.  Having been a java junkie all my life, this leaves me
significantly under-stimulated.  I'd like to find something easier to
get than dexedrine, safer than ephedrine, and without that specific
side-effect (other side effects might be OK).  I've tried that new
Guarana drink, but that doesn't do it.  Any ideas?

     we will be able to use the sand on a beach, the photons in a moon 
     beam, or the drops of water in a cloud to interface with.  Why not?

This is simple: I don't know which slit the photon/electron is going to go
through and I can't find out.  I have to send more than one photon/electron
towards the slits to make sure they go through, they are likely to go through
both.  All this says to me is that interference between photons and electrons
isn't effected by time.  If I send them through one at a time I get
interference from the one I haven't sent through yet, but I still have to
send through both slits at some point in time.

Am I missing something?

P.S. Just to add to the weirdness (you enjoy it really).  If at some point we
prove that Everett theory is true, the universe will split into two (or more)
realities, one where the theory is true (this one) and one where it is not.
 Because in the other reality the theory is not true, our reality cannot
exist!  So as soon as we consciously observe the existence of many worlds,
those many worlds will collapse leaving only one!

My original 'rant' about _making the ability to create software an intrinsic
part of any operating system_ failed to get my point across, so in my usual
persistent manner. Here I go again:

We've had network-centricity, document-centricity, web-centricity, now it's
time for some user-centric computing.  Some people use the term user-centric
for describing there attempts at user interface design, but it goes much
further than that.  User-centric computing, in short, means that the user
creates everything on the computer.  They don't create it in the traditional
hard-coding sense; they create it in a multitude of ways.  Whenever a user
interacts with a computer they are no longer using an application; they are
creating objects, documents and agents.

All this creating happens inside the 'software environment'.  The software
environment contains everything needed to establish network connections, send
and receive information, create object interactions, display multimedia and
search for information.  When a user creates objects (which essentially make
up tools, documents and agents) they are doing so through direct
manipulation.  Direct manipulation use to mean having to understand the core
computer components, but just as you don't have to understand quantum physics
to move a teacup, you don't have to program C++ to create objects and object
interactions.  What this means is - when you write a letter, you are no
longer typing in a word-processor, you are adding letter objects (or ink) to
a page object (or paper).  This has advantages, not only does it model real
life, it also means I can add paint to my page, or hyperlink, or anything
else.  No one programmed this in the traditional sense; it's just a fact of
life that inks stay on paper!

With this model come distinct advantages in I/O independence, media
independence and artificial intelligence.  I/O independence is helped because
it doesn't matter whether you're using a pen, keyboard or voice, they'll all
write on any document object (necessary pen and keyboard interface
information will be kept in the pen or keyboard).  It also allows for
switching between media types and the creation of multimedia interfaces using
intelligent media (media that programs itself for different situations,
creating user/situation-specific interfaces).  Most importantly, this high
level abstract programming environment helps AI as well as the user - it
allows the artificial intelligence to work with objects that have meaning to
both it and the user.

An early (and failed) attempt at some user-centricity was the original
version of HTML.  Older HTML commands are <quote> and <small>.  This is
because font sizes and colours were to be defined by the user.  This approach
failed because the web browser was not advanced enough to create a good
multimedia interface and because publishers wanted more control.  It is not
yet possible to create a truly user-centric computer, but we can start moving
in the right direction.  Making the ability to program applications as
in-built as the ability run them will open up many possibilities
(particularly in the business sector).  The advent of Aspect Oriented
Programming (AOP), component software and real-time aspect weavers will also
improve user-centricity.

I'm in the process of designing a user-centric software environment for rapid
application design, prototyping and real-world interactions (making objects
that co-exist in the real world and the software environment).  Eventually
I'll make a home version and crush Bills mighty empire, but that's for
another day

--Wax

P.S. I just realised that if I succeed in creating my OS.  I'll not only
destroy Microsoft, but *every* software company!  How's that for a monopoly!

        The main reason for this is simply the association of omnidimensional
ideas (words that are on a flat computer screen) with multidimensional people
and their personalities.  There is usually a lot more to people than can be
transmitted in the words they write...taking into consideration word
inflection, body language and facial movements etc.  In short, a person's
*character* is what carries him beyond his words; Extro-3 was a prime
example of that: though I knew most of the attendees through their writing,
I found myself wanting to "meet" everybody in person --an impossible task
when there are so many to meet!  ;-)

In this respects our upbringings were similar.  From the age of 6, I had
unrestricted access to my parent's library, including bodice-rippers, war
stories (often with gruesome pictures), and my (psychologist) mother's
collections of texts on human sexuality.  Indeed, they even assisted the
education process.  When my baby brother was born (I was 4) they got me a
picture book with stylized but still graphic illustrations of sex, adult
human genitalia, and childbirth.  They would never have made a scene to get
me a copy of de Sade, but that's only because they're not the type to make a
scene.

They did hide the pornography, but I found it anyway :-)  I personally
wouldn't care if a child of my own saw any, because I remember my reaction
(pre-puberty) was "what's the big deal?"

The world presents us with probabilistic balancing acts much more
often than it presents us with binary toggles.  Just as many people
are willing to take on small but significant risks of death in the
name of fun (skydivers, those who experiment with new designer
drugs, etc), some of us are willing to face significantly increased
*risks* of death in order to secure our freedoms.

And some of us have, shall I say, slightly diminished respect for
people who are ready to sell out all their freedoms in exchange
for a reduced risk of death. But these are personal decisions.

Lee asked about caffeine alternatives.

One alternative is L-phenylalanine.  Smart Basics (1-800-878-6520)
sells "Rise & Shine", an "energizing nutrient drink" with this as the
active ingredient, though it can have similar side effects to caffeine
and shouldn't be taken by "persons with the genetic metabolic disorder
PKU, psychosis, persons taking prescription MAO inhibitor drugs,
pigmented malignant melanoma cancer patients, those with Wilson's
disease or those who have a violent temper", according to the label.

The discussion about how to raise kids leads to the more general
societal question of how values and authority should override
individuals whose judgement in certain situations may be impaired. 

Children are generally assumed to lack good judgement, especially when
very young. But we all are like children in situations where we cannot
know some or all of the important outcomes of our actions, or where we
are aware of the outcomes but we attribute very different values to
those outcomes than do others who care about the outcomes and/or us, or
where we differ in the assessement of probabilities of various outcomes,
or all three.

Who/what is going to act as the parent in such situations? Who gets to
decide who is the child and who is the parent? Do "parents" have rights
to impose their wills on "children?" I will take a Devil's Advocate
position and say that (even in a post-human society) one of society's
most important functions is to be the "meta-parent," deciding the
policies that provide good answers to the above questions. As a
meta-parent society must strike numerous balances among competing values
and ignorance of outcomes. Else the resulting chaos and anarchy will
reduce the society's potential to achieve win-win outcomes, and to avoid
self-destruction (assuming self-destruction is something to be
avoided!).

Does this make me pro-government? No and Yes. Governments as we know
them today by and large abdicate their responsibilities to be good
meta-parents. But some form of self-regulating authority and enforcement
is clearly needed, just as real parents are.

Try DMAE.  I've been using it now for about 3 months.  It gives me the
same stimulation as caffeine without any of the side effects.  You
should be able to obtain a supply from any health food store.

I'd be nervous.  Algernon's Law - is choline hard to synthesize during
pregnancy?  Why wouldn't it be supplied naturally?  Are we sure that choline
isn't just activating one kind of memory which grows at the expense of others?

I refer to the 'Net as my ELTM - Extended Long-Term Memory.

Once, my father accidentally destroyed a large section of my files, including
most of my old childhood work such as fourth-grade book reports.  It felt
horrible, as if that part of my life had simply been obliterated.  Human
memory is so mucky and fragile that we Information-Age types use computers as
"ontological stabilizers".  (Which term I invented, on the fly, without
realizing it, in what had previously been an ordinary conversation.  Man, did
I get a strange look...)

The following is a REPOST of an explanation of the split-photon experimen=
t,
which I last posted to this list on Feb. 5th.

-----

The five-minute explanation of the basic counterfactual split-photon expe=
riment:

                 1          =

                 |           Arrows indicate direction. =

       A/--------/---2       A single photon leaves START,
        |       D|           and is reflected from mirrors. =

        |C       |           What is the chance that the photon
START---/--------/B          will reach target 1, or target 2? =


There are four mirrors: {A, B, C, D}.  {A, B} are "fully silvered"
mirrors:  They always reflect a photon.  {C, D} are "half-silvered"
mirrors:  They reflect a photon 50% of the time.

Under "classical" physics, the sort we're used to seeing, the photon has
a 50% chance of being reflected from C.  If reflected from C, it will
bounce off A and thus reach D.  Now we roll the dice again:  It has a
50% chance of being reflected again and reaching 1, and a 50% chance of
reaching 2.  Thus, since the photon only has a 50% chance of going down
path A (the path intercepted by mirror A), the total contribution of
path a is a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.

Path B is likewise.  The photon has a 50% chance of going down path B. =

Then it reaches mirror D and has a 50% chance of being reflected and
reaching 2, and a 50% chance of continuing to 1.  So path B contributes
a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.

Summing up the contributions, we find that the chance of reaching 1 is
(25% + 25% =3D 50%), and that of reaching 2 is (25% + 25% =3D 50%).  Thus=
,
under classical physics, a photon has an equal chance of reaching A or
B.

Quantum physics is different, and weirder.  Probabilities in quantum
physics are measured by complex numbers, of the form (a + bi).  Now we
perform the calculation again, but this time, mirrors not only change
the *path* of the photon - assuming they reflect it - but they also
change the *phase* of the photon by 90=B0 or a quarter-turn.  In practice=
,
they multiply the probability of the photon being in a particular place
by i, the square root of negative one.  What this all means will soon
become clear.

Now recalculate the probabilities.  A photon is emitted from START, with
a probability of 1, or 1 + 0i, of being there.  It hits mirror C.  Now
the photon has (1 + 0i)*(i)=3D(0 + i) or i "probability" of going down
path A, and a 1 "probability" of going down path B.  In the branch of
reality in which the photon goes down path A, the photon hits the mirror
A and reflects again, so the photon now has an (i)*(i)=3D(-1) quantum
"probability" of getting to D.  The photon hits D and "splits" again,
part of it getting to target 2 (without being reflected) with a
"probability" of -1, and part hitting target 1 with a "probability" of
-i.  So far, therefore, the photon has a -1 "probability" of being at
target 2 and a -i "probability" of being at target 1.

Interlude:  The reason "probability" has quotes around it is because
there is no such thing of a -50% chance of something happening.  In
quantum physics these are called probability amplitudes.  We will soon
see how probability amplitudes are converted to genuine, normal,
positive, real, probabilities.  But for now, don't be concerned by
probabilities like -1.

Now let's continue with the branch of reality in which the photon goes
down path B, with a probability of 1.  It gets reflected by B, and
continues with a probability of i.  It gets to D.  Along one branch, it
is not reflected and gets to target 1 with a probability of i.  Along
another branch, it is reflected and gets to target 2 with a probability
of (i)*(i)=3D(-1).  So for branch B, the contributions are an i
probability of getting to target 1 and a -1 probability of getting to
target 2.

Now we sum the branches of reality, just like with normal
probabilities.  Branch A gives a -i probability of getting to target 1,
and branch B gives an i probability.  i + -i equals 0.  They cancel
out.  There is probability amplitude zero of getting to target 1. =

Branch A and branch B both give -1 probability amplitude of the photon
getting to target 2.  -1 + -1 =3D -2, for a -2 probability amplitude of
the photon getting to 2.

Now convert probability amplitudes to probabilities.  This we do by
taking the "squared modulus", which for a complex number (a + bi), is
equal to a squared plus b squared, or (a * a) + (b * b).  The chance of
getting to target 1 is 0, or zero squared plus zero squared.  The chance
of getting to target 2 is 4, or -2 squared plus zero squared.  4 chances
of getting to target 2, 0 chances of getting to target 1, so there's a
100% chance of getting to target 2.

That is, quantum physics says that instead of a 50% chance of getting to
either target, every single photon "splits" into two separate branches
of reality, goes down *both* paths, *interferes* with *itself*, and
winds up at target 2.

But suppose we remove mirror C, so that all photons go down path B?  Or
suppose we place a rock in the middle of path A?  Then the two paths no
longer cancel out.  There's an i probability of getting to target 1, for
a (1*1) or 1 chance of getting there.  There's a -1 probability of
getting to target 2, or (-1*-1)=3D1 chance of getting there.  A 50% chanc=
e
of getting to either target.

What's worse, just *measuring* the photon will influence the probability
that it gets to its target - even if it doesn't deflect the photon by so
much as an inch.  Because when you measure a system, all probability
amplitudes are *immediately* converted to probabilities and the system
"collapses" or is "reduced" to a single branch of reality.  The photon
is suddenly in only one place in only one branch of reality.  This is
known as "the collapse of the wavefunction" or "state-vector reduction".

So if we replace mirror A with a "measuring device" that reflects the
photon as usual, but also lights up a little device that says the photon
has passed, the photon has a 50% chance of reaching target 1 or 2, just
like in classical physics.  Because when mirror A measures the system -
when hit by a photon in the branch of reality where the photon goes down
path A - the system is "reduced".  The photon has an i probability of
being on path A, and a 1 probability of being on path B.  Squared
amplitudes - 1 chance A, 1 chance B.  So the photon will wind up on
either A or B with a 50% chance - but not on both A and B with i and 1
probability.  There are no longer two branches of reality.  The photon
does split again when it reaches target 1 or target 2, but it has a -1
probability for 1 and an i probability for 2, which works out to 50/50
again.

As you'll recall from way back in the beginning, you can use this trick
to observe an object without touching it.  Take the Elitzur-Vaidman
bomb-testing problem.  We have been supplied with a large number of
bombs, with detonators so sensitive that a single photon reflecting from
one will set off the bomb.  The problem is that most of our bombs are
duds.  The detonating mechanism doesn't work.  And it's impossible to
test the detonating mechanism without reflecting a photon from it. =

Question:  How do you produce a bomb that is guaranteed to work...
without blowing yourself up?

Answer:  This problem, as presented, is *impossible* in classical
physics.  But quantum physics can provide a solution. =


Replace mirror A... with a bomb.  Since the bomb constitutes a
"measuring instrument" - that is, it blows up if a photon strikes it,
but doesn't blow up otherwise - the photon now has a chance of
reflecting off B, and winding up at target 1.  (And an equal chance of
reaching target 2... and of course it's only 50% that it reaches
*either* target instead of blowing up the bomb.)

Thus we can determine whether the bomb is a measuring instrument
*without* *even* *touching* *it*!  However, although you can measure
something without a photon having touched it in that branch of reality
which turns out to be real, it still has to be possible that the photon
*could* have touched it, or rather it has to be the case that the photon
*did* touch it in an alternate branch of reality.  Thus this trick does
not constitute FTL.

On the other hand, if you have a photon that is 'locked' to the one
inside the system, but in another galaxy, measuring the Andromeda photon
will cause the photon in the experimental apparatus to collapse as
well.  Once collapsed, it has a chance of reaching target 1, which it
did not have before.  Thus if you can achieve this sort of 'lock',
which, as I understand, you can - using the recent discovery as reported
in SciAm, you can synchronize the quantum states of large numbers of
photons - you have instantaneous communication, somebody wins a Nobel
Prize, and all hell breaks loose in the field of physics.

Even if you can't 'lock' photons, the experimentally confirmed Bell
inequalities demonstrate that performing a *particlar* measurement can
influence the outcome of another measurement performed on the other side
of the galaxy.  There are various reasons why you can't use Bell to
transmit information, but any way you look it at, quantum mechanics and
relativity are having screaming catfights.

I hope that cleared everything up.

Quantum theory says it can, but we can never know for sure, since the 
initial conditions and constants cannot be determined with infinite 
accuracy. Therefore it seems that every theory involving irrational 
numbers could be replaced by a theory that doesn't, and the two 
theories would be observationally equivalent, although the 
replacement theory would presumably be less elegant and simple than 
the original.

How do people who believe that upbringing accounts 
for much of the variability of intelligence explain the fact 
that the correlation coefficient between adopted children reared 
together is only 0.02?

I'd want to see the raw data, but my guess would be that
variability of intelligence is extremely sensitive to neonatal
environment. Adopted children probably have a more disruptive
neonatal environment, and even adopted children "reared
together" may have drastically non-correlated neonatal
experiences.

If the study binned data from adopted children "reared together"
who were adopted at ages as old as four or five, then that would
certainly explain the low correlation. Intelligence seems to be
far more sensitive to the environment in the first five years than
it is to environment in later childhood. A closer look at the data
and the collection methodology would be needed to resolve this
particular question.

It all depends on the age of the children at which the period
of "being reared together" began.

I like it!  Actually, that's pretty much what I *did* say - quick gestures
at multiple optional limbs, easy sex change, uploading into VRs morphed by
the imagination; all this did, of course, was halt the flow, alas, because
I was dealing with bizzy, glitzy, secondhand-car-ad-mouthers here on
jittery drive-time radio.  

However, as Greg Egan's terrific novel DISTRESS suggests, while lobotomies
might not ever be a fashion statement, elective autism might be.

But as the old saying puts it so wisely: `I'd rather have a free bottle in
front of me than a pre-frontal lobotomy.'

You really need to check out Java, and especially JavaBeans. Sun is in
essence
trying to make JavaBeans do exactly what you describe, And, if you don't
have
the right Beans, you can go get the ones you need from anybody who will
give them or sell them to you, or program your own. You aren't stuck
with a single-vendor solution. Microsoft seems to see the threat, so
they are atempting to weasel out of their agreement to support Java.

Well, my decision is based more on monkey see monkey do than any
in-depth analysis. There are indeed such achives at cryonet, which 
I read a couple years ago. They go into some detail on the various
squabblings and fallings-out, which didn't interest me.
I do admire the heroism displayed in the Dora Kent affair, like the 
people at Alcor, and feel they have a size advantage. The facility is 
also not more than 3 hrs air time from Seattle or San Jose.

You're up against tough competition.  Don't think that Microsoft is one to
rest on its laurels...  Microsoft has invested significant research dollars
into a variety of improvements to their OS which will have a profound
impact on the way we interact with our computers, if only because Microsoft
is monopolizing the market.


Take a look:  http://www.microsoft.com/research/default.htm

Especially take note of "Intentional Programming," which reminds me a lot
of what you're talking about.  (They refer to components where you refer to
objects.)  Also note Natural Language Processing, which I'm told has
undergone significant enhancement since its first implementation in the
Microsoft Office Answer Wizard...  I know *I* would spend a great deal for
a computer running a NLP UI that WORKED.

IMUninformedO, NLP or something similar is the next UI breakthrough,
bridging the gap between the GUI and the neural interface; I'm also not
convinced that AI is necessary to understand language.

Carry on...

I'd suggest this:  The genetic stuff determines your predisposition to react
in certain ways to certain stimuli.  So adopted children reared together react
in totally different ways, being genetically unrelated.  Twins reared apart
tend to encounter some of the same stimuli naturally.

So, same upbringing vs. different upbringing, for the genetically unrelated,
makes no difference in intelligence; they react in different ways.  But, given
the same genetic material, you start to notice differences in upbringing.

In other words, what this data tells us is that upbringing, although a major
factor, has effects which are almost totally dependent on genetic
predispositions.  You therefore cannot compare two styles of upbringing,
except for a particular genetic base.

True, myelinization does help, but not much. Without myelinization a signal
might move at 5 or 10 meters per second,  in axons that have a thick myelin
sheath around them  nerve impulses reach about 100 meters per second.
Light moves at 300,000,000 meters per second. I'm not impressed.

Evolution almost never picks the best move, it doesn't need to, it just needs
to be better than the competition.

        From what I saw at the conference, the Prometheus Project looks
pretty promising.  I particularly liked Paul's [Wakfer] position on the
potential placing of dewars in hospitals for patients who have decided to
be frozen.  If hospitals had their own dewars, the freezing process could
take place much quicker than having to be shipped to a faraway facility.
Also, the Prometheus Project has plans to set up (in the future) a group of
people who will be able to familiarize the client with his surroundings
upon reanimation.  I quite appreciated Paul's honesty as he was explaining
his project; he was very open about the fact that cryonics is by no means a
sure thing.  He could have glossed over the cryonics industry by claiming
that reanimation would be inevitable, but he treated it as a "best
alternative" situation...a stand which I really respected.  When *I* sign
up for cryonic suspension, I think that I will go with the Prometheus
Project...it looks very stable (lots of funding) and Paul is a reputable
physicist and businessman to boot.

I see what is attractive about suggesting that gender will become
increasingly individualized, but when I puzzle through just what that
might mean I find myself a bit befuddled...  I mean, there's an important
sense in which gender is already an infinitely individualized phenomenon,
defined by unrepeatably quirky histories, and flavored by a heady froth of
kink.  Sex, gender, and sexuality reverberate with one another in
complicated ways.  The conventional conceptualization of their relation is
to think of sex as the biological substrate onto which gender as cultural
construct is uneasily grafted and which in turn gives rise to the
individual outpourings of sexuality, the expressions of individual sexual
psyches. This tabulation overlooks (among other things) the extent to
which the so-called foundational/biological sexual dimorphism may in fact
play to the interests of the so-called non-foundational/cultural gender in
the first place.  Judith Butler likes to point out that when the doctor
says of a newborn, "It's a girl," she or he is not just identifying some
neutral physiological fact about the infant, but pronouncing the first
line of a script into which the child is immersed quite without a clue, a
script which is expected to contain lots of lines she didn't author (e.g.,
"I now pronounce you man and wife"), a script from which she undeniably
can *deviate* but no less undeniably not without important risks and
costs.
	What we're really talking about here I guess are modes of
*identification*, and while it is delicious to contemplate the prospect of
identities that are smoothly engineered to our own specifications, I think
we would would find the reality of such identities less than perfectly
appealing.  When Wilde quipped that "Only the shallow know themselves," he
was (as usual) deadly earnest.  We are always importantly opaque to
ourselves, we are always surprising ourselves, exploring our
potentialities.  I like the formulation (Arkuat's, I believe) that sex is
just some seriously high-bandwidth communication, but I worry that this
formulation may conjure a fantasy of an ideal sexual encounter as a kind
of unimpeded free-flow of info... Just as important surely to the sexual
expression of desire are the ways in which that expression is a
negotiation among and overcoming of expectations and social scripts and
relations of power, none of which are fully authored by us.  Think of how
my maleness, my masculinity, my effeminacy, my queerness, my topness or
bottomness are all registered from moment to moment in the expression of
desire and sexual play.  We cite and subvert the scripts, but we hardly
create the playing field ab initio.  What could it mean to do so
intelligibly? Nanotechnology will no more junk gender than it will
language or the economy.  Best, Dale

Yes, it is a promising project, but is only a research program at present,
with no specific plans for actual storage. As one of the original PP pledegers,
($5000/yr, $2000 for pilot project) my motivation here is to help explore 
alternatives to liquid nitrogen temperature storage and the associated 
freezing damage. _If_ the research pans out I as well as others would switch 
to that type of storage, assuming I'm not already suspended in LN2.
In the meantime, Alcor and the like are the only game in town.

I will be travelling to Moscow by end of the next week. It is very
possible me not having any net access for the next two months -- to keep
the mailbox from exploding, all incoming traffic will be diverted to
/dev/null, starting with next Thursday. (I will let the .forward point to
my new address asap, of course, in case I get one).

P.S. I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to this year's Extro, an unique

Just an additional note: 

This assumes the system lives until long after the last useful data
has vanished, which isn't that likely. For lifetimes short compared
to 1/p, then the non-error correcting system has an advantage, but it
vanishes in time.

Well, as you point out, that is good enough for evolution. Even if we
could increase the axonal speed a lot, we would still be limited by
the synaptic transmission speed, which is on the order of
milliseconds. Making our brains significantly faster requires a
complete remodeling of the neurons.

Good questions. The papers I have read (see below) are a bit unclear
on this. My impression is that a high choline level biases some
reactions in favor for developing more receptors of certain kinds and
likely more growth of cholinergic neurons. A wild guess would be that
some kinds of memory are improved at the expense of others, but it is
hard to tell what would happen in humans.

I believe brains evolved from an unmyelinated state to a myelinated state. 
Since this did involve an additional investment of biological energy, myelin
is almost certainly an evolutionary advantage.

That being the case - I think that giving choline supplements to pregnant
women is fine(*), but bearing in mind that the children will be Algernons.  In
other words, you create a limited number instead of putting choline in the
water supply.  As I said elsewhere, comparing humans to Algernons is futile,
so the children won't be "worse" or "better" in any absolute terms.  But
they'll be better off, having a better position in the supply-demand equation.
 And from a wider perspective, it's best to have as many different types of
human as possible.  The more types, the better the chance that any given
problem will have a person capable of solving it.

(Note that the issue of "informed consent" doesn't arise; you'd need that only
if you were acting on preexisting persons.  Creating new people entirely falls
under a totally different set of ethical laws.)

In the context of the conversation, I was claiming that human memory had a
fuzzy ontological basis - wetware - while computers were founded on clear,
unambiguous ones and zeroes.  In other words, it was an issue of substrate
rather than distortion... hence the phrase; the implication was that the
existence of information in clear and unchanging terms would stabilize the
high-level wavering of the wetware through the Laws of Similarity and Contagion.

Yes there are -- several.  But the problem is made very difficult by the 
lack of internal and external metrics (see my CIX 'Liberty' (NCCL) 
conference essay).

We can establish a civil-law rights-based approach, which provides for a 
_presumption_ of incapacity to give informed consent below a defined age 
(or alternatively, a set of objective parameters).  The Courts (and the 
judge) could test the validity of the presumption if it is challenged by 
the older or the younger party.  Kids have rights, too.  Deprive them of 
the right to say 'yes' and there saying 'no' becomes rather less valuable 
and worthy of respect.  That's part of the problem.

The statute and the prosecution are unlawful and unconstitutional.  She 
should walk free from the Court on August 29.  And we need every good 
teacher we can get, especially looking at the poor shape the world's in right now.

I've proposed that she teach again via the Internet and multimedia.

OK.

This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).

There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William 
Kinkaid [publ. RKP]  which I haven't read.

Let's look at this seriously.

Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)


Following logician Alfred Tarski, we can say:

"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les 
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, 
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such 
relationships are known in France as 'Special friendships.'  There's a 
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No 
sex in it, BTW.


We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of 
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext 
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent 
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not 
binary.  They range from people being completely erotically indifferent to 
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but 
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.


Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a reproductive context. So 
we're not dealing with sexuality at all -- pre-pubescent girls cannot 
reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except with fertile 
females.

So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally 
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred 
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic 
interactions - an exchange of intellectual and sensory experience.

But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- 
again, there is no external metric.  And they can therefore have _no 
impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other people can 
sense them at some tacit level).

Insofar as pre-pubescent children actually have no capacity -- knowledge and 
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense 
it in other people, or understand it either.

So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.

But is it objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Cut to the chase.


People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly 
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on 
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in 
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  

Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it 
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of 
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and [coercive-type] schools.  There 
is much empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on 
children (genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the 
home: people who have 'legitimate' power over them.

In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented 
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, 
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.


[ August 19 1997 Note:  I'm an adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District 
Attorney's Office in the JonBenet Ramsey case  Either -- vastly unlikely 
-- one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more probable -- 
it was a carefully [plannned political] 'demonstration' killing, carried 
out by paid psychopaths.  The investigating authorities are not making it 
very easy to discover the facts in this matter].  Time will tell.


Asking 'What powerful and unpleasant people has John Ramsey upset?' might 
prove a fruitful line of inquiry.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with 
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, activated in 
crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal,  This 
can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and given 
Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent to 
the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.

        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  
Taining children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. 
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in 
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This 
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of 
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by 
the governing hierarchical authorities.

Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in 
the Seventies.  

Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, 
Howard, Shephard) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is now 
actually being made available to children under threat within their 
homes, in America...

Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little 
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each 
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.

The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, 
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- 
so-called 'safe sex.'

The social-control freaks are _really pissed off_ about this failure.  A  
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.

Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and 
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, 
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.

It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.

Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern 
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as 
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go 
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures 
and text.

        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive 
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  
Coercion. Wonder why?

No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: -- 

                                  VOTES

                               MANIPULATION

                              BIGGER BUDGETS

                       MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the 
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  >:-}


But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his 
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvemet with -- and on occasion 
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve 
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to 
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a 
moment longer.


With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to 
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat 
trainer.  He trained to fly one-way nuclear mission against the USSR -- 
which would have killed and maimed million of people, had been ordered to 
do it.  Quite futile, too -- when someone asked 'but we haven't the fuel 
capacity to get back, they were told: "What do you think will be left here 
to get back to?"

He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, but is 
still an 'out' gay in Oz.


I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to 
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and 
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, 
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged 
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect 
to go on 'doing it.'

All too true.


A little later, he was found dead by his mother and sister.

That's the sort of response that says:


"We prefer killing people, destroying their lives. creating a climate of 
terror, letting children suffer and die, instead of PREVENTING CHILDREN 
BEING HARMED BY GIVING THEM FREE RADIO PANIC ALARMS as these trounlesome 
defenders of unpopular cases keep telling us to."


Mustn't let the _children_ decide, and be in command of their own defence 
in these matters, must we now?

Meanwhile, kids are suffering and dying, almost entirely at the hands of 
adults who are known to them (including their parents), an an oppotunity 
to extend draconian controls by the State goes unopposed -- by you, 
anyway.  For practical purposes, you're encouraging one of the worst 
outbreaks of 'moral panic' for a hundred years, with dire 'knock-on' 
effects on everyone's fundamental civil liberties.

That seems to be acceptable to you.

What the hell are you doing _here_, posturing as being concerned about 
civil liberties -- including the rights of children to say 'yes' and 'no' 
and have their wishes respected and enforced.  That's what all this is 
really about.

I'll point out that Cryocare was founded by a lot of the people
involved in the Dora Kent affair (Saul Kent, among others). Cryocare
is really a split-off more than an independantly evolved organization.

Personally, if I deanimate I want Mike Darwin supervising the process
of pumping me full of gunk, and I prefer to have more control over the
disposition of my patient care funds, so I picked Cryocare, since
Alcor has no provision to let you choose things like who will do your
suspension and where you get stored...

Another thing to think of (Mike mentioned it when we visited
Cryocare) is where the storage containers are: how likely are they to
be damaged by earthquakes, violence or accidents? It would be
interesting to hear the different views of standing containers,
horisontal containers, containers in basements and containers in the
foundations of the building.

Quite so.  Most notably, I hear Anders' voice when I read his posts
now -- I love that accent!  (It also happens that the voice helps
me understand his posts better, since I can get a better idea of
which words he would emphasize.)

I would agree with this- his methods are quite innovative,
the research is brilliant even.

Hmmm... maybe I'll do more research before making this decision. I 
thought Alcor stored at Scottsdale AZ?

I think it might be funny to see how singles bars change -- "There's
yes-yes in your eyes" would become harder to argue with, and shy people
could have their desires known more easily.  It could also cause some
fights among the jealous types -- after a stranger walks by, one partner
complains to the other 	"Hey -- that was more than 'just looking'!".

I also worry about the sorts of situations (remembering a movie, here)
where real wackos get off on raping and murdering so they can feel the
panic/anger/etc. "vibes".

It also occurs to me that if these sorts of things can be recorded,
the recordings might make useful evidence in rape trials.  Or to
remind feuding or fading couples how they used to feel.

Im not mathematically inclined enough (either), to debate the margins

differences.

Eliezer and JKC have recently dissected different types of emotions
quite nicely. Your line of reasoning might also be applied to another
abused concept, namely consciousness.  This is what Ned Block does in
his essay "On A Confusion About A Function Of Consciousness" at
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.block.html from which I
quote:

<The concept of consciousness is a hybrid or better, a mongrel
concept: the word `consciousness' connotes a number of different
concepts and denotes a number of different phenomena. We reason about
"consciousness" using some premises that apply to one of the phenomena
that fall under "consciousness", other premises that apply to other
"consciousnesses" and we end up with trouble. There are many parallels
in the history of science. Aristotle used `velocity' sometimes to mean
average velocity and sometimes to mean instantaneous velocity; his
failure to see the distinction caused confusion (Kuhn, 1964). The
Florentine Experimenters of the 17th Century used a single word
(roughly translatable as "degree of heat") for temperature and for
heat, generating paradoxes. [Snip] These are very different cases, but
there is a similarity, one that they share with the case of
`consciousness'. The similarity is: very different concepts are
treated as a single concept. I think we all have some tendency to make
this mistake in the case of "consciousness".>

One of the highlights of my trip to Extro 3 was the discovery that Forrest
Bishop has also given serious thought to blowing up the Sun.  He's come up
with a totally different method.  We had a wonderful conversation about
that, and related topics.  There can't be many people who have considered
how to blow up the Sun, but two of them were at Extro-3.  For two days, the
Doubletree San Jose was the world's leading center for Solar detonation
research.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

This message describes an amazing concept I came up with recently.  I
haven't worked out all the details, but if it's true it would be very cool.

Consider an advanced civilization/organism, that has converted all the
planets in the solar system into a Dyson sphere.  That's all very well, but
isn't it inconvenient that 99.9% of the mass of the system hasn't been put
to good use?  It's just sitting there, being a very inefficient fusion
generator.  How can we dismantle it, so we can get it to give up its energy
faster, and extract some useful materials from it?  Here's how!  

Remember that message I sent out a few weeks ago, about how you could build
a device that could hover indefinitely in the atmosphere of the Sun?  Well,
consider this: such devices could be made self-reproducing, so they could
cover much of the area of the Sun, and then used to extract raw materials
from the substance of the Sun.  The Sun is currently 75% hydrogen, 24%
helium, and 1% other stuff, mostly carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.  The
hydrogen and helium are so abundant as to be valueless, so we leave them.
The heavier elements can be extracted to build more Dyson sphere.  

The cool thing is that we can extract from the atmosphere two isotopes that
are both fairly abundant and have what astrophysicists call 'fragile
nuclei', meaning that they are good fuels for fusion reactions.  The two
isotopes are helium-3 and nitrogen-15.  These are lousy fuels compared to
deuterium and tritium, which is what all fusion bombs and reactors have used
to date, but all the deuterium and tritium in the Sun burned up long ago.

The outer layer of the Sun is swirling around, constantly bringing new
material to the surface.  This layer has about 70% of the volume of the Sun,
and 10% of the mass.  So the extraction machines at the surface can go on
for a long time before running out of stuff to process.  After a few hundred
thousand years, we will have extracted most of the helium-3 and nitrogen-15
in the swirly part of the Sun (the core of the Sun is non-swirly and doesn't
mix with the outside).  This will amount to a ball about the size of the
Earth.  

This ball is the mother of all fusion bombs.  Unfortunately, unlike the
regular kind, it burns relatively slowly.  It needs something to hold it
together while it burns up.  I spent a long time designing impractical
systems of crashing planets and self-imploding bombs before I realized that
there is one place in the Solar system where there is enough pressure to
hold the bomb together while it burns: the center of the Sun.  And the heat
of the Sun can provide a handy ignition source.

One of the problems with using the Sun for heat and pressure is that it is
very springy: any increase in fusion rate at the center will increase the
pressure, which will cause the Sun to expand, which will cool the gas,
causing the heat production to slow.  You can get around this by mixing some
lead with the fusion fuel, forming degenerate matter, which does not expand
when the temperature increases, and is also a good insulator at these
temperatures, so the heat will tend to stay confined in the bomb until
burning is complete.

How to get the bomb to the center of the Sun?  I suggest wrapping it in a
few thousand miles of inert, abundant stuff (say aluminum and silicon) and
then just dropping the whole ball in.  The Sun is, after all, gas all the
way down, and much less dense than the bomb, so according to my calculations
the bomb should   fall to the core in about half an hour.  Just how much of
the outer layers gets stippped off by air resistance on the way is hard to
know; such calculations are at the cutting edge of present-day astrophysics.

So, having dropped the bomb to the center of the Sun, we wait for it to go
off.  For several weeks, fusion proceeds at a relativly sedate pace, as the
bomb slowly gets hotter and hotter.  The hotter it gets, the faster it
burns, etc, until it finally burns most of its mass in a tiny fraction of a
second.  This heats the lead enough to un-degeneratize it, this lets it
expand, and the entire Sun is given a mighty kick in the butt (well, the
core, but you get the idea).

The shock wave propagates out to the surface and either blows off a few
percent of the mass of the Sun or merely inflates the Sun to twice normal
size for a few hundred thousand years.  But wait, you say, that's all?  I
thought you were going to actually blow up the entire Sun!  Well, don't
worry, that's the next step.

Remember how ony the outer 10% of the Sun's mass was accesible from the
surface?  Well, now that the deep interior has been mightily heated,
convection will make the entire depth of the Sun swirly, and all of it will
eventually come to the surface.  99% of the Sun's helium-3 was down below
the layer we could reach before.  Now it will be brought up to the surface,
where we can build the grandmother of all fusion bombs with it.  This one is
about the size of Uranus.  We drop that in, wait a few weeks, and KABOOM!
The Sun is history.

>From the resulting gas cloud, we build lots of Jupiter Brains and all live
happily ever after until the Big Crunch.  But that's another story...

--CarlF 

PS. What's the reliability of this scheme?  Well, I read a few books on the
topic of thermonuclear astrophysics, the Sun and stellar interiors.  The
fusion rate calculations I'm pretty confident of, the degenerate matter
stuff is so-so, and the air resistance calculation is an extrapolation from
the current behavior of the Sun, which amounts to a wild guess.  I'm
confident that the Sun contains enough fusion fuel to blow it to
smithereens, so the problem is simply one of releasing the energy fast
enough and in the right place.

This company (GERN) was mentioned several times at Extro3, including the 
investment panel. I hope somebody moved on it.

With this announcement:

http://www.sjmercury.com/news/scitech/deathcell081497.htm

- --- Quote from above referenced article ---
Researchers have discovered what has been referred to as the holy grail of 
cell aging -- a find with great potential for combating cancer as well as 
for staving off the maladies of old age.

 More precisely, two separate scientific teams -- one from Geron Corp. of 
Menlo Park and the University of Colorado, the other led by researchers at 
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research of Cambridge, Mass. -- 
announced Thursday that they have been able to clone a protein that 
controls how long cells live.

...

``This is not just a very interesting scientific discovery. It has very 
practical applications,'' said Ronald Eastman, president and chief 
executive officer of Geron, a biotech company that already is working to 
develop drugs to combat cancer and aging.
 ``For the first time, we have the opportunity to enhance the lifetime of a 
normally dividing cell.''
- --- End Quote ---

The stock when into a feeding frenzy, shooting up nearly 200%. It's back 
down to 120% now.

I've been wathcing it all week and I had just about convinced myself to go 
in for a couple hundred shares. That'll teach me to move faster. 

It still might be a good investment, check this out:

- --- Quote from above referenced article ---
The twin discoveries of the gene sets up a potential battle over what could 
turn out to be a very lucrative biotech patent. But Geron officials believe 
they have a strong claim because the discoveries build on earlier work by a 
member of their team, Nobel Prize winner Thomas Cech of the University of 
Colorado in Boulder.

A year or two ago a gene was found in the roundworm C.elegans that if mutated 
allowed the worm to live 8 times its normal life span. This is not quite as  
exciting as it seems because the mutation also slowed down everything in the 
animal about 8 times. In today's issue of the journal Science Dr. Gary Ruvkum
found that if he made a change in another gene, called daf-2, the worm lived 
3 times as long BUT without slowing the animal down and putting it into a  
general torpor.

Ruvkum also found the daf-2 gene in humans and 35% of it is identical to the 
one in worms. In humans daf-2 codes for a protein in the outer wall of cells  
that is the receptor for insulin. Insulin is just information, it tells cells 
how much glucose to metabolize. The products of this metabolism are free
radicals and other nasty things thought by many to be responsible for aging 
and the reason that animals on a very reduced diet live longer.
 
People with non-insulin dependent diabetes also have a mutation in their 
daf-2 gene, although it's not know if it's the same one Ruvkum produced, 
these people can make insulin but can't use it efficiently, they don't live 
longer and that's puzzling. Maybe the extra glucose in the blood is more 
detrimental than other effects are helpful or maybe another mutation or 
another gene is involved, but I think it's hopeful and I'm not the only one.

Longevity expert Dr. Caleb E Finch of The University of Southern California 
says "I think it's  a gorgeous piece of work[...] the bottom line is that 
there may be fundamental mechanisms that prevail among all multicellular 
organisms and that may be very informative in managing human  aging. [...] 
as we learn more about the specific behavior of genes that predispose to 
health problems we will be able to modify many aspects of aging".

A very Catholic viewpoint, I can't help thinking. Men and women have normal
penetrative sex whilst specifically preventing reproduction, and I don't
think that changes the nature of their attraction in the slightest; it
continues to find a basis in a mutual desire for sex: that is, it remains
sexual.

I'm curious if this process is more efficient-productive than David

Java is close, but not close enough.  Java's good because it integrates the
operating system with the programming language.  However it's a bit loose on
the operating system side (Sun isn't sure if it is an OS).  The idea of
'thin-clients' (such as the Java based NC) is directly the opposite of
user-centricity (which favours a very fat client).  Sun's continued support
of NC is taking it in the wrong direction.

IMO, I think that Microsoft is more scared of the amount of hype Java is
getting than any real threat.  It's changing Java to support it's own
standards because it can't afford to put another layer on top of Win 95.

Microsoft's Millennium project (which I have mentioned in previous posts) is
very close to some of the ideas I spoke of.  Then again Windows 95 was a
fast, malleable and simple OS when it was in research.  Then they add the
corporate baggage!

How would you do language understanding (very different from recognition)
without AI?  How would the system match words with objects?  The great thing
about AI is I can tell my computer to do something no programmer ever dreamed
of, that will be the true computer revolution!

In the long-term we will have sensory-rich physically safe environments for
both adults and children.  At present we do need some form of parenting and,
yes, some form of government.  I believe in self-responsibility and
spontaneous order, but currently the majority of individuals, like children,
cannot support themselves.  Just as expect technology to increase the
self-sufficiency and individuality of adults, I believe it will also have
great affect on children.  If children are in an environment where they are
physically safe there is no need for any such parenting.

Anarchy is not against supplying information (it's not _against_ anything).
 The information to help you through life is there - at your fingertips - you
can decide whether to listen and use that information without the need for
coercion.  This can be done without government or parents.

Even a Child's mind can get by without government or parent coercion.
 Animals, with far less intelligence, survive far harsher environments than
any child does today (I'll admit the casualty rate is pretty high).  We are
increasingly moving towards physically safer (but mentally challenging)
environments.  We will still shape each other (even coerce each other) as
individuals, without the need for any imposed hierarchical structure.

Hierarchy          0
Anarchy            1

The more general problem here is the private mistreatment of sentient
beings.

In the future, it will be possible to create all sorts of minds, with
varying degrees of consciousness, intelligence, sentience, etc.  These
can be created in a state in which they are under the control of the
creator, who can mistreat them as he wishes.  (Think of Vinge's image of
the poor subject being "smeared across a million death cubes".)

These beings, who could be considered children (this might be a common
method of reproduction in the future, direct creation of new minds),
could be subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment, within the
privacy of someone's own home (or even within the privacy of someone's
own *mind*).

Can we expect to do anything about this?  Should we try?  Or must we
just resign ourselves to the fact that some people choose to mistreat
those less fortunate than themselves, and that the laws of nature make
this rather easy to do?

It's hard to see how to stop it without an omnipresent "blue goo", a
nanotech/infotech police force which monitors all information processing
and prevents the unauthorized creation of minds beyond some level of
sentience.  Not clear that such control is really possible, though.

Thanks for the reference, I wasn't aware of it.  I presume you're talking
about his paper that appeared in "Interstellar Migration and the Human
Experience".

Well, I don't have Crisell's paper to compare with.  But I suspect his work,
like that of Beech, was dedicated to *extending* the lifetime of the Sun,
whereas I want to *shorten* it.  They want to carefully husband resources,
whereas I want to extract as much as possible as quickly as possible.  By
making the whole mass of the Sun into fodder for controlled fusion, we
should be able to 'burn down' the Sun much more quickly than it is doing the
job by itself.  (This assumes that it is possible to feed a fusion reactor
on protons, which might not be possible.)

Now I've got to track down these papers...

To me, the by far most interesting question in this area is what are
the chances that our new global civilization will befall a similar
fate.  In the past the relative isolation of civilizations mean that
progress could continue even when most civilizations eventually seem
to grow rotten.  But now with an integrated global civilization, we
can't rely on sheer numbers - we have to make this one work.  Note
that within old civilizations, if one part of the civilization fell,
so did the rest of it.

I agree that this is a very important key in understanding how
thinking goes wrong.  Many of my early (and not especially good)
physics ideas were trying to pursue this line, to make physics basics
more like minds.  It took a long time to really accept that physics
fundamentals are probably nothing like minds.  It really is a very
strange fact to assimilate, relative to our "natural priors".

Much as I'd love to take credit and get a legitimate bibliographic
ref in such a fabulous post as this latest one of Dale's, I must
confess that I got the formulation from an article by ExI's own
Tom M0rrow, in EXTROPY #3 (I think).  (That's the third issue of

Extro conference we've been recently discussing.)

Your stronger claim may well be true, but I am drawn to focus on
explanations that I can ground out in evolutionary terms.  If you are
right, that just raises the puzzle of why there should be such "magic"
words for us.

Yeah. This takes my thread back to where it derives from, Paul M.
Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the
possibility (eliminative materialism) that hardly any of the words
that we currently use to describe psychological phenomena have any
actual referents.  Psychological phenomena might easily be concrete,
real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind
of one-to-one correspondence with any of the words we currently
use to talk about psychological phenomena. In other words, they
might *matter* without being *real*, in the sense that there might
not *really* be anything that corresponds to the words.  (Although
things might be different with a future vocabulary of neuropsychology.)
Obviously, it's difficult to be clear when speaking of such things,
and I hope I'm not just making an ass of myself.

It was interesting to me to see the same kind of process happening
in word that is not obviously psychological in its content:
"complexity". The source analogies (like the disappearance of
"caloric") are all from physics because it is in physics that it
is easiest to formulate new, alien, but very concrete paradigms
that replace older ones and show their flaws and errors in a way
that is much easier to perceive and think about clearly than changes
of paradigm in, say, the social sciences.

I agree with Luke and Anton that I'd have liked more time to talk.
Of course I knew that would be my position the moment I saw the
schedule.  Most big name people I know hardly spend any time at
conferences listening to talks.  They're mostly talking with people in
the halls etc.  

Let me add to the chorus of people who really enjoyed Extro 3.  What I
mainly enjoyed was meeting all you people in person.  You people are
much more like me, and like people I'm very comfortable with, than
most people I see most of the time.  I was also reminded how important
it was to meet in person sometimes.  I never really had one of those
in depth work-it-all-out conversations I imagine would be the payoff
of personal meetings.  But I did get a much better image of people's
styles and personalities, which helps me interpret and react to their
email postings.  I think it is very valuable for virtual communities
to meet in person periodically.

I'd say this lesson applies to adults as well.  When we're confused
about why someone does or says something, its way too easy to
attribute it to stupidity.  Usually something much subtler is going on.

Let me echo Anders here.  The relevance of game theory isn't going to

rational, but they should be able to better manage firewalls between
their internal plans and beliefs and the external image they portray.

Many people simply refuse to admit that they *do* understand, claiming
stupidity is a great way to not have to think about things.  This is
something I refuse to accept, I have always believed that if I do not
understand something it's because I do not have enough information on the
subject.  I don't think genetic stupidity is as abundant as the masses would
have us believe.  It's such a waste of much-needed brain power.

Many people have the experience (possibly illusory) of being able
to think more clearly, and particularly of being better able to
detect flaws in ideas, when they are in an argumentative frame of
mind.  Argument also represents an opportunity to invite other
people to find flaws in one's ideas. Possibly argument is the chief
means by which ideas are improved.

Perhaps not everyone experiences the "benefits" hypothesized above,
but if a significant fraction of the population did so, then the
idea of there being some selection pressure in favor of pure
argumentativeness doesn't seem completely implausible to me.
Particularly if that population were in a clade and had
frequent opportunities to argue with one another and exchange
new ideas arising in argument.

(Then again, maybe I'm just flattering myself.  ;)

Saying you'd "rather be dead than not free" and saying you "would except the
risk of death to fight for freedom" are two very seperate things.  Your view
is obviously optimistic (in that you are risking death for freedom), the
other is pessimistic (accepting death because you cannot see a chance for
freedom).

Personally, I think death and *no chance of freedom* are the same thing.

The theory needs to be coupled with a theory that explains why it is
easier to find flaws in ideas if individual people tie themselves to
specific ideas, rather than critiquing ideas one doesn't feel
especially tied to.

I realized one good reason why I've been uncomfortable with
discussions of all the new kinds and styles of sex that will someday
be possible.  Its the same reason I'm uncomfortable with disscussion
of all the kinds of sex that are possible today (and there's quite a
few).  

In a gathering of people some of who were literally starving for food,
I would feel uncomfortable talking about all the yummy variations of
chinese food that are possible to the minority of people who were not
only not starving, but rich enough to explore all those variations.  I
would fear that such a discussion would make the starving folks feel
worse and more envious.  Of course I would likely
engage in some charity in such a situation, but quite likely that
would not erase the have/havenot division.

Similarly, many people in our society are literally starving for sex,
at least of the sort that they value.  While our society is rich
enough to have plenty of food, the market for sex has many more
frictions that the market for food, and technology has not
substantially lowered the costs of sex.  Many people do not feel they
are attractive enough to be in much demand sexually, or for other
reasons are not able to participate.  And sexual charity is very
limited.  I fear that these people are just made to feel worse by
discussion of all the variations beyond their reach.

Note I'm not proposing to ban such discussions.  I'm just describing a
reason for my unease.

Overestimating the influence of genetic factors, or concentrating attention

     Since the 1970s, economists have speculated on the effects of
     the proliferation of new computer and communications
     capabilities on business structure and performance. The
     present analysis explores information technology's (IT)
     relationship to employment and firm structure by examining
     how IT affects the relative size of employment at auxiliary
     units. The analysis treats auxiliary units--establishments
     where employees provide support services (mainly
     administrative) to production establishments--as a proxy for
     the highest administrative levels of the organizational
     hierarchy. Changes in the relative size of auxiliary
     employment give a broad indication of IT-related changes in
     firm structure. Statistical analyses of 46 industries show
     large variations across industries in the size, sign, and
     statistical significance of the elasticities of auxiliary
     unit employment shares with respect to IT capital stock
     shares. We find no economy-wide trends associated with IT.
     There is too much variation among industries to rely on
     estimates obtained from pooling industry data. For the most
     part, sectorial trends are scarce. Only in the transportation
     sector do the sign and statistical significance suggest that
     IT related changes are similar. Ultimately, the enormous
     variation revealed by our results suggests that one cannot
     make economy-wide generalizations about the effects of IT.

     Nevertheless, our results, combined with other evidence,
     suggest that economies of scale--gained from using IT to
     reduce coordination and monitoring costs--influence firm size
     and structure. One reason why the effects of IT are so
     different across industries is variation in the firm size
     distribution across industries prior to the IT revolution:
     1) For industries with a predominance of small firms, IT-
     related economies of scale may encourage growth in firm size
     and lead to an increase in the relative size of centralized
     back office establishments across the industry. This appears
     to have occurred in the retail trade industry. 2) In some
     industries where large firms predominate, IT may induce
     greater efficiency in back-office jobs, enabling firms to
     reduce back office employment relative to total employment.
     This appears to have occurred in some of the transportation
     industries. 3) In industries where IT primarily substitutes
     for production workers, auxiliary unit employment share is
     likely to rise because central administration office
     employment tends to change less than proportionately in
     response to changes in overall employment. This appears to
     have occurred in the primary metals industry.

I suggest social shunning of people who seem to be torturing creatures
substantially different from themselves.  A positive prospect is that
the most useful experiments will probably be best done on copies of
yourself - that gives you the most info about improving yourself. 
So experimenting on creatures very different from yourself is already
suspicious.  Especially if those other creatures are smart enough do
decide for themselves what experiments would help them improves
themselves.  The problem is experiments on "dumb" different creatures.

I propose that a candidate for this second theory would be a
neurological theory, possibly examining the connections between
activity in (for example)

the Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the temporal lobe that seem to
be heavily involved in linguistic manipulations and "logical rigor"

and

the regions in the brainstem (and limbic system?) involved in
territoriality and aggressiveness.

Carefully distinguishing between the future fortunes of a meme and
the future fortunes of oneself is a hallmark of civilized behavior,
but I think it takes time for us to become civilized (people aren't
born civilized), and formalized argumentativeness may be a form of
physically-nonrisky display combat (common among animal species)
that helps us learn how to use language and how to pick apart and
analyze ideas.

Obviously, since the second theory you are requesting is a
neuropsychological one (or at the least the best candidate I
can come up with right now is) the matter will be open to
dispute for at least another few years.  ;)

I'm obviously no linguistics professor, but here's my view, anyway:

It doesn't necessarily have to understand real world concepts...  Just
accurately matching words with pre-written programs and objects is more
than enough.  For example, NLP already works quite well for Internet
searches, because it's able to tell the difference between a proposed law,
an invoice and a visor of a cap.  That is, a bill, a bill and a bill.  It
may not genuinely know or understand what these are, but it can still do a
pretty good job associating the words with prewritten HTML documents.

Getting the gist of what I'm trying to do, performing context-sensitive
searching and loading up pre-designed programs is still a big step forward
from the GUI, even if it falls way way short of AI.

There's no doubt about that!  Nonetheless, just understanding "Send this
year's sales report to my boss," loading up the database, compiling the
report, and mailing it off to my boss's e-mail address would be a
significant breakthrough compared to Office 97, IMHO.

True. I guess I can generalize this a bit. the really neat thing about
interacting with kids is that they are somewhat simpler than adults.
You can learn a lot about people in general by working with the
simpler model. The big problem for me is that they aren't necessarily
simpler in the ways you think they are or "should" be.

Another thing I've learned is that teaching is a very good way to
learn. I suspect that those of you in academia already know this,
but it's true even when teaching little kids: my mental math skills
are a great deal better than they were before my first kid was four.

I suspect that this will remain true even when our "children" are
new computer algorithms.

     The future course of old-age mortality is of great
     importance to public sector expenditures in countries where
     old-age programs, such as Social Security and Medicare in
     the US, account for large fractions of the public budget.
     This paper argues that the competitive market prices of
     mortality contingent claims, such as annuities and life-
     insurance, contain information which allow one to infer the
     opinion of the market regarding the pace of the continued
     increase in old-age longevity. The paper develops methods to
     identify and estimate the mortality implicit in the market
     prices of such claims by identifying survival functions from
     prices of contracts that differ in their duration. Utilizing
     these methods, we provide estimates using cohort-specific
     prices of US term life insurance contracts in 1990-96 for
     individuals aged 60 in each calendar year. Our main finding
     is that the mortality patterns inferred from these prices
     indicate a continued decline in cohort-specific mortality
     at rates equal to or greater than recent historical trends;
     about a 5 percent reduction in relative terms in the
     mortality hazards per successive cohort.

Obviously, but the design change need not be perfect or even good, just a
little better than contemporaries who made no change at all. With a design
philosophy that mediocre it's no wonder that in just a few years,  almost
certainly (much?) less than a century,  we'll be able to make brains as good
as those that took nature 3 billion years to come up with, and then go far
beyond.

Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau's father (John G. Schmitz) opposed sex

Her husband Steve agreed to bring the kid up as part of their family. He'd 
had a vasectomy, I'm told.  His parents didn't like the isea of a 
'mixed-race' (Samoan/American) child in the family, and she was confronted 
with an 'abortion-or-prosecution' alternative.  She rejected abortion: she 
loves her baby.

Sooo... Steve's parents jump the gun and go to the _Child Protection Unit_ 
in Seattle (Wonder on whose advice?) and destroy her life and her family, 
so that Steve and they will (they think) get custody, care and control of 
the kids.


Just guess who's waiting for them in the so-called 'Child Protection Office'?

Republican Ron Maleng's Chief of Staff Dan Satterberg (and who else besides?)

Well, I was baptized into the Anglican (Episcopalian to you!) Church.  Me 
and Cordwainer Smith too (Dr. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger) -- see his 
incomparable short story, "The Game of Rat and Dragon" (GALAXY, [1955)).

I was never Confirmed in the Anglican faith, because I could not give my 
rational assent to the Nicene Creed of 325 C.E.  Isaac Newton, many of 
whose views I share, believed in the doctrines of Arius, declared 
heretical by the Council of Nicea.  Newton also believed that the Western 
Empire ('LATHEINOZ') in Greek) was the work of the Devil, BTW.


More interestingly, Newton believed space to be the sensorium of God.  The 
sensorium is the space within which we imagine and visualize.  God 
imagines matter and forces in space and across time, not just pictures or 
images.  A Universe 'infinite in all directions' (anything else would be a 
limitation on unlimited powers - a view shared by Cardinal Nicholas of 
Cusa, who advanced precisely this view in @[1440], including the view that 
there were other inhabited planets circling other stars...

To me, 'sexual' means 'making babies.'  This activity subsumes many, many 
others, of course.

If they put their discovery into the public domain, and defend against
the other company trying to patent it, /then/ they'll get my life
savings invested in them.  Patents are sand in the gears of progress,
and the sooner companies realize that, the more millions they'll make.

Hi Perry,

I just wanted to send a belated thank you for the mail you sent to me on
this subject. I'm still thinking about the problem, and will be discussing
it with a few people when I'm over in the US.

Hi Chris,

I just wanted to thank you for you list of books on this subject. When I
have time I will be sure to look some of them up. But by then you might
have finished the definitive work on the subject: good luck with that.

To most people, and most dictionaries, 'sexual' means 'of or concerning
sex'. And sex does not mean making babies. I find it hard to agree that
heterosexual people having penetrative intercourse without a condom are
engaging in sexual activity, whilst those having penetrative sex with a
condom are not. "Making babies" is a subset of sex, not vice-versa.

	Growing self-organization is what sophisticated conspiracy theorists mean
by conspiracy.....why keep arguing against staw men?  Why not argue with
the ideas actually being proposed here and now?

	But, there is some centralized planning none-the-less.  Remember, the most
powerful forces on Wall Street sent their representatives to plan the
Federal Reserve cartel in secret at Jeckyl Island Georgia in 1913.  Paul
Warburg (Daddy Warbucks) had reviewed the history of Central Banking
cartels prior to the meeting and presented his results.  The shadowy
figures travelled to the train station in disguise and under false names to
avoid the press.  They came to an agreement and then sold their agenda
covertly "as a populist measure to limit the power of Wall Street"!  The
Jeckyll Island "conspiracy" is well documented in the autobiographies of
several of the attendees.

	And, now that we see their usefulness, let's have our Foundations take

with acceptable leaders, etc. etc.  CONSPIRACY

	No one said the scientific method was easy to apply to the study of
society, and extremely complex phenomenon.

	However, conspiracy theories are no more untestable than any other theory
of history.  And people do attempt to test them...pefectly cotnrolled
experiments, of course, are possible only to the rich and powerful in a
position try a conspiratorial strategy and see if it works...those using
the scientific method outside a conspiracy can only only look for data that
would tend to support or deny the theory and then make a reasonable
judgement....

This was one of the most egregious science blunders in

my daughter as we listened to this an said "the numbers don't
work!" She already had a grimace on her face.

There's also no right NOT to have sex, (or at least not to have the desire
for sex), not to fear, not to love, not to rage. Emotions  partly control
our daily life, our decisions, who we are, what we are, severely limiting
ones choice in these matters. Emotions are ruled by hormones/chemicals, yet
the few emotion 'enhancers' or 'blockers' available are crude (side
effects), and hard to obtain (medical prescription, illegal drugs, etc). I
can practically run into the supermarket for a sexual enhancer, but it will
be a long time before we can say the same for a cure for love, or other
emotion blockers. Maybe our lives are one long continous addiction to
chemicals.

True, in nature sexual intercourse has various social functions other than
just reproduction. (not all of them less 'sophisticated' than our own) The
point about having sex, and making sure there is no reproduction, is a
point of choice. The choice of the individual to block out natural
processes, and the realization that some may not be beneficial to that
individuals life. 

As said before, a 'right' to have sex isn't limited by other individuals,
but it could be severly limited by ones other emotions. Some people can
only have sex with someone they love,  others can only love someone they
have sex with, while some just can't step over their fears. (and then there
are those who can have sex with everyone, except they person they love ;) )

When will they make that emotional switching board brain implant, and make
the choices our own ?

"Heat", in modern thermodynamics, is used to refer to the thermic 
energy of a system.

"Tempererature" is used to denote a parameter describing the thermal 
distribution function, roughly a measure of the mean kinetic energy. 
It is interesting to note, however, that even this updated notion 
of temprature is rather out of tune with contemporary science. In 
some contexts (e.g. in certain quantum descriptions of lasers) there 
is talk of systems with hotter than infinite temperatures, or of 
temperatures below zero Kelvin. It is a matter of debate whether this 
is a concept extension or whether a new concept has been introduced. 
In my opinion it may be unwise to expect a yes/no answer, because it 
seems all to be very much a matter of degrees and aspects.
 
> I suspect that a similar disintegration is happening to the word

Yes, many people mistakenly think that our intuitive notion of 
complexity is a uniform,  precise one. It isn't, only 
certain mathematical (related) concepts are, but these tend to be 
irrelevant except for mathematicians.

On this list, people often seem to use the word "complexity" to 
mean:" system which I happen to find intellectually interesting". The 
people who do this then ususally assume without argument that the 
post-singularity future will be extremely complex in this sense. In 
my opinion, that is a possibility; but it is also very possible that 
it won't be, even if we assume that some form of highly intelligent 
life survives. We should be on our guard against possible biases that 
might make us inclined to believe in something just because it would 
be interesting it it were so. (Is this bias toward intellectual 
interestingness our equivalent to emotional biases more prominent in 
other groups?)

Paul Churchland's view is that folk psychology is false, and that it 
is false to such an extent that many of the terms it involves fail to 
denote -- there are (probably) no such things as feelings, 
propositional beliefs etc. just as there is no ether, no heat, no 
soul etc. This does not mean that all sentences involving those terms 
are meaningless or unimportant. Au contraire: untill we have a 
more mature neuroscience, folk psychology is still the best theory we 
have for describing  the more complex phenomena produced by the 
brain. But, Paul Churchland thinks, we already have good reason to 
believe that the concepts in folk psychology won't be reducible to 
concepts in the improved theory that will replace it. (Notice that 
from this perspective, reductionism would be the only way save our 
beliefs in thoughs and feelings and beliefs.)

Some philosophers have objected that the folk psychological terms 
have a special, normative, status that would protect them from the 
fate that befell "the ether" or "the vital force". Some believe that 
the folk psychological theory is not so off the mark as to be 
comparable to the the like of folk thermodynamics.

The "vital force" in medicine was once "observed" and theorized 
about, but it has been eliminated a long time ago. Similarly, I think 
few historians or social scientists today would like to construct 
theories involving such a notion as "blood consciousness".

Hi Perry,

I just wanted to send a belated thank you for the mail you sent to me on
this subject. I'm still thinking about the problem, and will be discussing
it with a few people when I'm over in the US.

Hi Chris,

I just wanted to thank you for you list of books on this subject. When I
have time I will be sure to look some of them up. But by then you might
have finished the definitive work on the subject: good luck with that.

What an ingenious idea Carl!

I'm curious if this process is more efficient-productive than David

heavier elements while converting it into a white dwarf?

One of the highlights of my trip to Extro 3 was the discovery that Forrest
Bishop has also given serious thought to blowing up the Sun.  He's come up
with a totally different method.  We had a wonderful conversation about
that, and related topics.  There can't be many people who have considered
how to blow up the Sun, but two of them were at Extro-3.  For two days, the
Doubletree San Jose was the world's leading center for Solar detonation
research.

I'd say this lesson applies to adults as well.  When we're confused
about why someone does or says something, its way too easy to
attribute it to stupidity.  Usually something much subtler is going on.

A very Catholic viewpoint, I can't help thinking. Men and women have normal
penetrative sex whilst specifically preventing reproduction, and I don't
think that changes the nature of their attraction in the slightest; it
continues to find a basis in a mutual desire for sex: that is, it remains
sexual.

To me, the by far most interesting question in this area is what are
the chances that our new global civilization will befall a similar
fate.  In the past the relative isolation of civilizations mean that
progress could continue even when most civilizations eventually seem
to grow rotten.  But now with an integrated global civilization, we
can't rely on sheer numbers - we have to make this one work.  Note
that within old civilizations, if one part of the civilization fell,
so did the rest of it.

I agree that this is a very important key in understanding how
thinking goes wrong.  Many of my early (and not especially good)
physics ideas were trying to pursue this line, to make physics basics
more like minds.  It took a long time to really accept that physics
fundamentals are probably nothing like minds.  It really is a very
strange fact to assimilate, relative to our "natural priors".

Much as I'd love to take credit and get a legitimate bibliographic
ref in such a fabulous post as this latest one of Dale's, I must
confess that I got the formulation from an article by ExI's own
Tom M0rrow, in EXTROPY #3 (I think).  (That's the third issue of
the magazine, not to be confused with the third instance of the
Extro conference we've been recently discussing.)

Let me echo Anders here.  The relevance of game theory isn't going to
go away, it should get stronger.  Not only will players get more
rational, but they should be able to better manage firewalls between
their internal plans and beliefs and the external image they portray.

The theory needs to be coupled with a theory that explains why it is
easier to find flaws in ideas if individual people tie themselves to
specific ideas, rather than critiquing ideas one doesn't feel
especially tied to.

I believe brains evolved from an unmyelinated state to a myelinated state. 
Since this did involve an additional investment of biological energy, myelin
is almost certainly an evolutionary advantage.

Many people simply refuse to admit that they *do* understand, claiming
stupidity is a great way to not have to think about things.  This is
something I refuse to accept, I have always believed that if I do not
understand something it's because I do not have enough information on the
subject.  I don't think genetic stupidity is as abundant as the masses would
have us believe.  It's such a waste of much-needed brain power.

To most people, and most dictionaries, 'sexual' means 'of or concerning
sex'. And sex does not mean making babies. I find it hard to agree that
heterosexual people having penetrative intercourse without a condom are
engaging in sexual activity, whilst those having penetrative sex with a
condom are not. "Making babies" is a subset of sex, not vice-versa.

I suggest social shunning of people who seem to be torturing creatures
substantially different from themselves.  A positive prospect is that
the most useful experiments will probably be best done on copies of
yourself - that gives you the most info about improving yourself. 
So experimenting on creatures very different from yourself is already
suspicious.  Especially if those other creatures are smart enough do
decide for themselves what experiments would help them improves
themselves.  The problem is experiments on "dumb" different creatures.

Many people have the experience (possibly illusory) of being able
to think more clearly, and particularly of being better able to
detect flaws in ideas, when they are in an argumentative frame of
mind.  Argument also represents an opportunity to invite other
people to find flaws in one's ideas. Possibly argument is the chief
means by which ideas are improved.

Perhaps not everyone experiences the "benefits" hypothesized above,
but if a significant fraction of the population did so, then the
idea of there being some selection pressure in favor of pure
argumentativeness doesn't seem completely implausible to me.
Particularly if that population were in a clade and had
frequent opportunities to argue with one another and exchange
new ideas arising in argument.

(Then again, maybe I'm just flattering myself.  ;)

I agree with Luke and Anton that I'd have liked more time to talk.
Of course I knew that would be my position the moment I saw the
schedule.  Most big name people I know hardly spend any time at
conferences listening to talks.  They're mostly talking with people in
the halls etc.  

Let me add to the chorus of people who really enjoyed Extro 3.  What I
mainly enjoyed was meeting all you people in person.  You people are
much more like me, and like people I'm very comfortable with, than
most people I see most of the time.  I was also reminded how important
it was to meet in person sometimes.  I never really had one of those
in depth work-it-all-out conversations I imagine would be the payoff
of personal meetings.  But I did get a much better image of people's
styles and personalities, which helps me interpret and react to their
email postings.  I think it is very valuable for virtual communities
to meet in person periodically.

Thanks for the reference, I wasn't aware of it.  I presume you're talking
about his paper that appeared in "Interstellar Migration and the Human
Experience".

Well, I don't have Crisell's paper to compare with.  But I suspect his work,
like that of Beech, was dedicated to *extending* the lifetime of the Sun,
whereas I want to *shorten* it.  They want to carefully husband resources,
whereas I want to extract as much as possible as quickly as possible.  By
making the whole mass of the Sun into fodder for controlled fusion, we
should be able to 'burn down' the Sun much more quickly than it is doing the
job by itself.  (This assumes that it is possible to feed a fusion reactor
on protons, which might not be possible.)

Now I've got to track down these papers...

If they put their discovery into the public domain, and defend against
the other company trying to patent it, /then/ they'll get my life
savings invested in them.  Patents are sand in the gears of progress,
and the sooner companies realize that, the more millions they'll make.

Well, as you point out, that is good enough for evolution. Even if we
could increase the axonal speed a lot, we would still be limited by
the synaptic transmission speed, which is on the order of
milliseconds. Making our brains significantly faster requires a
complete remodeling of the neurons.

Your stronger claim may well be true, but I am drawn to focus on
explanations that I can ground out in evolutionary terms.  If you are
right, that just raises the puzzle of why there should be such "magic"
words for us.

Saying you'd "rather be dead than not free" and saying you "would except the
risk of death to fight for freedom" are two very seperate things.  Your view
is obviously optimistic (in that you are risking death for freedom), the
other is pessimistic (accepting death because you cannot see a chance for
freedom).

Personally, I think death and *no chance of freedom* are the same thing.

I'm not sure I understand this post, or who it is from.

If it is from Robin Hanson -- he is a very attractive and enticing person.
Whether or not one is in "demand" or "able to participate" is really minor
to the obvious sexiness of one's attitude, brain and integrity.

True. I guess I can generalize this a bit. the really neat thing about
interacting with kids is that they are somewhat simpler than adults.
You can learn a lot about people in general by working with the
simpler model. The big problem for me is that they aren't necessarily
simpler in the ways you think they are or "should" be.

Another thing I've learned is that teaching is a very good way to
learn. I suspect that those of you in academia already know this,
but it's true even when teaching little kids: my mental math skills
are a great deal better than they were before my first kid was four.

I suspect that this will remain true even when our "children" are
new computer algorithms.

The more general problem here is the private mistreatment of sentient
beings.

In the future, it will be possible to create all sorts of minds, with
varying degrees of consciousness, intelligence, sentience, etc.  These
can be created in a state in which they are under the control of the
creator, who can mistreat them as he wishes.  (Think of Vinge's image of
the poor subject being "smeared across a million death cubes".)

These beings, who could be considered children (this might be a common
method of reproduction in the future, direct creation of new minds),
could be subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment, within the
privacy of someone's own home (or even within the privacy of someone's
own *mind*).

Can we expect to do anything about this?  Should we try?  Or must we
just resign ourselves to the fact that some people choose to mistreat
those less fortunate than themselves, and that the laws of nature make
this rather easy to do?

It's hard to see how to stop it without an omnipresent "blue goo", a
nanotech/infotech police force which monitors all information processing
and prevents the unauthorized creation of minds beyond some level of
sentience.  Not clear that such control is really possible, though.

Obviously, but the design change need not be perfect or even good, just a
little better than contemporaries who made no change at all. With a design
philosophy that mediocre it's no wonder that in just a few years,  almost
certainly (much?) less than a century,  we'll be able to make brains as good
as those that took nature 3 billion years to come up with, and then go far
beyond.

I propose that a candidate for this second theory would be a
neurological theory, possibly examining the connections between
activity in (for example)

the Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the temporal lobe that seem to
be heavily involved in linguistic manipulations and "logical rigor"

and

the regions in the brainstem (and limbic system?) involved in
territoriality and aggressiveness.

Carefully distinguishing between the future fortunes of a meme and
the future fortunes of oneself is a hallmark of civilized behavior,
but I think it takes time for us to become civilized (people aren't
born civilized), and formalized argumentativeness may be a form of
physically-nonrisky display combat (common among animal species)
that helps us learn how to use language and how to pick apart and
analyze ideas.

Obviously, since the second theory you are requesting is a
neuropsychological one (or at the least the best candidate I
can come up with right now is) the matter will be open to
dispute for at least another few years.  ;)

Just an additional note: 

This assumes the system lives until long after the last useful data
has vanished, which isn't that likely. For lifetimes short compared
to 1/p, then the non-error correcting system has an advantage, but it
vanishes in time.

I'm obviously no linguistics professor, but here's my view, anyway:

It doesn't necessarily have to understand real world concepts...  Just
accurately matching words with pre-written programs and objects is more
than enough.  For example, NLP already works quite well for Internet
searches, because it's able to tell the difference between a proposed law,
an invoice and a visor of a cap.  That is, a bill, a bill and a bill.  It
may not genuinely know or understand what these are, but it can still do a
pretty good job associating the words with prewritten HTML documents.

Getting the gist of what I'm trying to do, performing context-sensitive
searching and loading up pre-designed programs is still a big step forward
from the GUI, even if it falls way way short of AI.

>The great thing

There's no doubt about that!  Nonetheless, just understanding "Send this
year's sales report to my boss," loading up the database, compiling the
report, and mailing it off to my boss's e-mail address would be a
significant breakthrough compared to Office 97, IMHO.

I realized one good reason why I've been uncomfortable with
discussions of all the new kinds and styles of sex that will someday
be possible.  Its the same reason I'm uncomfortable with disscussion
of all the kinds of sex that are possible today (and there's quite a
few).  

In a gathering of people some of who were literally starving for food,
I would feel uncomfortable talking about all the yummy variations of
chinese food that are possible to the minority of people who were not
only not starving, but rich enough to explore all those variations.  I
would fear that such a discussion would make the starving folks feel
worse and more envious.  Of course I would likely
engage in some charity in such a situation, but quite likely that
would not erase the have/havenot division.

Similarly, many people in our society are literally starving for sex,
at least of the sort that they value.  While our society is rich
enough to have plenty of food, the market for sex has many more
frictions that the market for food, and technology has not
substantially lowered the costs of sex.  Many people do not feel they
are attractive enough to be in much demand sexually, or for other
reasons are not able to participate.  And sexual charity is very
limited.  I fear that these people are just made to feel worse by
discussion of all the variations beyond their reach.

Note I'm not proposing to ban such discussions.  I'm just describing a
reason for my unease.

It's not clear that Communism "requires less computing power."  Obviously
it does less good computing (of what to do and how), but remember that
the people who live in a communist world still have to figure out where
their next meal is coming from, what to do at work, where to live & how
to arrange that, how to live within or work around the rules, etc.  My
guess would be that the more crazy the situation the more computing has
to be done, just to get by.  The simplicity is false.

Maybe a better example of simplestraction is mass production.  Like the
Model T that was available in "any color as long as it's black."  There
there was actually a savings in complexity over individually-made cars.
With mass vs. custom production people are making a real choice between
simplicity and cost.

Yeah. This takes my thread back to where it derives from, Paul M.
Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the
possibility (eliminative materialism) that hardly any of the words
that we currently use to describe psychological phenomena have any
actual referents.  Psychological phenomena might easily be concrete,
real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind
of one-to-one correspondence with any of the words we currently
use to talk about psychological phenomena. In other words, they
might *matter* without being *real*, in the sense that there might
not *really* be anything that corresponds to the words.  (Although
things might be different with a future vocabulary of neuropsychology.)
Obviously, it's difficult to be clear when speaking of such things,
and I hope I'm not just making an ass of myself.

It was interesting to me to see the same kind of process happening
in word that is not obviously psychological in its content:
"complexity". The source analogies (like the disappearance of
"caloric") are all from physics because it is in physics that it
is easiest to formulate new, alien, but very concrete paradigms
that replace older ones and show their flaws and errors in a way
that is much easier to perceive and think about clearly than changes
of paradigm in, say, the social sciences.

There's also no right NOT to have sex, (or at least not to have the desire
for sex), not to fear, not to love, not to rage. Emotions  partly control
our daily life, our decisions, who we are, what we are, severely limiting
ones choice in these matters. Emotions are ruled by hormones/chemicals, yet
the few emotion 'enhancers' or 'blockers' available are crude (side
effects), and hard to obtain (medical prescription, illegal drugs, etc). I
can practically run into the supermarket for a sexual enhancer, but it will
be a long time before we can say the same for a cure for love, or other
emotion blockers. Maybe our lives are one long continous addiction to
chemicals.

True, in nature sexual intercourse has various social functions other than
just reproduction. (not all of them less 'sophisticated' than our own) The
point about having sex, and making sure there is no reproduction, is a
point of choice. The choice of the individual to block out natural
processes, and the realization that some may not be beneficial to that
individuals life. 

As said before, a 'right' to have sex isn't limited by other individuals,
but it could be severly limited by ones other emotions. Some people can
only have sex with someone they love,  others can only love someone they
have sex with, while some just can't step over their fears. (and then there
are those who can have sex with everyone, except they person they love ;) )

When will they make that emotional switching board brain implant, and make
the choices our own ?

A year or two ago a gene was found in the roundworm C.elegans that if mutated 
allowed the worm to live 8 times its normal life span. This is not quite as  
exciting as it seems because the mutation also slowed down everything in the 
animal about 8 times. In today's issue of the journal Science Dr. Gary Ruvkum
found that if he made a change in another gene, called daf-2, the worm lived 
3 times as long BUT without slowing the animal down and putting it into a  
general torpor.

Ruvkum also found the daf-2 gene in humans and 35% of it is identical to the 
one in worms. In humans daf-2 codes for a protein in the outer wall of cells  
that is the receptor for insulin. Insulin is just information, it tells cells 
how much glucose to metabolize. The products of this metabolism are free
radicals and other nasty things thought by many to be responsible for aging 
and the reason that animals on a very reduced diet live longer.
 
People with non-insulin dependent diabetes also have a mutation in their 
daf-2 gene, although it's not know if it's the same one Ruvkum produced, 
these people can make insulin but can't use it efficiently, they don't live 
longer and that's puzzling. Maybe the extra glucose in the blood is more 
detrimental than other effects are helpful or maybe another mutation or 
another gene is involved, but I think it's hopeful and I'm not the only one.

Longevity expert Dr. Caleb E Finch of The University of Southern California 
says "I think it's  a gorgeous piece of work[...] the bottom line is that 
there may be fundamental mechanisms that prevail among all multicellular 
organisms and that may be very informative in managing human  aging. [...] 
as we learn more about the specific behavior of genes that predispose to 
health problems we will be able to modify many aspects of aging".

Java is close, but not close enough.  Java's good because it integrates the
operating system with the programming language.  However it's a bit loose on
the operating system side (Sun isn't sure if it is an OS).  The idea of
'thin-clients' (such as the Java based NC) is directly the opposite of
user-centricity (which favours a very fat client).  Sun's continued support
of NC is taking it in the wrong direction.

IMO, I think that Microsoft is more scared of the amount of hype Java is
getting than any real threat.  It's changing Java to support it's own
standards because it can't afford to put another layer on top of Win 95.

Microsoft's Millennium project (which I have mentioned in previous posts) is
very close to some of the ideas I spoke of.  Then again Windows 95 was a
fast, malleable and simple OS when it was in research.  Then they add the
corporate baggage!

How would you do language understanding (very different from recognition)
without AI?  How would the system match words with objects?  The great thing
about AI is I can tell my computer to do something no programmer ever dreamed
of, that will be the true computer revolution!

     The future course of old-age mortality is of great
     importance to public sector expenditures in countries where
     old-age programs, such as Social Security and Medicare in
     the US, account for large fractions of the public budget.
     This paper argues that the competitive market prices of
     mortality contingent claims, such as annuities and life-
     insurance, contain information which allow one to infer the
     opinion of the market regarding the pace of the continued
     increase in old-age longevity. The paper develops methods to
     identify and estimate the mortality implicit in the market
     prices of such claims by identifying survival functions from
     prices of contracts that differ in their duration. Utilizing
     these methods, we provide estimates using cohort-specific
     prices of US term life insurance contracts in 1990-96 for
     individuals aged 60 in each calendar year. Our main finding
     is that the mortality patterns inferred from these prices
     indicate a continued decline in cohort-specific mortality
     at rates equal to or greater than recent historical trends;
     about a 5 percent reduction in relative terms in the
     mortality hazards per successive cohort.

This company (GERN) was mentioned several times at Extro3, including the 
investment panel. I hope somebody moved on it.

With this announcement:

http://www.sjmercury.com/news/scitech/deathcell081497.htm

- --- Quote from above referenced article ---
Researchers have discovered what has been referred to as the holy grail of 
cell aging -- a find with great potential for combating cancer as well as 
for staving off the maladies of old age.

 More precisely, two separate scientific teams -- one from Geron Corp. of 
Menlo Park and the University of Colorado, the other led by researchers at 
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research of Cambridge, Mass. -- 
announced Thursday that they have been able to clone a protein that 
controls how long cells live.

...

``This is not just a very interesting scientific discovery. It has very 
practical applications,'' said Ronald Eastman, president and chief 
executive officer of Geron, a biotech company that already is working to 
develop drugs to combat cancer and aging.
 ``For the first time, we have the opportunity to enhance the lifetime of a 
normally dividing cell.''
- --- End Quote ---

The stock when into a feeding frenzy, shooting up nearly 200%. It's back 
down to 120% now.

I've been wathcing it all week and I had just about convinced myself to go 
in for a couple hundred shares. That'll teach me to move faster. 

It still might be a good investment, check this out:

- --- Quote from above referenced article ---
The twin discoveries of the gene sets up a potential battle over what could 
turn out to be a very lucrative biotech patent. But Geron officials believe 
they have a strong claim because the discoveries build on earlier work by a 
member of their team, Nobel Prize winner Thomas Cech of the University of 
Colorado in Boulder.

Im not mathematically inclined enough (either), to debate the margins

might hinge on structural, contextual or communication, and functional
differences.

Eliezer and JKC have recently dissected different types of emotions
quite nicely. Your line of reasoning might also be applied to another
abused concept, namely consciousness.  This is what Ned Block does in
his essay "On A Confusion About A Function Of Consciousness" at
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.block.html from which I
quote:

<The concept of consciousness is a hybrid or better, a mongrel
concept: the word `consciousness' connotes a number of different
concepts and denotes a number of different phenomena. We reason about
"consciousness" using some premises that apply to one of the phenomena
that fall under "consciousness", other premises that apply to other
"consciousnesses" and we end up with trouble. There are many parallels
in the history of science. Aristotle used `velocity' sometimes to mean
average velocity and sometimes to mean instantaneous velocity; his
failure to see the distinction caused confusion (Kuhn, 1964). The
Florentine Experimenters of the 17th Century used a single word
(roughly translatable as "degree of heat") for temperature and for
heat, generating paradoxes. [Snip] These are very different cases, but
there is a similarity, one that they share with the case of
`consciousness'. The similarity is: very different concepts are
treated as a single concept. I think we all have some tendency to make
this mistake in the case of "consciousness".>

This is quite an interesting exchange.  Very early on when I teach my
argumentation and writing classes, I point out that there are at least
*four* reasons to engage in argument: one, to clarify your thinking; two,
to persuade a person of the correctness or at least reasonableness of your
claim; three, to convince a person to undertake some particular action; or
four, to facilitate a reconciliation among initially incompatible
viewpoints.  It seems to me fairly straightforward that assuming and
defending a position -- even if in a provisional or improvisatory manner
-- in a free and open encounter is a good way to bring to light unexpected
flaws and possibilities in that position.  And the reasons are broadly
evolutionary in a memetic kinda sorta way -- your favorite flavor. 
Argument for argument's sake isn't an *ideal* way to clarify one's views
insofar as we can distinguish understanding from strategic advantage.  The
victor in the free and open encounter may rely more for success on a
winning personality or a compellingly euphonious turn of phrase, than a
sound or creative argument, etc. etc.  Eric's musings that position-taking
may tap into territoriality and other lizard-brain behaviors in ways that
figure in the ultimate efficacy of argument for argument's sake seem to
generate as much evidence against the attractiveness of the practice as
for it.  I'm wondering just what *practices* you have in mind when you
speak of general critique as opposed to position-taking as a way of
clarifying one's ideas?  Best, Dale

In the long-term we will have sensory-rich physically safe environments for
both adults and children.  At present we do need some form of parenting and,
yes, some form of government.  I believe in self-responsibility and
spontaneous order, but currently the majority of individuals, like children,
cannot support themselves.  Just as expect technology to increase the
self-sufficiency and individuality of adults, I believe it will also have
great affect on children.  If children are in an environment where they are
physically safe there is no need for any such parenting.

Anarchy is not against supplying information (it's not _against_ anything).
 The information to help you through life is there - at your fingertips - you
can decide whether to listen and use that information without the need for
coercion.  This can be done without government or parents.

Even a Child's mind can get by without government or parent coercion.
 Animals, with far less intelligence, survive far harsher environments than
any child does today (I'll admit the casualty rate is pretty high).  We are
increasingly moving towards physically safer (but mentally challenging)
environments.  We will still shape each other (even coerce each other) as
individuals, without the need for any imposed hierarchical structure.

Hierarchy          0
Anarchy            1

	Growing self-organization is what sophisticated conspiracy theorists mean
by conspiracy.....why keep arguing against staw men?  Why not argue with
the ideas actually being proposed here and now?

	But, there is some centralized planning none-the-less.  Remember, the most
powerful forces on Wall Street sent their representatives to plan the
Federal Reserve cartel in secret at Jeckyl Island Georgia in 1913.  Paul
Warburg (Daddy Warbucks) had reviewed the history of Central Banking
cartels prior to the meeting and presented his results.  The shadowy
figures travelled to the train station in disguise and under false names to
avoid the press.  They came to an agreement and then sold their agenda
covertly "as a populist measure to limit the power of Wall Street"!  The
Jeckyll Island "conspiracy" is well documented in the autobiographies of
several of the attendees.

	No one said the scientific method was easy to apply to the study of
society, and extremely complex phenomenon.

	However, conspiracy theories are no more untestable than any other theory
of history.  And people do attempt to test them...pefectly cotnrolled
experiments, of course, are possible only to the rich and powerful in a
position try a conspiratorial strategy and see if it works...those using
the scientific method outside a conspiracy can only only look for data that
would tend to support or deny the theory and then make a reasonable
judgement....

     Since the 1970s, economists have speculated on the effects of
     the proliferation of new computer and communications
     capabilities on business structure and performance. The
     present analysis explores information technology's (IT)
     relationship to employment and firm structure by examining
     how IT affects the relative size of employment at auxiliary
     units. The analysis treats auxiliary units--establishments
     where employees provide support services (mainly
     administrative) to production establishments--as a proxy for
     the highest administrative levels of the organizational
     hierarchy. Changes in the relative size of auxiliary
     employment give a broad indication of IT-related changes in
     firm structure. Statistical analyses of 46 industries show
     large variations across industries in the size, sign, and
     statistical significance of the elasticities of auxiliary
     unit employment shares with respect to IT capital stock
     shares. We find no economy-wide trends associated with IT.
     There is too much variation among industries to rely on
     estimates obtained from pooling industry data. For the most
     part, sectorial trends are scarce. Only in the transportation
     sector do the sign and statistical significance suggest that
     IT related changes are similar. Ultimately, the enormous
     variation revealed by our results suggests that one cannot
     make economy-wide generalizations about the effects of IT.

     Nevertheless, our results, combined with other evidence,
     suggest that economies of scale--gained from using IT to
     reduce coordination and monitoring costs--influence firm size
     and structure. One reason why the effects of IT are so
     different across industries is variation in the firm size
     distribution across industries prior to the IT revolution:
     1) For industries with a predominance of small firms, IT-
     related economies of scale may encourage growth in firm size
     and lead to an increase in the relative size of centralized
     back office establishments across the industry. This appears
     to have occurred in the retail trade industry. 2) In some
     industries where large firms predominate, IT may induce
     greater efficiency in back-office jobs, enabling firms to
     reduce back office employment relative to total employment.
     This appears to have occurred in some of the transportation
     industries. 3) In industries where IT primarily substitutes
     for production workers, auxiliary unit employment share is
     likely to rise because central administration office
     employment tends to change less than proportionately in
     response to changes in overall employment. This appears to
     have occurred in the primary metals industry.

Her husband Steve agreed to bring the kid up as part of their family. He'd 
had a vasectomy, I'm told.  His parents didn't like the isea of a 
'mixed-race' (Samoan/American) child in the family, and she was confronted 
with an 'abortion-or-prosecution' alternative.  She rejected abortion: she 
loves her baby.

Sooo... Steve's parents jump the gun and go to the _Child Protection Unit_ 
in Seattle (Wonder on whose advice?) and destroy her life and her family, 
so that Steve and they will (they think) get custody, care and control of 
the kids.


Just guess who's waiting for them in the so-called 'Child Protection Office'?

Well, I was baptized into the Anglican (Episcopalian to you!) Church.  Me

I was never Confirmed in the Anglican faith, because I could not give my 
rational assent to the Nicene Creed of 325 C.E.  Isaac Newton, many of 
whose views I share, believed in the doctrines of Arius, declared 
heretical by the Council of Nicea.  Newton also believed that the Western 
Empire ('LATHEINOZ') in Greek) was the work of the Devil, BTW.


More interestingly, Newton believed space to be the sensorium of God.  The 
sensorium is the space within which we imagine and visualize.  God 
imagines matter and forces in space and across time, not just pictures or 
images.  A Universe 'infinite in all directions' (anything else would be a

To me, 'sexual' means 'making babies.'  This activity subsumes many, many 
others, of course.

This message describes an amazing concept I came up with recently.  I
haven't worked out all the details, but if it's true it would be very cool.

Consider an advanced civilization/organism, that has converted all the
planets in the solar system into a Dyson sphere.  That's all very well, but
isn't it inconvenient that 99.9% of the mass of the system hasn't been put
to good use?  It's just sitting there, being a very inefficient fusion
generator.  How can we dismantle it, so we can get it to give up its energy
faster, and extract some useful materials from it?  Here's how!  

Remember that message I sent out a few weeks ago, about how you could build
a device that could hover indefinitely in the atmosphere of the Sun?  Well,
consider this: such devices could be made self-reproducing, so they could
cover much of the area of the Sun, and then used to extract raw materials
from the substance of the Sun.  The Sun is currently 75% hydrogen, 24%
helium, and 1% other stuff, mostly carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.  The
hydrogen and helium are so abundant as to be valueless, so we leave them.
The heavier elements can be extracted to build more Dyson sphere.  

The cool thing is that we can extract from the atmosphere two isotopes that
are both fairly abundant and have what astrophysicists call 'fragile
nuclei', meaning that they are good fuels for fusion reactions.  The two
isotopes are helium-3 and nitrogen-15.  These are lousy fuels compared to
deuterium and tritium, which is what all fusion bombs and reactors have used
to date, but all the deuterium and tritium in the Sun burned up long ago.

The outer layer of the Sun is swirling around, constantly bringing new
material to the surface.  This layer has about 70% of the volume of the Sun,
and 10% of the mass.  So the extraction machines at the surface can go on
for a long time before running out of stuff to process.  After a few hundred
thousand years, we will have extracted most of the helium-3 and nitrogen-15
in the swirly part of the Sun (the core of the Sun is non-swirly and doesn't
mix with the outside).  This will amount to a ball about the size of the
Earth.  

This ball is the mother of all fusion bombs.  Unfortunately, unlike the
regular kind, it burns relatively slowly.  It needs something to hold it
together while it burns up.  I spent a long time designing impractical
systems of crashing planets and self-imploding bombs before I realized that
there is one place in the Solar system where there is enough pressure to
hold the bomb together while it burns: the center of the Sun.  And the heat
of the Sun can provide a handy ignition source.

One of the problems with using the Sun for heat and pressure is that it is
very springy: any increase in fusion rate at the center will increase the
pressure, which will cause the Sun to expand, which will cool the gas,
causing the heat production to slow.  You can get around this by mixing some
lead with the fusion fuel, forming degenerate matter, which does not expand
when the temperature increases, and is also a good insulator at these
temperatures, so the heat will tend to stay confined in the bomb until
burning is complete.

How to get the bomb to the center of the Sun?  I suggest wrapping it in a
few thousand miles of inert, abundant stuff (say aluminum and silicon) and
then just dropping the whole ball in.  The Sun is, after all, gas all the
way down, and much less dense than the bomb, so according to my calculations
the bomb should   fall to the core in about half an hour.  Just how much of
the outer layers gets stippped off by air resistance on the way is hard to
know; such calculations are at the cutting edge of present-day astrophysics.

So, having dropped the bomb to the center of the Sun, we wait for it to go
off.  For several weeks, fusion proceeds at a relativly sedate pace, as the
bomb slowly gets hotter and hotter.  The hotter it gets, the faster it
burns, etc, until it finally burns most of its mass in a tiny fraction of a
second.  This heats the lead enough to un-degeneratize it, this lets it
expand, and the entire Sun is given a mighty kick in the butt (well, the
core, but you get the idea).

The shock wave propagates out to the surface and either blows off a few
percent of the mass of the Sun or merely inflates the Sun to twice normal
size for a few hundred thousand years.  But wait, you say, that's all?  I
thought you were going to actually blow up the entire Sun!  Well, don't
worry, that's the next step.

Remember how ony the outer 10% of the Sun's mass was accesible from the
surface?  Well, now that the deep interior has been mightily heated,
convection will make the entire depth of the Sun swirly, and all of it will
eventually come to the surface.  99% of the Sun's helium-3 was down below
the layer we could reach before.  Now it will be brought up to the surface,
where we can build the grandmother of all fusion bombs with it.  This one is
about the size of Uranus.  We drop that in, wait a few weeks, and KABOOM!
The Sun is history.

>From the resulting gas cloud, we build lots of Jupiter Brains and all live
happily ever after until the Big Crunch.  But that's another story...

--CarlF 

PS. What's the reliability of this scheme?  Well, I read a few books on the
topic of thermonuclear astrophysics, the Sun and stellar interiors.  The
fusion rate calculations I'm pretty confident of, the degenerate matter
stuff is so-so, and the air resistance calculation is an extrapolation from
the current behavior of the Sun, which amounts to a wild guess.  I'm
confident that the Sun contains enough fusion fuel to blow it to
smithereens, so the problem is simply one of releasing the energy fast
enough and in the right place.

In this case, the explanation will rely less on the notion of evolution
than on *consolation*.  It has been among the principal functions of
philosophy to provide its adherents a kind of consolation that no other
enterprise could afford.  For finite beings imperiled by death, desease,
and the disasters of politics, philosophy promised a method by means of
which one could presumably rise above the discord, to attach oneself to
something greater than finitude and so make some sense out of the human
condition.  Needless to say, times have changed.  To the extent that
philosophy has any role at all, it should be one of problem-solving.  I
like to think of philosophers as people suited by talent, temperament, and
circumstance to provide new descriptions that shake up complacent
perceptions and effect reconciliations among apparently antagonistic
viewpoints. Philosophers are hardly the only people in our society who can
undertake this task -- novelists, journalists, and songwriters are often
far better at it, for example -- but this still seems to me a worthy
*contemporary* (and future) task for the discipline. Certainly, the
provision of the so-called "metaphysical comforts" stands in the way of
this task and it's high time for philosophy to bag its sadly medieval
self-image for disposal.  
	I guess this discussion is inexcusably far from the conversation
that initiated it...  suffice it to say that philosophy has disastrously
exacerbated the human tendency to treat the familiar as the inevitable, by
stoking the fantasy that there can be descriptions of the world (e.g., the
magical ones that are Right, Good, Beautiful, and True) that are not just
the best on offer but which halt the quest for the better by somehow
"saying the way the world is".  Philosophy as an institution (read
Aristotle, or practically any philosopher up to and including Nietzsche
and Freud) and the philosophical sensibility more generally, have no small
share in the sociocultural maintenance of retrograde conceptions and
institutions of sex, race, gender, beastliness, madness, age, ability,
criminality, health, etc.

   Yes - that is correct.  I last laid eyes on it over 7 years ago. 
As I recall he was definitely trying to *extend* the life of the sun
by converting it into a white dwarf.  His hope was to *sustain* a

I think it will take less than 30 years.  What we need is to move the brain
to a scalable component software architecture (after which we can use
nanotech to sprawl our grey matter across the universe).  Hopefully we wont
have to make artificial brains as smart as our brain, instead we can meet
half way and then merge the two together (we add computer components to our
brain, the computer adds human components to its brain).  This should happen
when computers develop the ability to learn from us, personal computers
should evolve to be similar to their users; making the convergence of the two
architectures easier.

After we're scalable and we have all the parallel operations per second we
can possibly build.  It's time to explore new forms of thinking and learning.
 I'm sure that shear speed will not "magically" give us the ability to
understand more, just process information faster.  It's time to start
thinking of what lies beyond our current state consciousness.  Are there
other forms of thought we can adopt? How about conscious memes, each
exploring different situations as individuals to give us a fresh perspective
on new situations (so our old minds aren't put to shame by fresh young ones)?

I think we should maximize the integral of intelligence over time.
Both methods may be workable; a lot of intelligence in a short time,
a bit less for a very long time.

My guess is that we do not need to blow up the sun as soon as
possible (even if we have the technology), since we can spread among
the stars. But when all of the galaxy has been dysoned and the
inhabitants of the solar system realize they can't expand outwards,
they might start to think about doing some stellar engineering...

Actually, I think it might be a great idea to divide the stars into a
lot of small red dwarfs instead of these beautiful but wasteful G and
F stars (not to mention the giants!) - that will save a lot of
otherwise wasted matter and energy and give us space for a lot of
dyson spheres.

A good point. On the other hand, a global civilization may be more
resilent than a local civilization. Previously, most civilizations
have been monolithic administrative systems; empires, states or
closely allied states. But today we are seeing a civilization more
defined by a global economic, scientific and political framework. Of
course, if the world economy would break down then we would be in big
trouble (this was the disaster scenario we came up with in our
scenario planning meeting).

Another thing that comes to mind is that a large civilizations may be
more stable because they contain more people, see the discussion
about Tasmania in
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p5.html (Why Did
Human History Unfold Differently On Different Continents For The Last
13,000 Years?  by Jared Diamond) which I found very intriguing. 

As a final thought, I would guess that the global civilization we are
speaking of will not really be western. It will be based on western
civilization, but in time I expect it to take on a character on its
own as (say) China and India emerge as fully industrialized and
net.connected nations.

A nice idea, but unfortunately the lead is the problem: where do you

I like this two-stage approach, maybe we should look at stars which
first brighten a bit, and then go nova...

OK, I have to admit that this scheme is a bit too conservative (in
the Drexler sense :-) for me, I dislike blowing things up since so
much can go wrong. So when I notice that you are starting to buy lead
and neon extraction equipment, several copies of me will be heading
for the stars as fast as their ships can go :-)

That is an interesting point. I have realized that many of the commas

to make the flow of the sentence conform to how I would speak it. 

And I'm happy to hear you liked my accent. My main worry about my

that I would be simply incomprehensible due to my accent. But as

I think a dyson sphere is a tremendous waste of matter.  If ones
intent is to maximize useful surface area - a mandelbrot foam-like
structure beats a dyson sphere by several orders of magnitude.  Also,
assuming we are uploads, it would be much more effiecient to simulate
our spatial experiences rather than actually creating them.

Assembling this mass into a ball presents a problem, as
we talked about. Maybe consider injecting the mas into a 
low Sun orbit (LSO), then do the assembling into a sphere
with a crust.
Leaving it there in orbit, go out to the Oort cloud and gather 
up a roughly comparable mass of whatever. This can be accomplished
with relativly little energy expenditure. This mass is now sent on a
long-period cometary-style orbit which intersects the orbit of the
fusion-primer sphere. With proper mass, timing and flyby distance (prograde,
passing behind the sphere) the sphere's orbital velocity is nearly cancelled,
allowing it to drop nearly straight in, as desired. The cometary mass
takes up a Solar orbit of higher angular momentum.
A variation on this is a combo shot: Drop the Oort cloud mass(es)
on orbits intersecting the big moons of the gas giants, either putting 
them into periodic solar orbit or straight in.

And do the same here. A good deal of He3 can be obtained from the 
gas giants, maybe enough to make this a one step procedure??

I tried one of those "air walker" exercises at a little store in town.
You basically put your feet on a pair of steps which are attached to
free swinging bars which are suspended from a waist-high frame.  Then you
swing your legs forward and back.

I didn't like it much.  The motion did not feel natural, and while you
can adjust the resistance, it didn't seem like it would build up the
muscles you use in daily life.  It was smooth, though, so if you have
joint problems and can't take walking this could be an alternative.

To some extent, sex isn't something subject to a market.  To me, a great part
of the sexual experience is being desired and valued.  Really, I can't buy
that.  Sure I could hire somebody who might even do a good act, but the fact
that I would have to pay them would always remain as proof that it's just an
act.

I'm not amongst the "starving" at present, nor do I anticipate being so in
the foreseeable future.  I do like participating in and reading discussion of
sexual issues as I find that enables me to improve on a good thing; it can
always be better :-)

Yet discussing sexual matters is, I think, a good way to improve one's sexual
desirability and confidence.  For those who think they are unattractive, it
helps show that non-physical elements are far more important than the media
lets on, and that the range of "desired" is much broader in real life than in
modeling, acting, and pornography.  For anybody, knowledge of psychology,
goals, and techniques of sex and sexual attraction allow one to make oneself
more desirable, to more precisely target those who would desire you, and to
make oneself more of a value to one's partner(s).

If ideas serve a role in sexual selection, then an opposing ideas espoused by
a potential rival is obviously more of a threat than one that is not.  Hence
we may have more motive to find errors in an argumentative setting than
otherwise, even with a sham rivalry.

Not a theory, but a starting hypothesis.

The dyson sphere isn't intended to maximize surface, but rather to
collect all available energy from a star. I would guess the real fun
stuff goes on outside it, perhaps in orbiting stations (like in
Robert Bradbury's presentation at Extro3) or in lots of small
computer nodes orbiting in the shadow of the sphere. They might be
fractal, but I don't see any point in it (it won't cool better than a
sphere in vaccuum, and increases internal delays).

I am in the habit of being circumspect about this for the reasons Robin
describes, yet he and others make a good point that it can be a valuable
thing to discuss. Extropians use subject lines better than most people in
general; I find that on other lists there is an explicit policy of putting
certain topics in the subject line like this: [sexuality], so they are easy
to sort out. I think it might be a good time for me in particular to be
able to winnow the sexuality posts from the other gender posts...I just
mention this as a counter data point, because other posters described
themselves as "not 'starving'", and therefore not needing the kind of
consideration Robin was mentioning.

Some linguists see a male tendency toward argument not as part of
present-day sexual selection, but as legacy code in which
(to put it broadly and generally)

*men* communicate to seek status
(originally for sexual purposes)

and *women* communicate to form connections
(originally a habit that led to fathers and other community members helping
support them and their kids).

I find the styles of argument on the Extropians list not as gendered as on
other lists, but in mailing lists in general (again, broadly) I see support
for this.

Strangely familiar. At age six, I said "no" to a girl aged nine who wanted
(don't laugh) penetrative sex. We were already at it by the time I had made
up my mind. Looking back, I'm puzzled by my reaction. It seems so alien

I know zip about math, and this raises more questions than I can clearly
elucidate.

Implicit in your stuff is the suggestion that as the probability of failure
grows, the importance of a backup gets less ... odd! ("for p<1/2 system 1
is more valuable" implies that for p>1/2, system 2 may be more valuable!)

Did I misunderstand you?

Thanks enormously for the help with the math and the subsequent addendum!

A neat tale. Thanks, Dan. I guess this approach takes patience - a skill
I've been trying to master for the past ten minutes, but don't seem to be
able to get the hang of. No, seriously, it sounds like a sensible approach.

Robin,

Today, we build computers to help us think.

Tomorrow, we will create devices which more capability to "think" (whatever
*that* means) than humans have today.

Will they be our slaves, and should their creators be shunned by society?

I went through a phase of being vegan (vegetarian pure) on the grounds that
I didn't want to get eaten by aliens who used the same excuse that humans
often do for cows and sheep. But then I figured: hey, in a thousand years'
time, I'll probably be able to create cows inside my own body at will.
Surely they will be *my* cows? And if so, then what difference that the
cows are in a field rather than in my body? Surely they are still *my*
cows? Hmm ...

I still don't eat cows (well, not much), but I wondered what you thought
about it. And, since the reasoning seems the same, whether you think that
tomorrow's computers should be called slaves.

Regards,
Darren

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Max More has written in the past about two intellectual epiphanies in
his life: one when he discovered libertarian writings, another when he
encountered the pancritical rationalism of Popper and Bartley.  I have
been having one of my own in the past few weeks, stimulated by the
writings on cities of Jane Jacobs.

In _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_ (1961) she attacks
conventional urban planning of the time, citing as evidence of great
intellectual bankruptcy first the origin of urban planning assumptions
in writings by people who hated cities and wished to do away with them,
and second the failure of urban planning implementations to solve or
even prevent from worsening the problems they purported to solve.  Slums
were removed and replaced by large housing projects, which spiraled into
decay even faster; attempts to solve traffic congestion by accomodating
more cars simply led to more congested cars; zoning which separated out
commerical and residential uses to improve the quality of life in
residential areas led to decay and crime in those areas; a belief that
high population densities were synonomous with slums and overcrowding
was belied by the collapse of tracts of low-income houses while many
well-off people (the "people with choice', as she reiterates over and
over) choose to live in crowded and dynamic neighborhoods such as
Greenwich Village or much of San Francisco; etc.  

The strength of cities is in diversity of uses, as closely intertwined
as possible, which attract and draw along the streets strangers who
visit the various shops and keep, by virtue of numbers, the streets and
parks safe.  And cities are instances of organized complexity
("spontaneous order", in the Extropian lexicon) which cannot be
understood by simple mechanical models or statistical models, but by
detailed examination and knowledge akin to the process of understanding
how a biological organism works.

Now I've begun _Cities and the Wealth of Nations_ (1982), wherein she
boldly challenges every macro-economisc theory I've heard of.  Here her
damning evidence is the existence of stagflation (high inflation and
unemployment, common in the 1970s), the possibility of which was denied
by each and every theory, whether demand-side, supply-side, monetarist,
Keynesian, Marxist, etc.  First she notes that high prices *relative to
local wages* coupled with high unemployment is the normal state of most
historical economies.  Prices in India look low to us, but high to the
locals.  (I'm forced to note, however, that stagflation should involve
high and rising prices; stagnation would simply include high prices.
She may have claimed that stagflation was simply the natural route to
full stagnation, though; I don't remember precisely, I'm afraid.)
Scotland in Adam Smith's time had locally high prices and high
unemployment relative to England, even as Britain did relative to Europe
in the 1970s.

Having claimed every existing theory was falsified by severe
disagreement with reality, she identifies the theoretical flaw as the
assumption, inherited without question from mercantilism, that nations
are a viable level for examining economic activity.  As she points out,
the idea that comparing Singapore, Indonesia, Italy, and the United
States at the same level should appear inherently ridiculous,
particularly as California alone is nearly as large as Italy, itself
divided into two quite differently healthy economies, and the United
States has long been composed of many diverse areas -- industrial North,
stagnantly rural South, dynamically rural West, etc. -- which have
changed over time.

Instead she posits the city as the basic unit of economic expansion,
especially through the route of import-replacement, namely the
development of local industries to make what had formerly been imported
from other cities.  I haven't read any further in the book yet, but it's
been very exciting so far.  I hope I've conveyed a bit of that.

On an unrelated note, I looked at Eric's Loglan book while I was in
Berkeley and the language does look neat.  Caltech libraries don't have
anything on it, though.

Yeah, but you can say that about "consciousness" itself. The topic is

Yeah, but this misses the point. There IS feedback in the form of
selection. If Deep Blue makes bad moves, IBM will trash it. There doesn't
have to be anything in the code. It's the same feedback (and the only
feedback) that our own evolutionary path had until very recently.

Forget the physical substrate, and think only of the whole logical system:
inputs and ouputs. If one system produces all the same outputs for a given
series of inputs as another, then the systems are identical. If they don't
consist of the same stuff, that doesn't stop the SYSTEMs being identical.
One could be plastic, silicon and Cobol whilst the other is water, fat and
DNA.

A fun discussion this. :o)

Right. Whereas in humans, the internal difference between pleasure and pain
is ... er, what is the internal difference in humans exactly?

Hmm, that's a good point. But it is possible that this may have more to do
with our level of understanding of the system rather than the depth of the
distinction.

Again, I think that this misses the point. I argue that if humans alter a
system in a way which leads to greater levels of reproduction for that
system, then the system has evolved. The agent causing the evolution is
irrelevant. The code doesn't have to learn from its mistakes in chess.
There merely has to be an environment which prefers good moves, with
penalties and rewards that affect reproductive success.

I guess we'd have to ask it. How can you tell if I am angry?

Precisely. You are interested only in your own emotions. That's all you can
be. In fact, you ought (I don't mean this nastily at all, but
scientifically) to be interested in only yourself, because you can't be
sure that anything else exists. There are two types of entity: you, and
everything else. Other humans, dogs, wasps and computer programs are all
"everything else", and you really can't say very much about them. Your own
body probably falls into the category of "everything else", too, which is a
bit unnerving.

What do you think?

Darren

I thought about that, but reckon that the social interaction with other

I suspect that the available mass in the solar system is a
constraint on the near-term complexity of our sucessor
civilization, whether that's us, as transhumans, or some
integrated SI. The Sun, of course, constitures nearly all
of the available mass.

I suspect that we can derive the greatest amount fo computational
power per mass by converting as much mass as we can to neutonium.
By the tine we know how to do that, we'll also know how to build
nurtonium nanotech. The reason that neutronium computers are faster
is that they are a lot smaller, so the internal signals don't
have to travel as far. The speed-of light delay has always been
an important constraint on supercomcuter speeds, and is now
becoming important on workstations. Other things being equal(!)
a neutonium computer should be thousands to millions of times
faster than a computer of the same mass made of normal atoms.

Of course, we still need to use some of the mass for power,
and we'll want to minimize the wastage so as to maximize the
amount of neutronium we'll have available, but these are
trivial engineering details for our sucessor civilization
to worry about.

An extropian private school, of course.  I suppose Challenger Schools
are the closest thing right now, but if this group doubles a few more
times over the next few years, a private school in the LA or SF area
might be a practical venture.

For me, it goes way beyond that.  I noticed a few years ago when first
conversing with Sasha Chislenko that english spoken in a European accent
(by a smart transhuman, of course) is a good deal more interesting than
"normal" english.  The rhythm and pronunciations are novel, yet regular,
predictable, and pleasant.  My vague guess is that hearing the words and
phrases emphasized differently (but nonetheless intelligently) gives my
brain more to process than usual.  This extra information (which is
normally not information at all, if you speak with the same accent) brings
the words alive.

Hi Geoff, 

you posted recently to the extropian mailinglist that after the 
breakthough, the Geron stocks went up 200% and then back to a level 
of 120%. How long did it take after the publication untill they 
started to rise significantly?

A similar pattern occured with 
PPL Therapeutics and there were several days delay between the 
announcement of Dolly and the rise of the stock.

If this sort of delay is a regular feature of technologcal 
breakthroughs, we could exploit it to make money.

So, Anders, do you still have access to the book from which you 
cited this figure, or do you perhaps remember the average age of 
adoption?

Hmm, this could be right to some extent, but (apart from what goes 
into the 0.02) it seems to imply 

(1) that there are no factors that are generally good, such as good 
nourishment, loving parents, lots of intellectual stimulation, 
enriched environment etc. People who belive upbringing makes a lot 
great difference would have difficult time trying to swallow the fact 
that these factors don't make any significant net improvement.

and

(2) If some of these factors do a lot of good for some 
genotypes, then they must do positive harm to many other genotypes. 
This would also be hard to accept.

I agree. However, I think there is a sense in which the opposite may 
well be true. (It was not I who made the original statement, though.) 
I think that game theoretical considerations *might* show (I am not 
at all certain of this yet)  that there will most likely be only one 
superintelligence originating from earth. The sense in which game 
theory would not apply after the singularity is that there might only 
be one agent, and the game he is playing against Nature may be such 
that game theory is not at all useful in explaining it.

What I said in another thread might be relevant here (please forgive 
me for quoting myself):

"We should be on our guard against possible biases that
might make us inclined to believe in something just because it would
be interesting it it were so. (Is this bias toward intellectual
interestingness our equivalent to emotional biases more prominent in
other groups?)"

I'd like to claim that I've done a rigorous analysis of this, but
the truth is that the idea came from "Dragon's Egg", by Robert L.
Forward. It's a neat science fiction book about life on the
surface of a neutron star.

The question, of course, is whether
or not neutronium can exist in the form of collapsed atoms.
If so, some sort of chemistry should be possible, and therefore
nonotech may be possible.  Otherwise, neutronium may end up
being either a "neutron soup" or a "neutron crystal." If
"soup", there may not be enough structure to support
computation. If "crystal" there may be enough structure,
but a completely new technical approach may be required.
If an atomic phase is possible at some pressure, but the
"soup" phase arises at a higher pressure, the engineering
will be very interesting. We'll need to maximize the computing
capacity by finding the appropriate configuration of matter to
mazimize the atomic-neutronium regime. This may require new
physics. Of course, the instant you start depending on new
physics the entire speculation becomes unconstrained.

Gregory J. E. Rawlins, of the Indiana University Computer Science dept, has
published two books relevant to the singularity (or so I gather, having
fully read neither as yet).  MOTHS TO THE FLAME: The Seductions of Computer
Technology (MIT Press, 1996) can be read on-line, and a salient sample is at

http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/rawlins/moths/unknown/9.html

and onward from that point.

Rawlins is a specialist in genetic algorithms, self-adaptive software, and
computational complexity, and his skin tone will dismay several members of
this list. 

I will have the privilege of discussing the Spike with Professor Rawlins,
on 20 August, during an hour-long radio link-up between Australia and the
USA, broadcast (alas) only in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation program `Life Matters'.

I had thought that my first posting regarding the conference would 
much more positive reflections (of which there were many), but I see 
that something must be cleared up first.

I did not recuse myself from the gender seminar in hopes of making 
any sort of public statement.  It had more to do with the very 
serious ethical dilemma that emerged for me prior to the conference 
involving that particular panel, and I stayed out of the room out of 
respect for the other speakers, as I have not yet resolved that 
particular dilemma in my own mind.  I have never heard of people being 
called out of the audience to speak during a panel at any conference. 
It is my general understanding that if you want someone to speak at a 
conference, you put them on the panel.  I don't understand why I am now 
reading comments on this list implying that I did something impolitic by 
not having been in the room when someone brought up my name.  I would 
not have said much had I been in the room, as each session has 
limited time to accomplish its goals.

I spent that particular period of time discussing cryonics with the 
Alcor folks, and I discussed my decision with only a few persons, and 
more to get their feedback on a specific idea to provide a new type 
of discussion space within Extropy.  I would prefer to continue 
to pursue that aspect, in the hope of improving all areas of 
discussion within Extropy.

These both seem very plausible.  In what sense, however, are they "legacy"?
 Persuasiveness and skill at argument remain an excellent road to status
(sales, law, management) and I believe it's been shown that a strong social
network continues to provide good insurance for personal crises, whether
social or financial.  As far as I can tell, they are "legacy" only in that
reproduction is now limited by desire rather than resources.  In that sense,
I'd wager that most of our courting and child-bearing habits are now legacy.

You are thinking of a Dyson shell (=3Dsolid sphere). This would require=20
unobtainium at least. Even buckytubes fall infinitely short of the mark.

and Senators, please visit this web site:
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alexboko/css/bioclonefrm.html

In response to passionate, but irrational pressure from some in the
bioethics community, Congress is considering three completely unnecessary
anti-cloning bills: 

HR922-- Banning the use of Federal funds to support research on the
	cloning of humans (out of committee, up for vote by House).

HR923-- $5000 penalty for the cloning of humans (still in Committee on
	Commerce, Subcommittee on Health and Environment).

S368--	Banning the use of Federal funds to support cloning research
	(still in Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources).

* These bills are vaguely phrased, and will have un-intended side effects
  on useful and non-controversial research.

* Adequate safeguards against abuse of cloning technology already exist.
  In order to avoid an overly-controlling, bloated government, Congress
  must only pass laws when there is a compelling practical need. Public
  hysteria is neither compelling nor practical.

* Pro-cloning opinions have been under-represented, if not altogether
  ignored in the debate. The use of cloning as a valid reproductive option
  has not been addressed.

Senators, please visit the following web page:

Only if you have a scheme how to contain superhuman intelligences in 
captivity above intelligences do not approve. (I can't think of such a 
scheme).

These creators may be will be (briefly) shunned by society, but only as

I reread my posts, and if I had much of an idea along those lines,
I don't see it.  Argument for argument's sake is like play: a kind of
practice, the advantage of which would just be that it keeps you in
shape for real thinking.  There's a potential arms-race effect (a
setting for faster learning) in argument.

Another function could be to occupy your mind and keep out
presumably dangerous thoughts.  To argue
that you'd have to pull in some complicated Freud-like stuff.

Another might be that you get hooked on continuing arguments and
that glues you to certain people, and *that* has advantages.

I don't know if you were looking for specifically *interesting*
functions.  Sometimes life is boring and ad-hoc, though.

I can see arguments for the phenomenon's *own* evolutionary interest,
*against* those of its hosts, but that's not what you're asking.  In
fact you'd want to ask why we don't have defenses *against* parlor
conversation, if it were a truly parasitic waste of time and energy.

I certainly don't!!  Nyak nyak har har!  What do YOU think, Robin!?

Ok, I'll tell you my crazy idea.

The closest thing we have to a theory of quantum gravity and figuring out 
what things are like at less than 10^-33 cm is Superstring Theory. 
It postulates that all "elementary" particles are made up of one dimensional 
strings that vibrate in 10 dimensions of space-time, 9 of space and 1 of time.  
The reason we don't notice the other 6 spatial dimensions in everyday life is 
that they are curled up so tightly that they only become significant when you 
approach the Plank Length. 

It is possible to pack an infinite number of 3 dimensional objects in a 
9 dimensional space and have all the objects be arbitrarily close to each 
other, in fact just 4 dimensions would do. This means that an infinite number 
of objects could communicate with each other in an arbitrarily short amount 
of time, even if the objects are not infinitely small and even if the signal 
only travels at the speed of light, or even less.

So now we have a God who is limited by the Plank time to a finite clock speed 
of only 5.38 * 10^44 ticks a second, but who has an INFINITE ( and not just 
astronomical) number of processors running in parallel. He can perform an 
infinite number of calculations in just one tick of His clock.

This question is a cheerful and spunky way to start the day.

goeff replies:

Now, let's not jump to conclusions about "half its matter."

Remember, you don't have to duplicate all the information unless you're
worried about losing *all* (and only one copy of) the information.  To
recover from one bit lost out of m, you need something like log2(m) extra
check bits.  As the number of errors you want to be safe from approaches
infinity (it could be > m) the checkbits per loseable bit goes down toward
one.  RAID experts correct me if I'm wrong.

Me I would have my information scattered in secret--or very public--
places.  On my enemies' computers, for one example.

In a universe converted to computers, and assuming there are still
the famously problematical Other Entities, then there would be
a market in storage with various combinations of features like speed
and safety.  So your casual information or temporary working storage
might be stored in cheap but flakey memory, your more critical
information multiply backed up and distributed, and your really
crucial core self-definition stuff incorporated into every cubic
meter of the universe, say.  (I mean if you're just starting to plan
your personal storage policy, this might be a good place to start.)

Then there's the opportunity of "mutual information".  Not only do
different people keep literal copies of the same things, but different
chunks of information can be similar in the sense that you can save space
by compressing the combination rather than compressing each separately.
This means that the storage services could save space by only storing
once what more than one person wants stored.

So you might not have to store your own copy of "what it means to be
an intelligent entity," or "what a libertarian gets out of the New York
Times," only the uniquely-you stuff.  And of course the more of a Taoist
you are, the more you simply mirror the Way Things Are, so that fewer
and fewer things that can happen count as errors for you.  If you become
completely One with the laws of nature then nothing can violate you.
If you are the universe there is no catastrophe against which you need
backups, Max.  So don't spend your retirement in paranoia--kick back
and relax, you've earned it!

The problem of saving space on mutual information without compromising
privacy or the desire to have actual redundant copies (if you contract
out to someone to store your backups, how do you know he isn't just
storing them on your system as redundant copies that you've compressed
away?), seems really tough but worth pursuing.

Wow - this is beautiful writing.  The last section is tremendously moving
and awe-inspiring.  I should warn people that I have some brief excerpts
from the web pages here.  If you want the full impact you should first
read the few pages starting from the URL above, which constitute the
conclusion to the book.

In "Let There be Light", Rawlins first describes the accretion of
dust grains, gradually, slowly, falling together, becoming more dense,
finally bursting into nuclear flame as the heart of a star.  I really
didn't know where he was going with this.  I was stunned when he turned
it into a metaphor for our own future:

> We seem headed for our own starbirth, drawn to it just as
> inexorably as those grains merge, accelerating toward it
> just as surely as the merging accelerates. The attraction is
> massive, relentless, unstoppable. When our starbirth
> comes, some of us will no longer be truly human; and things
> we now call machines will no longer truly be machines.

One thing that seems wrong to me is the title: "moths to the flame"
sounds too much like one of the anti-computer screeds by the likes of
Cliff Stoll.  Actually, Rawlins' book seems to cover many good and bad
aspects of the changes which computers will bring.

He is cautionary in the concluding chapter when he describes what
he means by this image:

> What's special today is that
> because of the computer, an undifferentiated intelligence

> and is now juggernauting us around the dance floor at such

> our breath. Now prisoners of the dance, we're moths
> irresistibly attracted to the flame of technology.
> Prometheus, disguised as a scientist, has given us that
> flame. But fire also burns.

The changes ahead will be hard for some people.  But Rawlins emphasizes
that change is necessary, that stasis would be far worse.  His conclusion
is so good that I can't resist quoting it:

I've just read Bruno Bettelheim's (1974?) _The Uses of Enchantment_.
It's about what fairy tales have evolved to do for kids' minds.
One of the many thought-provoking things Bettelheim says is
that becoming King represents gaining soveriegnty over one's own life.
That makes it more clear for me why stories about powerful people--
Presidents, big businessmen, mafia bosses, army generals, etc.--like
_Air Force One_, are so popular.  "Get off my plane!" says Mr. Prez in
the trailer for that one, and I understand him to mean symbolically:
"Get out of my life, disorder!"

Although I reject centralized power as a way to run one's mind, and in
fact I've always been turned off by some libertarians' (IMHO) over-
emphasis on logic and rationality, still I have a lot more sympathy for
this symbolism (autocrat = autonomy) than I do for plain power worship.
In some sense we are *rightly* enraptured by power.  It's an essential
nutrient.

"Bottom-up," in terms of structure of things someone is studying, just
means flowing from the scattered details to the overall visible patterns
and trends.  "Surely" (Dale, I love that word; I want to use it, too!)
power is fractal--having details and concentrations at different levels
and scales--like everything else.

>*Neither* the idea that the market, say, emerges in consequence of the

Just because economists use simplified models doesn't mean they think
the world is perfect or simple!  Like point masses in perfect vacuum,
perfect economic actors in a perfect economic fluid are easier to
analyze, that's all.  There are also analyses of perfectly stupid&
ignorant actors, and analyses of "transaction costs" (=messiness)
abound.

I agree that visions of central control (whether by individuals,
governments, conspiracies, ideas, markets...), even when described with
horror, are often the result of a kind of romance with power.

But I wouldn't romanticize a vision of *de*centeredness.  That's just
different blinkers.  Also, I don't get what Power, with a capital P as
Foucault used it, means if not central power.  He seemed to mean something
other than the everyday power we all use to move about in the world.

Uh, "infinite number of objects" "arbitrarily close to each other"?

Is talking about such abstractions as packing of n-dimensional objects in 
n+1 dimensional space for computational purposes at all meaningful?

I notice a tendency to tear off exploring wild possibilities on this list 
recently. (Extro 3 talks risen to the head?).

This is only okay if we do not longer hold by the basic tenets of science.
Future may be wild, but when talking of astro- and spacetime engineering 
we are clearly discussing Postsingularity events, which are by definition 
unpredictable, i.e. a waste of time.

They are "legacy" in the sense that they are gender-specific and no longer
need to be, which is a way of saying they are "legacy" in the sense that
these styles are highly correlated with hardware. I guess the metaphor with
legacy code does break down there.

If the standard types of sex aren't of the sort that one values,
then variations might bring sex-of-the-kind-one-values within
reach.  Or sex of a kind one is capable of psychologically, socially
or, er, whatever.

But I would still guess that being turned off by standard sex wasn't why
most sex-starved people are.  Unless you count things like embarrassment,
rejection, disease, alienation, psychological warfare within couples,
etc. to be features of standard sex.  If people talk about variations on
those things, I (e.g.) might overcome my squeemishness and pay attention.

Robin's post made me realize that I sympathize with outsiders to such
an extent that maybe I'm trying to sympathize with issues that are
more rarified, less mundane than my own.  Abstracting can be dangerous.

Other people have said that uncomfortable conversations can be good for
you.  But still there's this sense of "brought to you by the sexual
vanguard."  To a sex-starved person variety can look like a luxury (even
if it isn't really) and envy can color perception.

Of course sexual "starvation" is largely a matter of perception.  You can
live a long healthy life without sex.  It's different with food.

Of course one must remember that many of the well-off choose to live in the
suburbs.  My cynical take on this is that such people primarily do so in
order to restrict their children's ability to learn of alternate ways of life
and thought.  For someone without a car, the modern homogenous suburbs
borders on being a prison, although a pleasant one.

I haven't read that book of hers, but either she's wrong or you misunderstood
her.  Monetarist theory predicts stagflation as a typical result of sustained
inflation.  So did supply-side, but supply-side as we know it today was
cooked up after the stagflation of the '70s, so it doesn't really count as a
prediction.

An interesting supporting point to her claim - I don't know if she makes it
in that book - is that many countries are almost just one giant city-state
and its hinterland.  Examples: London/England, Paris/France,
Berlin/Prepartition Germany, Tokyo/Japan, Moscow/Soviet Union, Madrid/Spain,
Lisbon/Portugal, Athens/Greece, Mexico City/Mexico, Buenos Aires/Argentina,
Sydney/Australia.  The city-state is typically 1/6 or so of the population,
more of the economy, and overwhelmingly dominant cultually.  Even the US has
been such, with New York City playing the role from about the Irish Potato
Famine to WWII.  Naturally not all countries are like this, but it's
surprisingly common.

She uses the term "city region", distinguishing cities with extensive
influence on the hinterland, like Tokyo or Los Angeles, from others
like Rome without such influence; she says (I paraphrase from memory)
that twenty miles from Rome you wouldn't know there's a city nearby.

To me her most interesting claim is that this dominance by one city
is partly an artifact of a single currency.  When a region's exports
lose market share in the world economy, the exchange value of its
currency ought to decline, giving the signal that it's time to cut
imports and begin import-replacement, which is the key step on the 
road to developing new exports.  But when multiple city-regions share 
a currency, the signals to each of them gets muddled in with signals
to the others, the usual result being that the capital gets the right
signals and expands, while other cities (Manchester, Marseille) get the
wrong signals and decline.  Her metaphor: an elephant, a monkey and a
hummingbird, all sharing a single heart.  The US has largely escaped
the pattern because the role of "capital" is divided between New York,
Washington and now Hollywood.

I find such speculation to be intellectually stimulating,
and at least as relevant as (say) the future of gender.
In fact, I feel that most of what we discuss relates
to Postsingularity events, and is therefore idle speculation.

At least when discussing physics, I try to identify ideas that
require "new physics" from ideas that do not, and I remain
deeply sceptical of ideas that contravene existing physics.
Unfortunately, it's difficult or impossible for me to apply
the same approach to speculations in the areas of sociology,
economics, or other "softer" sciences, since I cannot determine
which parts of the existing body of knowledge in these areas
will remain valid.

I find such speculation to be intellectually stimulating,
and at least as relevant as (say) the future of gender.
In fact, I feel that most of what we discuss relates
to Postsingularity events, and is therefore idle speculation.

At least when discussing physics, I try to identify ideas that
require "new physics" from ideas that do not, and I remain
deeply sceptical of ideas that contravene existing physics.
Unfortunately, it's difficult or impossible for me to apply
the same approach to speculations in the areas of sociology,
economics, or other "softer" sciences, since I cannot determine
which parts of the existing body of knowledge in these areas
will remain valid.

I'm not an expert, but I don't think this is quite
correct. If this variant of superstring theory is
correct, then matter really is (9+1)-dimensional, not
(3+)-dimensional, and is therefore has finite "thickness"
in the other dimensions. By analogy, you can stack
an infinite number of abstract 2-dimensional objects
together in 3-space without generating any "thickness",
but when you start stacking practical "2-D" pieces of
paper, you build a real book with real thickness.

> What is picotechnology?

I infer from Ander's post that "picotechnology" is "control
of matter to subatomic precision.", by analogy with
nanotechnology: control of matter to atomic precision.

The etymology is a bit strange: "micro-technology"
relates to very small machines. The word "nanotechnology"
is almost a pun. The prefix "micro" has a non-scientific
meaning of "tiny", but it also has a specific ISO-standard
meaning of 10E-6, or "one millionth". "Nano" means 10E-9,
or "one part in a thousand million", and "pico" means 10E-12,
or "one part in a million million." So, Anders is extending the
pun: if nanotechnology is "tinier than microtechnology", then
picotechnology is "tinier than nanotechnology".

My post was assuming an ability to do mechanicla engineering
of neutronium, which is (or may be) atoms with their electrons
crushed nearly into the nucleus by ambient pressure  with
roughly a thousand-fold reduction in size. Anders is not
sure this will work, but has hopes for operating at the
quark level which would result in an additional thousand-fold
reduction, but which IMO would require discovery of new
physical laws.

A big problem with using neutron stars as computational platforms (a.k.a.
turning them into neuron stars) is that they might actually be kaon or
strange stars, and who knows what the physics is then?  Gerald Brown and
Hans Bethe have argued that the standard stellar dynamics narrative, in
which gravitational collapse forces protons and electrons together (so to
speak) to build neutrons and runaway neutrinos, might be only partially
correct.  They suggest that the electrons might do a lepton=>hadron
transition, turning into kaons (which contain a strange quark).  Usually
massive kaons decay mighty fast, but the Brown-Bethe models sez that the
weird environment of a supernova remnant could allow kaons to shed most of
their quarky mass (decoupling from the Higgs field? don't ask me, mate, I
just work here), so they skid around like electrons in a superconductive
environment.  Would you wish to upload into a substrate like that?  Maybe
it would be ideal - fast and slippery.  Hmmm.

To Obey


Chapter 1 "Hounded Into Submission 16 year old Cindy for your pleasure" 

"Ok Melissa, pull up your slip and show Paul your pussy." 

The command, given to pretty sixteen year old Melissa Andrews by her father Dave, was
not one a girl her age would normally expect to hear. But then Dave was not exactly a
normal father. For him the most important trait in a female, especially a young daughter,
was obedience. Absolute. Unquestioning. Immediate. Failure to give it earned punishment.

The punishments Melissa and her eighteen year old sister Sharon had received while
growing up had been bad enough. Neither could remember a time when they weren't
constantly being ordered to bend over and bare for the cane, paddle, or strap. Then last
summer he'd sent them away to the notorious Hackmoore Girl's Disciplinary Academy for
even harsher training. It had been a three month nightmare of pain and sexual abuse, all
requested by, approved, and carefully photo-documented for their father's benefit. 

And now here he was trying to talk his best friend Paul Winslow into sending HIS
daughter Cindy off to the very same school, supposedly to cure her "stubborn willfulness".
And to better make his point he intended to use poor Melissa as an example. 

The three of them were in the living-room of Dave's house. The two men were seated on
the couch. Melissa was standing in front of them. She'd been ordered to dress in her
"discipline slip" for the occasion. It was a plain white satin slip, slit down the back and tied
closed with ribbons. Additional ribbons formed the straps over the shoulders. This
allowed the garment to be removed easily over bound hands and feet. 

"Quickly now. Don't embarrass me in front of Paul." her father commanded. 

Blushing deeply, Melissa raised the hem of her slip a scant couple of inches. The way her
lithe young thighs were pressed together all Paul could see was the very top of her cleft,
but even that was enough to make his cock throb suddenly to life. Like Dave he was into
harsh discipline and had a thing for pretty teenage girls. He'd often admired Dave's two
young daughters, but until now he'd never imagined his friend would actually make them
show off their sexual charms to him. He hoped he wasn't dreaming. 

Dave was not impressed by Melissa's efforts. "You can do better than that," he snapped
in disgust. "Show it right!" 

Melissa gulped. Her father's tone of voice was unmistakable. Behave or get punished. She
immediately jerked the him up to her waist and spread her legs wide. Her blush this time
was a bright scarlet. Dave was the first to break the long, admiring silence that followed.
He winked at Paul, a message to play along. "Well, what do you think?" 

Paul response was carefully casual. "Very pretty. I like the way the pink inner lips peek
out around the edges of her slit. Her clit also stands out nicely. If I were you I'd make her
keep it shaved off like it is now. 

Dave nodded thoughtfully. "Thanks for the suggestion. I will." 

They continued to look for another couple of minutes before Dave asked, "Ready for the
flip side?" Paul managed to tear his eyes away long enough to reply, "Sure!" 

"Ok Melissa. Turn slowly, and keep your legs spread this time! That's it. All the way
around. Ok, stop. Now pull that slip up under your arms and bend over. No, all the way
down. Hands on the floor. Feet a little wider. Wider damnit! That's better. Now arch your
spine, stick out your ass, and hold it. That's fine." 

This time Paul's dick wanted to rip right up out of his pants. Never had he seen a girl so
fully exposed. Her pert little round buns yawed wide open, the cleft between them
reduced to a shallow grove. Her bare sex gaped helplessly, its every inner secret fully
revealed to his lustful gaze. If she opened her mouth he was sure he could see daylight.
"Not bad, hunh," Dave asked with just a bit of fatherly pride. "Imagine having Cindy
trained to do this." 

Paul cleared his throat, which for some reason had gone suddenly dry. "Uh... yeah. Not
bad at all." He leaned forward for a closer look. "That sure is a tiny little cunthole. She
must be real tight." 

Dave grinned. "As a cat's ass. But that ain't nothing compared to her butt. Virgin tight and
tender as hell. After what happened to her at that school she hates even having it
touched." 

Paul looked puzzled. "Oh? What was that?" 

Dave's reply was a little embarrassed. "Well, actually it's kind of my fault. The people at
the school have this special treatment that's supposed to tone up the ass muscles. You
know, make 'em nice and firm so they don't get stretched out of shape. It's a kind of chair
with a little metal prong about the size of your thumb sticking up from the seat. They run a
current through it to make the muscles clench. Kind'a painful, especially if it goes on for
very long. Anyway, when I filled out the forms I checked the box for "maximum". I didn't
know that meant they'd spend a whole day on that prong, getting the shit shocked out of
them." 

"Oh." It was all Paul could think of to say. 

Paul was so busy admiring the view that he hardly noticed when Dave got up and walked
out of the room. When he returned he was leading a very large Great Dane on a leash. It
was Butch, the family pet. "Okay," he said with a flourish, "time to demonstrate sexual
responsiveness." He turned to his young daughter. "On your hands and knees kid,
forehead to the floor, and spread 'em wide." 

Melissa took one look at the huge dog and panicked. She fell to her knees. "Oh no
Daddy! Please don't make me do it! Not the dog! Not in front of Mr. Winslow!
PLEASEEE!!!!" 

Dave's face darkened. "You have just earned yourself one whipping for disobedience, and
one extra one for misbehaving in front of a guest. Both will be QUITE severe. Now get it
up here!" 

With a sob of despair Melissa did as she was told. Head down and ass up, her knees
spread wide, her shaved sex gaped in open invitation. Dave unhooked the dogs leash and
said, "Go boy!" 

The hound bounded over the girl in two steps. He apparently had done this before
because he went immediately to her plump cleft and started lapping. Dave returned to the
couch to watch the show. 

"I think it's interesting to note that Melissa would rather die than show sexual response to
a dog," Dave commented casually. "Especially in front of another man. She'll do
everything in her power to resist the sensations. She will of course be unable to, thanks to
all those special female hormones and stimulants the school treated her with. She has less
control now over her orgasm than she has over breathing. But she'll still try." 

Dave was right. Poor little Melissa never had a chance. First her fists clenched. Then her
hips began to wriggle. She bit her lip to try to stifle the moans. The dog was winning.
Finally when she knew all was lost she buried her face in her hands and let the spasms
take her, her hips thrusting helplessly against the probing tongue. It went on for a long
time. 

"Damn it Melissa! Back into position!" Dave snapped. "I didn't say you could get up." 

Melissa's tear streaked face turned toward her father. "B... but..." 

"That makes three whippings you've got coming," Dave hissed. "Now get that little ass of
yours back in position!" 

The second one was even worse. Her sex was already wet, swollen, and excruciatingly
sensitive from her previous orgasm. She writhed and moaned and sobbed in helpless
frustration at the brutally intense sensations streaming up from between her widely parted
thighs. The outcome was inevitable. She wailed helplessly as the second set of spasms
shook her. 

Nor did it stop there. Melissa looked up at her father, her eyes pleading. He just grinned.
She was cumming for the forth time when her mother walked in. 

Ann Andrews shook her head and just smiled at the sight of her daughter and the dog on
the floor. She walked over to her husband and kissed him hello. "Hi sweetheart," she said
cheerfully. "Why hello Paul." 

"Uh... Hi Ann," he replied, his voice betraying his nervousness. He was unsure of how the
mother would react to the blatant sexual abuse of her sixteen year old daughter. She just
smiled. "I see you boys are having a good time." 

Paul colored slightly and looked uncomfortable. Dave nodded with boyish enthusiasm.
"You bet. I was just showing Paul the benefits of sending his daughter off to that girl's
training school. Melissa is helping. Oops! There she goes again." 

Three pairs of eyes turned to watch Melissa clutch the carpet and gurgle into another long
series of spasms. When they finally passed Ann said, "Well, I hate to break up the show
but we've got to be at the Henderson's in half an hour for bridge club." 

Dave looked thunderstruck. "Oh SHIT! I forgot all about it. And I didn't even call the
baby sitter." He glanced around wildly, his eyes falling on his friend. "Paul! You've got to
help me. Stay with the girls for a few hours while we go out. How about it?" 

Paul hesitated, unsure of how to handle this sudden turn of events. "Uh... I don't know
Dave. I'm not much of a baby sitter." Behind them Melissa suddenly cried out in the throes
of yet another orgasm. No one could remember whether it was her fifth or sixth. Dave
paused, thinking. He caught his wife's eye. "Could you excuse us for a minute dear? Man
talk." 

When she was gone Dave pulled Paul aside and said, "Listen chum, I can see by the bulge
in your pants that you're just dying to get at that cute little piece of teenage ass over there
on the floor. Lord knows she's all warmed up for it." Behind them Melissa moaned as if in
confirmation. "And believe me I don't mind. We'll be gone for hours. Fuck her all you
want." 

It was tempting. Damn tempting. The problem was that deep down inside Paul still just
couldn't believe Dave really meant what he was saying. Dave squeezed his arm. "Even
better, give her those three whippings I promised her. There's all sorts of canes and ropes
and things down in the basement. Her sister Sharon's already down there, tied up over the
trestle. I was planning to demonstrate a good old fashioned ass whipping for you after we
finished with Melissa." 

Paul wavered. "Well..." 

Dave sighed. "Ok, if it makes you feel any better I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll make a
deal. A gentlemen's agreement so to speak. That way it'll be fair for everybody." 

"What kind of deal?" Paul asked suspiciously. 

"You're going to send your daughter Cindy off to the same school my two went to, right?" 

There was no question about that one. Paul had seen more than enough to convince him
of the school's merits. He nodded. 

"And when she gets back she'll be just as well trained as mine are." 

"I suppose so," Paul replied cautiously. 

"So here's the agreement. You can do anything you want to my two daughters tonight.
And I do mean ANYTHING! As long as I get to do the same things to your daughter
some night after she gets back. That way we both know it won't get too far out of hand." 

Paul thought about it. A smile played slowly over his lips. "You know, Cindy has been a
real pain in the ass lately. Protecting her precious hide from you won't be much of a
deterrent. In fact it'll probably have the opposite effect." 

Dave shrugged. "That's her problem. Deal?" 

Paul nodded. "Deal?" 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Chapter 2 "Getting A Buzz On" 

The two of them hurriedly stripped off Melissa's slip and carried her downstairs to the
basement. As promised her eighteen year old sister Sharon was already down there, bent
naked over the trestle, her pert little ass reared high. She was gagged, which prevented a
lot of unnecessary questions. She was obviously shocked to see to see the two men
carrying her naked, sobbing younger sister into the room. 

They threw Melissa down on a large four poster bed, spread-eagled her face up, and
cuffed her wrists and ankles to posts in each corner. A thick pillow shoved under her ass
elevated her hips. Conveniently placed cranks allowed them to draw her body bowstring
taut. When they were done her red, swollen cleft gaped helplessly skyward. 

"You should find everything you need in one of those lockers," Dave said, pointing to a
row of four cabinets against the far wall. Don't hesitate to use any of it." He looked
pointedly over at his younger daughter's cruelly elevated midsection and winked. "Also
don't hesitate to use it where you think it'll do the most good." 

Dave hurried out to get ready for bridge club, closing the basement door behind him.
Before leaving he assured Paul that it was totally soundproof. Just to be sure he wasn't
disturbed Paul threw the heavy inside bolt. 

That done he began to take stock. Inside one large cabinet was every kind of whip,
paddle, strap, cane, and taws imaginable. Another cabinet yielded a treasure trove of
dildos and vibrators, some impossibly huge and heavily spiked for girls the age of Sharon
and Melissa. A third was full of bondage devices. A forth held what looked like medical
instruments and supplies, heavy on the lubricants. Paul gleefully rubbed his hands together.
He was in business. 

The first thing he looked for was an appropriate vibrating dildo for Sharon. He found one
that was over ten inches long and about as thick as the girl's wrist. It had a dozen spiraling
rows of short, pointy spikes along it's length, and even better it was equipped with a heavy
duty AC powered vibration unit. Perfect. He picked it up along with a harness and a jar of
Vaseline. 

It took almost ten minutes of pushing and shoving and twisting to get the dildo buried to
the hilt up Sharon's tight little hole. To Paul's delight the poor youngster kicked and
screamed the whole time, especially when the spikes started digging into the drum-taut
inner walls of her cunt walls. He could actually see the little bumps moving up the bulge the
dildo was making in her groin. 

He didn't really need the harness. There was no way the dildo was going to come out on
it's own. But buy putting it on and cinching it tight between the girl's legs he ensured that
the head of the phallus would remain pressed hard up into the very back of her womb, no
matter how violently she bucked. 

Sharon shook her head frantically when Paul held up the plug, her big brown eyes
pleading for mercy. The dildo already felt like it was splitting her in two. Paul grinned, bent
down, and shoved the prongs into a nearby wall socket. Sharon tensed. Her eyes
squeezed shut. She held her breath. Nothing happened. 

A minute later Paul was still scratching his head. He pulled the plug out and tried the other
socket. Still nothing. He walked around and looked at the base of the dildo. Ah! There it
was. A ring at the base of the dildo with an arrow embossed on it. Above it, etched into
the plastic shaft were the words "OFF -- LOW -- MED -- HI -- MAX". Above that was
the message: 

CAUTION! Do NOT use maximum setting for more than 30 sec. at a time. Intense
discomfort may result. 

The arrow pointed to "OFF". Paul twisted the ring until it pointed to "LOW". The
vibration unit kicked on and began to hum in a low, powerful way that was entirely
different from the usual battery operated unit. Sharon squirmed and whimpered at the
sudden new wave of sensation pouring up from between her legs. She tugged at her
bindings. 

Paul had to admit that the sex hormones were wickedly effective. It took less than a
minute for Sharon's first orgasm to start. The moment it hit her Paul twisted the ring to
"MED" and the hum doubled in volume. So did Sharon's strangled protests. She bucked
and heaved and tugged uselessly at her bindings as the blinding waves of pleasure/pain
filled her young body. It went on and on until she felt like she surely must faint. That's
when Paul twisted the ring to "HI". 

The angry buzz cut through Sharon like a red hot poker. Her sex was already sore and
swollen from her just finished orgasm. The new assault was more than she could take. She
wailed helplessly, her hips bouncing in wild abandon over the top of the trestle. Paul let
her suffer for a good five minutes before switching up one more notch to "MAX". 

The dildo actually thrummed with power as its full potential was released upon Sharon's
helpless sex. If she hadn't been gagged her teeth would have rattled. As it was it felt like a
bare wire had been shoved up her cunt and plugged in instead of a vibrator. She
screamed. Again and again. Paul just smiled, patted her on her wildly jerking ass, and
walked off. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Chapter 3 "Punished Puss" 

Paul found exactly what he was looking for in the whips cabinet. A martinet with six
knotted cords about eighteen inches in length. The dildo cabinet produced a "billy-club", a
slim twelve inch rectal invader with a heavily spiked head attached to a grip fitting handle.
The penis gag was in the bindings locker. He still had the Vaseline. 

Melissa watched him approach with wide-eyed fear. She'd seen what he'd done to her
sister. She knew she could expect the same. Her voice quavered. "W...what are you
going to do?" 

Paul sat down on the bed even with Melissa's raised hips and grinned. "I'm going to give
you the whipping you earned tonight by disobeying your father. Now be a good girl and
open your mouth." 

Knowing better than to disobey the pert youngster did as she was told. Paul inserted the
phallus into her mouth and buckled the strap behind her head. She whimpered at the
tightness of it. 

Paul picked up the jar of Vaseline and scooped out a big glob onto his fingers. He began
to message it into the girl's gaping sex and between her bottom cheeks. While he worked
he talked. "Tell me Melissa, have you ever been whipped between your legs? (Wide eyed
shock. Frantic shake of the head.) No? Well in that case you're in for a real experience.
Every girl I've ever done it to absolutely hates it. I'm sure you will too. But then that's part
of the price you pay for disobedience, isn't it." He bent over to inspect his work, then
scooped more Vaseline. 

"Of course this will be a new experience for me as well, since I've never pussy-whipped a
girl your age before. I suspect that you're going to be much more sensitive than the women
I've tried. Especially after that little bout with the dog." Paul grinned at Melissa's blush.
"The spread of your legs and your total lack of pubic hair should also add to the severity
of the pain." He dipped more Vaseline. "In case you're wondering the Vaseline is to
lubricate your tissues so that the thongs won't cut. They'll still sting just as bad, maybe
even worse, but I promise there won't be any damage. I wouldn't want to injure a pretty
girl like you." 

By this time Melissa's hips were squirming helplessly. It had been less that fifteen minutes
since the dog's attentions and she was still wet and fully aroused. Paul chuckled. "Good.
I'm glad to see you've got some spark left. It always hurts more when the tissues are
swollen with lust." 

Finally Paul set the Vaseline aside and picked up the dildo. "Do you know what this is
for?" Melissa shook her head. "Before each stroke I expect you to lift your hips up off the
pillow as high as you can. If you start to forget I'll shove this up your ass to remind you. Is
that clear?" Blinking back tears, Melissa nodded. 

Paul picked up the lash and turned to face Melissa's cruelly splayed sex. The sight of her
plump, hairless little pussy with its slit gaping wide and its insides wet and swollen was the
most erotic thing he'd ever seen. He touched the cords to her pubic mount. She obediently
raised her hips. 

SWISSSHHHHHH.........SPLATTT!!! 

Melissa's scream was one of pure, shrill, burning agony. Never in her young life had she
experienced anything like the white hot pain of the knotted thongs biting into her tender
inner tissues. She heaved against her bindings, her legs kicking wildly as the terrible
sensations between her legs grew and grew. And just when it couldn't possibly get any
worse, Paul whipped her again. And again. And again. 

SWISSSHHHHHH.........THWACKKK!!! 

SWISSSHHHHHH.........SPLATTT!!! 

SWISSSHHHHHH.........SPLAATTTTT!!! 

Paul was having the time of his life. Never had he seen anything so beautiful, so powerfully
erotic as the way pretty little sixteen year old Melissa reacted to having her cunt flogged.
The look of shock and pain on her sweet young face was priceless all by itself. Then there
was the helplessly lewd way her hips danced around on the bed. The beautiful red welts
that spread across the pale nether lips. And the sounds! The splat of the lash. The strident
shrieks of agony, reduced to soft mewings by the gag. The creak of the bed under her
bouncing ass. The muffled pleas for mercy. The broken, shuddering sobs. It was
unbelievable. 

Poor Melissa foolishly failed to rise for the fifth stroke. This caused a short but interesting
pause while the dildo was rammed up her tight, tender little asshole. Her father had been
right about the effects of the training. The poor kid tried to jump out of her skin the
moment the spiked tip touched the puckered bud of her rectum. She strained to the very
limits of her bindings trying to escape it, and Paul took full advantage of the opportunity by
cheerfully lashing the thongs straight down into her wide open cleft. The dildo sank a little
deeper with each stroke. 

After that Paul had no trouble making the girl arch her pussy up. All he had to do was
reach around her hips and tap the handle of the dildo. She would rise up like a breaching
whale, her sex ripe and open for the lash. The whipping progressed with a steady, cruel
rhythm. 

Remember now email me the order :) :) I know you have enjoyed this

True. We haven't yet sent a probe to the Dragon's Egg
(as in Robert L. Forward's book) to find out. But we won't
necessarily need to use the natural form of a neutron star.
We may be able to construct a different for of collapsed matter.
To build a collapsed-matter computer, we just need a for the
laws of physics to allow some form of the stuff that will
act analogously to atoms. We don't necessarily need to
use the neutron star configuration.

Precisely - and we have a word for this species of solution.  It's
`culture' - all those extro-bytes.  Admittedly, current rudimentary means
of implementing it tend to involve a deplorable amount of  redundancy
anyway.  I had this method in mind when I suggested (in my 1980 novel THE
DREAMING DRAGONS) that humans and their intelligent saurian
parallel/predecessors are ceaselessly archived in compressed and shared
form inside what amounts to a single neutronium crystal - it's buried under
Ayers Rock, if you'd like to look for it - so that yes, Virginia, there
*is* a collective unconscious.  :)

Other functions for these were discussed at the X3 conference:
A stored facial snapshot of yourself to help with name recognition, after
a conference, you could dump out a set of prints for everyone you met,
with pertinent data. 

Sounds like a EEPROM or flash ROM, a wimpy microcontroller, a simple 
tranceiver, a lithium coin cell.  Simple software.  Who needs Xerox parc?

Indeed, how much of who YOU are was "invented", or created by you?  Most
of what we are is the work of (or actual copies of parts of) those who
have gone before, yes?  Think of your genes, your language, mathematics,
science, literature, your culture, history (memories of events you never
experienced). 

This is my personal view of "heaven": being remembered in the sense of 
being incorporated in others, or at least archived and appreciated from 
time to time.  "Hell" then would be being archived as someone you want to 
avoid being like: pick any dictator you care to mention.

Why not just put your picture, and realaudio "Hello", and perhaps
a video clip all on your web page. Then you can just send the URL
over a lo-bandwidth local circuit. You could do the web part today.

Yes, this seems to be exactly the right reply.

BTW, you said that you like to believe that you have established the 
possibility of neutronium computing. Do you have a paper on this?

Oops! Please excuse me. I meant that, while I would like to
claim credit for the idea, I cannot, because I feel that it is
an obvious extension of the plot of Dr. Robert Forward's
novel "Dragon's Egg." I have not done any research to see if
that was the first reference to the idea in the literature.

There's probably some of that -- keep the innocents from the fleshpots
of the city.  Then again, since these families started in the city, I
think this is too simplistic.  America, at least of the 1950s, has
having your own house as part of the "Dream".  That supplies desire, and
tax subsidies for mortgages and direct subsidies of cars and freeways
supplies the means for an explosion into the suburbs.  When the city
starts declining more people flee increasing crime and decay.  I like to
think their safety remains the same, transferring risk of crime to risk
of auto accidents, but I have no data.

I re-read that part.  She doesn't say explicitly what monetarism said
about stagflation.  For all the other theories she shows an explicit
contradiction, but elsewhere implies that stagflation defeated all
macro-economic theories.  Monetarism was called in after stagflation
took effect but failed (as of her writing) to cure the problem, so there
is probably no contradiction.  Monetarism seems adequate theoretically
but failed in practice, and thus was defeated.  "In sum, measures
contrived to fight inflation were proving ruinous to producers and their
work forces, while measures contrived to help producers were enlarging
government deficits."

I think, but am not sure, that stagflation ended under Volcker/Greenspan
by the mid-80s.  I presume that would provisionally count as vindication
for monetarism -- unless one could find some other reason for recovery.
I've been inclined anyway to suspect that macro-economics is the real
voodoo economics, simply due to lack of solid data (complex subject,
we've only been collecting good data for some decades, and screwing with
the system in different ways most of the time -- not exactly a
controlled experiment); Jacobs' criticism and the apparently universal
bafflement at the current state of the economy aren't doing much to
convince me otherwise.

} in that book - is that many countries are almost just one giant city-state

Yep, I've gotten that far.  As Anton notes, she blames national
currencies.  She accepts classical analysis of currencies as feedback
mechanism -- import too much and your currency drops, forming an
automatic and temporary tariff and export subsidy -- then first makes an
analogy to a hundred people with a hundred lungs and one brainstem.  Not
a healthy situation; this is the multi-city nation.  Later she describes
one brainstem controlling the breathing of an elephant, 3 sheep, 2
puppy dogs and a rabbit.  This is a multi-city nation much of whose
trade is international.  Presumably one city will be strongest in trade;
it then gets the most accurate feedback signals from currency
fluctuations.  The other cities get choked off, and the nation-state
turns into a city-state with excessive welfare rolls (i.e. the rest of
the country.  Rural America gets a larger share of welfare dollars than
most voters realize, I think.)

} Berlin/Prepartition Germany, Tokyo/Japan, Moscow/Soviet Union, Madrid/Spain,
} Lisbon/Portugal, Athens/Greece, Mexico City/Mexico, Buenos Aires/Argentina,
} Sydney/Australia.  The city-state is typically 1/6 or so of the population,

Milan and relatives/Italy, Stockholm Sweden, Copenhagen/Denmark,
Toronto/Canada.  The
Netherlands are a partial exception:  many cities are hooked up in a
"Ring City".  The basic rule holds: one currency, one active economic
region.

Large empires mostly trade domestically, so there's no feedback, and the
cities wander market space at random until they die off.  This may be
what happened to the Roman Empire; control was increasing centralized,
and the various cities gradually decayed.  

The US has a high proportion of domestic trade, so turning into a
city-state would be slow at best.  Earlier in our history, and in Japan
as well, protective tariffs can take the place of currency fluctuation.
Post-colonial cities should have had weak currencies, because they were
weak, but being grouped with strong rural exports (especially from the
South) boosted the dollar and could have strangled development, as in
her example of Uruguay.  Tariffs helped our cities develop, but
effectively this was a subsidy from the South, and tariffs don't provide
internal feedback.

One thing about the Pacific Rim, the "tigers of Asia": Hong Kong and
Singapore are nothing but cities with their own currencies, and Taiwan
and South Korea are pretty small, close to city-states naturally.

Another optimistic note about them was that Western Europe took
centuries to rebuild after the fall of Rome, led by Venice which fed off
of Constantinople in the beginning.  America took about a century or two
to build up its cities.  Japan took a few decades (twice) to
industrialize.  The Pacific Rim has moved even faster.  Whether this is
due to greater general knowledge or being smaller and smaller bits
relative to a large economy is unclear, but it might be good news for
the speed of development elsewhere, if it ever starts right.

But medieval Europe had many, many currencies, at least once they were
rich enough to have any currencies.  The cities of the Hanseatic League
had their own currencies.

True.  "Great city", "city region", "import-replacing city".  I like
"great city" myself.  Do San Diego or the big cities of Texas qualify?
I'm wondering what the distribution of great cities is in this country,
and I'm not sure how to tell from a distance: what statistics to look
at, or whether I should get phone books delivered and look at the index.

Maybe she says that later; so far it's because we have a lot of domestic
trade, and perhaps multiple strong international trading cities to begin
with.

She also suggests that unification might have been China's bane,
claiming most Chinese innovations preceded full unification.  If true
this would be a more concrete link than Jared Diamond used to explain
why Europe overtook China.  He had to say being unified allowed China to
regress stupidly as one unit, without competition.  Jacobs would posit
that stagnation was inevitable.

All of which suggests that Europe is about to make a big mistake.  If
currencies -- feedbacks -- should be tightly linked to the regions they're
feeding back to, Europe needs more, not less.  Scotland and Southern
Italy have cities, after all; they just don't do anything.  Being
coupled without feedback to London and northen Italy is bad enough.
All of Europe?

Yes, if we can't find something that is really 3 dimensional, or at least 
8 dimensional, then we couldn't get arbitrarily close and would have to 
settle for 10^-33 cm and forget about infinite computation. Another slight 
problem is that I'm not exactly sure where I'm going to get an infinite amount 
of matter, 3D or otherwise, to build all those processors, but I'm a big

I also heard that, about the 10 dimensions.  When the universe sprang forth
it was split into 4 and 6 dimensions.  But Ive heard other things too, like
infinite dimensions, and other numbers, like 8, relating to the circuits in
our brain (Leary's model).

Has anyone heard of the zero point theory(?), it states that there is more
energy than the whole universe contained within each cubic centimeter, within
another dimension, and may be able to be tapped into, so that energy may be
able to be converted to matter so thats where you can get unlimited matter
from.  What are we gonna do with all this energy/matter?

This sounds somewhat like a "symbol-grounding" problem.  Heres the
abstract of a fascinating Internet dialog, "Virtual Symposium on the
Virtual Mind", from 1992 [1]:
< When certain formal symbol systems (e.g., computer programs) are
implemented as dynamic physical symbol systems (e.g., run on a
computer) their activity can be interpreted at higher levels . . .
called "virtual" systems. If such a virtual system is interpretable as
if it had a mind, is such a "virtual mind" real? This is the question
addressed in this "virtual" symposium, originally conducted
electronically among four cognitive scientists: Donald Perlis, a
computer scientist, argues that according to the computationalist
thesis, virtual minds are real . . . Stevan Harnad, a psychologist,
argues that . . . virtual minds are just hermeneutic
overinterpretations, and symbols must be grounded in the real world of
objects, not just the virtual world of interpretations. Computer
scientist Patrick Hayes argues that . . . A real implementation must
not be homuncular but mindless and mechanical, like a computer. Only
then can it give rise to a mind at the virtual level. Philosopher Ned
Block suggests that there is no reason a mindful implementation would
not be a real one.>

Harnad has a more formal paper on the symbol-grounding problem [2]
where he says:
< Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic
representations of two kinds:  (1) "iconic representations," which are
analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and
events, and (2) "categorical representations," which are learned and
innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of
object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary
symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned
on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations.
Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations," grounded in these
elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category
membership relations. Connectionism is one natural candidate for the
mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical
representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections
of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be
seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic
model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling.>

But, I also like Patrick Hayes reasoning about the evolutionary
advantages of virtual machines which is nicely summarized in a
recent JCS Online thread [3]:

Hayes cites Sam Salt saying: 
< I do not believe that programs 'learn', 'adapt', 'pounce' and so on,
except by very broad analogy to how humans do these things. Programs
mostly implement only three things (sequence, selection and iteration)
by the way in which they can be pushed through a central processing
unit(CPU) which only accepts inputs sequentially.>

Hayes responds:
< [SNIP] Salt, like many electrical engineers, stops at the processor
circuitry . . . One can't reverse engineer software from hardware . .
. Much software doesn't run on the electronic hardware; it runs on one
or another virtual machine . . . [Salt says: regardless of] your
high-level language . . . the low-level implementation uses the same
lowly sequential CPU.  [And Hayes responds:] This is to be celebrated!
Here we have a simple physical mechanism which can produce
extraordinarily complex, symbolically significant, behaviors which can
grow and change, without altering the machine at all! All it needs is
more and more memory, which itself is a simple mechanism. Isnt this
more like a brain that any other mechanism we have ever come across? >

You need to be a bit cautious when reading the
"free energy" newsgroups. Many posters on those groups
tend to let their urgent desire for free energy overwhelm
their objectivity, to say the least. They also tend to 
grab a concept from theoretical physics and warp it
beyond all recognition. You did well to use "may" your
questions above.  Yes, some recent theoretical models
use the concept of "vacuum energy" or "zero-point energy."
I confess I don't know enough about the theory to comment on
practical applications, but as I recall, the energy is analogous
to perfectly isothermal heat energy and is thus unusable.
Perhaps another list member can point both of us to a
good reference?

Yes, for a while there the cosomlogists and the TOE guys were
coming up with a theory a week or beter, and each one seemed
to have its own pet number of dimensions. These mathematical
models have essentially no relationship to Leary's model, which
IMO is mystical, not mathematical, and is therefore beyond the
bounds of science. I recall a review in Science magazine within
the last six months. The review atempted to categorize the various
models.

No one questioned your right to be absent; you were simply missed.
While those of us who were in the room had to stay awake though
half an hour or more of Sharon Presley's fact-free and imagination-
free egalitarian drivel, I know I wasn't the only one in the room
longing for comments from someone actually capable of independent
thinking on the matter, such as you.  It is indeed unusual for a
panelist in such a discussion to call upon an audience member by
name (it happened two other times at E3 if I remember), but I for
one could feel the starvation for intellectual stimulation in the
room during that panel, and would have welcomed anyone with ideas,
even bad ones.

The only entertaining pieces of that hour were Max and Natasha, who
talked about rewiring orgasms to activities other than sex (Max said
he'd like to get off on writing--literally), and having genitals
designed by artists (too bad M.C.Escher is dead--I'd like to rise
indefinitely like one of his staircases).

Fact-free *and* imagination-free?  I am impressed.

Monetarism is a "kinda" failure.  It had two big conclusions:

1) Playing with the inflation rate cannot improve the long-term function of
the economy, only mess it up.

This has basically turned out turn, although there still is some work that
indicates a little (less than 3%) inflation may help.

2) The inflation rate is determined by the size of the money supply.

This has turned out to be true only when the financial markets don't innovate
and are fairly restrictive.  It used to work passably well, but is a major
bust today, due to deregulation and computers.  

Right now the major central banks achieve monetarist goals with
non-monetarist means. The current state of the money markets in
industrialized countries seems to validate their approach.

Actually, most of us already use personality transmitters, although
they may be more subtle.  Each person's clothing and mannerisms
display their interests to a varying degree.  Anders "broadcasts"
the "transhumanist code" clearly when he wears his ">H" button. :)

The "web part" would probably make the information much more
expensive to get at.  Believe it or not, not everybody has
Ricochet yet...

I haven't used a Newton, but they are supposed to be able to
"squirt" business card information in IR.  It's a terrible
shame they didn't include an IR bulb in the PalmPilot for
transferring (say) address book records, especially since i
hear that the Dragonball even has specialized pins for IR
output.  <sigh>

Then again, it sounds like what we're after is a radio
transmitter: one that you don't need to intentionally
activate broadcasting for.  But your batteries wouldn't last.

But what you said about clothes and so forth was neat because when we parse
icons such as clothes instead of having more explicit information, the
'right' people will be the most likely to parse correctly.

Ha-ha! If people start wearing 'smart-badges' to transmit what they want
people to know about them some of the first transmissions I expect to
recieve will be 'ask me about cheap phone service' and 'Imagine! I'm still
single.' Followed shortly by badges transmitting spam warnings about phony
badges.

OK, this isn't really hard science, but if they were really personality
transmitters (not radio transmitters), they would energize each other by
recieving as well as sending. The presence of transmitter B would cause
transmitter A to send its message, and B would get the message with a pulse
of energy, stimulating it to send its message to A.

I know the original idea was to facilitate physical interactions
when we meet each other in a crowd, but I interact with you on the
net, not in person. I guess I'd better at least put my picture on
the web.

The word "torturing" was a key part of my statement.  To create is not
to torture.

You could look at centralization as the form that failure takes at
first, which induces other failures later.  From this view the lack of
global centralization simply shows that we have not yet failed, offers
little hope by itself that we won't fail later.

Yes, but more so: Clearly several english words should have their 
standard pronunciation corrected to match Anders's own.  Some of them 
were just beautiful, spoken by him.  I am not kidding about this, Anders!

This is a good example of reasonable scientific theory being unjustifiably
twisted and modified to fit the preconcieved fantasy of someone who can not
tell the difference.

Zero point field (also commonly referred to as Quantum Vacuum, or QV)
theory is an interesting consequence of quantum mechanics, but is by no
means a source of "free energy".  The zero point field is a pervasive and
essentially uniform radiation field with a Lorentz invariant spectrum.
Although, you can generate some interesting phenomena by manipulating this
field (currently our ability to do so is extremely limited), these always
seem to require adding energy to the system in some form or another.

Zero point field theory has *nothing* to do with "another dimension" in the
sense that you are most likely using it.  The only potentially interesting
consequences that I am aware of is a possible explanation of inertial mass
and the gravitational force (which would not be a fundamental force in this
model).

There are a few scientific and rigorous papers on the net regarding this,
but I do not have the URLs.  On most search engines you'll have to wade
through a ton of garbage to find something good.  "stochastic
electrodynamics" or "Lorentz invariant" are probably a good key phrases to
weed out most of the 
free-energy and UFO crowd.

In some tech fields this is a regular phenomenon.  I suspect the delay is
due primarily to the fact that the analysts are not technically savvy
enough to determine whether the announcement is important or not (among the
many that are routinely made) and are forced to wait for some science types
to speak up.  It is very feasible that money could be made on this
phenomenon if you tracked the science news carefully and were knowledgeable
enough to determine the market reaction.  Some announcements, on the other
hand, produce a Pavlovian response in stock analysts that gives almost no
lead time.  In these cases you can make money only if you are able to
predict the market position after you take cascade and feedback effects
into consideration.  Actually, I find stock analysts' Pavlovian response's
to be fairly easy targets for making money, primarily because they are so
predictable.

Another related phenomena is that even when the analysts respond quickly,
related companies often experience a similar stock boost, but usually after
a short delay.  This varies widely, dependant mostly on the particular
industry and company involved.  

I am currently working on software algorithms (part of a larger software
package under design) to predict the delay, cascade, and feedback factors
as the result of such technology announcements.  Accurate probability
assessment in such situations is a non-trivial computational problem,
although the human brain can often "intuit" the situation with training or
experience.

One of my main problems at Extr3 was that I didn't have enough
buttons and the right texts on them (everybody wants a different
text). I would really like to be able to mail more buttons to people
(they are wonderful memetic vectors), but it might be slightly costly

Actually, I made them using SuperPaint on a mac using public

The book is Psychology by Smith (West 1993), a common basic
psychology textbook. It doesn't tell how old the children were, or
when they were adopted, just the correlations. Too bad. We have to
look at the original papers.

Actually, picotech would act on the quantum scale from the start
(nanotech is just above it). Some of the obvious uses would
be to transmute atoms, cause particles to decay, build new particles
(including weird stuff), perhaps create quark matter and neutronium,
and of course do computing with it. Of course, we haven't got the
faintest idea of how to do this, it makes nanotech look like medieval
mechanics.

The chemistry in _Dragons Egg_ was based on the atoms near the
surface of the neutron star; their behavior can be quite complex
(magentically stabilized ultra-strong whiskers is one possibility I
like) but it is the neutronium itself which is interesting.

Unfortunately this seems to be the most likely state, a superliquid
of neutronium. But do not despair, it would contain flux tubes for
angular momentum and magnetic fields, which perhaps could do some
neat trick (I think they are to sparse to be a truly dense computer
though, judging from my reading on neutron stars). In fact neutron
stars might contain both proton and neutron superfluids, with
independent flux tubes.

My best bet is on quark matter, that could be an excellent substrate
for intelligence. See Baxter's _Flux_ for a fictional treatment with
plenty of hard science for how nuclear, neutronium and quark life
could co-exist.

 I had the Olivetti active badge system in mind when I wrote that,
the whole thing reminds me of a sort of "digital Quipu".

Note: the following info on quipu is from the Bruce Sterling
inspired and run "Dead Media Project"

 Dead Media Working Notes 00.3

 Source:  Communication in History:  Technology, Culture, Society
 David Crowley and Paul Heyer, eds.
 Longman, New York and London, 1991
 ISBN 0-8013-0598-5
 
 From the article:  "Civilization Without Writing -- The Inca and
the Quipu"  by Marcia Ascher and Robert Ascher (also authors of
"Code of the Quipu:  A  Study in Media, Mathematics and Culture",
publisher and date unknown)
 
 "A quipu is a collection of cords with knots tied in them.   The
cords were usually made of cotton, and they were often dyed one or
more colors.  When  held in the hands, a quipu is unimpressive;
surely, in our culture, it might  be mistaken for a tangled old
mop.  (...)
 
     "Quipus probably predate the coming to power of the Incas. 
But under  the Incas, they became part of statecraft. (....)
 
      "There are several extremely important properties of
quipus....  First  of all, quipus can be assigned horizontal
direction. (...)  Quipumakers knew  which end was which; we will
assume that they start at the looped ends and  proceed to the
knotted ends.  Quipus can also be assigned vertical  direction. 
Pendant cords and top cords are vertically opposite to each
 other with pendant cords considered to go downward and top cords
upward.  (...)  Quipus have levels.  Cords attached to the main
cord are on one  level; their subsidiaries form a second level. 
Subsidiaries to these  subsidiaries form a third level, and so on. 
Quipus are made of cords and  spaces between cords. (...)  Larger
or smaller spaces between cords are an  intentional part of the
overall construction. (...)
 
       "As well as having a particular placement, each cord has a
color.  Color is fundamental to the symbolic system of the quipu.
(...)  Basically,  the quipumaker designed each quipu using color
coding to relate some cords  together and to distinguish them from
other cords.  (...) Additional cord  colors were created by
spinning the colored yarns together.  Two solid  colors twisted
together gives a candy cane effect, two of these twisted
together using the opposite twist direction gives a mottled effect,
and the  two solid colors can be joined so that part of the cord is
one color and the  rest of it is another color.  (...)
 
        "For the most part, cords had knots tied along them and the
knots  represented numbers.  But we are certain that before knots
were tied in the  cords, the entire blank quipu was prepared.  The
overall planning and  construction of the quipu was done first,
including the types of cord  connections, the relative placement of
cords, the selection of cord colors,  and even individual
decorative finishings.  (...)   The quipumaker's recording was
nonlinear.  (...)  A group of strings occupy a space that has
no definite orientation; as the quipumaker connected strongs to
each other,  the space became defined by the points where the
strings were attached.  (...)    Essentially then, the quipmaker
had to have the ability to conceive  and execute a recording in
three dimensions with color."
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Have you ever heard of the quipu of preColumbian Peru?
 If you have, it's a minor miracle.   The  archives of
 Incan quipu were burned by the Spanish conquerors, after
 the Council of Lima in the year 1583.   There are about
 400 authentic quipus left in the entire world.   Every
 last one of the quipus we possess nowadays was dug out of
 a human grave.
 
        Well, not quite every last one.  I happen to have a
 brand-new quipu here in my pocket.  I was doing quite a
 bit of reading about quipu, so I decided I'd make one.
 
        The word quipu means 'account' in the Quechua
 language, so the quipu was basically a kind of accounting
 device and calculator.   This is a fabric network to carry
 data.  This was the only recording medium that the Incas
 had.   It served all the recording functions of their
 society.
 
        No one today seems to have any real idea how these
 quipu worked.  They all looked more or less like this one
 -- they had a thick fabric backbone, with a series of
 dependent fringes.  But the fringes could also have
 fringes.  Sometimes there were as many as six
 subdirectories coming off the backbone of the network.
 They had a variety of different knots.  They had quite a
 wide variety of colors.  People have only the vaguest
 ideas what the colors may have signified.
 
        This is a very small quipu.  The largest remaining
 quipu weighs about forty pounds and has well over two
 thousand dependent cords.  No one has any idea what this
 device signifies or what message it carries.  It was
 buried with a Peruvian gentleman who was modestly well to
 do, but he doesn't appear to have been particularly
 prominent.
 
        The Incas had no idea that the planet harbored any
 civilization other than their own.   As far as they were
 concerned, these quipu were the absolute apex of human
 intellectual accomplishment.   And one must admit they
 have a lot to offer.  They're very light -- wool and
 cotton -- they're portable and durable.  Crush-proof.   No
 problem with power surges or headcrashes.    A good thing
 they were portable too, because one of their primary
 functions was the census.
 
        It appears that everyone without exception in the Inca
 realm existed as a knot in a quipu somewhere.   The Incas
 were great masters of ethnic cleansing.  They thought
 nothing of ordering thousands of people out of their homes
 to distant realms as pioneers and settlers.  Everyone
 simply loaded all their possessions onto their backs and
 left immediately.  Thanks to the quipu, there was simply
 no way they would ever be missed by the authorities.
 
        The Inca economic system was a centralized command
 economy.   A third of the nation's economic output was
 stored in vast ranks of stone cells.  Everything down to
 the last sandal was recorded on quipu.
 
        I don't think there was ever an alphabet in quipu.  I
 don't think that the Inca were literate in that fashion,
 because their empire was only a hundred years old.  There
 was nothing to pronounce that you could find on a piece of
 string.  But there may have been geneologies in string --
 hierarchies, maybe family trees.  Maps, even -- three
 days' journey, they forded a blue river, they fought a red
 battle -- you can imagine how usefully suggestive this
 might have been.  Maybe you could attack language even
 more directly with a quipu:   meter, stress, quantity,
 pitch, length of the poem -- why should this be hard to
 believe?   In English we sometimes call telling a story
 "spinning a yarn."
 
         These Incas were fine textile makers.  They had a lot
 of wool and cotton.  The government made them grow it, and
 their women spun yarn every day of their lives.  When a
 quipucamayoc read one of these recording devices, I don't
 think his lips moved.   There was nothing crude or halting
 or primitive or painful about the experience -- a quipu is
 certainly a  more tactile and sensual and three-
 dimensional experience than a book.
 
        The quipu was a medium.  It was a way to cast the
 world into an entire new form of order.  It was a medium
 invented by and for a very careful and methodical people,
 people who liked to fit huge boulders together so snugly
 that you couldn't slip a knife-blade between them.   For
 the Incas, this was the Net -- a net that caught their
 population in a sieve that dominated the whole material
 world, a sieve that no one could escape.
 
        You know, in today's ultramediated world, I think it's
 quite a good idea to go into a quiet room with a quipu.
 Go to a room and shut off the electricity.  Don't look at
 the quipu with scorn or condescension.    Just hold it in
 your hands and try to pretend that this the only possible
 abstract relationship, besides speech, that you have with
 the world.   Really try to imagine what you are *missing*
 by not comprehending all economics, all governmental
 business, all nonverbal communication, as a network of
 colored yarn.    Think of this as a discipline, as an act
 of imaginative concentration, as a human engagement with a
 profoundly alien media alternative.
 
        It's truly pitiful how little is known or remembered
 about the quipu, a dead medium which was once the nervous
 system of a major civilization.  And yet that is by no
 means the only form of knot record.  There's the
 Tlascaltec nepohualtzitzin, the Okinawan warazan, the
 Bolivian chimpu. Samoan, Egyptian, Hawaiian, Tibetan,
 Bengali, Formosan knot records.  So far, I know almost
 nothing about these beyond their names.   I'd like to
 learn more.  If I learn more and you're on my list, I'll
 tell you about it.

     Sarrah Marr wrote in response to Tony Hollick's rant:
     
     To most people, and most dictionaries, 'sexual' means 'of or 
     concerning sex'. And sex does not mean making babies. I find it hard 
     to agree that heterosexual people having penetrative intercourse 
     without a condom are engaging in sexual activity, whilst those having 
     penetrative sex with a condom are not. "Making babies" is a subset of 
     sex, not vice-versa.
     
     
     Rick Knight responds:
     
     A practical and sober response Sarah.  I'm of the mind that in this 
     particular instance, any other attempts to reason in this arena would 
     be like beating one's head against a brick wall <G>.
     
     I asked my partner about this whole teacher-lover-mother situation 
     with Mary Kay whoever.  He was actively pursued by a father figure man 
     when he was 13 and they had an affair.  It went on for the summer.  It 
     ended up being a big public court mess of course when the parents 
     found out.  The guy was in his late 20s and had used guilt and other 
     adult-honed forms of manipulation to make his boy-lover more mailable. 
     
     Regardless of the information-richness of our society, the exceptions 
     we may deem appropriate or inappropriate in the realm of love/sex, 
     this woman was the boy's teacher, she was entrusted in a relationship 
     of propriety.  The boy would only naturally follow his impulses (like 
     boys his age will whether it's an unrequited crush or having one's 
     first hump or blow job in some private stolen moment).  I regard the 
     teacher (as does my partner) as an emotional child.  She has 
     sacrificed a great deal because of a howling error in judgment.  While 
     there may be volumes of extenuating circumstances Mr. Hollick can 
     dredge up to garner sympathy for the woman, fact of the matter is 
     doing what she did in our culture is no more appropriate than when 
     Ethiopian immigrants try to continue the tradition of female 
     "circumcision" in this country and think it's not a crime.  We as a 
     culture have deemed it so.  
     
     Until such time where children are somehow imbued with experience, 
     wisdom and discernment, they are not appropriate sexual partners for 
     adults.  The chasm is too wide (although considering the lame-brained 
     folly of Mary Kay, maybe they were closer, emotional maturity-wise, 
     than one may think! <G>).

     precision, awesome as merely a metaphor.  For what it's worth, I like 
     to think it opened up, a little further, the minds of a few people who 
     viewed it.  To use the basis of empirical truth against intuitive

     Sagan or Zemeckis or both who crafted the mentality of a child who,

     I remember thinking when she gave that line that "millions" was much

     Anders Sandberg was based on the presentation of his lecture - not

Hal Finney quotes Gregory J. E. Rawlins:

> interesting species---transhumanity. 

Listening to Greg Stock at Extro 3 I formed this hypothesis: that what
most unites us is a conviction that within a century (or two at most)
the world will be a VERY different place.  Greg had been arguing that
people shouldn't try to stop some simple genetic possibilities,
because things are going to get lots stranger that that and people
better get used to it.  And it seeems to me that most elements of our
community can be understood as coming from our taking the idea of a
strange future very seriously.

Lots of people seem to sorta believe in a strange future, yet seem
unwillling or unable to actually take the time to think seriously
about it. 

But I wonder:  is there any smart person out there who understands the
sorts of arguements that lead us to expect strangeness, and yet who
disagrees with our conclusion?

Huh?  If one has "obvious sexiness", then one is likely is demand.
And one can easily be very frustrated if unable to participate for
whatever reason.

Yes of course.  And if most people were physically starving, I

Do you have any more information or references on this? I'm just
trying to finish may Jupiter Brain paper, and if this holds I'll have
to adjust some of my equations. Unfortunately I slept through error
correcting codes in combinatorics, I liked generating series too
much.

Sounds almost like my idea of becoming an open standard. "There is no

I like the idea of mutual information, it makes a lot of sense.

I can see that people would want to signal their mental abilities via
conversation. I can also see that people might want to display their
ability to persuade the tribe to take some action they favor.  But as
you note, we don't understand why this would require people to
strongly identify with particular views.

For example, in academic discourse people typically speak about the
strengths and weaknesses of particular views, and less often say "I
believe", even when they do.

Thanks for the many replies on this topic.  

Taking raw "votes", I seem to get the most votes for 

> 2) "Explaining Product Bans" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps)

But I think I might see a pattern.  My libertarian friends like this
one, my older friends (like my parents) who have the most contact with
current health care systems like this one

> 1) "Incentive Contracts" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html)

and my academic/abstract-thinker friends like this one:

> 3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps)

I'd be interested to hear of evidence against this theory, that the
distribution of responses mainly reflects the distribution of health
care contact vs. libertarians vs. academics among those I've asked.

My other general comment is that I'm now thinking about these
alternatives more in terms of what there is for me to learn.  In the
"Incentive Contracts" project, I would mainly be trying to convince
non-economists of some standard results known to economists.  I'd have
a lot to learn about institutional details, and about how to perusade,
but I'm not sure that would keep my interest up.  The "Why we
disagree" project, on the other hand, is most centered on a question I
don't know the answer to, and so I am most personally curious to work
on this project to learn the answer to the question.  The "Product
Bans" project is in the middle; I think I understand the basic
dynamic, but there are lots of details I don't understand to work on.
So I'm wondering how much weight I should give to selfish curiousity,
vs. "making an impact".  Tough choice. 

Now for responses to specific comments:

Hal writes:

I understand your point, but I'm more optimistic about the long term.
I think, for example, that many people have been influenced by
understanding Bayesian decision theory.  I think I was.

>gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.  "Sorry, we've decided it's cheaper
>just to pay out your life insurance than to cure you.  Have a nice death."

Unless we want to pay any arbitrary amount for any small health help,
we *must* accept that at some point possible cares are not given.
The issue is to induce the right cost/benefit tradeoffs.
As you note in a later post, we now do this indirectly via "standard
practice", "its experimental", and other indirect labels.  I'm
proposing we be very direct about making cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
I'm curious to see what you fear about such directness.

Hal Finney does a good job of summarizing the best Many-Worlds Theory:

It has long (since ~ '84) seemed to me that what all one really needs
is a way to "kill" off relatively small branches.  Imagine there were a
slight non-linearity whereby when there are two branches that are
sufficiently similar, and one of the branches has a large enough
amplitude relative to the other one, then physics in the small branch
gets modified in big enough way as to kill off living creatures like
ourselves.  This would seem to imply that creatures like us only
survive in the branches with large relative amplitude, which would
seem to imply experimental verification of the squared-amplitude
probability law for QM.

I was very interested in studying this topic when I was a grad student
in physics and philosophy of science back in '81-84.  But as Nicholas
notes, philosophers don't take many worlds seriously (or didn't till
recently).  And physicists didn't think it an appropriate topic for
non-senior folks.  Had I been encouraged more, I would have pursued
this research idea in much more depth.  As it is, I likely won't get
around to doing physics again for quite some time.

Yeah, but people screw this usage up all the time because thermic
energy is not something that can be directly sensed without knowledge
of specific heat of the substance you are touching with your skin
(and knowledge of the temperature of your fingers or whatever you're
using as a thermal sensor).  What we feel is the rate of heat
conduction across our skins, plus incident infrared radiation and
absorbed light, and that relates only messily and incompletely to
what modern thermodynamicists call "heat" in the strict sense.
Caloric lives on in human nervous systems, lurking in the currents
of "common sense".

It's a bit like trying to translate candelas into watts, or watts
into candelas.  Candelas really are just measuring power, like
watts, but power seen through a inverted-U shaped filter that looks
only at the visible wavelengths of the full photonic spectrum.
Likewise, our current bodies only pick up on some of the phenomena
of heat, and we manage to piece together concepts of the "physical
reality" going on behind our sensorium. That real historical progress
is possible in this process of piecing together and testing our
perceptual filters and models of the world has always fascinated
me, and is still rather mysterious to me.

One of the functions of gray-goo stories is to remind people
that we have no guarantee that the future will be very
interesting. I find that rather motivating. It's one of the
things that keeps my optimism dynamic rather than static.

Yes, that's a very interesting question.  ;^)

Wow! I have some questions on this:

Were any wreath-shaped quipu found? These might be monthly or 
yearly calendars. Planting and harvesting might be represented by
a pendant string, for example. An astronomical calendar should be 
recognizable, and decipherable.

Were any fids, needles, combs with widely-spaced teeth, or odd-looking
frameworks found in the graves that held the quipu?

Any children's graves found? These may hold the equivalent of a
grammar book.

Are some of the knots of a kind that can be easily moved along the string
(e.g. the simple overhand knot)? These would allow updating the record.
Loosening the knot with a fid, then sliding it along the string with the fid,
pulling the ends to re-set the knot. Are three any beads on the quipu that
might perform the same function (beads can encode more local information 
than a knot, like the icons below)?
What type is the primary knot?

Have any knot theorists studied these things?

Are there cross-links from one branched structure to another? These may 
indicate interrelationships, or simple keep the structure organized. It seems
to me a large and complicated quipu might have had an associated framework.
Alternatively, they might have been suspended on several threads from
something that looks like a small gallows.

The knotted string construct you describe has the ability to store information 
in a multi-variable (multi-dimensional) fashion. Several knotted strings tied 
together at a single point may represent many different aspects of the 
same thing.

The efficacy of this system of representation may have hampered the
development of the written word.

I have dabbled with various means of representing information in a 3D
construct. My latest effort is a 3D animated scheduler- icons stand or 
march along a time axis, priorities and other variables on the other
two axes. The icons code for various kinds of projects and activities, 
colored lines (!) connect between them to indicate interrelationships. 
It is unfortunately entirely visual,  although audio could be added
(e.g. click an icon for a spoken description).

The tactile (in addition to the visual) nature of the quipu is, I think, a decided
advantage- something I argued for on a recent panel discussing VR
applications. I was shouted down (by Howard Davidson, no less) based 
on the amount of the brain devoted to visual vs. tactile processing. I would 
now argue that this ratio is a recent development, that primitives (like me) 
have a somewhat different ratio, weighted more towards the physical. This 
is a testable hypothesis.

Incidentally, much of my inventive work involves conceptually _feeling_,
or _being_ the thing, as opposed to looking at it from the outside.
Einstein spoke of a similar method, I think he called it muscle knowledge.

None that I've found.
There are however, many brilliant people that simply close off
such speculation. You spoke of your cohorts at Caltech being

"I believe" is a metaphysical phrase I never use, rather "I think",
which is shorthand for "I assign a high probability to the veracity
of this claim". Holding a belief constrains the mind.

The Bethe/Brown kaonic state is only stable for a few seconds, just long
enough to explain the delay in neutrino emmision (from supernova
1987A). It is postulated to be a gigantic, star-wide Bose-Einstein 
condensate. Such a state cannot support much diversity, as all the 
particles are in the same (for certain parameters) quantum state.

Eh? Why to obliterate Civilization As We Know It, of course.
My semi-study involves sequenced relativistic bombing across the
disk of the Sun (or enemy star) to construct a (hemi)spherical
implosion shock front. Early warning would be very brief, though
it does take time for the star to cook.

Not necessarily.  One might not *want* to be in demand.  Being in demand

Ok. Individual choice.  Although, perhaps the participation might be less

I'm noticing an upsurge of this kind of questioning lately -- perhaps a
consequence of X3, which reminded folks that transhumanism is as much like
a fledgling community as it is a conversation.  Nicholas Bostrom's
question as to whether it is an occupational hazard of extropianism to
expect the future to be interesting in ways we like is another variant.  I
think there are lots of folks at present who expect a strange future on
the horizon, and lots of kindred spirits among those who relish the
unexpected strangenesses of the present-day.  Of these people I have in
mind the folks who litter the hallways of my Department at Berkeley, the
queer theorists, multiculturalists, poststructuralists, and the like (I
think Nietzsche was the first serious theorist of the singularity). 
Despite rough affinities, though, there is definitely a difference that
makes a difference.  The spirit of rolling up shirtsleeves and grappling
with problems and possibilities, perhaps?  I am loath to think of
extropianism as a "movement" (movements don't have a particularly
attractive track record in the twentieth century really), but there is a
flavor to conversation in these fora that you simply can't find anywhere
else.  I wonder, is extropianism just libertarian-inflected technophilia,
or more?  Is it a foretaste of what societies may come to look like once
the specters of death and conspicuous scarcities are finally trashed for
good?  Is this just a place where likeminded folks come for the waters? 
Discussions of the desirability of an extropian political party a few
weeks back had me wondering just what kind of agenda could a group like
this intelligibly agree to.  Expedite the arrival of the singularity
(whatever that might be)?  Bring on the demise of the nation-state? 
Frustrate the surge of religious fundamentalisms?  What?  Best, Dale

It's all a matter of degree, Robin. You understand my arguments, but
you don't agree that the singularity will occur wihtin 9 years. :-)

I have heard it, and there seems to be some neuropsychology to
support it (but this is of course still speculative) :-)

Seriously, I think both are parallel systems. Pain is quite well
understood (OK, I'm lying - but it is much better understood than
pleasure) and seems to involve a series of spinal regulatory systems
(the pain gates of the zona gelatinosa) sending signals up to the
periaqueductal gray matter (seems to control it), the activation
systems of the brainstem (esp. the locus ceruleus) and the thalamus,
where it sends both "sharp" signals to the sensory cortices ("WHERE
is the pain?") and diffuse signals to all of the brain ("THERE IS
PAIN!"). 

Pleasure seems to be based in the basal forebrain (the septal region,
esp. nucleus accumbens), closely linked to the serotenergic systems,
the limbic system, hypothalamus and the medial forebrain bundle. 

Note that pleasure seems to come from inside the brain, while pain
seems to come from the outside. They are also independent, you can
have great pleasure while having great pain. So my guess is that
since pain is very activating, it might enhance the pleasure
experience besides adding another "bouquet" to it; a wild speculation
might be that it makes the usual almost epileptic limbic activity
during intense pleasure even wilder.

Who said neuroscience only had medical uses? I think it can be
applied with some success in the bedroom... :-)

I'm now readoing the book. The quote is similar in tone to
something Ellie says in the book, but in the book, Sagan uses
numbers that do make sense.

In the Book, Ellie's childhood is much more complex (Father
dies, Mother remarries, becomes weak and ineffectual, stepfather
is a male chauvinist non-supportive asshole professor) but the
movie captures the tone of the book beautifully, a free translation
to a new medium rather than an awkward transliteration. The biggest
difficulty with reading the book so far is that, being written in 1985,
the Soviet Union is assumed to still be here. It's a bit jarring.

Look up "Hamming distance" in any computer hardware text. Conceptually,
Its fairly straigtforward, but the details are a bit awkward. Caution:
theory and practice diverge considerably in current practice: about
half of all attempts to recover from backups fail due to procedural
mishaps, because recovery is a rare operation and the administrators
are not used to it. Funny thing: in the 1960's, Burroughs mainframes
had extremely reliable recovery mechanisms that nearly always worked.
They had to, because the hardware was unreliable enough that recovery
was a relatively frequent operation. I think you need to factor this
into you calculations. For example, you may want to run your galaxy
with the ability to detect errors in pairs instead of just single
errors (in each block) then, you can continously induce single errors
to verify that the backup system is working. This continuous effort will
occupy resources over and above the resourced needed for the redundant
data
encoding.

I would be interested to hear your opinions about the following 
problem: (and especially Robin Hanson's opinion, since it's close to 
his area of expertise)

How do we best deal with the danger of nuclear proliferation and 
the spread of other weapons of  mass destruction?

It is conceivable, for example, that there will be some early stages 
of nanotechnology, before the onset of a singularity-like event, 
where nanotechnology could provide destructive powers sufficient to 
eliminate all intelligent life on earth. (And this might be before 
any significant space-colonization has taken place.)

One possible answer, of course, is a world government. Does anybody 
have what they think is a better idea, or an idea of how best to 
implement a world government?

It seems clear to me that this problem needs to be addressed. I've 
heard people defending "each one's right to his or her own nuke", but 
that principle seems to me absurd. (Since each nuke could kill more 
than a million people, and there probably are more than one 
per million who would use his nuke, it would kill all of us.)

Yes, but you have to include our belief that this strangeness will be 
brought aboutmainly  by technology, otherwise all religious and 
environmentalist doomsday sects would fall in the same category. One 
could say: Transhumanism is the doctrine that new technologies will 
make the world extremely different soon.

Bioweapons are far more likely to get out of control in a massive
and destructive fashion than nukes or mechanosynthetic molecular
nanotechnology. Weapons built by the genetic modifications of
existing living organisms can bootstrap off of billions of years
of testing of code for ability to survive in hostile environments.
They can also be targeted to attack the central nervous system,
and possibilities for subversion, "wounding" damage (more debilitating
to an enemy than fatalities), and other havoc loom.  I will have
to do a lot more thinking about this particular problem before I
will have formed a clear opinion about it... I don't know if I'll
succeed in ever forming a clear opinion of it.

What's scary about terror fantasies of molecular nanotechnology is
the replicative aspect. This is not actually likely to enter into
mechanosynthetic molecular nanotechnology in the early stages, and
thus is unlikely to surprise us much by the time it's actually
here. Nukes don't replicate themselves without assistance anymore
than early-stage mechanosynthetic systems are likely to. But
bioweapons... all the self-replication code is *already there*.
The rest is a matter of finding a bug that will go into the right
vector, and equipping it with the right payload. And the actual
nature of the research dovetails quite nicely out of current
medical research, which is more and more beginning to look like
the crafting of non-replicating chemical and other weapons
against the bugs that like to eat us (many of which, like
cancers, are *part* of us).  As Ani DiFranco says, every tool
is a weapon if you hold it right.  I wonder how many defense
ecologists are working at the Pentagon yet.

Oh, am I indulging in disasturbation?  So sorry.   !!!

World government is likely to exacerbate disagreements among the
extremely varied peoples of the world, since government is an
extremely poor method of resolving preexisting differences.  If
the world government were to limit itself exclusively to military
affairs and the prevention and suppression of outbreaks of open
warfare (local civil wars, and the like), leaving all other affairs
to substantially smaller regional governments with free intermigration,
then I might assent, but I don't see any path in that direction,
and anything much more intrusive or activist than that is likely
to provoke and escalate more disputes than it settles and resolves.

I think it would be a really good idea for us all to agree not to
have any more major wars until after we get offplanet, ha ha.
Nicholas, were these thoughts by any chance sparked by Eric Drexler's
Extro-3 after-dinner quotation from Leon Trotsky? "You may not be
very interested in war, but war is very interested in you!" or
something like that.

Or to put what I take to be your point slightly more (less?) bluntly: The
problem is the way we assign "dumbness" to creatures as a way of
justifying the otherwise problematic interventions we make in their lives. 
I am very interested in your turn to "manners" in the above formulation. 
As we contemplate the demise of the nation-state, and the disintegration
of many of the institutions that exert material pressures to induce people
to "behave," it becomes distressingly easy to imagine societies whose
"proper" policing seems *un*imaginable.  The principal theme of Judith
Martin's (a/k/a Miss Manners)  work is that the disintegration of manners
fuels a disastrous rise of litigiousness in our society.  A more
"extropian" spin on her thesis would worry, on the one hand, that the turn
to litigiousness, however disastrous on the face of it, may not even be an
available option in the near future, and, on the other hand, that if
anything like a "singularity"  occurs it's hard to imagine how manners
could provide any kind of intelligible alternative.  How do you make
Powers feel ashamed of themselves?  Your discussion above is a step in the
direction of thinking about these things, as is (in a slightly different
way) your pondering of the effects of discussions of mehuman-to-transhuman
sexuality for people of various sensibilities.  Anxieties about goo
(especially the grey, the blue, and uber) also tend to provoke questions
and discussions that tangle with this kind of trouble. The fraught and
frustrating discussions of gender, race, and sexuality of a couple weeks
back (and periodically before this) are another place where we think about
these things.  I am very interested in other folks' visions of transhuman
civility.

I'm vegan to this day and have been for, let's see, just about four years
now.  I get nervous about calling this a "pure" practice, but my reasons
for the practice *are* as much about ethics as about keeping trim.  Seems
to me that if I create -- intentionally or not -- beings with the kind of
awareness that registers as intelligible to me (I have been accused of
brutally ignoring the rich inner life of broccoli, for example), then I
had best treat them as ends-in-themselves rather than means-to-my-ends in
the good ol' Kantian manner.  I think it is a practice of ethical *self*-
brutalization to make a habit of doing things that one knows to cause
suffering.  Questions of ignorance of such consequences, and of necessary
suffering in the face of irreconcilable ends are another discussion or
two.  But in a nutshell, I for one think it would be potentially
impoverishing to the greatest of Powers to imagine *anyone* on this list,
e.g., was better used as nano feedstock than as a potential peer.  Now,
how to spread this meme before the onslaught of singularity makes it
*useful*?

Isn't it "reasonably easy" to produce machines that do fabulously useful
and complicated things with little more in the way of awareness than a
bacterium?  If not, it's more likely the problem is not whether we should
treat them as slaves but whether we can deal with them as superiors.

Nuclear proliferation may be amenable to government control in the
pre-nanotech era because nuclear technology generally needs a large
and difficult-to-conceal technical base. Nanotech-based mass
destruction (nuclear or otherwise) is a much more difficult
proposition. In what way will world government, or any government,
be able to prevent nanotech-based mass destruction? The only
way I can think of would be nanotech-based invasive survailence
of the entire populace on an unprecedented scale, and I'm not sure
that even that will help.

I haven't seen the movie, but I do know that directors like to cut & paste.
 I wonder if the original script line was:

"There are hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy, and hundreds of
billions of galaxies in the universe, and if only one in a million of those
stars had planets, and if only one in a million of those had life, and if
one in a million of those had intelligent life, there could be millions of
intelligent civilizations out there."

`Nah,' sez the director, `too wordy, let's just cut this bit about the--'

Deep and wise reflections about the Extro conference as it fades 
into the sunset along with the vapor trail of the plane that whisked 
this surly Easterner away from the land of palm trees and deserts....
but maybe also a little gossip.

I enjoyed the opportunity to indulge in broader bandwidth 
communications with persons who I have come to respect and like, and I 
know that I did not get to spend enough time with everyone, or even 
to actually meet every familiar name.  Will we ever outgrow the human 
need for physical proximity, to stand near, see a smile, share a 
meal, laugh together, dance just briefly?  Looking at us all gathered 
into one room, how frustratingly normal these bodies, how insufficient 
to express the fierce originality of thoughts generated within.  

For one who has never seen past Texas, the sudden immersion in 
California tech culture quickly overwhelmed.  Even before 
reaching the Doubletree, I was taken on a whirlwind tour of the Stanford 
and Apple campuses, courtesy of my fellow airline passengers.  After the 
conference, several more days in Palo Alto and Stanford with one friend 
who works in biomedical informatics, and another in orbital 
mechanics.  Both of whom were impressed with my heretofore unnoticed 
ability to discuss Drexler, Minsky, and Dyson spheres!  

Then, on to Berkely with my friend Jaime and, of all things, we ran into 
Robin Hanson, just moving into his new office building!  We explored 
his new home together.

And then, San Francisco, for the less mindful pursuits of shopping, 
wandering, nightlife, and climbing Bryant Hill.  A day's drive along 
the coast, where we spotted the elusive mountain cows of Bodega Bay.  
Shrieks from Jaime upon the discovery of monstrous alien seaweeds 
marooned on the sand.  Rocks that glowed pink on the cliff and grey in 
my hand.  Fog, powered by the sea wind, that swept across with the force 
of a rainshower.  Back to the Castro and Harrison Street for a long night 
of taking in the living carnivals behind every door.  The sudden 
realization that I'm leaving and Jaime's staying and the plane isn't 
going to wait, it being mechanical and not subject to the failings of 
human indecision.  

And back, at last, to the warm embrace of loved ones here, 
and the even warmer embrace of the weather, a heat index of 105 degrees 
upon my descent into Baltimore!

I think what's going on is practice at argument with others, not just
practice at thinking.  The more convinced you are, the more convincing
you can be.  Committment--cutting one's retreat--makes one
harder to intimidate with threats.  In fact seeming crazy helps, too.

I guess that arguing without commitment is a more complicated skill than
committing to harmless beliefs.  If it's less complicated, committing to
trivia would leave more of your brain for actual arguing--giving you better
practice--and would also be an easier skill to discover by unconscious
learning or evolution.

A slight variation: maybe being consciously in doubt puts you at a
disadvantage in an argument, so it's better not to consciously
doubt your "beliefs," at least not while you're arguing them.  Plus,
they have to be consistent from argument to argument.

Gregory Bateson says that dogs know the difference between play fighting
and real fighting.  But they have to get into a fight to know which they're
doing.  I don't think dogs have an *idea* of play, or pretend.  They have
something like a sense of fun, a sense that they're stretching their
abilities without getting hurt.  Argument could have evolved from
unthinking play-fighting.

Hmm...  I became an extropian before munching on the idea of the
singularity.  BUT.  I've always contrasted extropians with...50's
futurists.  You know, domed cities, flying cars, plastic clothing,
cities on mars, rockets going everywhere, videophones, robot-tended
farms (or hydroponics), fusion reactors...

I think what we have is a tendency to trace basic changes through
to radical ramifications.  What "50's futurists" do is more like
linear extrapolation.  Also, they seem(ed) to think as if things in the
future will just be more rational ways of doing things we do now.
As if change were something brought to us by the experts in Housing,
Transportation, Communication, etc., finding more efficient ways to
do their jobs.  "A big machine to make big decisions, programmed by
fellas of compasion and vision," as Donald Fagan sings.

We look at causes--basic technologies, market forces, evolution,
information transfers--instead of just extrapolating trends in
results and finished products.

So, I think our tendency to see future strangeness is a result of a
deeper difference in the way we look at change.  Bottom-up futurists
are tipped-applecart futurists.

There was a jump from not having an idea of progress to the idea of
progress.  Progress was gradual and good for us people.

Then there was futurism, the idea that change was happening soon enough
that we ought to think about it seriously.  Here the idea was to make
choices at the forks in this road we're progressing along.

The difference between Futurists and Extropians may be the
suspicion that formerly abstract or theoretical topics--evolution, the
structure of molecules, arrangement of matter as information,
number theory, quantum mechanics--will have a more forceful and
immediate effect on our own futures than human social structures,
needs and activities.

Of course the difference could result from a *willingness* to consider
strangeness, not shying from it.  I'm not sure but I don't think so.
Consider 50's science fiction readers.  Definitely neophiles,
strangophiles, but not extropians.

It's the tendency to extropolate.

I know why I don't believe emotions are the easy part.

To me, "emotions" are all the energy-allocation and value-calculating

In this light, "raw intelligence" would be all the brute-force algorithms
with no knowlege of efficiency, importance, other representations, context,
learning, etc.  Emotion is all the heuristics, meta-heuristics, and so on.

So, emotion is everything but the easiest part.  Everything except
carrying out what you've already learned how to do by rote.  Anytime
there are previously-unreconciled goals or aspects of a situation that
come up simultaneously, the process that recognizes that and finds ways
to balance or resolve it is emotion.  It does this by having *somewhat*
more general knowledge of kinds of conflict--but there are many
kinds of inner conflicts and many skills for dealing with them.  And
there are conflicts between the conflict-resolution strategies which
require resolution, and so on.

Was it Anders who said emotion's easy?  He seems to mean pre-wired
pleasure and pain.  If that's all it means, then one-celled creatures
have "emotions," and we'll only have to design something as complex
as an E. Coli to have "emotion."  Lewis Thomas proposed modestly that
we not start any nuclear wars until we understand one single-celled
animal completely.

Or, are we talking about emotions as complex as a worm has?  A lizard?
How many billions of years of evolution of "easy part" are we trying
to duplicate?

Well, I finished the Jacobs book.  Short synthesis: she feels multicity
nation-states as they exist today are doomed.  Empire size ones like the
US will have their cities strangled due to lack of accurate feedback,   
and trading nations will turn into oversized city-states.  "Transactions
of decline" such as perpetual high levels of military spending, and
continual transfer payments to undeveloped/stagnating/elderly parts of
the country, drain the productivity of healthy cities.  European
monetary union probably wasn't too visible in 1984; I'm sure she would
have been appalled by the prospect.

The main hope she sees is if nations could somehow become more flexible
about splitting up, "trading the power of survival for the power of
reproduction" since they won't be surviving anyway.  Obviously the US
won't be splitting into city-states anytime soon, with or without
surviving free trade/defense/environmental pacts.  But she raises the
concept of "pattern states", nations which adopt a new structure and are
then imitated.  E.g. Britain's parliamentary system, the US's structure,
the Soviet Union.

Possibly (this is me now) Canada or the UK could serve as patterns, and
should be watched or encouraged if possible.  Quebec splitting off and
developing, or Scotland or Wales doing the same, could be a profound
example.  Of course growing a healthy city takes a fair amount of time.

Jacobs seemed to make, without trying to, many good purely practical
arguments for libertarianism at a national level.  (In a world of
private currencies, if she's right each city would come to be dmiinated
by one local currency, which would serve the purpose.)  In earlier books
she outlined possible need for intelligent guidance at the city level.

Absent "matter compilers", and possibly even with them, it seems to me
that dense collections of people and specialized producers will continue
to be necessary, if not more important, not to mention more fun for most
humans.  City issues could be somewhat important for future
civilization. 

(Etymologically an extreme understatement.)

I worry that in this *particular* example it may mean instead to most
grownups present: I'm tired of trying to figure out how the world works
these days, give me back the Evil Empire to hate in a straightforward
manner, rather than this unimaginably complicated and shifting brew of
powers and meanings and values I'm drowning in.  Wait, maybe that *is*
just a version of "Get out of my life, disorder!"  Problem is, that
"disorder" is here to stay, a vague premonition, perhaps, of what's to
come...

For one thing, one distinguishes the "absolute power" that corrupts
absolutely from, say, the attractive "empowerment" of the decent and the
downtrodden.  It's not always so easy to flesh out the distinction though. 
And I agree that taking responsibility for oneself is necessary, and
finding one's way to some kind of autonomy is agreeable as well.  But I
find the idea of self-ownership can also be misleading in certain
interpretations.  No less a champion of strong wills and strong selves
than Nietzsche expressed ambivalences on this score that trouble me a lot. 
Can there be a sense of "taking responsibility" which would have us assume
a falsely exhaustive sense of authorship over the details of our lives and
characters, one that plays to interests other than our own?  The process
of self-creation is importantly a process of selectivity and style, and
it's crucial to *own* one's choices.  0ne way of *disowning* them is to
pretend there's no choice involved, to pretend that people who are
different than you are unworthy of emulation rather than simply on
different paths of self-creation.  For the most part, I imagine there's a
lot to be learned from *everyone* and that when I choose one over the
other -- something I do all the time, and with a certain joy -- I am
*losing* something as well as *gaining* something.  However, when
self-ownership is taken to mean instead that I imagine myself the sole
author of my destiny, I think this is a recipe for some disastrously
paralyzing guilt.  Let's leave that stuff to the Catholic Church and the
Ayn Rand Institute.

Trouble is, we often think of power as functioning repressively rather
than productively, as issuing from secure and central intentions rather
than emerging in a more complicated way -- hence it pays to remind
ourselves of these things.  Btw, would it reassure you to hear that
whenever I say "surely" my voice lilts up into a question-mark?

Both of your points are well-taken.  I was sketching two descriptive poles
that exert a rhetorical influence on our formulations even if neither
appeared often in their extreme forms.  Surely -- ahem -- they don't often
appear in their extreme forms in a forum so careful in its formulations as
this one, but in general I do think conceptions of power tend to be
governed by the figures of the invisible hand of spontaneous order, the
hidden hand of conspiracy, or the heavy hand of state. 

> But I wouldn't romanticize a vision of *de*centeredness.  

It's true I may stray into this from time to time.  Still, the opposite
temptation seems to me more common and more urgent in its trouble-making
potential.

A dissertation, not a post.  Suffice it to say that Foucault was convinced
that repressive and central/sovereign conceptions of the operations of
power were grossly inadequate to "the everyday power we all use to move
about in the world" and sought out better explanations.  Specifically, he
seemed to mean by power an emergent property of the sum of interactions
among people calculating to gain advantage from/with/over one another.
Institutions, intelligible values, social scripts arise out of these
interactions, and they facilitate these calculations and in turn are
fortified in their existence by the fact that they are made-recourse-to,
cited, reiterated in practice.  But no citation is perfect, and the string
of citations plots a path of transformations -- a subversive citation may
be strategically more useful than a more "faithful" one in some
circumstances.  Sometimes Foucault seemed to figure this emergent property
as a hopelessly complex dynamic system -- like the market is, or an
ecosystem; and sometimes he seemed to figure it more as a resevoir of
force, of capacity-to-effect-change-in-the-world, that people dip into,
stir up, make use of.  Best, Dale

But... The statement does not say "millions of intellegent civilizations 
in this galaxy", but rather "out there", which would include all 
galaxys.  So the statement is merely misleading, yes?

Nift-o-rama, re: Quipo.

Just thought of another use or three for these things.

PGP encrypted letters recorded in your unit for reception by some other
person attending the same meeting.  Encrypt by the recipient's public key,
and the letter is exchanged without you even knowing which individual it
is.

Such letters could include digital cash.  Also, the tag units could
negitiate a transaction, by pre-set rules, like: I'll buy 1000 widgets if
the price is under $4.29 each. 

Requires no change in the hardware.

Very anarchic and potent, this must be an old idea by now.

I'm against multitracking. How about two rooms, one for the
presentations, and one with lots of sofas for conversation. When I visit
the sofa room, I chat with others who are also not into the current
presentation. I really missed having places to sit and chat at the
doubletree.....

The sofa room could also have the coffee, beverage and snack service
present, solving the catering/refreshment problem.

Citizens Supporting Science Ratings of Congress' Technology Voting Record

	Has your Representative or Senator been a good girl or boy as far
as science appropriations go? Have they been stifling biomedical research
by voting against fetal tissue experimentation again? Have they been
trying to shut down the Mir Station (again)? Now, you can find out,
because the CSS Congressional Ratings have arrived (with generous help
from Voter Information Services Inc.).
	If you vote in the US, take a look at
http://www.umich.edu/~alexboko/css/bydist.html
(it loads much faster than the previous, home-grown ratings page)  Let me
know if you find any factual or grammatical errors. An annotated list of
the Congressional votes researched to obtain these ratings will be
available by the end of this week. 

	Now, I know that many of us here don't care much for the Federal
Government, and with good reason. However, ignoring it is not the best
option. It exists (for the time being), and its mistakes affect our
future. If we're smart we're going to use the Fed (along with every other
tool at our disposal) to insure that the technological utopias we keep
talking about actually happen within our lifetimes.

OK. With 10^80 particles, 4.4 x 10^81, or 10^86 - no matter, both are
finite numbers. BTW, thanks for doing the calculations.

Well, I wouldn't know about Omega Points - if they exist, it's a long,
long
way off from now. My focus is on the present limits to what can be
represented
in this universe, pretty much as it is now.

A Preal object is represented by the particles which comprise it. This
implies that repesenting this object at most requires about the same
number of bits. Note that I am content to use the value you cited for a
hydrogen atom, so n*10^6 bits will do.

Your example of a line vs a pine tree is just a bit misleading. The
definition of the line is very simple, a true line is not a Preal
object. Obviously a pine tree is more complex than a definition of a
line.

A Real object such as the Mandelbrot set's shape cannot be directly
represented. Its abstract definition is easily stated in a few hundred
bytes, and this definition is therefore Preal. In fact, the Mandelbrot
set is a rather simple object in terms of complexity theory since its
description is very much smaller than its resulting representation!

Ah, serious confusion here. Indeed, to our perception, the Mandelbrot
Set is infinitely complex, in its overwhelming amount of detail. In
terms of complexity theory, the Mandelbrot Set is a simple object. The
mathematical definition of complexity is basically the length of the
string describing the algorithm used to create the object. The Peano
Postulates describes the algorithm used to create the integers. The
algorithm used for the Mandelbrot Set is only slightly longer. Both
objects are not very complex in this sense. A grape is much more
complex, simply due to the length of the active DNA used to build a
grape.

Let me make a slight modification to my terminology:

	Areal - Abstractly Real, ie, Platonic reality
	Preal - Physically Real, representable in the physical universe
	Mreal - Mentally Real, representable in the mind

Mreal is a subset of Preal. Preal is a subset of Areal.

The set of integers, and the Mandelbrot Set are Areal objects. Said sets
cannot be represented in the Preal or Mreal. The definitions or
algorithms for these objects are Mreal, and therefore Preal. The
definitions are not complex, and the sets themselves are.

BTW, to all readers of this list, Hara Ra is a single word, ie, 
Hara(space)Ra. (I would use Hara_Ra but my email server won't accept
underscores)

Assuming that c is the limit speed for data transfer, galaxy brains have
an obvious problem - it takes some 100K years for a message to get to
all parts of a galaxy. The darn things are just too big and too diffuse!

One answer to all this is to make the galaxy more dense.... after all, a
galaxy is mostly space, and I expect computational nanotechnology to
have a density comparable to water.... So I began to think of
mega-ringworlds and beyond dyson spheres. 

The area of a black hole's event horizon is proportional to its mass.
The more massive a balck hole, the less dense it is, and the smaller the
gravitational field at the event horizon. Imagine building something
like a dyson sphere whose radius is just slightly larger than the event
horizon of a black hole of the same mass.... The kind of technology
capable of a galaxy brain should be able to move all the matter in the
galaxy essentially at will. 

We can eliminate stars as energy production devices, as ALL the matter
in a galaxy is to used for this endeavour. It is much more efficient to
drop a little matter into a black hole, getting 1/2 mc^2 back - rather
than the 0.1% yield for fusion....

Since the super dyson sphere is not tasked to collect stellar radiation,
there is a way to construct one without encountering severe stresses.
Start with an object in orbit. Make the orbit slightly elliptical. Now
imagine a "string of beads" in orbit, like an elliptical necklace. Now
imagine lots and lots of beads, say 1cm beads with 1mm spacing. The
inter bead spacing varies slightly as the beads orbit due to the
ellipticity. Since the ellipse is very nearly circular, this variation
would be in microns. Control of such a system could be via magnetics or
electrostatics between the beads.

Imagine a second beady ellipse, 180 degrees in orientation. To avoid
collisions, make the two orbital planes at a very slight angle to one
another. This pair of intertwined necklaces is now repeated until one
sees a sphere, which becomes two interlaced ellipsoids, very nearly
spherical. We now have a very nearly spherical structure with no
internal stresses. Just add mass until one uses up the galaxy....

The gravity experts will have to answer the next speculation - since the
gravity field within a spherical shell is flat, it may be possible to
have an event horizon for the entire structure slightly below the
orbits, and still maintain a black hole in the very center - provided
gratis by most galaxies anyway....

I don't know the numbers here, I guess that such an object will be a few
tens of light years across - but about 10^4 times faster signaling.....

Alcor provides a Bracelet or Pendant (you choose) and a wallet card. I
have augmented this with a money sized bright red folder saying "READ IN
EMERGENCY" with a fold out sheet inside detailing several scenarios from
death to mere arrest to be followed by whoever sees it.

About 80% of deaths are anticipated, and such patients do usually become
suspended. I don't have stats for the other situations. EMTs will follow
instructions provided 1) they are aware of them 2) said instructions do
not interfere with the EMT procedures and life saving mandates.

Cryonet, about a year ago. 

I've looked into this quite a lot. Basically the technology for this
will appear in about 2 years as part of the medical monitoring/telemetry
market which is currently the focus of a lot of R&D. The cryo folk are
such a minute market it is senseless to try commercial development
directly. I had lunch with a CEO of a wireless company at Extro-3, his
estimate of development costs was about $250K and 1-2 years. I agree.

Yes, it could be done as a labor of love, but the result would be kludgy
and requires the full dedication of someone indefinitely. Developing the
right sensor technology is a non-trivial problem!!!

Those seriously interested please email me and I will send you some
memos I wrote last year on this topic.

It happened already, two years ago. 6 days in summer heat made the brain

Yah. Let alone the silent "I'm being mugged" alert. Making it reliable,
ie few undetected situations and NO false alarms is a serious challenge.

I thought there was.  My working definition is that pleasure

[snip of some interesting galactic engineering]

It will take a while to accomplish all this. At the speed of light,
your acquisition probes will take about 50Kyears to reach the limits
of a 50K lightyear sphere surroundng the galaxy. Once there, they can
start sending all the matter back to the collection point. Assuming
transit speeds of .5c, you will expend two thirds of the mass to
accelerate the other third at the start and decelerrate it at the
end of the trip, so after an additional 100K years, you will have
accumulated "only" one third of the galaxy's mass. If you are
willing to wait, you can use longer transit times and end up with
more mass. Of course, you will be able to begin construction with
material accumulated much earlier in the program, as soon
as you reach the galactic center, about 25Kyears from now.

I discussed this with Erik Mller a year back. The conclusion (at
least from my point of view, I think Erik disagrees) was that even a
government with nanotech trying to keep the technology under control
would be at a severe disadvantage to disgruntled nanotechnologists,
industrial spies, nerds in basements reading Nanosystems and current
research journals etc; the measures needed to keep everybody in line
would simply turn into a balooning police state with no certainty
that it ever would work (see _The Bohr Maker_ by Nagata for a good
illustration of this scenario).

The main problem isn't nuclear weapons and other stuff that needs big
technological bases or controllable ingredients, like (say) 
antimatter (a lot of energy is needed, and likely a big accelerator),
but the mass destruction weapons that can be made in secret, using
hard-to-trace ingredients. I can easily get enough ammonium nitrate
to become very dangerous, but I doubt it would be as simple for me to
get the ingredients for nerve gas - the latter chemicals are watched,
while ammonium nitrate is commonly used. The same goes for nanotech
weapons, bioweapons and other stuff we fortunately haven't thought of
yet. It is likely it will be extremely hard to avoid proliferation of
them. 

The problem is that most systems of control can only decrease the
likeliehood that mass destruction weapons are used, and as world
population and technological abilities increase the risk of somebody
somewhere using them. If you hunt the weapons maker, they will become
more secret. Making people less inclined to use them is a better
idea; but unless 100% of humanity becomes very nice and sane (or
brainwashed) there will always be some kooks somewhere. The other way
to motivate people not to use weapons of mass destruction is of
course the threat of being annihilated. If a weapon can be traced
back, then this threat may work. Even MAD has a certain power
(*everybody* has nukes, and if you use one they will start to fly),
but in a sufficiently large population there will be people deranged
enough to ignore that too. So we are back at square one: we can make
mass destruction weapons less likely, but we cannot be sure there are
no nutcases who will not care about the consequences.

I think the best way to deal with this is to try to minimize the
risks, while making sure that if something awful happens you can deal
with it: in a nanotech world, I would invest in active shields
(several of them, and tweak them to be slightly different frome
everybdoy else's), in a world with plenty of biotech I would make
sure I had connections to people with good medical knowledge (CDC?)
and so on. Not ideal, but perhaps the best we can get.

Well, that depends on the scale. Their thinking could just as well
exist on different timescales, with quick subminds being isolated
from each other, seeing each other as individuals, and higher level
slower subminds gradually merging.

True, although it will take a long time (many millions of years, at
least), judging by Dyson's calculations.

Sounds reasonable, beautiful and tricky (but feasible!) to design.
Note that you will have to take GR into account for the orbits;
making them interlace is a very nontrivial problem. Basically the
gravitational field ar radius r will be the black hole + all beads at
lesser radii, which creates a potential on the form

P(r)= -g Mb / r        r<ri
P(r)= -g(Mb / r + (Ms / (ro - ri))(1 - ri/r)))    ri < r < ro
P(r)= -g(Mb + Ms) / r   r>ro

(if you calculate classically, which you can't do here :-), where Mb
is the black hole mass, Ms the shell mass, ro the outer radius and ri
the inner radius of the shell. I haven't taken different densities at
different radii into account. 

Hmm, this looks odd. There is a dip in the potential inside the
shell. This suggests that self-gravity might be a big problem if the
shell is massive (the classic dyson sphere is not massive compared to
the central star). This dip might make orbits much trickier to
design, although a fun possibility is having a shell of equal mass to
the black hole orbiting between radii r=1 and r=2, g=1; it creates a
flat potential there - no tidal forces! Of course, I could have made
a simple mistake (and never trust a classical calculation!).

I am new to the study of Quipo/Quipu so I can't answer your

When my copy arrives I may be in a better position.

 Yep, lots of cypherpunk potential here, encrypted IFF (identify

	I guess it depends on who you ask.  Destruction (especially

There is no color, smell, sound, warmth... or pain beyond our senses;
only the electromagnetic radiation, chemical content, acoustical
vibrations, kinetic energy of molecules... and bodily damage our
brains merely arbitrarily represent with such phenomenon.

Dear Extropians,

As far as I could think, the concept of extropy is more important 
than it seems:
Let's begin considering the dual oposition:

                         EXTROPY  x  ENTROPY

Entropy is said as one of the characteristics of the universe as a 
whole. But it is not locally always true ! Extropy seems to be 
another physical tendency and, apparently, is strongly related to 
existence of life. The chemicals when discovered the concept of 
entropy were not studying biochemical reactions... 
If one studies physics following a biophysical reverse path, will 
identify some reactions and phenomena which  are eminently 
extropic... Organism is organization and not disorder...
I should even risk to make an afirmation: LIFE JUST APPEARS WHEN THE 
LOCAL PARTIAL DERIVATE dX/dt  > 0  (X=Extropy, complementary of 
entropy (S), S+X = ?, cte or not ?)

Some of the many questions that should arise are:

1.Which are the fundamental extropic reactions and phenomena and 
which are responsible to life creation (or any extropic phenomena 
could lead to a certain kind of life form?)?

2. What conditions lead the same particles set to have extropic or 
extropic behaviour? 

3. What conditions would reverse the extropic/entropic state of a set 
of particles (including aglomerate objects)?

4. What were the extropic conditions that have generated life on 
Earth ?

I would invite the creators of the Extropy Group to join us in this 
discussion...

Hugs,

Gomes.

A lifeform is a complex self-organizing system, which keeps entropy
at bay by moving it out from its body through a continous energy flow
(in our case food and air into wastes, plants do it through
sunlight). But it isn't so simple that life appears when entropy
decreases, there are plenty of entropy decreasing but non-living
processes (like freezing a liquid). 

IMHO Extropy is a rather loose term, a bit like "complexity". We have
an intuitive feeling for it, but when studied closely it likely falls
apart into some more elementary (and perhaps different) concepts such
as complexity and -entropy. 

> Some of the many questions that should arise are:

I think these are very good questions, moving in the borderland
between thermodynamics and complexity theory. But I think we need a
better definition of what we are talking about before proceeding.

(this seems to be a tie in with the metasystem transitions of the
Principia Cybernetica Project).

I think this is almost an inevitable conclusion of considering what happens
if you apply technology to human bodies, behavior, and society.
Technology changes things it affect quite drastically, and it is already
changing all of the above.  So far the changes are mostly indirect, but with
bodies and behaviour, at least, they are now becoming direct, with things
like CR and anti-depressants, and with enhancement cyborgization and genetic
modifications now in sight.

I haven't met anyone such.  I know lots of people who don't think about it
hard but don't significantly disagree with what I bring up.  I'm as likely to
deny "strangeness" as anybody I've met or corresponded with, as I don't
anticipate a singularity, and I think the "far-out" stuff is generally a
century or more out.

Women's rights, gay rights - the idea of "rights" is wrong.  It's a way for
the 'white heterosexual males' to *allow* you to be yourself without having
to admit their wrongs.  This 'allowance' is worse than outright
discrimination.  It's the weapon of hypocrites, those who say one thing yet
do another, those who can be your friend yet remain your enemy, and those who
accept yet hate.  It's time we stopped granting rights and started taking
them away.  Such as the right to discriminate, something society and
government passed out many years ago.

I refuse to accept anyone, because there's nothing to accept.  I refuse to
let minorities be my friends, because they're already welcome.  And I refuse
to give others rights, because they were never wrong.

Yes, it simply does not have a rigorous, scientific definition as yet.

Such as including conciousness.

To discriminate is to distinguish, and the right to
discriminate arises in the ability to discriminate, which does
not originate with the government.

The right to discriminate is the right to choose your associates.
Free association is the ability to control (in the long term) your
own future development... it is part and parcel of the task of
self-creation.

It seems to me that you are preaching universal love. Now, the
older I get, the fonder I become of the old ideal of universal
love.  But we are born lions, one and all, and it's always
struck me as pointless and obtuse to quack about universal love
to fourteen-year-old boys who will *mostly* have no idea what the
heck you're talking about no matter how long you quack. I know
that I certainly wouldn't have. Perhaps in the era of uploads,
we'll be able to start hacking up our legacy code, and it will
be interesting to see what the old ideal of universal love
grows into in *that* environment. (Note: I'm not accusing you
of quacking, just pointing out that universal love is one of
those things that is much quacked about.)

But you can't enforce universal love through legislation, which
is what anti-discrimination legislation attempts to do. Forcing
people to do what you are telling them is good for them arouses
tremendous amounts of resentment, and rightly so. Morality and
legislation should be firewalled apart, IMHO.

Personally, what I feel toward those people who have for decades
shaped their own personal development by filtering out all information
that was not offered by people of their own race, class, and
gender... is pity.  And I'm really not very fond of feeling pitying.
(Read too much Nietzsche, heh heh.) Wisdom is funny stuff, and I
suspect that it, too, is still tinted and tinged with the colors
of race, class, and gender. Personally I have tremendously benefited
from paying attention to and trying to absorb some women's wisdom,
black people's wisdom, stuff that is invaluable to me and very
difficult to find when I go browsing among white men's wisdom. But
I was initially programmed as a white man, and so I think it's
perfectly okay for me to have a taste for white men's wisdom. But
I think I'm much stronger and much happier now for having sought
out the wisdom of the women and the black people that I have been
lucky enough to meet.

(Class is much harder for me to think about because I completely
bought into the standard American brainwashing about the unreality
of class until just a few years ago. As a result, I have only a
hazy idea of what class I belong to... which is probably the sort
of thing that motivated the people who initiated and propagated
the standard American ideology about class.)

The benefits of concentrating your galaxy's mass to the center, and the 
time involved in doing this, has a side effect: civilizations that 
started out near the core get the jump on us laggards out here in the 
boondocks!  (shorter time to reach mass of complete galaxy, if you start 
from center).  How annoying to start building your galactic empire only to 
learn you never had a chance.

This leads to an interesting variation on Keith Henson's Far Edge Party: 
Send out invitations to each star system in the form of basic seeds for
the formation of life.  Kick back and wait for a few billion years, in
your galactic core easy chair, and all sorts of interesting and odd
intellegent creatures show up of their own volition, after independantly
deciding that the core is the place to be.

They bring their stellar mass with them, of course, this is a BYOS party.

As I've noted many times, "extropy" is not intended as a technical term. It
is, as Anders says, a loose term. We use it as a label, a metaphor for the
life and intelligence-promoting things we value. The inverse of entropy
already has a term, "negentropy". This had been given both a thermodynamic
and an information-theoretic definition. I feel no need to attempt a
rigorous, scientific definition for "extropy" since it is not intended to
function in that way.

In regard to negentropy, I still am unsure how to relate the thermodynamic
definition to the information-theoretic definition. The former appears to
be objectively well-defined but, as far as I understand it, the latter is
not since the notion of "information" is not objectively defined. Perhaps
AIT fans can explain this (if they agree that information is not
objectively defined in the context of the definition of entropy). The
difficulty with objectively defining "information" arises from because a
signal only conveys information when apprehended by a mind, and the
information content of any signal seems to depend on the existing contents
of a mind.

"In the long-term" is a qualifier that makes the prediction irrefutable.
(If true -- QED; else ask again later.) Hence the prediction is
fundamentally unscientific in the Popperian sense.

It is well known that only a countable infinity of problems are
solvable. That is, for all but a vanishingly small fraction of problems,
no solution algorithms can exist. For example, problems whose boundary
conditions are inconsistent are unsolvable, and are legion. In other
words, any post-human society, existing in vastly more complex
environments than exist today, will be just as riddled with
inappropriate solutions to their problems -- trade-offs with unwanted
side-effects. Thus the above prediction is not only unscientific, it is
an utopian illusion. Some sort of parenting will always be necessary,
and the sooner we bend our minds to thinking about good ways to
(meta)parent, the sooner we can develop a workable post-human society.

1.I am thinking about extropy as a *physical* phenomena, a 
possible state of a determined subset of the universe,  still 
independent of the existence of life, that would appear "after". So 
it would be anterior, existencially speaking, to even the
"intelligence" effect... Nevertheless, are you speaking about 
intelligence just when normally considered, as a characteristic of 
already structured organisms,  or are you using a more abrangent 
definition of intelligence, like, f. ex., gravity, which exists under 
certain physical conditions, independently and even before the 
existence of life (as we usually conceive..)?   

2. For me, there is no counciousness without life ? (Unless we 
consider - and prove...- that counciousness is transtemporal...)

Well, I suppose gravity is necessary for life because without it there
would be no planets, stars etc. I think gravity is very interesting
because we know the least about in comparison to the other forces. More
speculatively, how do we know that we have identified *all* the known
forces that exist in the universe? Maybe extropy is being driven by
forces, or the interaction of forces, that we don't know anything about
yet. The recent discussion of 10+ dimensions adds strength to the argument
that we really don't yet have enough information about the true nature of
physical and non-physical reality to make conclusions about what is
driving extropy. I'm not even sure that we have enough information about
these other dimensions to make good hypotheses about complexity and
extropy.

 2. For me, there is no counciousness without life ? (Unless
we consider - and prove...- that counciousness is transtemporal...)

I think that consciousness is dependent on information storage, i.e.
*memory*. Without memory I don't think any localized concentration of
matter and energy, however complex, would be conscious. it also need a way
to differentaiate between itself and its environment.

Obviously we must talk about the minimum string or it is not unique, but as  
I've already mentioned, it's been proven that we can never know if a smaller 
string that does the same thing can be found, so if this is the definition of  
complexity it's not a very useful concept because we can never know waht it
is for anything.

Three questions.

1) Exactly what is this property you call "physical" and how can I test to 
   see if an object has it?

2) If Mreal is a subset of Preal and I have the idea of a fire breathing   
   dragon in my mind, does that mean that dragons are physically real?

3) If the integers or the Mandelbrot Set are not part of Mreal then how do   
   we know anything about them?
                     

        >The definitions or algorithms for these objects are Mreal, and

The definition is real but the set is not? Can you give an example of 
something the definition has but the set does not.

Deep and wise reflections about the Extro conference as it fades 
into the sunset along with the vapor trail of the plane that whisked 
this surly Easterner away from the land of palm trees and deserts....
but maybe also a little gossip.

I enjoyed the opportunity to indulge in broader bandwidth 
communications with persons who I have come to respect and like, and I 
know that I did not get to spend enough time with everyone, or even 
to actually meet every familiar name.  Will we ever outgrow the human 
need for physical proximity, to stand near, see a smile, share a 
meal, laugh together, dance just briefly?  Looking at us all gathered 
into one room, how frustratingly normal these bodies, how insufficient 
to express the fierce originality of thoughts generated within.  

For one who has never seen past Texas, the sudden immersion in 
California tech culture quickly overwhelmed.  Even before 
reaching the Doubletree, I was taken on a whirlwind tour of the Stanford 
and Apple campuses, courtesy of my fellow airline passengers.  After the 
conference, several more days in Palo Alto and Stanford with one friend 
who works in biomedical informatics, and another in orbital 
mechanics.  Both of whom were impressed with my heretofore unnoticed 
ability to discuss Drexler, Minsky, and Dyson spheres!  

Then, on to Berkely with my friend Jaime and, of all things, we ran into 
Robin Hanson, just moving into his new office building!  We explored 
his new home together.

And then, San Francisco, for the less mindful pursuits of shopping, 
wandering, nightlife, and climbing Bryant Hill.  A day's drive along 
the coast, where we spotted the elusive mountain cows of Bodega Bay.  
Shrieks from Jaime upon the discovery of monstrous alien seaweeds 
marooned on the sand.  Rocks that glowed pink on the cliff and grey in 
my hand.  Fog, powered by the sea wind, that swept across with the force 
of a rainshower.  Back to the Castro and Harrison Street for a long night 
of taking in the living carnivals behind every door.  The sudden 
realization that I'm leaving and Jaime's staying and the plane isn't 
going to wait, it being mechanical and not subject to the failings of 
human indecision.  

And back, at last, to the warm embrace of loved ones here, 
and the even warmer embrace of the weather, a heat index of 105 degrees 
upon my descent into Baltimore!

     I asked my partner about this whole teacher-lover-mother situation 
     with Mary Kay whoever.  He was actively pursued by a father figure man 
     when he was 13 and they had an affair.  It went on for the summer.  It 
     ended up being a big public court mess of course when the parents 
     found out.  The guy was in his late 20s and had used guilt and other 
     adult-honed forms of manipulation to make his boy-lover more mailable. 
     
     Regardless of the information-richness of our society, the exceptions 
     we may deem appropriate or inappropriate in the realm of love/sex, 
     this woman was the boy's teacher, she was entrusted in a relationship 
     of propriety.  The boy would only naturally follow his impulses (like 
     boys his age will whether it's an unrequited crush or having one's 
     first hump or blow job in some private stolen moment).  I regard the 
     teacher (as does my partner) as an emotional child.  She has 
     sacrificed a great deal because of a howling error in judgment.  While 
     there may be volumes of extenuating circumstances Mr. Hollick can 
     dredge up to garner sympathy for the woman, fact of the matter is 
     doing what she did in our culture is no more appropriate than when 
     Ethiopian immigrants try to continue the tradition of female 
     "circumcision" in this country and think it's not a crime.  We as a 
     culture have deemed it so.  
     
     Until such time where children are somehow imbued with experience, 
     wisdom and discernment, they are not appropriate sexual partners for 
     adults.  The chasm is too wide (although considering the lame-brained 
     folly of Mary Kay, maybe they were closer, emotional maturity-wise, 
     than one may think! <G>).

  In a more nearly Extropian (or free) society, learning will be a 
  voluntary interaction between teacher and student.

  The learner (of any age) may be issued with a book of vouchers, to 
  purchase the sought-for educational services from the teacher (of any 
  age).  We all understand the idea of honest exchanges for mutual 
  benefit, and the idea of the interaction of two (or more) intelligent 
  consciousnesses.


  All parties to such relationships have _rights_.  This should be our 
  focus in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and her 'younger man.'


  The 'younger man' is on record as saying that he actively sought a deep 
  relationship (he presented Mary Kay with a silver ring as a symbol of 
  his affection); and he is by all accounts an exceptional individual.


  He and Mary Kay _love_ each other.  And now they have a child, Audrey.

  They're both *magnificent* Americans.


  "Why do we love where the lightning strikes, and not where we choose?"

-- Coventry Patmore.


   Mary Kay's father (John G. Schmitz) opposed 'sex education' in schools 
   during his political career.  Would an Extropian (or other 
   free-society) curriculum exclude or prohibit 'sex education'?  I rather 
   think not.


  So the student, questing for educational services in the educational 
  'hypermarket', will seek out the best possible opportunities, and spend 
  his (or her) education vouchers accordingly.  Given the lack of 
  internal and external metrics for human experience and preferences, 
  most of us know better than to 'second-guess' the transactional choices 
  people make between themselves.


   Are you saying you would seek to _coercively prevent_ competent 
   youngsters from seeking out and obtaining 'sex education'?  If this 
   freely develops into emotional and intellectual relationships, would 
   you seek to _coercively punish_ people for it?  Is it any of your 
   business. in fact?  Do you believe 'we' can arbitrarily declare love to 
   be some sort of 'crime'?



   "Yes" or "No" will do.

Wow -- hadn't heard about the Othello match.

I tend to think that Go will take a while because it seems a few
orders of magnitude more combinatorially complex than chess.
Let's see... without quantum computers, 10 years; with quantum
computers, 5 years?  Only a stab in the dark, of course.  (You
can't ever be shown right unless you make a prediction...)

This is a most unconvincing argument. Supposing the child in question was
ten years old. Or seven. Or five. He becomes attracted to his teacher,
wants to spend time with her, takes her flowers, and as she becomes more
responsive and physcial he, not knowing exactly what the hell is going on,
sees his affection reciprocated and goes along with it. I happen to think
that five year-olds should be protected from a world which can take such
advantage of them.

Why? What's 'magnificent' about them? They sound like pretty ordinary
Americans to me, albeit one of them is, potentially, a criminal. (Or has
she already been convicted?)

I think not, also. Nor has anybody suggested it would.

The point in this case is 'choice', and whether or not children are capable
of making certain informed choices. And in this we base an awful lot of our
raising of children on our belief that they cannot make certain choices.
So, we don't leave paint-stripper on baby's little table; we apply a
blanket "don't talk to strangers rule" rather than trusting the child's
character judgement; etc. We make informed decisions about the
choice-making capabilities of our children, for their protection.

>   Are you saying you would seek to _coercively prevent_ competent 
>   youngsters from seeking out and obtaining 'sex education'?

Nobody has said anything like this, Tony. I haven't seen 'sex education'
mentioned once before this post. Unless you're arguing that this affair was
merely a sex education practical?

>   Is it any of your business. in fact?

I would say it is the business of the child's parents, in their continuing
role as protectors of that child until he reaches such an age as to be
well-informed and competent in matters of physicality. And in so protecting
him, they do not need to resort to their own vigilante means of prevention,
since they have the law to do that for them.

>   Do you believe 'we' can arbitrarily declare love to 
>   be some sort of 'crime'?

No. Sex with a minor, on the other hand, can be declared a crime, with a
non-arbitrary basis in at least several hundred years of Western cultural
development.

>   "Yes" or "No" will do.

No, they won't. You are phrasing your arguments in misleading ways, drawn
from false interpretations of previous statements. A "yes" or "no" to that
is a choice made against options you provide, rather than a sound exegesis
of the arguments to be presented.



The problem is, of course, that certain children are more capable of taking
decisions at an earlier age than other children. However, the
practicalities of the law mean that it must assign one single age to the
meeting of sexual majority. This does not seem unreasonable. If there is
any argument to be put, it must be that this age is too high (as I believe
it is, at 18, for homosexuals in the UK). Personally, given the current
social milieu of the West, I think 16 is about right (and given the state
of the law it would seem the majority agree with me), but I'd listen to the
arguments with interest, especially since a cross-cultural analysis would
show the age of sexual maturity to differ globally.

What I won't listen to is nonsense about people having suggested that sex
education be banned, or that love be legally controlled, etc. in an attempt
to win arguments which are almost, if not entirely, completely unrelated.

Well, extropy seems to be at work in alife simulations like Tierra,
which run on deterministic computers where we can define *all* forces
which affect the simulated world. So it doesn't seem very reasonable
to say there is some "extropic field" (mediated by extropy bosons?) 
that drives growth of complexity.

Actually, I don't think this will hold since it will take you a few
hundred millions of years to move your star to the centre (given the
energies and physics currently known), while you can get there in
just a few millennia by travelling relativistically. So the center
civilizations doesn't seem to have any advantage except their
location at a natural Schelling point.

Mark Scott had an interesting guest on his Detroit radio talk show
yesterday, Professor Arthur Robinson, editor of the pro-science,
pro-technology, pro-free enterprise newsletter, Access to Energy.
Robinson
replaced Czech escapee from communism Professor Petr Beckman when
Beckman
died of cancer some years ago.

Professor Robinson presented powerful evidence that the Establishment
funded Foudations and Think Tanks have had genocidal programs
operationally
in place for several decades via their support for environmentalist
policies and will achieve dramatically higher death rates world-wide as
soon as the CO-2 treaty is implemented.  The Senate is slated to approve

the treaty in December of this year.

Prof. Robinson reminded the audience that malaria was almost eliminated
when DDT was banned through international treaty several decades ago.
Now
10% of the world's population has the disease and 3-4 million people die

each year from the disease.  100's of millions are made miserable.
Robinson made careful studies of the raw data on which the decision was
made.  Contrary to the high paid talking heads of the EPA, there was no
evidence of ecological dangers from DDT.  The EPA chief Russell Train
supported the DDT ban in spite of the recommendations of his top
scientists!

Similarly, Prof. Robinson's review of the government's raw data
regarding
global warming and ozone depletion indicate that these too are
mythological
dangers concocted solely for the purpose decreasing world population
through subtle genocide.  Robinson mention that, at a recent Gorbachev
Foundation meeting of environmentalist heavy hitters, the audience
applauded uncontrollably when a speaker suggested reducing the planet's
population by 90%!

Prof. Robinson reminded the audience that everything humans need from
housing to food to education to transportaion to medicine etc etc has a
certain amount of energy associated with it.  Regulation CO-2 emmissions

will reduce the amount of energy available per person in the world.
Reducing the amount of energy available will kill people, especially in
under-developed countries already starved for energy.  However, the
cause
and effect relationship will not be readily apparent and the genocidal
Establishment will get away with it unless enough Amercans can be
educated
to these realities in time to stop Senate ratification of the CO-2
treaty.


Currently, the Senate debate centers on whether the US should sign the
treaty before India and China agree to sign it.....Prof. Robinson wants
to
shift the debate to genocide vs. freedom and prosperity.

Access to Energy




Access to Energy Newsletter - Plus

Following is an introduction to the Access to Energy Newsletter:

Within days of the Chernobyl accident we warned our 6,000 readers:

DON'T DRINK 63,000 GALLONS OF RAIN WATER!

My name is Art Robinson. I am Professor of Chemistry at the Oregon
Institute of Science and Medicine, and I publish a pro-science,
pro-technology, pro-free enterprise monthly newsletter, Access to
Energy,
which in September 1993 began its twenty first year. Access to Energy
was
founded by Professor Petr Beckmann in 1973 and published by him until
his
death in 1993.

As for those 63,000 gallons, our readers know why they are safe. We
don't
ask them to trust and parrot us, we ask them to think.

In this case, we told them how much radioactive iodine 131 is given to a

healthy patient in a thyroid check: up to 90 microcuries (a cancer
patient
is given much more). And we reported the maximum measured activity in
rainwater washing out Chernobyls iodine over the US: 0.00036
microcuries
per liter. There is about 4 liters to the gallon; hence 63,000 gallons
of
"contaminated" rain water "full of fallout" will give you as much
radioactive iodine as you get when you have your thyroid checked.

Does that tiny grain of knowledge make you feel good?

It should, because America's news media and largest periodicals don't
have
it. They work by the T&P (trust and parrot) method. They may differ in
whom
to trust and parrot; but they share a common inability to evaluate. They

will find two opposing viewpoints and manufacture a controversy; "for
they think objectivity lies halfway between the truth and a lie" (or
worse,
between two lies).

In the Three Mile Island episode, Access to Energy pointed out at the
time
that the accident would cost more than one life per week: not from any
radiation, but in the fuel cycle of the substitute power, mostly
coal-fired, that had to be brought in to replace the safer and healthier

way of generating electric power - nuclear power.

In the Chernobyl accident, too, we pointed out that in its short life of
25
months, Chernobyl Unit 4 saved more lives from coal-fired pollution than
it
took, or will ever take, by radiation. And we gave the reasons why the
Soviets will not even bother to dilute contaminated wheat with grain
from
elsewhere. "A little cesium and strontium will give the Russians a more
varied diet; for like Markey, Solarz, Schroeder and the other
antinuclear
breast beaters in Congress, the Soviets care only about visible deaths."

But Access to Energy is not just about nuclear energy (which is merely a

very blatant target of superstition mongering). It is about the truth
and
how to arrive at it in scientific fields.

Access to Energy readers know now, as others will find out in years to
come, why the Ozone Depletion panic is little more than a hoax: they
know
why the layers in the high atmosphere are self-healing, why chlorine
reaching the stratosphere is unlikely to come from manmade sources, why
such chemically induced changes are laughably small compared with the
ozone
layer's natural variations with latitude and season, and why the "ozone
hole" (a partial reduction of ozone concentration for 6 weeks in the
antarctic fall) is more pronounced in the Antarctic, far from most CFC
consumers, than in the Arctic, which is much closer to the bulk of the
world's industry. The world's industry produces some 750,000 tons of
chlorine in CFCs per year. The volcano Mt. Erebus (have you ever heard
of
it? and why not?) in the Antarctic (Ross island, Ross Sea) puts out
1,000
tons of chlorine every day.

Access to Energy readers also know more about Global Warming than those
who
gobble up the media bunk. Yes, the carbon dioxide content of the
atmosphere
is increasing. But readers know that the link between CO2 and global
temperature is flatly contradicted by the historic record. They know why

the world data claiming a temperature increase over the past 150 years
are
inaccurate, why renowned climatologists (whom you never see on the TV
screen) believe the average temperature has not changed, and that it has

decreased over the last decade.

Our readers know about rival theories to the greenhouse. And they know
that
if the greenhouse theory were correct in spite of its poor experimental
record, higher temperatures would lead to more evaporation, more clouds,

and less solar energy influx, and hence to a cooling of the atmosphere
before equilibrium is re-established. To those who fret that we have no
right to wait until we know all the data, and that we should start with
countermeasures to the imminent threat now, Access to Energy readers
coolly
reply, "the threat of warming or of cooling?"

In all other cases of irrational panic, Access to Energy gives reasons,
not
parroted hunches, for its conclusions; and it tells you where you can
check
them independently. If you think these reasons are unimportant compared
with the political need of distributing research grants and humoring the

sham environmentalists, support the efforts of the EPA and the State
Department to ban "ozone-destroying" chemicals. If you think
corporations
can be taxed without passing the tax to the consumer, join Ralph Nader
in
soaking the rich.

If you are looking for somebody to trust and parrot, get your opinions
ready-made from the network newscasters and newspaper analysts, who are
mostly trusting and parroting each other.

But if you want to form an opinion by rational conclusion from measured
data, subscribe to Access to Energy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Access to Energy is a pro-science, pro-technology, pro-free enterprise
monthly newsletter packed with information and comment on science,
technology and energy - and on those who would restrict your access to
it.
It gives you answers based on facts with which to dispel myths. Access
to
Energy is now in its 21st year. Well before the Arab oil embargo in
1973,
Access to Energy pointed out the folly of having US energy sources
controlled by medieval sheikdoms.

In 1980, amidst Carter's confusion about the "energy crisis," it
reported
on the coming oil glut.

Access to Energy was the only voice in the country pointing to the dead
of
Three Mile Island: for six years, one person a week was dying from the
effects of the substitute power that had to be brought in to replace the

far safer power from nuclear reactors. Access to Energy explains the
true
nature of nuclear wastes: minute in quantity, temporary in toxicity (in
500
years they are less toxic than the coal ash from the same delivered
electric energy), the first type of waste completely removable from the
biosphere, they are a revolution in public health. Fossil-fired wastes
amount to an annual one billion tons, and some of these wastes are
disposed
of in people's lungs.

The radioactive dangers of energy conservation via high levels radon gas

(see below for the benefits of low levels) have only in the last few
years
been given publicity by the media and the government. Access to Energy
has
been writing about them since 1980. Access to Energy explains why
radiation
cannot make food radioactive. It is safer than other types of food
preservation.

Access to Energy defends science against superstition outside energy,
too.
It explains why today's genetic engineering takes far smaller risks than

when, millennia ago, grass was engineered into wheat. Ozone layer?
Greenhouse? EMFs from power lines and video terminals? In short, get
Access
to Energy, the UNbrainwash.

Access to Energy is fiercely independent: it takes no advertising, no
subsidies, no dips into taxpayers money. It doesn't theorize about the
free market: it practices it.

Access to Energy costs only $35 for 12 monthly issues. Why so little,
when
the others cost $95 and even more? Because Access to Energy's renewal
rate,
consistently month after month, is 80% or more. (Yes, eighty!) It gets
most
of its publicity free and unsolicited: it is mentioned and recommended
by
national journals (Commentary, National Review, Conservative Digest,
Reason, American Spectator, Policy Review, and others), by famous
scientists and well known congressmen - but above all, by its readers.

Access to Energy PLUS

During the past ten months Access to Energy has published detailed
articles
giving the evidence that:

- Carbon dioxide is not only not warming up the earth's atmosphere, it
is
causing explosive increases in the numbers of plants and animals. Carbon

dioxide release is the most beneficial effect that man has ever had upon

the plant and animal environment. Did you know, for example, that the
mass
of trees in the United States has already increased more than 25% and,
during the next century, is going to double as a result of carbon
dioxide
release?

- The recent ozone scare over Toronto was caused by unprofessional
interpretation of the effects of a volcanic eruption and had nothing
whatever to do with CFC emissions. We call this sort of misinformation
"cargo cult science." Armed with the facts in our January 1994 issue,
you
will understand unscrupulous politicians who are forcing the American
people to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in an entirely
unnecessary
ban of CFCs like freon.

- Radon and other sources of low level radiation actually decrease your
risk of cancer. This reduction can be as great as the increase from
cigarette smoking. Current Environmental Protection Agency attempts to
lower radon levels in homes may, if successful, actually cause as many
as
75,000 American lung cancer deaths.

- Revolutionary safer and more productive methods of power generation by

nuclear fission can be developed. The October and December 1993 issues
of
Access to Energy contain articles by Edward Teller and by Sam Cohen
describing two of these methods.

- The Clinton medical plan is nothing less than, as we call it, "The
Euthanasia Act of 1994." The November 1993 Access to Energy tells why
the
Wall Street Journal recently said of this plan, "Our advice is, keep a
good
grip on your wallet, and if anything like the Clinton plan ever passes,
don't get sick."
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each issue of Access to Energy contains new information with complete
references to scientific literature. We seldom repeat ourselves. If you
want the full story on these recent and timely articles in Access to
Energy, we will send you:



All ten of these information-packed recent issues of Access to Energy

"Global
Lies." AND a 90 minute audio tape in which the experts, whose
scientific
publications have recently been quoted in Access to Energy, discuss the
dangers of compliance with recent EPA edicts about radon and evaluate
the
evidence that low level radiation (yes, even the kind the EPA wants put
in
radioactive waste dumps) may actually be beneficial to your health.

I don't see any reason for consciousness to be dependent on life. Of
course, at present the only known/accepted conscious entities are all
living beings, but I have no problem with (say) a conscious AI that
isn't alive even given my personal, rather broad, definition of life.

Why is this locally optimal? Yes, it is optimal to us, but from an
entropy standpoint entropy could be decreased a lot if we just froze
the entire world into a chunk of ice. 

Complexity can thrive when the local entropy isn't too low or too
high ("the edge of chaos"). The entropy flow out of the system sets
an upper limit to the complexity of the structures which can exist in
it.

Sound reasoning overall, Sarah, tho' I found myself thinking this whole
discussion provides a good example why a proliferation of coexisting PPLs
is more attractive than the present system.  It should be able to
accommodate these ambiguities without bringing the whole civil house of
cards down.  Not to say the two individuals we're discussing here would be
championed by any PPL I'd personally endorse, but, really, I don't know
enough in this particular case to pass judgment (NB: this is NOT an
invitation for more of these lengthy posts about the case).  It's a deadly
thing regulating anything so conspicuously *variable* as sexuality by way
of majority opinion.  Best, Dale

My innocent, tragic, love affair at 13


Tony Allen-Mills recollects an adolescent affair with his music mistress
 -- a young woman whose career he inadvertently ruined.
#

I was visiting a school friend on a Sussex farm when the telephone call
that ended my childhood arrived on a cool spring morning 30 years ago. I
can still feel today the sense of impending dread that a seemingly
innocuous message aroused. My father was coming to collect me. There was
something about a visiting aunt.

I knew at once that disaster was imminent. No aunt had been mentioned
when I had left our home in Hastings only a couple of hours earlier. The
thunderous look on my father's face as he stepped from his car, and as
he struggled to maintain his composure in front of my friend's mother,
left no doubt that my secret was out.

As we drove away from the farm he seethed for a while in silence. Then
he turned to me, his greying moustache quivering with rage.

"You know what this is about, don't you?" he snapped.

"Um," I replied.

"What have you been doing with that woman? How long has this been going
on? Do you realise this has destroyed your mother?"

I could do nothing but sob. I was 13 years old. For much of the previous
four months I had been recklessly, deliriously besotted with the music
mistress at my preparatory boarding school. She was 23, and I adored
her. We had slept together at least 20 times.

Oh, the thrill of those late-night excursions along silent school
corridors from my dormitory to her room. And the terror of that dreadful
morning when we woke up to find the rest of the school already at
breakfast. I had to sneak to the nearby matron's office, heart pounding,
feigning illness, to explain my absence from the prefects' table.

At home during the Easter holidays, I had kept her photograph hidden
beneath the lining of one of my bedroom drawers, along with a poem and
several letters she had written to me at school. These my father had now
discovered.

The memories came flooding back last week when I read of Tracey Whalin,
who ran away to Florida with a 14-year-old. In America she was charged
with "lewd and indecent assault on a child". And I suppose there is
something lewd and indecent about an adult woman seducing a boy so
young. It is probably worse when the adult is a teacher and the boy is
one of her pupils.

Yet that is not how I remember Sylvia A, the lonely, immature music
teacher stuck on an isolated school estate in the middle of the Sussex
countryside with 100 small boys and several elderly bachelor teachers
for company. Not for a moment in the past 30 years have I ever
considered her lewd or indecent -- and I am now myself a parent acutely
concerned about the upbringing of my two daughters.

My anger is instead reserved for those teachers -- and, yes, my father,
too -- whose anxiety to cover up a potentially embarrassing incident
left me hurt and bewildered for much of the rest of my youth. Whatever else
happens to Whalin's young friend, I hope he isn't treated as an evil
little brat.

There's something else I should mention. Sylvia didn't seduce me. I set
out to seduce Sylvia.

Our story began at Vinehall school, converted from a sprawling
19th-century mansion amid lovely grounds near Robertsbridge. My father
was an army officer, and to secure me a stable education while he was
posted around the world, he enrolled me as a  boarder, aged nine.

I had the happiest of schooldays, spoilt only by a tyrannical Latin
teacher who enjoyed wielding a gym shoe on bare bottoms. I was a keen
football player, and it was my prowess as a centre forward  that may
first have caught Sylvia's eye.

She had come to the school a couple of terms earlier and had immediately
cut a dash with her trendy clothes and cheerful manner. I still remember
the stir she caused when she came down to breakfast one morning wearing
the first red miniskirt ever to be seen on school grounds. The Latin
master nearly choked on his porridge.

At my mother's insistence I had signed up for piano lessons, and though
I was tone deaf, no student was ever more attentive sitting next to Miss
A on the piano stool, nor more sad to leave her at the end of the
lesson. I flirted with her shamelessly. I considered the lesson a
triumph if I managed to brush my thigh against hers.

One Saturday afternoon Sylvia was on the touchline when I scored five
goals against an opposing team. I was big and quick for my age and
utterly selfish with the ball. At my next piano lesson, Miss A touched
my cheek. "Well played," she said. "You were good."

>From that moment I was in love. By the end of the Christmas term I was
demanding a kiss for every goal I scored. In one of the season's last
games, we won 7-2. I scored all seven goals. The headmaster thought I
should turn professional. Little did he know I just wanted seven kisses.

Three days before the end of term, I asked if I could come to her room.
Sylvia blushed and looked away. Victory, I thought. She didn't say no.
That night I crept from the dormitory where, as a senior prefect, I
supervised a dozen younger boys. They were all asleep. I knocked on
Sylvia's door. I barely heard her whisper: "Come in."

Oddly, I remember nothing of the sex. There was none the first night -- 
merely industrious hugging. There were two more nights before the end of
term. On both, we broke a number of laws. I stayed in her room a couple
of hours, then sneaked back to my dormitory -- exhausted, elated,
inspired.

It therefore came as a considerable shock, on the first day of the
Easter term, to find Sylvia repelling my advances. Evidently she had
been greatly sobered over the Christmas break. She must have been
bitterly regretting her weakness the previous term. As for me, I
couldn't understand her. I had spent the entire Christmas holiday
longing to get back to school; longing to get back to her bed. Now she
wouldn't even look at me.

Slowly I broke her down. Boarding school terms are long, and there was
little at Vinehall to distract a pretty and sociable young music
mistress. There was no town within walking distance. She couldn't afford
her own car. She had a boyfriend in London, but she had to work at the
school most weekends and she only saw him about once a month. Eventually
Sylvia relented. I got my next kiss without even having to score a goal
-- which was just as well, as Easter was the rugby term and rugby was
never my forte.

The point here, I suppose, is that Sylvia was scarcely a lewd and
indecent woman seeking out sordid sexual gratification. She must have
been desperately confused. She knew that what she was doing was wrong,
yet misery and isolation must have propelled her to bow to the insistent
flattery of a dangerously knowing schoolboy. I have no idea what
happened in the Whalin case, but it would be far from safe to assume
that teenage boys are sexually  innocent.

It was just after the resumption of our affair -- with further nocturnal
excursions along that creaking corridor -- that my father returned from
an 18-month posting to Borneo. He came to watch me play rugby. I didn't
know it at the time, but he was shocked by my haggard appearance. I must
have been pale from lack of sleep.

He hadn't seen me during his long absence, so perhaps he was more
attuned than my mother to changes in my behaviour. No sooner had I left
the house at the beginning of the Easter holiday than he was rummaging
through my room for evidence. Like a fool, I had left plenty to find.

I have no way of knowing exactly what happened next, but it is now clear
to me that an agreement was reached to keep the matter out of the
newspapers. Sylvia was dismissed on the spot and I have never seen or
heard of her since. As for my future, everything depended on one man.
John Kendall-Carpenter, a former England rugby union international, was
headmaster of my father's alma mater, Cranbrook school in Kent. I had
been due to move to Cranbrook at the start of the next school year.
Would Kendall-Carpenter agree to accept me a term early under such
sordid circumstances?

Eventually a deal was struck. I would be removed from Vinehall. Nobody
would ever say I had been expelled. I would simply turn up at Cranbrook
a term early. Teachers would be advised it was for  family reasons -- my
father was moving from Borneo to Malaysia. My father took me aside,
clasped me by the shoulders, and told me, not without sympathy: "You
have been given a chance. You must never speak of this to anyone."

And that should have been that. Except for the fact that, in all this
convenient deal-making, nobody ever sought to ask me if I had any
questions, if I was worried about anything, or if I was happy with the
way things worked out. (Of course I wasn't: I agonised about Sylvia for
years and even tried pathetically to trace her. I remember spending one
evening telephoning all the entries in the London directory with her
fairly common last name. I would listen for a few seconds to see if I
recognised her voice; then I would hang up without speaking. I have
never found her.)

As long as my father was alive, we never discussed the matter again. Nor
did I wish to wound my mother further by keeping the subject alive. And
the last person concerned about my feelings was Kendall-Carpenter, who
viewed me from the start with deadly distaste.

Kendall-Carpenter -- hailed later as a great educator -- made it clear to
me that I had been admitted to Cranbrook on sufferance; that I had done
something so hideously wrong that I was lucky not to be flogged within
an inch of my life; and that no trouble from me would be tolerated.

So I had to sort things out for myself, and for years after my affair
with Sylvia, I must have been fairly intolerable. Somehow I knew enough
not to boast about my conquest to my Cranbrook schoolmates -- I realised
they would regard me either as a liar or a  freak. Yet it took me a long
time to realise that I was not irresistible to women, and that a
glorious adolescent romance with a sad and lonely music mistress was no
guarantee of future sexual success. Now I come to think of it, I was a
thoroughly repulsive 15-year-old.

So I do not think that the authorities should be too harsh in these
cases. The chances are that other teenager lovers will grow up, as I
did, with indelible memories of what seemed, at least to me, a love
affair of effortless purity. My main regret, of course, is that I helped
ruin Sylvia's life. And to that charge, I can surely plead that I was
too young to know any better.

You assume one must sample the search space exhaustively. This is not 
true for chess. Brute force is a way to do it, but Deep Blue is not all 
muscle. I am convinced that one can blow away virtually everybody with 
say 1 realtime MNeuron equivalent. Strategy does wonder on not very 
rugged fitness landscapes.

Actually, in the U.S. this situation is changing (I guess it all
depends
on the perceived threat model of the local authorities.)  Tim McVeigh
used
an ammonium nitrate bomb and so large purchases of it are being
passively
monitored, although it is still easy enough to steal and just about
every
farm in the country has enough to make a reasonably sized boom.  As
far as
nerve gas goes, this is also fairly easy to make (although this fact
is less
widely known since there are few "how to make Sarin" texts floating
around
the Internet :)  Sarin was actually discovered almost accidentally
just
prior to WWII and it is only a few steps removed from insecticides,
anyone
with a decent background in organic chemistry can make it.
Biological
agents are more difficult to come by and that is mostly because after
it
was discovered that the Japanese cult which gassed a subway station
had
been trying to get Anthrax specimens the controls on who gets viral
samples
were tightened up.  On the other hand most bio labs are poorly
secured and
a simple break-in or even armed robbery will probably get you what
you need.

Nuclear weapons are the only mass-destruction weapons which require a
large
infrastructure to create.  The number of countries which have
admitted to
having chemical weapons now that a ban is in place has proven to be
quite
surprising, and after looking at the list of those countries which
were
suspected of having such weapons it becomes quite apparent just how
easy
they are to make...

Actually, if everyone ignored the government it would solve the problem.

How about a wireless wearable distributed mail system.  I store a letter with
an e-mail address in my active tag/badge/whatever, it's sent randomly to
people I meet throughout the day, and then from them to people they meet and
so on until it reaches its destination.  Sure, it's slow but it must have
some application.

It can also provide defensive capabilities to meet the destructive
capabilities.  It's this balance that has kept us alive until now (internal
nanowar is happening all the time) and it's this balance that will keep some
of us (if not all) alive for a considerably longer time.

If you make something illegal the only people who will have access to it are
those who want to commit mass-destruction.  We need to leave it open to the
masses so they can defend themselves from any maniac who wants to kill them.
 If one in a million is such a maniac, then we can have a million people
making sure their defence is more than capable of shielding them from that or
any other maniac.

Educating people about these things, rather than hiding them away so only the
most determined nut can find them is our best chance of survival.

The alternative to "each one's right to his or her nuke" is giving a few
people defensive/offensive abilities and taking them away from the rest.  If
you don't have a problem with that, then I wish you the best of luck when
your world governments leaders hide behind their active shields and you wish
you had been allowed the knowledge to make your own!

The Foresight Exchange on-line betting game (based on Robin Hanson's Idea
Futures) has a betting claim on whether a computer will become the Go
champion before the year 2020.  Current odds are running at about a 60%
chance of it happening by then.  So the consensus of the players would
seem to be that this is not likely to happen soon (since surely the
computers of 2020 will be much more powerful than those of today, plus
progress in AI should give the computers a software edge by then as well).

The subject line is the title of a 1992 (?) book by Merlin Donald,
Department of Psychology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario,
Canada, _ Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of
Culture and Cognition_.  I found Donalds fascinating precis at
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.donald.html

If this is old stuff, forgive me.  Otherwise, heres a summary, which
seems relevant to theories of "the augmented animal", memory models
and AI.  All of the following is snipped from the essay at the above
URL.

Mark Crosby

Abstract: [SNIP] My central hypothesis is that there were three major
cognitive transformations by which the modern human mind emerged over
several million years, starting with a complex of skills presumably
resembling those of the chimpanzee. These transformations left, on the
one hand, three new, uniquely human systems of memory representation,
and on the other, three interwoven layers of human culture, each
supported by its corresponding set of representations. [SNIP] 

The first transition introduced two fundamentally new cognitive
features: a supramodal, motor-modelling capacity called mimesis, which
created representations that had the critical property of voluntary
retrievability. The second transition added two more features: a
capacity for lexical invention, and a high-speed phonological
apparatus, the latter being a specialized mimetic subsystem. The third
transition introduced external memory storage and retrieval, and a new
working memory architecture. [SNIP]

Apes have episodic memory, that is the ability to store their
perceptions of specific episodes. However, they have very poor
episodic recall, because they cannot self-trigger their memories: that
is, they have great difficulty in gaining voluntarily access to the
contents of their own episodic memories independently of environmental
cues. Thus they are largely environmentally- driven, or conditioned,
in their behavior, and show very little independent thought that is
not directly related to specific episodes. I have called their style
of thought and culture "episodic."  [SNIP] They can learn signs made
available by human trainers, but they do not invent them on their own;
nor do they seem to consciously "model" their patterns of movement, in
the sense of reflecting on them, experimenting with them, and pushing
them to the limits, the way humans do. This seems to indicate that
they are far less developed than humans in at least two areas of motor
control: the construction of conscious action-models, and the
independent voluntary retrieval of such models.  [SNIP] Thus apes are
not good at improving their skills through systematic rehearsal. The
contrast with human children in this regard is striking. [SNIP]

First transition: mimetic skill and autocueing 

The rationale for the first transition is based on several premises:
(a) the first truly human cognitive breakthrough was a revolution in
motor skill--mimetic skill--which enabled hominids to use the whole
body as a representational device; (b) this mimetic adaptation had two
critical features: it was a multimodal modelling system, and it had a
self-triggered rehearsal loop (that is, it could voluntarily access
and retrieve its own outputs); (c) the sociocultural implications of
mimetic skill are considerable, and could explain the documented
achievements of Homo erectus; (d) in modern humans, mimetic skill in
its broadest definition is dissociable from language-based skills, and
retains its own realm of cultural usefulness; and (e) the mimetic
motor adaptation set the stage for the later evolution of language.
[SNIP]

Early language theories of evolution are seeking a "quick fix"
solution, a rapid leap to some form of language without attending to
the more fundamental motoric changes that must have preceded it. (In
the process, of course, these theories also sustain the AI agenda that
attributes all higher cognition to some sort of symbolizing process:
see Dennett, 1992). [SNIP]

Second transition: lexical invention

The rationale for the second transition is briefly as follows: (a)
since no linguistic environment yet existed, a move towards language
would have depended primarily on developing a capacity for lexical
invention; (b) phonological evolution was accelerated by the emergence
of this general capacity for lexical invention, and included a whole
complex of special neuronal and anatomical modifications for speech;
(c) the language system evolved as an extension of lexical skill, and
gradually extended to the labelling of relationships between words,
and also to the imposition of more and more complex metalinguistic
skills that govern the uses of words; and (d) the natural collective
product of language was narrative thought, (essentially, storytelling)
which evolved for specific social purposes, and serves essentially
similar purposes in modern society. [SNIP]

Third transition: the externalization of memory 

The case for a third cognitive transition is based on arguments,
partly structural, and partly chronological, that are similar in
principle to those used for the first two; but the physical factors
that supported the third transition are a little different, inasmuch
as the latter was driven primarily by technological, rather than
biological developments. The chronological evidence is based on the
rapid emergence of whole new classes of memory representations --
external memory records -- as well as a major change in the types of
symbolic artifacts produced by humans. The structural argument is
based partly on neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence
bearing on localization and plasticity, and partly on an analysis of
cognitive architecture in the context of our new relationship with
external memory. [SNIP]

The structural case can be stated as follows: (a) external memory has
introduced radical new properties into the collective storage and
retrieval systems of humans; (b) the use of these external storage
systems is difficult, and requires a major re-deployment of cerebral
resources towards establishing literacy- related "modules" in the
brain; (c) the physiological basis for this reorganization probably
lies in neuronal epigenesis and plasticity; and (d) the role of
biological working memory has been changed by the heavy use of
external memory. [SNIP]

The external display projects directly to the visual regions, which
now become the locus of a new kind of internal working memory, one
which utilizes the power of the perceptual systems. In effect, because
the perceptual systems are displaying representations (as opposed to
nonsymbolic objects), the user's brain can move through "information
space" just as it has always moved through the natural environment,
with the difference that processing occurs on two levels, instead of
only one. The items displayed in the external memory field are treated
first as natural objects and events, and second as memory
representations that can externally program the user's brain, that is,
create specific states of knowledge that were intended by the creator
of the particular external device on display. 

[SNIP  to final paragraph]
The modern brain must accommodate not only these new working memory
arrangements, and all the coding demands imposed by symbolic literacy,
but also a number of metalinguistic skills that simply did not exist a
few thousands of years ago. The latter are socially-entrenched; for
instance an enterprise like modern science is very much a collective
endeavor, in which the individual mind is essentially a node in a
larger networked structure supported by external memory. Humans have
been part of a collective knowledge enterprise ever since mimetic
skill permitted us to break with the limitations of episodic
cognition, but external memory has amplified the number and variety of
representations available in human culture, and increased the degree
to which our minds share representations and rely on external devices
for the process of thought itself. Cognitive studies of the modern
workplace testify to the way that electronically distributed knowledge
representation, and computer-coordinated planning and problem-solving,
are affecting the relative roles of individual minds and external
memory devices in this collective enterprise.

Err, I think protecting children from their physical environment is
probably the smaller part of parenting, at least by the time they're age
7 or so.  The main function of raising kids is teaching them, and while
part of that is physically practical stuff, a very large part of
parenting is (or should be) civilizing the brats.  Children do not raise
themselves well.  _Lord of the Flies_ and gangs and all that.  Our
progress in manipulating the physical environment has been coupled with
progress in learning how to get along with each other in pleasant ways,
and a pack of kids isn't going to recapitulate thousands of years of
development in either field without substantial guidance.

but, considering the structures: organisms, it is possible that one

complexity of the set of possible genetic mutations of a certain 
organism (genetically based, of course...) upper limited or even

Without thinking very deep, apparently such memory (if 
really necessary to the existence of consciousness, don't know...) 
could be simply a "RAM", to use just when locally processing... 
Do not see the need of a permanent memory...except for 
the firmware (like the "bios")... A conscious object can perfectly 
exist without "remembering" past happenings ( I'm talking about a 
*possible*  form of conscious object, not necessarily considering 
humanoids...) A question is : would it evolute? The answer is: if 
mutation, f. ex., is possible... 
Other question: would the  consciousness minimum set (or kernel) be 
just a set of data (including basic procedures) in our (or any 
organism's) "firmware", or is it just a virtual characteristic 
dependent of other functions, acting together?

I'll give it 2 years and with a standard PC.  Providing you use genetic
algorithms, instead of Deep Blue's 'expert system' approach.  We should be
able to evolve a damn good Go playing computer.  More power only gives you
more speed, mass parallel processing would be more desirable.

The reason I said that "in the long-term" we will have
sensory-rich/physically safe environments is because I've seen examples of
them, understand the current trends and have a good idea of what technology
will allow us to do.  I guess I should have said, "It may be possible to
create"?  Criticism noted.

I'm not sure how saying 'some sort of parenting will always be necessary' is
any more scientific than saying it won't be.  Especially on the grounds that
'nothing's perfect'.  A need for parenting or no need for parenting can both
be considered as 'utopian illusions' depending on your own brand of utopia.

Such environments could be considered as artificial meta-parents, couldn't
they?

Making a child's environment safe by altering the environment is not coercing
the child - there's a difference between covering the live wire and telling
everyone to never go near it (and which one's more effective?).  We can tell
when a child has matured enough to make its own decisions because it starts
making its own decisions.

The argument I always hear for an age of consent law is "the child may be
physically mature, but is not emotionally mature".  I'm not completely sure
what 'emotionally mature' is, but I know it's a social limit (which
extropians actively challenge (?)).  Physical sexual maturity is about 13.

If children aren't emotionally mature enough to have sex before the age of
16, then obviously we're not teaching them fast enough.  The thing we need to
do is make sure they're emotionally ready when they're physically ready.  And
that will mean talking about sex in an open, rational and critical manner -
something I'm dissapointed to see many people on this list find hard.

When I mentioned discrimination being passed out by the government, I meant
in terms of legislation made to empower a certain race/gender/sexuality and
hinder another.  The entire point of the post was to stop giving rights and
start taking away the ones that empowered one person over another.  I was
calling for less government, not more.

I would be the last person to preach universal love, of all the people I've
met in my life time I would say I could resist beating-the-hell out of 10%,
respect 1%, like 0.1% and love 0.01%.  I hope that when uploaded there is
more competition, deference's of opinion and out-right hate.  But, of course,
when uploaded the colour of your skin, your gender and your sexuality no
longer matter.

The key-phrase in my post was "start taking rights away".  What legislation
does is give a white man rights over a black man, then give a black man
rights to counter act the balance.  I'm saying the answer is to take away the
white mans rights over the black man.  Don't *let* them ride at the front of
the bus, *stop* making them ride at the back - there is a difference!  The
difference is subtraction and addition, presently we solve problems with
additional legislation when we should be decreasing legislation.

The point is you shouldn't be happy to absorb wisdom from some black people
and some women.  You should absorb wisdom based on its merit.  I'm not saying
that we should make all people accept everyone, I'm saying that there's
nothing to accept.  The fact that you said 'I was initially programmed as a
white man' is exactly the point.  When we talk of stopping racism, sexism,
and all the other isms we just continue programming 'white men' and then add
a sugar coating of 'acceptance' so they'll be more presentable in the modern
world.  It's time we simply stopped programming.

Does anybody know of any work about the feasibility of active shields 
as a defense against a nanotech enemy?

Drexler has told me that he belives there is a possible stable 
situation with nanotech and intelligent life. I tend to agree with 
this. The problem is it is not impossible that the only way to get 
there is to "tunnel" through an impossible region of civilization 
space.

We will of course never have an "ideal" world government, but we 
should be willing to pay a high prise in terms of inefficiency if 
that will reduce the risk of total annihilation.

What are your grounds for thinking that a reformed, democratic United 
Nations would provoke and escalate mote disputes than it would 
settle?

Many wars seem to originate in differing interpretations of some 
legal or historical circumstance. I have often thought, oh, if there 
only were an impartial arbiter to which the rivalling nations could 
submit their cases, and a responsible international force that 
could implement the judgements.

The only realistic candidates in the foreseeable future are either the 
UN or a coalition led by the USA. I think it is dubious that most 
people would accept the USA as an international Dad in the long run. 
I would suggest a reformed UN in which the USA and the other powers 
had an influence that were in some proportion to their real power. 
This would presumably also lead to an inefficient bureaucracy that 
wastes a few billion dollars per year, but so what?

No, these are issues I have long been worried about. Drexler 
has told me that he intentionally de-emphasises the darker scenarios 
in his speeches and publications for strategic reasons. One 
of the reasons why Drexler is the person that I admire perhaps more 
than anybody else is that he has not only realized how good the 
future could be if things go well but he is also fully aware of how 
serious the risks are.

First let me say that I misunderstood your original post, and I
mostly agree with you, though I'm not sure that you're expressing
your ideas in the most effective possible way (and there's nothing
wrong with that, because these are inherently difficult things to
talk about).

But since you seem to have developed some method of judging the merit
of someone's wisdom *prior* to absorbing that wisdom, I'd be *very*
interested to learn of your methods, since I'm sure I could benefit
tremendously from the application of these new techniques.

 > It's time we simply stopped programming.

I think we're designed to program. We can hardly help it. But we can
start doing it deliberately instead of just automatically passing along
whichever programs happen to have gotten their hooks into our brains
before we woke up. In Leary's terminology, we can start
programming and metaprogramming ourselves.

And besides, programming is fun! Especially when it's collaborative
and interactive.  In that form, it's often called "conversation". I
dig it. It seems to be a positive-sum game.

Sure, but it seems to me that most serious outbreaks of military
disorderliness nowadays are civil wars, not international wars. I
can't think of any reasons to believe that a world government would
be a more effective means of reducing the risk of total annihilation
from civil wars than the current setup, or an even more decentralized
setup.

Because, for instance, the reformed democratic government that I
endure, the federal government of the United States of America and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provokes and escalates more disputes
than it settles.  One could mention the police execution of the
Black Panther leadership in Chicago a couple decades ago, or the
mess in Waco, Texas a few years ago.  And I notice this seems to
be true of governments in general. I wouldn't expect an empowered
United Nations to be very different in this respect.

What makes you think that a reformed, democratic United Nations
would be impartial? (Or that their international force would be
responsible, though I find this far easier to imagine than an
impartial United Nations. The current United Nations is
extremely partial.)

I think any increase in the influence that the US federal government
has over world affairs would be disastrous.  It has far too much
busybody meddling influence as it is.  I find both of your "realistic
candidates" quite frightening.

 > I would suggest a reformed UN in which the USA and the

What the heck is "real power" and how do you propose to measure
it? (I hope you're not going to say "in watts". ;)

I agree with you that this wouldn't be so bad if there were
some counterbalancing benefit to be obtained. But I don't see
any counterbalancing benefit.

So you don't think Marshall Savage's scheme to use OTECs to raise
lots of spirulina and dump some of it (with the attendant carbon)
to the ocean bottom will help?  The scheme is described in his book
THE MILLENIAL PROJECT along with several other poetically-portrayed
engineering marvels. (Savage's book is also loaded with the most
entertaining flights of disasturbation, but I have no trouble
discounting that stuff.  He's just trying to get people motivated,
so I just pretend I'm reading Steven King.)

One problem I have in thinking about these things is that everytime
I try to worry about global warming, I recall that we have recently
had four major glacial periods, each about 100,000 years long,
punctuated by four interglacial periods, each about 10,000 years
long. We've been in the current (fourth) interglacial for about
10,000 years. Now I must confess that I haven't delved into the
primary geological research behind these numbers, but if anyone on
the list is familiar with this stuff I'd be fascinated to hear
more.

Personally, I lump most forecasting discussions of global ecology
in with forecasting discussions of macroeconomics.  They seem to
be about equally difficult, and the hit rate of opinions of experts
in these fields seems to be pretty close to chance.  Local ecology
and microeconomics I treat with somewhat less skepticism.

Trying to *think* about global ecology and macroeconomics is a
tremendously valuable guide for helping me find gaps in my education,
though, so I do that all the time. I just don't have much confidence
in the opinions I develop along the way.

As an unrelated sidepoint, I'll mention that I've found Daugherty's
posts considerably more comprehensible after he explained to us
that what he calls "sophisticated conspiracy theorists" envision
the conspiracies they discuss as the Dark Side of spontaneous order:
implicit understandings that arise in the collective subconscious
of the old boy network.  Admittedly, this still sounds wacky, but
not nearly as wacky as the idea that successful global conspiracies
are deliberately planned and constructed (the Illuminatus! fantasy).

In regards to a World Government, one only needs to look at the 
disparity between your access to city government vs state government or 
worse still federal government. When I imagine a whole new layer of 
beauracracy on top of that - I shudder!  Creating a singular centralized 
World Government forcing social policy on over a thousand diverse 
cultures consisitng of 6 billion people is unworkable - tremendous chaos 
and social uoheaval is likley to result.  I highly recommend Max More's 
Order w/o Orderers in Extropy #(8?) for insight into alternatives.

How, then, do you explain that 77% of the electricity in France is
generated by nuclear power?  Are they not "the public"?  Or did you mean
the public in the United States?  It seems to me that French people are
not so utterly different from Americans, and that a power source which
is so widely accepted there does have prospects of being more used in
the U.S. as well.

(See http://www.uilondon.org/uprod94.html for the percentage of power
from nuclear energy in various countries.)

Actually, I really believe that we should just try to keep things
on a relatively even keel for the next 9 years or so. Most
attempts at fixing the system have up-front costs to the
ecology (an economy) that will not be recovered for 20 years
or so. However, our ability to fix this mess will get very
rapidly better. IMO, we'll hit the singularity. Therefore, it
actually makes sense to defer any attempt at massive improvement
in our use (abuse?) of the environment: we're likely to do
more harm than good, sort of like the attempts during the
last century to preserve ancient works of art. If the
preservationists had simply left the stuff alone, we'd
now be able to do a much better job. I realize that it sounds
as if I'm just waiting for the Tooth Fairy to come and
solve all our problems, but I'm not.

[Excerpt translated by Mod.JW]

NASA scientist Richard Hoover announced the finding of fossil structures in
the shape of fungi and other [microbial] forms in a meteorite from Mars that
fell in Australia in 1969.  This meteorite is different from the one in
which fossil microbes were reported to have been discovered last year.

The announcement was made at a conference in San Diego, California (USA), on
the search for alien micro-organisms.

My prediction is at least falsifiable -- Wax in fact claims to have seen
counter-examples, which if confirmed, would indeed falsify it. 

The issue is how to minimize the disasters stemming frome immature
judgements, when more mature judgements can intervene to avoid/lessen
them. Whether you call it parenting or whatever, I believe any
(post-human) family or society strives to operate in a manner that is
more efficient than trial-and-error learning from one's mistakes --
natural selection is a literally ignorant and very wasteful technique.

The word "environment" usually connotes an externality relative to some
system (e.g. a family or a post-human society), and hence it is not
constrained by the rules by which the system operates. Thus environments
could not function as (meta)parents for entities within the system. I
think of systems that try to protect themselves from disasters as
pragmatic, hardly utopian.

on genetic defects in mitochondria and how this causes many problems

We know immune systems do a fairly good job against natural "goo",
although at a noticeable price: it consumes a lot of energy, and we
multicellular animals have evolved sex (with all its complications
and further energy losses) to improve its chances. 

So I think active shields are feasible, it is just unlikely they will
be perfect. In the future even our equipment might get colds... :-)

I'm sceptical; saying it is fungi and bacteria sounds a bit too bold.
It is likely that the newspaper has distorted the news somewhat.
Looking through the web suggests that Dr Richard Hoover isn't
involved in meteor research, although he seems to be interested in
diatoms.

Will this not risk the creation of dead sea bottoms as aerobic decay
processes consume all the available oxygen, creating a layer of
hydrogen-sulphide laden water (which kills most aerobic lifeforms)? 
This kind of problem regularly occurs in the Baltic sea after algae
blooms. In the oceans, the inflow of cold polar water might change
this, but I'm still somewhat worried (although I like the general
idea).

Yes, I also got a great deal more positive about his theories when he
explained that (I hope to respond to them when I get the time).

Yes, that should be possible within some limits. A plant or animal
can become more complex as it grows larger (just look at ordinary
developmental processes). In the end there will be environmental
limits, of course (the Earth receives a certain amount of energy from
the sun, which cannot be changed although it can be used more
efficiently).

The number of possible mutations depends merely on the length of the
genome (in the case of expressed mutations, mainly on the length of
the intron genome). If the genome has length N, then 4N point changes
can occur (and a larger number of deletions, crossovers and
additions; each on the order of N^2). So it doesn't depend on the
entropy outflow, although for a very long genome you need an entropy
outflow just to make the DNA repair work.

By "executing children" do they mean executing people under 18, or 
executing adults for crimes they commited before age 18.  Not a lot 
of difference, perhaps, but I sure wasn't aware of any minors being 
put to death in the US and would like to know.

My God, Anders, that's it!  We must forestall the goo problem with sex!
Yes, with sex, I tell you!  With more sex!  More sex!  More sex!  More sex!
 Sorry, I seem to be... getting a little... overexci--  Perhaps it's true

It is easy to observe that it is necessary to create an International 
Committee, which will manage the "curriculum vitae" of these and 
other countries. Not for punishment, but for democratic control 
and global information... We are already going to XXI century ( in 
reality much more of real civilization. See for example the year 
count of the chineses....) By the way, the recent prohibition of 
experiences with human clones is ridiculously narrow-minded... ( the 
day after, our parliamentaries, here in Brazil,  ran to prepair local 
prohibitions too... Get what I mean?...)

Hmm, I still think you have a point. Maybe we should let our
nanosystems have sex occasionally to gain better immunity for
themselves or their descendant systems from nanoinfections.

Indeed.  The previous episode of hoopla regarding martian "microfossils" 
seemed quite a bit too bold.  I recently processed some Pt/Ir wire tips in
an arc and created a micro-forest of interesting structures.  When viewed
in an SEM, there was an area covered with short, tubular, round-ended
structures that would have better passed for "bacteria" than the those in
the martian sample.  I'm told that such things can form
electro-chemically, also.  Personally, I think someone at NASA was trying
(valiantly) to get the general public fired up for an expanded Mars
program.

I thought, it was strange that the report was San Diego and the newspaper was
Portuguese (newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo).  Maybe something was lost in
the  translation by "Mod.JW?"  Fungus is much more highly evolved than
bacteria from what we know on Earth, . . . but on Mars?  I can't understand
how the evolution fungus was possible on Mars.  It seems too good to be true.
 Too many intermediate evolutionary developments in between bacteria and
fungus.  Of course, what "looks" like fungus might not be fungus, this is
Exomicrobiology we are talking about after all.

Savage was talking about doing this in equatorial ocean waters,
with his preferred first site being in the Indian Ocean between
the Seychelles and Zanzibar (because later, he wants to build a
laser-launcher in Kilimanjaro).  That has open access to cold
flows from the Antarctic waters.

There might be a way to package or preprocess the discarded algae
(more specifically, the carbon, which would be the only thing we'd
really be trying to get rid of) so that it decays anaerobically,
or goes into the sediment layer without withdrawing or releasing
any constituents to or from the abyssal waters.

Firstly, _Lord of the Flies_ is about 'civilised' children put in a situation
where their 'civilised' values failed them, and gangs are rebellion against
authority - both are products of civilisation.  I was suggesting a world of
*learning* without *teaching* (used in terms of giving instruction rather
than inspiration).  You'd be amazed how much a child learns of its own accord
when not being taught, seeing and doing are far greater tools than being
told.

I'm not suggesting keeping children in isolation, we will still be there
offering the usual advice.  Let's just do away with the current parent/child
hierarchy, children can learn from their parent and parents can learn from
their children as and when they want.

Subject: COMP: A DPA of VPU's to replace CPU's?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I had this idea about 5 minutes ago, so forgive me if I've overlooked
something embarrassingly obvious, made any number of grammatical errors, or
it's just crap...

I recently noticed that things like sound, graphics, 3D, etc. are migrating
in to a single chip on new computers (Intel and MS have rival solutions for
this!).  And also the release of the software modem, eventually we could have
software soundcards, graphics adapters, etc. all running on a universal
architecture.  After all this you end up with computers consisting of a
processor and some memory.  But that's two thing, wouldn't it be better to
have only one?

A British company called _Division_ uses memory chips as processors, each
chip contains lots of virtual processors (one per pixel) which are used for
creating 3D graphics in Divisions VR simulators.  The _University Of North
Carolina_ originally conceived the idea.  A central processor controls the
array of memory chips; I don't know how it functions exactly so my idea is a
bit speculative.  Here it is anyway:

Move some of the CPU processing power on to the memory chips, just enough so
they can take care of themselves and communicate with each other.  What you
get is a Versatile Processing Unit (VPU) that can switch between the
functions of RAM, ROM, Flash RAM and Processor.  Put a thousand of these
chips in parallel and you get a Distributed Processing Array (DPA).  It has
no CPU, no FPU, no graphics card, and no sound card - just a bunch of similar
chips.

Why?

Many reasons (other than I'm obsessed with the notion of distribution):

Economies of Scale - A VPU will never be as powerful as purpose built
silicon, but it could be cheaper.  If you're mass-producing the same chip in
thousands per system then the cost will keep falling.  Eventually you could
end up with a higher price/performance ration than custom hardware.

Security - How about duplicating calculations across two processors at any
one time, on the fly backup of not only information but of actually
processing.  The two processors could then compare results for error
checking.  You could also have two processors doing the same calculation in
different ways and then crosscheck them to make sure all areas are function
correctly.  And then there's redundancy; one chip goes down another takes
over.

Economics - If you have custom hardware for graphics and you're not using it,
it goes to waste.  If you're using VPU's nothing goes to waste.  You're using
all the hardware all the time.

Obviously there would have to be built-in security against people turning ROM
into RAM and deleting its contents (and I'm sure you could come up with some
great viruses for this architecture!).  And you would need an OS that could
abstract the system so programmers don't have to worry about all those
parallel VPU's (Taos?).

Now I need to know:

Has it been done before? 
And will it work?

Personally, I would consider losing the "social interaction with other
children" a great benefit of home schooling; many of the kids I met at
school were little but vicious thugs. I think a lot of people who feel
this is important are caught up in the myth of "childhood innocence". 

Didn't someone post some research results to the list a year or two ago
showing that children who spend time with adults generally do better than
those who spend their time with other kids? This wouldn't seem terribly
surprising, since adults tend to know a lot more than kids. Worked for me,
anyway.

I thought (based on memories of my astrophysics class a few years ago)
that the outer layers of the sun were about as dense as water? Still much
less dense than lead, but far more dense than air...

	ooh... to me that is a bit like saying "spare the rod, spoil the

	instance, helped produce the fine person that many of the

	a good example is one of my best friends that for various reasons

	to follow his interests (and they had the ability, financially,
	to do so).  he now has a successful music career, does freelance
	graphic design, and is a well adjusted 19 year old.  and he has
	no problems interacting with other human beings.  this is because
	he was able to pursue his interests at his own speed and interact
	with adults as a human.

	on the other hand, i was forced to interact with adults as a 
	2nd class human being (student)... the only things I could pick

	a yes man and the other survival skills neccessary to a bipedal
	hominid in the USA.  (i'm proud to say i've pretty well gotten
	over all of that.)

	i guess an "extropian viewpoint" on child rearing would be:
	children are influenced, molded by their surroundings. why
	would you subject your children to any system (public school, 
	catholic school, hebrew school, the rotary club, the marine

Hmm...

If we want to use the immune system analogy, the term "active 
shield" is perhaps a little misleading. One thinks of some kind of 
spherical wall, but is what you have in mind somthing that would 
permeate the whole domain? If it's just a wall, might it not be much
cheaper to blow a hole in it (with (nuclear?) explosives) than to 
rebuild it? Then nanites could be sent in and devastate the 
unprotected interior.

If it's not just a wall then there is still the question of power 
balance. I agree with you that biology gives us hope in this respect: 
higher organisms can and do survive in an environment with naturally 
evolved viruses and bacteria. We need to consider:

(1) What if the parasites were designed instead of evolved? (Design 
is better than sex. Remember, just because we might think sex is 
more interesting doesn't mean it's more plausible!) Perhaps the fact 
that the defence would also be designed would conterbalance this 
factor. 

(2) What if new chemical reactions are introduced? Will complicated 
higher organisms still be viable? Exactly what properties of the 
system does this depend on? Does anybody have any idea of how to get 
a handle on this problem?

UN has terminated the shooting in Bosnia, and there is some hope that 
the peace will hold, though a shortage of resources might force a 
withdrawal of the Nato troops next year. There are several other 
examples of successful UN peace keeping missons (and some of failed 
ones), but this is still a rather new phenomenon and learning is 
still in progress, so I think there is room for hope, especially if 
the UN is given adequate funding.

UN itself would not need to be impartial (though it would presumably 
be much less partial that the parts that are fighting), it would 
only need to implement the decisions of some independent tribunal.

By real power I mean the power they have in the world as opposed to 
the power they have within the present UN. I don't have any specific 
proposals for how to measure it, but I think a UN is less likely to 
function well if some nations perceive that they are 
underrepresented. (A rough measure of real power would be GNP.)

Living beings have the same problem. We surround ourselves with
impermeable walls called skin, and let the immune system permeate the
inside. If you worry about an enemy trying to blow your walls/skin
apart, then you have to take more active measures than to protect
against random grey goo, advertising nanites and opportunistic
devices trying to build distributed computing nodes out of you. If I
notice that something is building TNT out of matter in my vicinity,
I'm not going to stay around...

If you know what defenses I have, then I'm vulnerable (think of the
AIDS virus, which uses the immune system), but if I have a system
which you know fairly little about, then it is harder to design a
workable attack (hint: never let your enemy get fingernail clippings
or spittle, he can use them to bring down black magic on you!). So it
might be a good idea to design *and* evolve your defenses to make
them unique. And a good basic structure would give you time to act
("Oh shit! My immune nanites can't stop the infection. Let's call
tech support...").

Very broadly, the question seems to be if diamondoid mechanosynthetic
or a aquaeous carbochemic biomass has the lowest chemical energy; the
biosphere would tunnel to the lowest if given a reaction pathway. I
guess diamond is the stablest, since cells cannot digest it, but it
might be too energy-intensive for nanites competing with each other
to digest too (thick diamondoid sediments on the ocean floors; in
time they will form a very fun form of "chalk"). 

I think complicated organisms are still quite viable, since they have
the advantage of fast cultural evolution before biological evolution.
It doesn't matter if their biology is about diamond or water.

UN committed genocide against the Bosnian Muslims by enforcing an
arms embargo against Yugoslavia at a time when most of the organized
Yugoslavian armed forces, and almost all of their materiel, was in
Serbian hands. You credit them with stopping, three years later,
a bloodbath that they (inadvertently?) laid the groundwork for.
Aided and abetted by the United States, of course.

 > Small potatoes!.

A green plague of ten different high-latency fatal strains of
virus will be quite useful to small potatoes terrorists. I
don't think the size of the potatoes is at issue here.  Small
potatoes can be quite deadly, especially nowadays.

I still don't understand why you think that "world government"
or transferring more power from the current nations to the UN
would increase the likelihood that large civil disputes would
be settled by the decisions of an independent tribunal. If the
disputants don't accept the decisions of the tribunal (and they

These sorts of things come down to primates and their will to
fight, their reasons for fighting, and the extreme difficulty
of communication, as both a transmitting and a measuring
process. Implementing an accounting change at the top-level has
many dangers of its own, and furthermore, does little or
nothing to address the dangers that you're worrying about. The
proposals you are making, it seems to me, would simply pile new
dangers on top of the existing dangers.

Cowardice is not the motivation behind my arguments, I
assure you. I mentioned fears only because your proposals were
set forth in the name of allaying fears of military
destruction.

Ah, there's the rub. It is less likely to function well if some
nations perceive that they are underrepresented. And I can
guarantee you that some of them will perceive that, no matter
what you do.

Military troubles are worst in the poorest nations. Allocating
political power by GNP will do almost nothing to soothe these
troubles. Better to keep poor countries and rich countries politically
decoupled from one another. What you are proposing is to arrange
for the rich countries to rule the poor countries (that's what your
"representation according to 'real' power seems to come down to),
which I guarantee will lead to war. It's been tried already.

I have heard conflicting reports on what is an appropriate amount of
Deprynl to take.  For a 30yr old, recommended dosages have varied from
1mg to 5mg per week.  More importantly I read that this dosage level
should be lowered after some time.  Three were no details about when
to lower the dosage and how much to take.

Any answers?

I will grant that school environments do create opportunity for 
bullies and the weak-minded to prey on children unlike themselves, 
and I do not doubt that most of the persons on this list had some bad 
experiences during their school years.  I do not agree, however, 
that spending time in a potentially environment discourages personal and 
intellectual growth.  One of the main cautions for parents 
considering home-schooling is that their children must somehow be 
exposed to situations in which they must negotiate disputes with 
other children, and learn to assert themselves, without the 
intervention of adults (unless the situation becomes dangerous).  
Socialization theory holds that this aspect of early development 
partially determines future effectiveness in a career or personal 
relationships.  

That's the theoretical level.  On a practical level, humans who are 
different in a manner that is going to draw hostility from other 
humans need to learn to deal with it early in life.  Developing the 
quality of courage, based on the success of prior experiences of 
standing one's ground, will help prevent some of the future 
potential incidents.  And, in addition, that strength will carry into 
other areas of life and allow that person to face future adversities 
more successfully.

 Will this not risk the creation of dead sea bottoms as aerobic decay
 processes consume all the available oxygen, creating a layer of
 hydrogen-sulphide laden water (which kills most aerobic lifeforms)?  >>


I seem to recall several things that might impact upon this:

    1.  OTEC's work best when the tempeture differential is greatest....the
location that best fits this is deep-sea equatorial waters...the sea floor
waters many thousands of feet down are barely above freezing...the surface is
equatorially hot.  (was in Yuma the other day...was 115 degrees...and Yuma is
still a ways north of the equator)

    2. The  deep sea equatorial waters are deserts...that is they have no
life in them except near land (shallows)...due to lack of nutrients and lack
of oxygen in the water...(????maybe...I dunno)

     3. If 1. and 2. are true then the problem would not arise I wouldn't
think.

As an aside...what's holding back OTEC production of Hydrogen and "The
Hydrogen Economy"?...It would seem to be an absolute end to any question of
an "energy shortage"...as well as continued carbon dioxide emission into the
atmosphere .(CO2 driven global warming)...and a host of other solutions to
present day problems.(food shortage...)and relatively speaking..wouldn't cost
much to implement. (replace IC engines with Hydrogen Fuel cells..transport
hydrogen overland via gas pipelines...etc)..or are they really problems?  Or
just excuses for new taxes and restrictive legislation?

When (if) we do go to a hydrogen economy with hydrogen from deep-sea OTECs
being shipped to civilization via Hydrogen Tankers...(multi-ton cyronic
surface-effect  Ram-wings I would think....100+ mph...burn Hydrogen for fuel
...able to reach any ocean or river port in a few days..(thereby accessible
to vast pecentage of worlds population)..fast enough to avoid storms....I
want the job of driving one...talk about LONG DISTANCE trucking!!!!!!!  (and

I wonder if this has anything to do with another subject I'm currently

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The American Society of Newspaper Editors launched a project to
learn why they are losing public trust. Some know that liberal
bias is the problem, but more disparage that thought

              +++++++++++++++++++++++++

 'Journalism Credibility Project'
may be the industry's most serious effort at large-scale
ombudsmanship. Over the next three years, the society will spend
more than $1 million trying to find out why people don't love and
trust newspapers anymore. 


 "The society's President, Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The
(Portland) Oregonian, became convinced of journalism's credibility
problem 'because of negative poll after negative poll coming out'
and 'the amount of negative press in the press about the press.'...
    "During the project, the editors will do some predictable..........."

          +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Duh!

Here's a guess on my part.....the USA was added to that list of countries 
 because the news media hates the US...

Why does the news media hate the US?  Because it represents freedom and
individual rights....by associating the US with countries which are opposed
to that view the idea of individual rights and freedom is diminished.  And
Statism gains ground....

Now I don't hold strongly to this guess...it sounds too much like a
conspiricy...and why invest in a conspiricy when pure ole stupidity will
explain it just as well?  And the news media have demonstrated that in
addittion to being lazy and liberal they are  very much stupid...as reading
any science or technology (or anything that you can corroborate for that
matter...i.e. trucking)  article in the general press  will demonstrate.

The general public ain't buying it....it's backfiring...the newsmedia is
loosing credibulity instead. Which is interesting to me since the news media
lost all credibulity with me 20 or more years ago during the Veet-Naam war,
and has never regained it.. Does that make prescient?

Then again....when listing  the USA maybe they were referring to the 3million
or so unborn children who are executed every year.?.....nawwwwwww..

     So it's those nasty teenage boys (glad I had a girl...most of the

     true in Inner City situations.  But does not poverty factor in and 
     undermine matriarchal influence?  Poverty tends to numb one to the 
     hardships of day-to-day living.  That disempowerment of the women due 
     to poverty (particularly in regards to an ostensibly disempowered 
     cultural set due to racial inequality) could very well just open the 
     space for rampant teenage mayhem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{It's been some time since I read the book...but it impressed me a
lot...let's see if I can recall some pertinent points.  It IS nasty teenage
boys...."Every culture is only one generation away from Barbarism...and every
culture must deal with the onslaught of barbarians...their young"

And poverty has nothing to do with it.  The blacks HAD a culture prior to the
governments meddling thanks to LBJ during the sixties...said meddling pretty
much destroyed it...this according to Ken Hamblin...Walter Williams...Thomas
Sowell (or at least my understanding of what they said...and they are all
blacks) and my understanding of George Gilder.....and personal observation.

Teen age boys are ruled by their Hormones...and girls control the floodgates.
 Many societies/cultures have methods of sublimating  and controlling the
desires and impulses generated by the hormonal flood...in West Texas where I
am from it was in a large part FOOTBALL....and other sports...to a much
lesser degree....the boys vented much of their anger/frusturation/excess
energy etc...trying to be a football hero and hence get the girls to pay
attention to him....it pretty much worked for a fair percentage of the
suceptible teenage male population....

This discouraged gangs...another...more primitive (natural...but socially
destructive) method of hormonal storm control...

In either case the girls were in control.  They could say NO.  The longer the
DID say no the better things worked out....In black Ghettos (and brown, and
white, and yellow and ...I suppose...red)...the girls DON'T say no....hence
there is no control over the boys...the fathers being displaced by government
welfare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------    
     Are there any examples where survival issues aren't weighing heavily 
     on the scenario so that teenage boys don't just "revert to type" (now 
     THAT'S a generalization! Woo-doggie!)?  Sorry, teenage boys tended to 
     make this former wimp's growing up life rather hellish at times <G>.

Mine too...I was <am> a loner...didn't fit in very well in team sports at

NOOOO....(funny...they pretty much left me alone after that...)

Last December, there was a thread on this list called "Singularity-worship".

It was Sandberg, I believe, who started it off, and said:

> The Singularity concept has all the earmarks of an idea that can lead to
> cultishness, and passivity.

And I replied with words to this effect:

"To me, the Singularity means that we don't need to worry about the far
future; we can concentrate on the near-term stuff."

It struck me as being truly fantastic that someone could read about the
Singularity and then sit back and wait for it.  The Singularity validated, not
invalidated, our current efforts.

Well, a professor I know read "Staring", liked it, and then said:  "Perhaps
I'll retire, since everything I do is going to be obsoleted anyway."

And I said:
"But isn't what you're doing useful right now?  (Which it was, since he was
working on more efficient chickens.)  Won't it help get to the Singularity by
feeding more people?"

And he said:
"Hmmm, you're right.  Well, guess I won't retire then."

With regards to this whole conversation,
I can only express my feelings in one way:


                 ????         ????        ????
                ?    ?       ?    ?      ?    ?
                    ?            ?           ?
                   ?            ?           ?
                   ?            ?           ?

                   ?            ?           ?


I can't really claim to understand what happened, or how to prevent it -
but it looks like Sandberg was right; the "Singularity" CAN lead to passivity.
 Insofar as there IS going to be a Singularity, cultish or not, does anyone
have suggestions on how the concept could be presented so as to avoid a repeat
of the above error?

We aren't.  Our emotions aren't hidden - it's obvious to anyone, internally
and externally, that we have these things called "emotions".  You were
proposing that Deep Thought had emotions and we didn't know about it.  My
response was that emotions are not subjective philosophical constructs that we
can assign or deny at our whim; they are cognitive processes that objectively
exist - in all known cases, obviously so.  From the medial forebrain bundle,
to the amygdala, to the mammillary bodies... the entire limbic system... there
are numerous parts of the brain specialized for handling emotions.  Emotions
don't just happen, they are evolutionarily designed to serve specific
functions.  Insofar as Deep Thought doesn't evolve, wasn't designed to feel,
and contains no hidden processes - which assumptions I debated in the previous
letter - it is not likely to have emotions remotely analogous to those which
take up so much explicit processing power in our own minds.

I am not interested in debating what evolution "really" is.  The evolution you
name had no effect on Deep Blue's design.  Deep Blue was designed by a bunch
of humans; it was not designed by selection of any type.  The weightings may
have been evolutionary; the architecture was not.

Pleasure is handled by the medial forebrain bundle... though this is only one
kind of pleasure; "satiation" pleasure is handled by an entirely different
area.  I don't recall where the pain center(s) are, but they are *elsewhere*. 
So in response, pleasure and pain are handled by entirely different sections
of the brain, feel entirely different from a subjective standpoint, have
wholly different effects, and in general are totally different subsystems. 
Ask not how they differ; ask how they are alike.

I disagree.  Programs designed by humans tend to work one way.  Programs
designed by evolutionary computation work a completely different way.  This is
what makes the distinction between "evolved" and "designed" programs useful. 
The narrowness and genuine distinguishing power of the term is what makes
evolutionary computation a science.  What practical purpose is served by
broadening the term as you suggest?

I couldn't fail to disagree with you less!  I can study emotions though
experiment.  I can study the neural architectures of the areas of the brain
which subserve emotions.  I can study subjective cost-benefit ratios, and how
our causal handling of them differs from Deep Blue's linear branching. 
Emotions are REAL and objective, not subjective.

Tossing your children into public playgrounds gives no guarantee that

That seems rather too glib.  Skills should be as important as

I don't think a chance at learning combat survival for an hour every day

especially in most public schools.  If adversity training is that
important find some other playground or something with a low adult-kid

        The crucial element that separates those who worship and those who
welcome the singularity is that it takes people to make it happen.  If
everyone were to stop what they were doing, to sit back and worship the
singularity, there would be no singularity.  It takes all technical people
in their respective trades to create such a singularity; if that is
forgotten, the singularity may as well be some deity that is expected to
provide salvation upon such and such a date.  If you want to explain the
concept of the singularity, first start with telling the person or people
*how* a singularity can be created.  Without the human element, it appears
(and is) a totally foreign entity.  Show how such a singularity is the
summation of man's potential.  That is what it is.

Just a quick note: 2 is wrong. There is plenty of life in the deep
sea and on the sea floor, even in the "desert equatorial seas". And
if the breakdown of organics there were disrupted, the cold
nutrient-rich upwellings which today sustain a lot of life near the
coasts, would vanish.

The center of the Sun is far denser than ordinary lead.  The bomb, at zero
pressure, has about the density of silicon.  It is true that on its way down
it will encounter layers denser than this, but by the time it gets there, it
will be under much more pressure, and will be compressed to be much smaller,
so it will still be denser than the surrounding gas.  In fact, it will
always be at least several times denser than the medium it is faling through.

This is provided that it is not substantially hotter than its surroundings,
since being hotter makes it expand and reduces its density.  While it's
dropping, it will be heated by compression, but the medium around it is also
heated by compression, so as long as the bomb is cooler at the surface it
will stay cooler all the way down.  So it is important to deliver it to the
surface of the Sun in a way tha leaves it no hotter than the Sun itself.
That means that it has to be placed rather gently on the surface of the Sun,
rather than being dropped in at orbital velocity (200 km/sec).  Forrest
Bishop's message suggested doing this by halting an orbiting bomb in its
orbit using a gravitational slingshot manuver.  Unfortunately, this won't
work because such manuvers are limited in their delta-v to the escape
velocity for the bodies concerned, which for planet-size objects are only
tens of kilometers per second.  I was imagining using mass drivers on the
bomb to bring it suddenly to a halt by catching a bunch of mass going the
other way in the same orbit.  I'm not sure it's feasible; there's a lot of
waste heat.

The UN intervention was delayed too long. But for all I know, if it 
hadn't intervened at all, the killing might still have gone on today, 
or one of the combatants might have won and done terrible 
things to the defeated people.

I agree. Still, the bigger the powers that fight, the sooner they 
will start to have access to weapons of mass destruction. So even if 
we can't eliminate all the small conflicts as well, we might be able 
to delay the use of, say, destructive nanoreplicators untill adequate 
defences have been developed.

The difference is that UN would be there to enforce the decision, 
whether the disputants accepted it or not. If somebody issues a 
"resolution", Sadam Hussein would wipe his ass with it; but a cruise 
missile is something that needs to be taken into account.

A clarification of my earlier statement: I only said that it might be 
advisable (I am not really certain of this) that a nation's 
representation in the UN is "in some proportion" to its real power. 
This would mean that real power would be taken into account, but 
other factors, such as population size or the extent to which a 
nation would be affected by UN decisions would also be given a role. 
The overall result would almost certainly be that poor nations were 
given somewhat *more* influence than they have in the real world 
today.

Hey, let's take a step back and look at it this way. You have your 
own values, involving, perhaps, personal freedom, immortality, to see 
the ones you care for prosper etc. Surely you won't accept that 
some fucked up religious extremist lay these values in ashes by 
releasing some self-replicators, or that the inhabitants of your 
city are gassed as a result of a failed blackmail attempt by a wicked 
dictator. Yet these things will happen unless they are actively 
prevented. One way one might try to prevent them is by having a 
global organization with legislative powers that surveils the use of 
the most dangerous technologies and prevents irresponsible agents 
from acquiring them. The only enteties in the real world even 
remotely resembling this are the UN and a US led coalision.  In my 
original post I asked if someone had a better proposal, and I hope 
that someone has, but so far I have seen none.

                          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
                          ==================

                          A project to bring
                        spread-spectrum systems
                            down to Earth.

As a microcomputer enthusiast for some years now, I remember with affection
earlier, 'hobbyist' days of yore. I spent many happy days and weeks and...
constructing and working with a Digital Research Computers "BIGBOARD," which
was the only way I could afford to gain entrance to a magical world of CP/M.

I read Jerry Pournelle's pieces in BYTE avidly, one of a few who could write
good fiction (science) and technical stuff. This led me to Magic Wand, and
the wonders of dBASE II (designed by Wayne Ratcliff to organize data for
NASA's Viking Lander programme).

My BIGBOARD came with parallel and serial port options, each with its own
Zilog Z-80 dedicated chip. I soon learned the grim truth, that there was no
parallel port printer driver routine to enable me to get print-outs. Autistic
computers are really bad news...

After weeks of exploring the black hole of Z-80 opcodes and registers,
I was lucky (veery lucky) to meet up with one Geoffrey Drake, a cheerful
magician who whizzed up a parallel port driver routine in an afternoon.

The obviously superiority of parallel data transfers was thus imprinted
in my mind. And, SERIAL PORTS COST MORE MONEY!!!

In due course, David Thompson, a Hewlett-Packard technician in Portland,
Oregon, started his "MICRO-CORNUCOPIA" newsletter for BIGBOARD users,
and other "single-boarders." When I finally med David in Portland in 1981,
it was clear that I had much to learn (still do). He and Portland are both
quiet and civilized. And still, "modems are serial devices."

No-one seemed to know much about byte-parallel comms. The alias of NSA used
to be "NEVER SAY ANYTHING!" Hmmmmm........

It was when I read James Bamford's brilliant book on the legendary
"Puzzle Palace", America's National Security Agency, that I started
to realize what REAL communications are all about.

Imagine: messages (in any language) are encrypted, compressed, and burst-
transmitted at over 20,000 times faster, at one millionth of the usual
radio transmission strength, intermittently spread all over the broadcast
spectrum at shifting pseudo-random intervals, buried in "deep-background"
noise.

The NSA somehow (!!!) manages to "vacuum-clean" these signals out of thin
air, relay them to Anagram Inn, NSA's HQ in Maryland, and somehow (!!!)
reassembles them, decrypts them and translates them into English, whereon
they can then be passed to the Analytical Branch for the extraction of
any useable intelligence.

Apart from being fascinating in its own right, this started me thinking:
most bright people are a bit lazy, and constantly look for ways to do
things quicker, easier, better, cheaper. It was then that I realized
that the NSA could INSTANTLY relay and reassemble my computer's RF
emanations at any speed, in real time. And we were being asked to use
300 baud acoustic modems?*!!@? to talk to each other with some difficulty!

In June, 1988's BYTE, John H. Humphrey and Gary S. Smock wrote on
"High-Speed Modems." On p. 104, this gem appeared:

                     Multicarrier Technology

"The fourth approach borrows from spread-spectrum technology used by the
military in secure communications systems. This technology breaks the data
into discrete pieces and spreads them across the available bandwidth on
separate carrier frequencies, keyed at different time intervals. This
requires the enemy to know which spreading algorithm is being used to recover
the individual pieces of the communique. Without the correct algorithm, the
transmissions look like random noise.

"Modems using multicarrier technology spread the telephone bandwidth with
hundreds of individual carrier tones, each of which is modulated quite
slowly. Digital data is fed to the modem and buffered. Individual bits are
fed to the multiple carriers and data is passed over the link in n-length
bit-parallel fashion.

The advantage of this approach is its ability to "map around" bad spots in
telephone lines. If discrete portions of the telephone line are of poor
quality, the modems recognize this and simply do not place carrier tones
in those areas. In theory, this lets the modems operate at full speed under
good line conditions and slowly fall back under poorer line conditions. The
modems automatically seek and find the maximum operating speed achievable
under constantly changing line conditions."

(The Ven-Tel EC18K-34 is included in the review).

Since then, I have learned of "public domain" discussion of a British radio-
based datacomms system, called "PICCOLO," which works in much the same way.

Now, sitting on the back of my ST is a parallel port, which I am told can
be made bi-directional. There is also a disk-drive socket and a DMA port.
Surely, I thought to myself, there must be a few bright techno-hobbyists
around who could work up a neat package of hardware and software, to be
sold together under the trade name "RAINBOW BRIDGE." This could be both
fun, profitable, and contribute to the global liberal perestroika being
brought about by the micro revolution.

Please let me know if you would like to join in this venture.

Kind and Gentle Regards,

Tony Hollick.

As far as I can see, the only difference between what you propose here and
something like CIX is the supply of custom terminals to users. As custom
terminals are less useful than general-purpose micros, it's only a powerful
idea if you can arrange for a large percentage of the population to have
these things. So, either (1) you can persuade BT to follow the example of 
the French or (2) you can support solutions like CIX. I think that a small-
scale cix-like solution is more probable in Britain.

Though the existence of Fax makes the mail side well, not useful at
all....
And once say ISDN is widespread, you could get access directly to
online services.... finding out how to contact and use them is where
Cix comes in.....

You don't actually say what problem you are solving and don't resolve 
how you make landmail or voice phonecalls use Cix, or how you
actually get someone to do the cross indexing.... 

I suggest you have a look at project Xanadu for the database engine
of a multi-referential linked information service....

I found a company in the Netherlands offers a package that does
Piccolo Mk VI as an optional extra. It is hardware and software
(for the PC what else ?) and costs 299 with the option.
Hoka Electronics, Teiko Clockstraat 31,NL-9665 BB Oude Pekela.
I don't suggest that everyone buys this as it decodes about 30
other protocols, but at least we know that it exists and what to
look for. Looking at the packet radio stuff it may be better to
move all this to that media anyway. Who wants to get their class
B RAE in november then ?

Yes.  You have described the Connection Machine, models CM-1 and CM-2,
manufactured by the Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge Massachusetts
from 1984 to 1990, and designed by yours truly and some other people. Also
the MasPar NCube and the Meiko Computing Surface, and a bunch of others, all
built during the same period.  They sold adequately, but mostly to the
military-industrial complex, so when the cold war ended, so did the sales.
  
>And will it work?

Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it turned out that the
right size for a processor is about 32 bits wide, not 1 or 4 bits, and it
turned out that the manufacturing techniques for RAM and processor were
different enough that you're better off putting them on seperate chips.
Then, given that you had designed a 32-bit processor on a chip, you might as
well give up on the central instruction broadcast trick and use a separate
instruction fetch engine on every chip, because it buys lots of flexibility
at little cost.  That's close enough to a regular microprocessor that you're
better off just buying them, and adding special-purpose logic for
interprocessor communication.  The upshot is the design of the CM-5 and
every other post-1990 large parallel computer: hundreds or thousands of
standard one-chip CPUs, each with their own memory, and some special-purpose
network hardware conecting them.

     I'm sceptical; saying it is fungi and bacteria sounds a bit too bold.
     It is likely that the newspaper has distorted the news somewhat.
     Looking through the web suggests that Dr Richard Hoover isn't
     involved in meteor research, although he seems to be interested in
     diatoms.
     
     Rick Knight:
     
     I read today that bacteria has been discovered 2 miles below the 
     surface of the earth.  Don't know much about geology (sounds like a 
     song...) but I'd assume 2 miles deep is a bit inhospitable for all but 
     the most robust tiny life forms.  So what if there's microbes on Mars? 
     We all blew out from the same stellar stuff billions of years ago.  
     Maybe Mars was a resort planet at one time.  Looks like a pretty red 
     rock now!  Am I being callous?  Perhaps.  I just don't see what the 
     big deal is.  Does the notion of life, ANY life, however microscopic, 
     really impact our place in the universe much.  Seems to me like even 
     the religious zealots would be shrugging their shoulders.  I much 
     prefer our research dollars going towards restoring and improving 
     earth conditions and listening for "come back" signals from out there.

     Forrest Bishop cited CNN as reporting:
     
     Six countries currently execute children (people
     under the age of 18):
     
     Iran
     Iraq
     Bangladesh
     Pakistan
     Nigeria (?)
     USA
     
     Rick Knight responds:
     
     This actually brings up an interesting subject I've been meaning to 
     broach in this forum.  It ties in with the thread about age of 
     consent, the access to information for all ages, etc.. 
     
     In this country, we're presently deciding capital punishment is okay.  
     I have an interesting position on this.  Since I can honestly say that 
     I don't invest all but the most affrontive information about things 
     like
     * starving or murdered people in the Third World
     * jet crashes killing everyone
     * or even when the Oklahoma City bombing killed those many people 
     (which should've tweaked me considerably since I had a front row seat 
     to the fatal result of a terrorist bombing in 85), 
     
     I can also honestly say that whether a person convicted of a capital 
     crime will be systematically exterminated by the state doesn't really 
     move me one way or another.  Since I hold that consciousness has 
     metaphysical existence separate from physicality BUT I don't hold the 
     superstitious and disabling heaven/hell beliefs, it's almost like a 
     person is getting off the hook if you execute them.  YET, I think 
     prisons have become places of cruel and unusual punishment.
     
     Bottom line is how we're handling life-ending crimes in our culture.  
     We incarcerate or incinerate (alliterative leeway taken here).  We 
     DON'T seem to rehabilitate except where it's the earnest desire of the 
     offending individual.
     
     Here's the Extropian part:
     
     With the advent of new technology (prior to the all-bets-are-off 
     Singularity thing okay?), is it more "appropriate" to:
     
     * pay for their wastoid incarceration (via tax dollars)
     * pay for their somehow grossly expensive execution/appeal processes
     * give them the option to biologically be reprogrammed as a civil 
     servant <G>
     
     Okay, a little joke, but biological reprogramming is the gist.  What 
     behooves a cooperative society most efficiently, particularly one 
     currently driven by our economic structure?
     
     And the last notion, executing children.  There have been some 
     abhorrent crimes committed by children of late.  I, for one, refuse to 
     justify their actions simply because they are young.  Western 
     children, perhaps even the least educated, are likely exposed to more 
     information by their prepubescent years than most Eastern Europeans 
     prior to WWII were in their entire lives.  But the question of 
     execution applies to the previous point I make in this post.
     
     As I mentioned, there are interesting tangents regarding sexual age of 
     consent.  In this information-rich age, when do we DECIDE that 
     children are accountable?  
     
     Does information bring about discernment and rationality?

     or so unborn children who are executed every year.?.....nawwwwwww..
     
     Rick Knight responds:
     
     Me thinks a nerve is thus exposed in our traveling Texan.  "Execution" 
     in terms of abortion is a horse of a different color with gobs of 
     offshoots that I'm sure have their Extropian angle but you'd have to 
     carefully position it so.  Otherwise, it's the same ol' debate.
     
     BTW, for the record, I am anti-abortion *and* pro-choice.  It's weird 
     but I've wedged it into my belief system in a way where I'm comfy.  I 
     used "acocuntability" as my wrench to tighten it in.  I've already had 
     to deal with abortion and it was anything BUT comfy.  I can tell you 
     that the sanctity one holds for a gestating human life can be quickly 
     comprimised by the threat of someone outside your family carelessly 
     destroying the relations of those within it.  To have chosen the life 
     of that unborn would've been to have sealed that connection 
     biologically or socially...neither of which was acceptable. 
     
     The decision to abort a child brings up feelings akin to racism, 
     classism, and negative emotions you didn't even know could manifest.  
     It was a purging but growing experience for me as a passive 
     participant (the somewhat unwilling support person).  But it is not a 
     simple issue and certainly not easily clumped together with the 
     execution of capital criminals.

     Certainly not because it wasn't going to be such a profound and 
     strangely curious and inticing event but because I was *implicitly* 
     forbidden to dream about/imagine it.  In doing so, one was easily 
     dismissed because their dreams were so small, their imaginations so

     "scientific beauty" compels me to ask what part "beauty" and our 
     fundamental instinct of attraction towards the symmetrical combination 
     of power and elegance play in our advance towards the transhuman era.  
     If the Singularity is even remotely painted as something

     Rick, kindly cease from using provocative language: 'flame wars' are

     Rick Knight responds:
     
     Rather than address this in a private e-mail, let me first say that it 
     wasn't my intention to start a flame war although your posts as a rule 
     do tend to find me patting my pockets for a lighter.  And speaking of 
     "lighter", please lighten up.  This is a digest of *ideas* and if you 
     don't like the ones I express, try to look at the source of that 
     dissatisfaction rather than as some guy (me) as your perceived enemy 
     which is *flaming* you in some personally damaging way.  
     
     A veiled threat such as your last statement prompts me to keep this 
     discussion public because if my credit goes whacko all of a sudden, 
     I'd like an audit trail of where that dysfunction may have originated. 
      
     The moral of the story is that it is unwise to threaten people without 
     just cause.  It causes them to be defensive unnecessarily.  The verb 
     "burn" in conjunction with human beings is usually regarded as a bad 
     thing.  Unless I am to assume you are limiting your countermeasure to 
     verbal assaults (which I don't publically respond to and I have a very 
     thick skin), your response was inappropriate because the only thing I 
     might've said that could be remotely interpreted as hostile was to 
     refer to your post as a "rant".
     
     As for a response to your questions about the mating rituals of 
     American teachers and their students, Sarah pretty much covered the 
     topic adequately for me.  Thanks Sarah.

Oops. So scrape together several Earth-size masses, and perform a 
sequence of slingshots, within a few hours of each other. For an average
10 km/s, need 20 Earths. Some heating from tidal deformations.

Yes, this adds integral(M*v^2/2) of energy, with M= bomb+intercepted mass,
and v= relative intercept velocity.

You can't arbitrarily eliminate the "more" between 2 and 3.
Agreeing more is not equivalent to agreeing.

The sentence cannot be resolved by cancelling the negatives.  If it could,
it wouldn't be so beautiful.

Okay, here's my idea:

Take a large, but not too large, sheet of ice.  Attach a block of ice to one
side of the sheet.  Frozen inside this block is the bomb.  Now, send this into
the sun, with the bomb on the side facing away.

The sheet of ice acts as a lightsail.  As the bomb gets close to the sun, the
lightsail evaporates while slowing the fall.  Ideally, the lightsail should
disappear at about the same time the bomb touches the "surface" of the sun.

Some additional notes:

If ice evaporates too fast, we can use a metal of some other melting point instead.

If we put a fast-evaporating core of material, either into the light sail or
the bomb box, then when the lightsail finally evaporates, the material will
puff up, kick the bomb back for a final slowdown, and act as an insulating
vapor cushion.

All that ice helps keep the bomb cool.

We can spin the whole circular lightsail to keep it from turning away.

I think Robin Hanson answered it quite well with his "Great Filter" 
essay: if it turns out that there is life (even very simple) 
elsewhere, it tells us something important about how the universe
looks in general. If life is hardy and can easily evolve, it ought to
be everywhere. If so, why the Fermi paradox? Is there something
*dangerous* out there?.

See http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html

And I wouldn't underestimate the impact of knowing there is life
elsewhere. The zealots shrugged their shoulders when Newton suggested
his mechanics, but it undermined their views by showing a clockwork
universe that didn't need divine intervention. If we live on a fairly
normal planet in an universe filled with life or if we are utterly
alone in a vast emptiness, doesn't that change the *feel* of things?

I am sorry that you had this experience, but if you are going to 
contest my statement, contest it in full.  I made it very clear in 
the sentence following my statement above that adults should step 
into a situation that is dangerous for the child.  Your example does 
nothing to obviate the need for crucial socialization into 
assertiveness skills, and I also never stated that a home schooling 
parent could not provide those settings necessary for that type of 
development.  

Also, one need not "throw onto a playground" any child for that child 
to encounter bullies or other threatening types, and certainly some 
sort of training is necessary for every child to deal with bad 
situations.  But I think that is a highly obvious point and not worth 
discussing in detail.

Lots of things can be argued, but the notion that children, arbitrarily
defined, are either chattel of the parents or chattel of the state, and
that the former view "would have to be the libertarian position" is 
seriously troubling to me.

I'd like to believe that some system could come into being where a person
of whatever age who demonstrates ability to self govern is invited to do
so... but demonstrates to whom? and when? and how? ...with what appeal?

The issue is one that I find very sticky. 
And I am no great lover of the State.

It's a good thing you're not saying that. :)

Wouldn't it be a kick?  Our loveable lords and masters...bless their greedy

I surprised to hear such a comment coming from the Extropian mailing list.
 Why would we need to sink more research on Earth, where we already have
billions sunk--for all of human history?  People in every country, without
exception, have never had a better life.   Life on Earth has had a good run
of research funding improving conditions.  It's about time we look out wards.
  We have sunk enough money on this little planet.   "Come back" signals?
 That would be fantastic too, even if it came from microscopic life forms.
  Remember WE are also "microscopic life forms."  We are a colony of about a
trillion cells who don't know they are part of us.  How do we know the
microscopic life forms we find on other planets are not part of a larger
organism?  Also, think of these hostile extra-Earthly environments and how
the exobiological processes we discover will teach us how to adapt to those
environments.  I want to get off this Earth as soon as possible.  Earth was a
nice warm little nest for babies.  Now, sooner or later we should grow up,
become adults, and leave the nest.

Any idea what this fellow means by "cohort"?  I've always understood it to
mean the group of people sharing a birth-year.  Does this mean 5% per year?
 I'd like to believe that it does, but this seems very optimistic.

Actually, I do have a good idea of what real depression is, although
I have not had the misfortune of experiencing it personally. When I
used the expression "felt depressed" above, I did not mean depressed
in the clinical DSM-IV way, but depressed in the everyday sense
(which is dreadfully common). Anton is of course correct in pointing
out that cognitive tricks like the one I described doesn't work as
well for clinical depression as for normal feelings of depression
(although similar ideas are used quite successfully in cognitive
therapy).

I'm happy to hear that. I think this demonstrates the most important
thing with curing depression: it is a vicious circle, and if you can
get out of it you have a good chance of staying out of it. Whether
the tools of breaking the vicious circle are biochemical or cognitive
doesn't really matter, use whatever works best. 

IMHO the debate about drugs vs. psychology is silly; both are ways of
influencing the same complex neurochemical cognitive patterns in our
brains, and I don't subscribe to the idea that drugs or therapies
just cure the symptoms. In the mind feedback often makes symptoms
into causes.

As I said, most people who hold this belief seem caught up in the myth of
"childhood innocence". You seem to be under the impression that kids are
somehow rational, civilised people with whom you can "negotiate
disputes", and ignore the rather obvious fact that most kids are far more
vicious and irrational than most adults.

Of course, in my experience the adults would do no such thing. Either
they believed, as you do, that kids should be left to fend for
themselves, or they just couldn't care less. None of our complaints to
teachers had any long-term effect on the vicious thugs, and in many cases
made the situation worse by giving them a reason to 'get even' with us.

The only reliable method we found to deal with them was to throw a knife
at their leader's head (which would, of course, have got us in deep shit
if they'd reported it to any teachers); they stopped messing with us
after that. Frankly I can't think of anything worse for a kid than to put
them in a situation where they're threatened daily by vicious thugs, can
do nothing whatsoever about it without potentially getting into real
trouble themselves, and can't even get an adult to help.

I agree that a home-schooling parent probably couldn't provide the
settings required to learn such "moron management" skills. I strongly
disagree that I or any kid of mine have a need for such skills. What they
need is experience of dealing with the kind of reasonably civilised and
rational adults who they will be working with in the future. What better
way to do that than to spend time with those kind of adults?

So send them on a martial arts or Practical Pistol course, where they can
learn those skills without being beaten up by vicious thugs. Otherwise,
to take your comments to their logical conclusion, we should drop our
kids off in Watts at an early age and let them find their own way home.
If any of them don't come back, well, that's just "evolution in action".

Have you looked at:  knee supports, chiropractic, acupuncture, ...?

What does your doctor say?  And if he/she just says "Here, take these...",

All antidepressants are not created equal.  Even all SSRIs are not
created equal.  When I found the right one, I had more energy as well
as a greater sense of well-being.  Adding DHEA (for me) also helped.
I started taking them not because I was severely depressed, but because
I felt my mind wasn't working as well as I thought it should.

Not being depressed is only halfway (or less) to the goal.

BTW -- I recently took a follow-up set of cognitive tests (first set taken
about 8 months ago, when I'd just started on antidepressants), and it seems
that on the cocktail of supplements that my doctor has prescribed, my
mental functioning has improved more than can be accounted for by
practice effects.

Hmm, for concretness, let's assue you are the size of a house. With 
nanotech, the time it takes to assemble sufficient TNT to blow a 
house to pieces would be much less than the time it would take to 
move the house.
	Ok, so you put wheels on your house, or wings and a jet engine. But 
the aggressor could do the same; and at least today, small missiles 
can usually catch up with big warplanes. Or even better: He could 
build TNT all over the place to begin with, so you have nowhere to 
go.
	Perhaps he can't build TNT all over the place, because there are 
other people living there, secluded within their own walls. We can 
call this the bee-hive scenario; there are still independent, 
humanoid beings, and each has her own cell, the cells being packed 
side by side in a three dimensional structure. The surface of hive 
is a heat emitter and energy collector... No, I need to think this 
through before I write about it. I might do a nanotech strategies 
paper when I have finished the ones I am working on now (one of which

Why design *and* evolve? I mean, obviously they would evolve if we 
first design one version and then an improved version; but why would 
they evolve in the sense we were discussing, i.e. by sexual 
reproduction and natural selction? If there is an advantage in having 
a system that is unknown to your enemy, then change the design often,

I would find it very interesting if you could expand a bit on this.

OK, you have a point. But a TNT attack is quite noticeable, and is
likely to make not just me but a lot of my friends, neighbors and
people in general react; the offender would have to deal with this. 
But this is the ordinary weapons control problem (admittedly tricky),
not the more interesting (and IMHO far more dangerous) problem of
designing a nanotech immune system.

I think someone might have beaten you to it. When I was fairly young,
I read a book about all the readical possibilities predicted by
science in the early 70's (I forget the name, the author might have
been Russian. And yes, it has influenced me profoundly!), and it
mentioned a very similar scenario. The whole world is paved with
a huge 2000-story building covering all the continents, and the
oceans are algae-farms. Inside the building, people live in small
cubicles and communicate using phone and television (OK, it is a 70's
scenario). The problem of heat emissions was mentioned. 

A somewhat similar idea can be found in _A Torrent of Faces_ by Blish
and Knight.

Design is good at jumping over deserts in the fitness landscape,
while evolution is good at searching it. If you combine occasional
re-design with evolution, you can add optimizations and clever tricks
to the powerful abilities of evolutionary programming. There will be
a certain overhead, but it is an overhead for your immune-computer
not for your design capabilities.

Nanodevices might be able to out-compete organic life, since they
could be indigestible while organics are perfectly good feedstock.
But intelligent systems communicating with each other are likely
quite good at resisting attacks from low-level systems, be they
bacteria or goo, since they can (at a sufficiently high level of
technology) develop solutions, be they vaccines, immune processors or
antibiotics using cultural evolution, which is faster than biological
evolution and able to make deliberate leaps in fitness space. 

As an example, assume the worst scenario happens and an escaped badly
programmed dishwashing nanite starts to turn all organic life into
more of itself. It will spread with the speed of an bacterial
infection, and be quite deadly. Of course, as soon as this becomes
known there will be several groups who quickly enclose themselves in
their already built underground bases (Cheyenne mountain is an
example that exists today, and with this level of nanotech I think
there will be more "nanosurvivalists" waiting for the disaster). So
while the biosphere turns to dishwashing goo there will be people
around who are very motivated to find a weapon against it, for
example a tailored "predator nanite" or something similar. It doesn't
appear likely that the goo could wipe out all the people (just a very
large amount of them), and then it would just evolve in an ordinary
way while the survivors were quite busy dealing with it (or adapt
themselves to it, creating a new nano-based biosphere through
"reverse terraforming").

The IRA have been blowing up large parts of London with ammonium nitrate
for decades. Even with such monitoring and oppressive laws they still blow
up London on a fairly regular basis.

'Basement Nukes' from Loompanics Unlimited contains various recipes for
nerve poisons. I'm surprised noone has transcribed that onto the Net yet.

That depends; even if you can't buy enriched fissionables directly, a
modern uranium-purifying plant would be a tiny fraction of the size of the
Manhattan Project, particularly if you were willing to trade size for time
(e.g. a plant of half the size would take twice as long to build a bomb).
Any well-funded terrorist group who wanted a nuke could probably build
one, and as governments poke their noses deeper into our affairs, more and
more people will have the desire to do so; indeed, nukes are far more
useful to non-territorial groups than they are to governments, because MAD
doesn't work if you can't nuke the opposition. 

Personally I'll be surprised if we don't see at least one major city nuked
by 2010. I'll be even less surprised if the current rush towards a world
government continues.

The biggest problem I can think of with Home tuition, is not the lack of
association with other children, but the lack of freedom a child has in his
or her own home.  When would the child unleash his or her anger?  When will
they have the chance to learn the importance of rebellion?  And how can we
stop a child's parents from imprinting dogmatic views?  Children are an
important part of progress, and some of the thing's parents find wrong are
the very things that aid that progress.

Also, couldn't constant contact with adult's lead to an inferiority complex?
 Isn't there something to be said for sharing discovery with others, rather
than the "yes, yes I know" attitude of adults?

And then there's you, with your _slightly unconventional_ quoting.  Perhaps a

Thanks, I don't want to be doing things that have already been done.  I was
thinking of selling to banks, with multiple layers of redundancy and backup
it might be able to save some of those billions of dollars that get lost
every year (for a percentage, of course ;-).  Now where did I put that

The environment is created by us and as such is a product of our system.
 Think of it as a post-human womb, where our children receive enough
'mind-food' to be able to cope with the highly competitive post-human society
that awaits them.

It made perfect sense when I wrote it.  I don't think I can really explain
the meaning of the quoted sentence without inventing a new language.  What we
need is a new language capable of transmitting the model of an idea.  Your
computer can translate it in a way you and only you would understand, with
hyperlinks to the various thoughts and memories leading up to the original
idea.  English is so faulted.

Alternatively, I could take a creative writing course!

Actually I discriminate according to race, gender, creed, colour, and body
language.  Which kind of makes my above statement loose the little merit it
had!  But I didn't mean individuals discriminating as a basis of choosing who
to give credence to, which I'm all for.  It's the idea of non-critical
discrimination, discrimination without merit that I oppose.

Maybe critical-discrimination should be a part of the extropian principles!?

Again, crossed wires.  When I hear the word 'program' I hear 'dogma'.  I
don't think conversation is programming because it's subjective and
multidirectional.  Programming sounds like hard coding.

These posts have made me realise something.  This is no longer about skin
colour, gender or sexuality - it's about words.  It's about what meaning we
each take out of words, and our failure to communicate what we really want to
say.  I'm optimistic (dynamically, of course) that we'll find way to share
our thoughts.  And then, even if we don't get along, at least we'll
understand why.

     With the advent of two-way fiber optic telecommunications, I think it 
     would behoove us to start forming small collectives.  Not every parent 
     wishes to work outside the house and there are certainly a number of 
     adults with a desire to instruct and assist young minds as they grow.
     
     Wouldn't it be grand if we could have small neighborhood home schools 
     with maybe six kids using the TV, PC, even the Nintendo as interactive 
     tools to get information?  As laptops become more the norm, it could 
     become as common a school supply as a compass or ruler (over 
     simplification alert, I know).  I'm speaking of those parents with the 
     capability of organizing such groups.  It compels us to personalize 
     education, get along better with one another, negotiate disputes not 
     only between children's conflicts but parents.  We tend to have such a 
     "take our toys and go home" attitude in this culture when we don't get 
     our way.  The art of comprimise is woefully lacking.
     
     Even as an adult, my desire to learn is greatly stimulated by the 
     information becoming more and more available on the Internet.  In the 
     mind of a conscientious child, how much more would that desire be 
     present?
     
     There are all kinds of negative factors to discuss along with this: 
     the dysfunctional child that doesn't respond to reason or discipline, 
     the inequality that stems from those in a class with access to hi-tech 
     and those in the poorer classes that don't.  But as far as 
     Extropian-minded individuals and their children, I think banding 
     together and forming small educational groups for their kids would be 
     a good start towards taking back control of education, which at least 
     in the public sector, seems to be very mismanaged, disoriented by 
     crime and social dysfunction and poorly funded.

In my experience, much 'real depression' comes from getting into an
internal loop, worrying continuously about things you can't change. I used
to do that a lot, but these days if it's something I can't change I just
don't worry about it and get on with things. Hence I'm happy most of the
time.

Wax,

The things that you find wrong with home schooling are exactly the reason 
so many people chose to have home schooling. Lack of rebellion, the chance 
to impart core values and control over some to the influences that these 
parents fear from the education system will always provide the basis for 
continued interest in home schooling.

However, I also know that one of our friends gave up home schooling because 
the kids were driving her nuts. You might say that the kids were home 
schooling the mom.

 What is this statement based on? >> 
 
Well, spore do not have a validated stability of millions of years in space.
 Spores *do* have a long survival.  Some one on the list found data that
spores survived with out count reduction in viability on the Moon.  The
spores were recovered by a manned space mission, I believe.   Since spores
are very inert hostile environments kill very few spores (e.g., _Bacillus_).
 Even cosmic/gamma ray damage would probably be negligible for things like
_Deinococcus radiodurans_ and _D. radiophilus_,  , _Agrobacterium
radiobacter_ (formerly _Bacillus radiobacter_), _Micrococcus radiodurans_,
_Arthrobacter radiotolerans_, Radiococcus radiodurans_.   And then the
thermophilic bacteria are usually spore formers too as are the hydrogen
peroxide resistance bacteria.  All of these have injury repair mechanisms
that I have done research on for for the past ten years.  I am trained in
environmental microbiology (bacteria, yeast, mold, etc.), hostile
environments, microbial ecology, adaptation to stress, mixed cell/multicell
interaction biofilm type "organisms", etc. 
 
Also bacteriospores once activated, have DNA repair enzyme systems--so even
if there is a great count reduction in viable spores, only a few survivors
could repopulate the whole colony.

Yep...lots of things can be argued...but it seems that they gotta be one or

Seems that's why the name "children"...when one ceases to be of that category

For starters, not living at the bottom of a really large gravity well

I don't make statements of belief on this list, and I never trade in 
myth.  My post was based on the basic textbook theory found in the 
fields of childhood psychology, early socialization theory, and group 
dynamics.  The literature in these fields gives short shrift to the 
subjective concept of "innocence".

Again, I am sorry for your bad experiences as a child, and I think 
that most of us can share the same type of story.  I do not, however, 
equate that experience with general childhood disputes.  The learning
of basic negotiation skills is a vital component to any child's 
development, to the extent that most childhood development books will 
devote at least a chapter to it.  As for your 'obvious fact' above, I 
would ask that you provide some definite support for that statement, 
outside of your personal experience, in order to consider it a 
general truism.

>as a greater sense of well-being.  Adding DHEA (for me) also helped.

I think that the topic of depression can be an important one for questing, 
hyper-intelligent, growth oriented individuals who can sometimes feel 
stymied by their environments, and I thank you for your openness in 
discussing your meds program.  I have a question:  Does the DHEA help 
the antidepressants work better, or are its effects related more to your 
general health?

>I started taking them not because I was severely depressed, but because
>I felt my mind wasn't working as well as I thought it should.

I wish you could have been in on Anders' and my brief conversation
at the conference regarding mental function and antidepressants, and 
I hope that you or others will provide some input now.  The story in
brief:  As a young, questioning, somewhat rebellious woman growing 
up in the deep south, and, yes, experiencing occasional depression, I 
was put under the care of a physician who put me on every existing 
neurotransmitter drug, sometimes two or three at a time, for several 
years.  (These drugs are not used anymore, considered too crude and 
dangereous with the development of the SSIs.)  

The negative results:  reduced ability to memorize concrete data, and 
periods of reduced focus, serious damage to my immune system.  
The positive results:  acquired ability to parallel process, greater 
speed in processing input, occasional intense 'brain burn' breakthroughs 
in conceptual thought. 

What I am trying to figure out, and am open to serious suggestions on, 
is how to retain the positive aspects while improving the negative.  My 
goals:  increased focus and greater ability to memorize concrete data. 
The one nootropic expert I spoke to suggested that I was forced into the 
effects of nootropics too fast and should hold off on trying them.  Most 
of the literature surrounding nootropics seems to concentrate on 
'speeding up' the thought process, whereas I am more interested in 
'refining'.  And I certainly don't recommend anyone dumping these 
neuro drugs into their systems, because the physical effects are 
simply not worth the mental effects--it nearly killed me and it took 
years to clean out.  But I am open to suggestions here!

	the question here is : do we accept the old systems because they

	etc.), ignoring the the thousands of years of wars, rape, and
	strife caused directly or indirectly by christianity?  should
	i raise them as christians just because that's how it's always
	been done in my family?

	or, for that matter, let's say that i was homosexual and i end
	up with a child through some means.  i want to raise this child.
	should i ditch my life partner and marry a member of the opposite

I didn't say they "own themselves"--but I am not positive they don't.

OK, first, some background:

I consider myself principled (these days), and one of the principles I try
to maintain is the non-initiation of force or violence. This doesn't make
me a pacifist, of course--non-initiation is distinct from non-employment.
It does mean that if I'm ever again in loco parentis, I'll do all I can to
keep from using corporal punishment, especially the severe kind. I wince
when I see people who've clearly screwed up in that regard, and are
programming their kids to be poor at handling their lives--but I don't
scoop them up and rescue them, because I *can't*. This doesn't mean I don't
feel the urge. And it doesn't mean I'm holier-than-those parents, and it
doesn't mean there aren't some kids (boys, probably) who don't "need" a
"touch of the hickory" to "get their attention"--I just hope I never have
to raise one. That may be a foolish hope; perhaps some day I'll find that out.

>Seems that's why the name "children"...when one ceases to be of that category
>then one is responsible  for(i.e. "owns") oneself. The boundry of that
>classification being defined by culture, law etc.

"culture, law etc." covers a lot of ground. In Rome it was permissible to
put one's slave to torture or death. Yet in Rome a slave could buy his
freedom; this almost never happened in the antebellum South. 

My point is, in part, that the boundary of that classification remains
badly defined. 

Me, I'd like to see a world where a person of any age could qualify for
full adulthood--_all rights, all the time, all at once_... but I don't see
that in the cards. If it were, kids with sufficient motivation could
qualify to move out of a hellhole (if _THEY_ thought that was what it was)
and move into, say, a special youth-hostel-style quasi-commune-condo
(commercially run at a profit, naturally) to continue their own maturation
minus the hell. Now that's what *I* call child support.

As I said, I don't see that in the cards--and I don't know how such a
system could be fairly administered via The State, which currently *does*
intervene inappropriately and monopolistically.

I think I understand where you're coming from. I too tend to prefer minding
my own business.
However, by your logic, every one of those 3 million you mentioned earlier
in this thread is "none of your business". I'm not trying for a cheap
rhetorical point, here, I'm trying to point out that it's a serious matter,
and as I said, sticky...

>I and society...have no moral athority to intervene. The most I can do is
>disapprove....and/or disassociate myself with that person and his
>activities....I think the Jews used a technique...shunning....towards similar
>ends....in times past.

So did some of the Romans toward other Romans who mistreated their slaves.
It only has any effect when reputation matters.

I say I _have_ some moral obligation (not "authority") to intervene if
things are bad enough. 
I say that because I feel that children are not just property, they're
people-in-training, cadet people, and because if I were a kid in some
circumstances I would _want_ a third party to rescue me, to "steal me" from
my "rightful owners". But I'm not sure where the line is. And I'm not in
favor of delegating the action to some faceless civil servant acting under
color of a spurious authority.

Consider the following two cases:

I recall a situation where two sub-teen boys beat and eventually mangled
(using a railroad train) a younger boy. Somewhere in all that, the
four-year-old victim died. Before that, he was in obvious distress in front
of witnesses, none of whom intervened. Since all three are someone else's
child, I take it it should be none of my business should I see such a thing
happen--barring of course shunning the parents? Or, since they were not
fully human, would it be appropriate for me to shoot the 9-year-old and the
7-year-old out of hand, the way I might a pair of feral dogs?

More directly: there was the case of the woman who strapped her two kids in
the car and sent the car on a little swim, because she had the impression
that they were the only thing standing in the way of her relationship with
a man who wasn't sure he was ready to be a father. If the kids were her
property, ditching the car is the same as ditching the car plus kids,
right? Property is property.
Then again, by rights of salvage, once she abandoned them, anyone who
rescued or recovered them would be their owner, right?

Here we are "in violent agreement".

My point remains that children are a tough one to be single-principled
about, for me, anyway... and there are some people who _aren't_ fit to be
parents... and I continue to wish I could do something about it. I'm _not_
saying I want the _state_ to do something about it. It boils down to "am I
my brother's keeper?"... and the answer that comes to me is "it depends".
And I wish it didn't, because it would make my life easier.

Now, if duelling were legal, someone who cared could call bad parents
out... ( 1/2 :) )

ObExtropianContent:
One can conceive of an explicit contract-based system of genuine "child
support" in the true sense, with potential parents agreeing to binding
arbitration if their kids object to the way they're being brought up, but I
don't know how well it'd catch on--what's the parent's motivation? IMO,
this turns out to have some connection with the "when is it all right to
abuse an AI?" thread.

Uh, comets hit the Earth because it's large and its gravity pulls them
towards it. In comparison, an O'Neill-style habitat is a tiny target. 

Interestingly, I was watching a documentary about Jupiter recently where
Gene Shoemaker (I think) was claiming that without a large gas giant in
the system to 'hoover up' comets events like the dinosaur extinction would
be so common that sentient life could not have evolved on Earth. If true,
this could be another reason why life seems so rare in the universe.

Been there...done that...have successfully raised a boy...now 25..HE (and his

But isn't rebellion the very reason we're all here, instead of at church?

People in the area of research of computing in eduation have found that
dysfunctional children and children with learning difficulties take to
computers easier than those without.  It has also been found that children in
non-technical societies (third world countries) take to computing as easily
as those from high-tech societies.  It seems, as ever, computers are the
great equaliser.  Except in cost, what if our libraries started loaning
computers?

Certain highly religious groups?  The ones that use a many thousand year old
belief system?  Do we really want kids to share the beliefs of adults word
for word?  Or do we want kids that will challenge our ideas?

Gangs are great things, they beat down Big Brother (who I know you hate) and
help create the freemarket (read "drugs and guns").  I always feel safe in
the knowledge that there's crime on our streets, it means we still have some
control.

"God made men equal...but Colonel Colt made them free".....or something like

Jobs...

As for the cost...it's getting there...project a little while into the future
and what will a multimedia net capable computer cost?  I dunno...but a whole
lot less than it does now...which is about the cost of a console type color
tv I think...(been a long time since I bought a tv...so im not sure)

Don't think It'd be cost effective for libraries to loan computers...they
break easier than books...and library books are pretty badly damaged even
now.

Government sharpshooter "was aiming at the other guy" and missed...hitting
and killing instead mother with infant in arms. Charged with involuntary
manslaughter.

Citizen attacked from ambush by government agents...returns fire in self
defense ....killing one agent...is charged with first degree murder.

 18 year old goat herder killed from ambush by U.S. Marines while tending
goats on family farm...marines not charged with anything.

And it goes on and on and on and on....I drive a truck...as I may have
mentioned...and I travel the 48 states and parts of Canada...I listen to
radio a lot...during my travels I hear this kinda stuff repeatedly....only I
hear about a lot more than makes the national news...like that case in Ohio
where the BATF broke in..caused injury to the wife such that she
aborted...then left...sorry...wrong house.  Or the other "Waco" that occurred
in Ohio...several dead...no national news coverage.

What are we gonna do?

BTW, for those who have not heard, Gene Shoemaker died this summer, in
an auto accident while doing field work in Australia.  Shoemaker was a
well known and articulate astronomer/geologist/planetary scientist, most
famous for discovering comet Shoemaker-Levy, which crashed spectacularly
into Jupiter in 1994.  He had made his mark earlier by establishing the
extraterrestrial origin of Meteor Crater, near Winslow, Arizona.

My wife took an intro geology class from Shoemaker when she was in college,
and he had always been one of her favorite instructors.

The Seattle Times, Today's Top Stories:   http://www.seatimes.com

Director's vicious story gets him in hot water


Entertainment News

Copyright 1997 The Seattle Times Company

Friday, Aug. 22, 1997

by John Hartl

Seattle Times movie reviewer

     Chad, the evil white-collar executive Aaron Eckhart plays in Neil 
     LaBute's "In the Company of Men," is so willfully destructive he hopes 
     his latest victim will reach for sleeping pills once he's through with 
     her.

     In the opening scenes, Chad and his pushover pal Howard (Matt Malloy) 
     set out to seduce Christine (Stacy Edwards), a deaf office worker. Their 
     goal: to simultaneously dump her and avenge themselves on women in 
     general.

     When LaBute and Eckhart attended the premiere of the movie at the 
     Sundance Film Festival last January, they weren't prepared for the 
     on-the-street reaction afterwards. Although it received a Sundance 
     filmmaker's trophy in the drama category, some accused the film itself 
     of being misogynistic and cruel.

     "Women would come up to Aaron and say, `I hate you,' " said LaBute when 
     he brought the movie to the Seattle International Film Festival in May 
     (it opens for a regular run here today). "Of course he'd remind them 
     that `Yyou don't hate me, you hate the character.' "

      LaBute thinks one reason Chad is so despised is that the story line 
      doesn't provide an obvious punishment for him or tie everything up 
      neatly.

     "That's when you've signed your death warrant," said LaBute, who 
     welcomes controversy. "Polarizing opinion is no worry to me. There's no 
     right or wrong answer to a film. My most feared responses are `That was 
     interesting' or `That was different.' "

     LaBute set out to create a yin-yang relationship between the handsome, 
     aggressive Chad and the unassertive Howard, who goes along with the plan 
     but eventually wants out. As the story gradually shifts to Christine's 
     point of view, their scheming looks increasingly obsessive and pathetic.

     "For drama's sake you create types of a sort," said LaBute. "Chad is the 
     poster boy for the one side you're trying to distill. People are a 
     little taken aback by him; they're hoping he's actually fallen for her. 
     They don't know what a viper he is; they don't understand his need for 
     control.

     "The way they begin it, it's almost a lark. You want him to be a better 
     guy than he is. And Chad has an advantage: The beautiful people get a 
     little more rope in life."

     Eckhart is an old college friend who has appeared in several of LaBute's 
     plays as well as the upcoming Kevin Kline movie, "In and Out." LaBute 
     cast him because he could make the character ambiguous sexually and 
     otherwise, suggesting "15 reasons for what he's done."

     He thinks Chad is "not unlike a serial killer. He has to take things 
     closer and closer to the edge, asking `How's that feel?' He has to know 
     how the pain feels, and he's going to take this too far at some point. 
     There's a synapse there that isn't firing emotionally."

     At the same time, he feels a kinship with the character.

     "Chad is in me, he's in everybody, I think. I've met people as bad as 
     Chad, though they had none of the charm."

     LaBute believes that reluctant identification with the charismatic Chad 
     could be a reason for the angry response, although initially he doubted 
     that the script would have that kind of appeal. He shot it in less than 
     two weeks on a tiny budget.

     "I didn't know there'd be an audience for it," said Labute, though he 
     did guess it when Sundance called to talk about showing it. "Then you 
     know you have a topic for discussion."

     He sees the script as an outgrowth of his stage work: "Betrayal is a 
     subject I keep returning to in my plays, which tend to be a little 
     darker in spirit than most."

     LaBute, a 34-year-old Mormon who met Eckhart at Brigham Young 
     University, spent his formative years in the Northwest.

     Born in Detroit, he was a child when his parents moved to Spokane, where 
     he spent the next 15 years. He once worked at the city's best-known art 
     house, the Magic Lantern theater, visiting Seattle to see foreign films 
     that never crossed the mountains. He was a movie buff even as a child.

     "I have to credit my mother for that," said LaBute. "She's always been a 
     voracious reader and film watcher. The first thing I can remember is 
     waking up in the middle of `Gone With the Wind' at the Dishman theater 
     in Spokane. The red was so overwhelming."

     After high school, LaBute attended three universities, enrolled in the 
     graduate dramatic writing program at New York University, wrote several 
     plays ("Lepers," "A Gaggle of Saints") and moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., 
     where he lives with his wife and two children.

     "I always created quickly," he said. "Money (for film production) was 
     what I didn't have. With theater you could work much more rapidly."

     Eventually he was able to raise enough to shoot "In the Company of Men," 
     which is essentially a three-character story designed around a 
     minimalist budget.

     "Casting was done with literally just three phone calls," he said. 
     "Aaron always wanted to do something with me, Stacy had done a play of 
     mine, and Matt I knew. I knew they had theater training, and I knew we 
     had only 11 days."

     Abandoning the vogue for MTV-style cutting, LaBute's movie consists 
     mostly of long takes that allow the actors to develop more sustained 
     performances.

     "They knew there was no way to cheat," said LaBute. "I'm a big hater of 
     establishing shots and inserts. Editing is a lie anyway. And I'm a big 
     fan of actors and what they can do. I can sit and watch two people talk 
     forever as long as the talk is good."

Thanks for answering my question.  This is facinating, I continue to be 
impressed that "simpler" forms of life are so tenaciously adaptable.  

Which (if any) of the creatures you know of can survive long term in a
very high vacuum (say, under 10^-9 torr) at 3 degrees kelvin?  Presumably,
most all water would be gone.  Of course, things might hide inside a rock
for much longer, with the pressure being much higher. 

Do you know of any books or papers specifically discussing the survival of 
organisms over extremely long time-spans?

I'll just give you the left-wing, Dutch pinko view on this stuff and if you
want to flame me to crisp ... that is your right as a free entity.
Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number
of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.
If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,
cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.
In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.
our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).
Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the private
ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns and such has
something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that between 1965 and 1975
more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in the US (10 for every American
killed in 'nam).
For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a
governement that you at least trust a little bit.
Seems to work out more or less here ...

If the US governement is as F*%$#-up as you seem to believe (I woulnd't
know, being on this side of the atlantic), why not get a new one? Last time
I heard the US was a democracy.

Mick, in spite of the fact that I don't always agree with you, I find you
down-to-earth remarks very refreshing (and fun!).

I think there is something that should be pointed out clearly here. 
What you seem to mean is that  genetic algorithms will play an 
important role in designing the immune system. However, what you 
often say is that *evolution* will do that. Now, that is not wrong, 
but I might mislead some people. Although genetic algorithms can be 
said to describe some form of evolution, there is a world of a 
difference between natural, blind, Darwinian evolution and specially 
designed genetic algorithms that can be Darwinian or Laplacian with 
any number of sexes and variable sizes of the property chunks that 
are inherited, where all the parameters can be played with by an 
insightful experimenter who a guids the process with his knowledge 
and overseeing intelligence. These are two separate things, but many 
people tend to confuse them.

evolutionaly computing: designed & controlled
(natural) evolution: blind & controlling

> Design is good at jumping over deserts in the fitness landscape,
> while evolution is good at searching it

This would seem to lead to the prediction that the more that is known 
the less useful will evolutionary computing be.

What do you mean? My desigen capabilities depend on the 
design-programs I run. Since the designs in question are designs for 
immune-defence systems, they would run on the "immune-computer". 
Hence any overhead for the immune-computer is an overhead for my 
design capabilities.

This does not seem to be the worst scenario to me. The worst 
scenario would be something deliberately built to eliminate all 
life. (It would be even worse if it was designed to torture it.)

>starts to turn all organic life

Why just organic life? Why not dead organic substances, earth, etc. 
And is there any good reason why it could not change the earth crust 
into something with a higher binding energy?

Why couldn't it spread much faster? Bacteria are limited to some 
specifid kinds of hosts, the nanites could attack any organic 
material and many inorganic ones too.And if they were deliberately 
designed, they could transform themself to missiles after they had 
eaten enough, and then swoosh accross the seven sees in a very short 
time.

They might have to go there pretty quickly, like after a nuclear 
alert. They will have to make sure that not a single little nanite 
finds a way in. They will have to hope that the nanite doesn't eat 
rocks and cement. They will have a limited time to figure out how to 
use their very limited resources to eliminate a enemy that already 
forms a think deadly layer over the whole earth. They have to hope 
that the nanites weren't deliberately designed to pile up explosives 
on top of their bunker and blow it all away. --Yes, they *could* make 
it, at least in a Hollywood movie...

I'm sorry, but it does seem to me a bit like wishful thinking (and 
reading to much SF?). I think I will call this the 
go-hide-in-your-basement solution to the antiproliferation problem.

The remarks you made seem predicated on the assumption that the 
nanites will be comparable to a particularly virulent biological 
plague. Suppose that this isn't true. Then the only method for 
avoiding disaster in a society where there are many independet 
individuals with full technological access is to have some kind of 
active nanotech immune system. It seems to me that the reactions 
towards higher binding energy would always have an advantage, so in 
this situation there would only be two ways of maintaing status quo.

The first is if all the material were already very close to its 
lowest energy state, so that no more reactions were economical. Does 
anyone have a good design for a computer that would work under those 
circumstances (we would all be uploads then).

The second is to have the immune system quickly eliminating any 
plagues, and it could use the fact that it has access to more energy. 
A good design for this?

Aha, I just thought of a third way. The independent folks could all 
live in a virtual reality that were designed so they could do no 
major harm. They would have no access to the real reality, which 
would be ruled by a single entity.

Very true.  The power of evolutionary computing lies in its blind speed. 
Let's say we have a million-organism brew that evolves for a thousand
generations.  Now let's say we have a hundred thousand programmers, each of
whom chooses an organism out of the stew and redesigns it.  The latter
situation will proceed more slowly than the first, and be vastly more
expensive, but it will also be far more powerful and capable of reaching
loftier goals.

Evolution - in at least one way of doing it - is a vast, random, search tree,
with each branch growing a number of leaves that depends on how profitable
that branch is right now.  An AI might use the same tree, but with
intelligently redesigned versions of each leaf.  Ultimately, guided evolution
and design converge to the same cognitive ability.  How do we ourselves ask
the "What-if?" questions that are key to creative design?  Some kind of
immense semantic search tree - perhaps guided, perhaps not - would be my guess.

Very, very true.  A lot of people on this list seem to lack a deep-seated
faith in the innate perversity of the universe.  I shudder to think what would
happen if they went up against a perverse Augmented human.  Field mice under a
lawn mower.

I'd actually think that the infection would spread in multiple waves.  The
first wave might be small pellets travelling at hypersonic speeds, or even
lightspeed computer viruses travelling to existing replicators.  The second
wave would be a softening-up wave that would reproduce very quickly and at
high speed, taking small bites out of things and leaving third-wave
replicators behind.  The third wave would be immensely destructive, the actual
gray goo.  The fourth wave, if any, would assemble things out of the raw
material thus produced.

Note that these don't need to be different types of replicator.  Each "wave"
could be a different mode of action, evoked by circumstances.

I agree, except that they'll be using nukes, not ordinary explosives.  Or the
nanites could surround the entire compound, lift it into space, and toss it
into the Sun.

Same here.  It's immensely easier to destroy than create.  You couldn't "hide"
from a predatory nanite.  You could slow it down, keep it from getting to your
bunker, surround it with a continuous wall of nuclear flame, and then make
your escape into space and blast the gooey Earth into bits... then try to
rebuild civilization in the new asteroid belt.

But most likely, the nanite would get into your bunker before blossoming.  And
then you're dead.  (Unless you're an upload, but it seems to me that that
issue is for the uploads to worry about.  While this very discussion, on the
other hand, could be read by some genius at Foresight who's made a
breakthrough we haven't been told about.)

Yeah, I noted - and rejected - that possibility, some time ago.  My theory was
that if you said you were going to do THAT, nobody would help you do it.  It
is true that nanotechnology will most likely be controlled by a single entity
or a small group of them.

"Who will guard the guardians?" - maybe nanotechnology would give us a perfect
lie detector.  Nanotechnology in everyone's hands would be just like giving
every single human a complete set of "launch" buttons for the world's nuclear
weapons.  Like it or not, nanotechnology cannot be widely and freely
distributed or it will end in holocaust.  Nanotechnology will be controlled by
a single entity or a small group... just as nuclear weapons are today.

If that entity is benevolent and Libertarian, utility nanites would be
released as they were programmed - to eliminate hunger, starvation, old age,
death, etc.  The world would remain much the same, except most forms of
physically based pain and coercion would be eliminated.  Other utilities might
be more flexible.  No utility will give access to the forbidden molecular
level, but many might give access to higher levels.  People might be able to
edit their synapses or their tissue-level body structure.  (The former
scenario might result in Singularity in fairly short order.)

If that entity is benevolent and authoritarian, we'd probably wind up with the
scenario you just described.  One guy stays in real life, the rest play tennis
in VR.  Life goes on "hold" while everyone waits for the King to do a Singularity.

If that entity is malevolent, immediate and indiscriminate use of nuclear
weapons would be free humanity's only hope of survival.  Humanity can survive
nuclear war and fallout.  It cannot survive molecular warfare.  Just as
nuclear war would utterly destroy the geopolitical balance made of governments
made of humans, so molecular warfare would destroy all humans made of tissues
made of cells made of molecules.

I should note that none of this is proposing a "Divine Right of Kings"
situation.  It is not justification for the King retaining all power.  Power
should still never be in the hands of one person.  It's just that in this
case, the King wouldn't have any choice.  The King remains bound by the usual
ethical restraints, and cannot impose any form of coercion.

And you wrote
 
 I'll just give you the left-wing, Dutch pinko view on this stuff and if you

(Never...disagree <violently...semantically speaking...perhaps>)

 Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number
 of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.
 If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,
 cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.

(Our second amendment to our constitution was intended as a last ditch
defense against tyranny...if everyone owns guns...the government is a bit
reluctant to get too uppity)

 In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.
 our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).
 Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the private
 ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns and such has
 something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that between 1965 and 1975
 more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in the US (10 for every American
 killed in 'nam).

(Interesting fact...in the US...violence tends to vary by locale...more in
inner cities than Rural and interestingly enough...less the closer to Canada
and more the closer to Mexico...I dunno why...but I can guess...be
politically incorrect and be "flamed to a crisp")  (And Mexico bans guns
totally too...and has a VERY high rate of violence..higher than the US...but
we'll blame that on "Poverty")

 For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a
 governement that you at least trust a little bit.

(trust must be earned...in my lifetime it's been betrayed)

 Seems to work out more or less here ...
 
 If the US governement is as F*%$#-up as you seem to believe (I woulnd't
 know, being on this side of the atlantic), why not get a new one? Last time
 I heard the US was a democracy.

(I heard it was a democracy too...I'm beginning to doubt it...less than 15%
of the populance voted for our current president...but there he is...some
democracy...<yeah...I know...voter apathy...more like voter disgust...>)
 
 Mick, in spite of the fact that I don't always agree with you, I find you
 down-to-earth remarks very refreshing (and fun!)....

Any parent who can afford a good TV can afford a high-end 486 or low-end
Pentium PC instead, and these days you have a hard time giving away used
386s (which are far more powerful than the home computers I grew up on);
in fact I suspect that when I upgrade in a few months I'll be giving this
486/66 laptop to a computer-deprived friend because it's barely worth the
hassle of trying to sell. 

Computers are cheap if you avoid the latest and greatest. I read on the
Well a few years ago about a group coordinating famine relief in Africa
with old Commodore Vic-20s and radio modems because the computers were
free; today they could get used 286s or 386s for the same price.

"Police only have an easy job in a police state" - someone or other.

As for 'bigger guns and more of them', how come cops in many European
countries carry submachineguns, yet most US cops only carry pistols? Does
this mean that those European countries have more guns than the US? 

> In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.

The majority of murders in the US occur in a few large cities. Outside
those cities there are many towns or entire states where the murder rate
is no higher than normal for Europe. Those are also the states with the
most relaxed gun laws; at the other end of the scale, Washington DC is
normally the most dangerous US city, yet it has the toughest anti-gun laws
in the country. Isn't that odd?

Back in the 'bad old days' of the Wild West when just about anyone could 
walk into a gun shop and buy a gun with no questions asked, the US murder 
rate was comparable to that in England today (about 1 per 100,000). Why has 
the US murder rate gone up as more and more gun control laws have been 
passed? Can you say 'prohibition'?

Holland has very liberal drug laws. The US has the infamous 'War on
Drugs'. Most murders in the US are literally casualties in that 'War'; and
note that in the last two weeks in England three people were shot dead in
the street in battles between drug-smuggling gangs and two more shot in
battles between beer-smuggling gangs (in fact five more people were shot
today, though noone knows the motive yet). How could that be with Britain's
incredibly tough anti-gun laws?

Oddly, criminologists disagree with your simplistic viewpoint. But here
are a few obvious examples:

In Switzerland most men are required to keep a fully-automatic assault
rifle at home as part of their militia duties. Yet Swiss murder rates are
far lower than the US average. 

In Israel people wander around the streets or even drink in bars with an
M-16 or Uzi slung over their shoulder or a holstered pistol on their belt
(which would be a heinous crime in most of the US). Yet the murder rate in
Israel is lower than the US average. 

Here are two countries where the people don't just possess wimpy handguns 
and shotguns but fully-automatic military weapons. Yet they just don't 
shoot each other. Why?

In Jamaica and Mexico, gun ownership has been banned for years, yet the 
murder rate is several times as high as the US. How come?

That figure is definitely high for deaths, unless it includes suicides and 
killings in self-defence (even then it seems high). Even so, so what? You'd
prefer they had their brains bashed out of their skull with a blunt
object?

And before you come back with some nonsense about how people wouldn't
commit suicide without guns, note that the US suicide rate is rather lower
than in Holland. And if Holland is such a paradise, why do Dutch people
kill themselves so often? 

> For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a

A government which doesn't trust me to own a gun is not a government
which deserves my trust. 

And as a left-winger you might like to research the real reasons behind
past gun control laws; they weren't instigated in Britain because they
were expected to have any effect on crime, but as a means of keeping guns
out of the hands of socialists and communists, and thirty years ago the
American left would have been bemoaning the Californian gun-control laws
passed to disarm the Black Panthers. How soon we forget.

I got the following from a website devoted to home schooling...fits with my
experience
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Think for a moment about what schools really do. They classify and 
segregate children by age and ability, reinforce class, gender and 
racial prejudice, and strip from children the right to any real 
interaction or private life. 


Socialization, in this respect, becomes submitting one's will to that of 
the group (or person in charge). This is not the basis for healthy 
relationships. Home educated children, because they spend so much of 
their time out in the real world, generally are able to communicate well 
with both adults and children and to have friends of all ages. They 
choose to spend time with others because they enjoy their company or 
have a similar interest - just like adults.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Duh!  

Can't allow that to happen...better raise school taxes.

There was a letter to Nature a few months ago that discussed the possiblity
of life spreading throughout the galaxy via the spread of spores. The idea
was that a sizeable impact with Earth, or like body, would put some spores
into space. I can't remember the details, but the idea was that if you
assume a small piece of soot with spores inside you could expect them to
survive millions of years. Once in space they would slowly spread outwards
from the sun under the pressure of solar radiation until they perhaps
reached another solar system and fell to a planet with suitable conditions;
where they could start the process of life all over, or perhaps out compete
whatever organisms had evolved separately.

I disagree. There are *no* entities in the real world even 
remotely resembling "this". What you are describing is a fantasy.
Such a concentration of all existing global legislative powers
into a single organization would itself create a tremendously
irresponsible agent, and it is that agent that would develop
and wield the weapons you fear.

I really don't like to take a conservative stance, but since you
are asking for an alternative that is better than your scenario,
and since I'm pretty sure that since your preferred scenario looks
like a fantasy to me, you will doubtless judge that my preferred
scenario (an agoristic society) is as unrealistic as I think yours
is, I can only propose to you that I think the status quo would
be a preferable alternative to what you are proposing.

It may well happen.  I remember when a four-function calculator cost
more than many TVs do now.  Now they're given away as free gifts and
come in credit-card or watch sizes.  The Toshiba Libretto, which is
about the size of a VCR cartridge, has a Pentium 75 processor, runs
Windows 95, and has 16MB of memory and 770MB of hard disk, costs about
$1700 now.  It's not beyond the pale that such machines might cost less
than a library book within ten years, and get more durable besides.

Real depression is a clinical, not a psychological, phenomenon, quite
different from sadness, though extreme sadness is one of its symptoms.
People with imbalances in their brain chemistry need medicine at least
as much as pep talks.

Memory for numbers I hear, forward and backward; memory for details in

arrange patterned blocks to form larger patterns; ability to memorize and

I have to admit I haven't found anything to improve those either.  Then
again, I haven't been looking.  I may bring them up with my doctor the

Let's not paint all "neuro drugs" with the same brush.  If you're depressed,
one antidepressant may help and another may not; yet another may both help
and have less worrisome side effects.  It depends on your particular brain
chemistry.  I definitely prefer having my doctor (a specialist in "mind
medicine" -- my term) involved; I certainly don't believe what I read on
labels.  Medline searches may help.

I should have made a more precise statement:  Don't be tempted to 
take these drugs solely for the cognitive effects, especially the 
older ones, because this can lead to dangerous physical effects.

Socialization never becomes anything other than what it is:  a form 
of conditioning into the cultural norms of a given society.  One can 
be socialized into the cultural norm of a respect for authority, but 
this occurs both within families and within schools simultaneously.  
If anything, the family unit utilizes a more authoritarian structure of 
authority than the school environment as a whole.  Children spend 
much of their early lives being socialized into heirarchical
structures, of which the school is only one.

I do not have an opinion for or against home schooling, but I hope that 
this discussion of it will involve a clear understanding of the 
social phenonemons involved.

Obvious? Sometimes I'm don't entirely understand even my own emotions, If you 
can always tell what somebody is feeling you really should go into politics,  
or the used car business.

If by "objective" you mean emotions are real then I agree.

If by "objective" you mean I can have the same sort of knowledge of your 
emotions that I have of mine then I disagree.

If by "objective" you mean that when you and I act in a similar way we 
probably have emotions of a somewhat similar nature then I agree. Probably. 

If by "objective" you mean my emotions can exist independent of me then 
I disagree, and so they obviously must be subjective.

Subject: The PSYCHE Mailing Lists: Interdisciplinary Discussions on Consciousness
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In recent years there as been a convergence of interest, from a number
of fields of study, on the nature of conscious experience. The
neuroscientist who explores the biological basis of consciousness, the
philosopher concerned with how age old questions of human experience are
explained, the psychologist seeking a more comprehensive view of the
nature and dynamics of subjective experience, and the cyberneticist who
dreams of a robot that thinks for itself, all work with closely related
and overlapping subjects, and all stand to benefit from and contribute
to a common pool of knowledge.  Furthermore, these issues are finding
increasing relevance among the humanities --the traditional home of
discussion on the nature of human experience.

The study of consciousness is ultimately an interdisciplinary endeavor.
In order to accommodate a more diverse yet focussed dialog on a very
complex subject, the journal PSYCHE <http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/>
has established two discussion lists.  Psyche-D is intended for dialog
on issues of theory, while Psyche-B focuses on research and empirical
issues.

PSYCHE-D for discussion of theoretical issues:

   * How do we define consciousness? In the broader sense, what
     natural phenomena are we trying to understand? What needs to be
     explained, and why?

   * What theoretical approaches are being offered in the study of
     consciousness, and how do they contribute to our understanding
     with reference to our definition of the problem?

   * Just how big is this question, and why?


PSYCHE-B for discussion of empirical issues:

   * What directions in research are suggested by theory? What
     questions are ripe for research?

   * What can we put our hands on? How can the neural (or other)
     correlates of consciousness be operationally defined and tested?

   * What research has been done, and what does it contribute to our
     understanding with reference to our definition of the problem?

=======================================================================

Indeed, and this SUCKS! The crime rate isn't low at all in Holland, we
(yes,
I'm Dutch myself) have more than our fair share of muggings, rapes, murders
(yes, including killer kids) etc, etc. The tough gun laws and the warped
"pinky"
criminal-loving justice system make sure that only the bad guys pack heat,
and get only mildly punished (say, 3 years for murder) if punished at all
(you
know: lack of jailspace or a minor technicality error in the police report
and
things like that are enough to let 'em walk). Now if a law-abiding citizen
*dares*
to defend himself, his family and/or his property (even with his bare
hands!) against  an assault by those "poor guys that had such a difficult
childhood" [and
hence had to turn to crime]....well, you've guessed it....he's in *deep*
shit! 
The justice system will make sure that this horrible crime of "taking
justice
into your own hands" is dealt with swiftly and severely (they'll let a
couple of
child molesters walk, if necessary, to make sure that "this heinous
criminal"
is put away. I'm hardly exaggerating!). 

Example: a man caught some dude breaking into his house, and they get
into a (fist)fight in which the home-owner broke his arm, but managed to
knock the burgular unconscious. Now the owner is facing charges of
attempted
manslaughter, while the real criminal is out on the streets again (I
believe he
wants to file charges against his "attacker", and given the legal
situation, he might very well win this case).

Note: even pepper spray is illegal in Holland. Teargas is classified in the
same
category as flame throwers (!) and "unlawful" possession is punished
accordingly.

> (yeah, yeah...does holland have an imigration problem or an emigration
> problem?...that is ...are people trying to get in ..or get out...or
neither?
**Yes** we do have a immigration problem. Thanks to the pinky government
policies the country is being *flooded* by poor immigrants from all corners
of the world (but especially Turks, Moroccans which will probably result in
Islam becoming the number one religion after the turn of the century, with
as much as 50% (and eventually more) of Dutch citizens being Muslim.
*They* breed a lot faster than "we" do. I guess we all know what happens
to tolerance, progress and liberal ideas in general when Islam takes
over...)
The immigrants are responsible for a disproportionally great percentage of
crimes (what a surprise!) according to recently published police statistics
(there was quite a fuss about this, because the results weren't
"politically
correct". The sanctimonious Dutch are *very* squeamish when it comes to
"ethnic issues", maybe even more than you guys...)

Our great socialist social security is generous to the lazy opportunists
(that's
one of the main reasons why we're so popular with immigrants; they know),
while at the same time it's harsh on the ("native") sick and elderly. 

 >  We have LOTS of people trying to get in...and very few wanting to
leave.
Right! The only people trying to get *out* of Holland are the more
successful
(wealthier) ones, because of some of the highest taxes in the world (hey,
*someone* has to finance the great parasite state!)

Rant finished (for now). I hope y'all have a somewhat better understanding
of
my point of view after this. I still like Holland though, just hate the
political/
justice system. I've heard some countries want to copy our "model". My
advice:
*don't*.

That's certainly a good idea; another possibility is to always try to use
private alternatives to government and watch it 'wither away'. Government
will continue to exist until people stop calling on it every time they
have a problem.

My experience is the same as Burroughs'; anything that can be done with
drugs (at least the kind which affect the brain) can be done in other
ways. This is why I'm extremely wary of using any of those drugs; I'd
rather fix the bad programming than rely on an external agent.

Sure, and I agree with the point that kids should learn to rely on
themselves. I just have no convincing evidence that sending them to public
schools is a good way to do that, nor that child psychologists are any
better at raising kids than normal parents.

Yet continuing to send kids into that environment is better than teaching
them at home?

Uh, my experience, my friends' experiences, the experiences of those on
this list... the only people I've met who didn't have similar tales to
tell were either home-schooled or went to expensive private schools. 

And, since you're discussing 'socialization' on another thread, why would
that be neccesary if I'm wrong?

Because, sadly, there's no box on the voting slip to vote out a candidate;
you always have to vote in another who's probably just as bad. Regardless
of which President you vote for, you always get a President.

Well, most of my friends and most of the people I've worked with in the

When I was growing up the tax-funded education system seemed to be
intended to program people to do what they're told while working
nine-to-five in offices and factories. I've never worked nine-to-five and
there's a fair chance that I'll be able to 'retire' at 35, so that
programming was at best utterly pointless.

Good points. I have a skeleton for an essay at home where I discuss
the 'P' word ("progress") and why we seldom use it (short answer:
positivism is no longer fashionable in these postmodern times),
instead saying "evolution" and "development", mixing things up a
bit.

Yes and no. Suppose you are a near-omniscient jupiter brain. You can
see the entire fitness landscape (or more correctly, the entire game
matrix) and find the best strategy if there is one; you might
realize that your immune system cannot defend against nanite X, so
your equally smart enemy will defeat you in any case since it also
knows this. So in this case you will either survive, be destroyed or
face a somewhat uncertain future (when both players play mixed
strategies). 

But can even a jupiter brain see the entire fitness landscape and
find the global optimum? The space of possible designs is very, very
large (I would argue that it is at least of cardinality aleph zero
for physical designs, and the space of possible shapes is of
cardinality aleph two in a continous world). Even a planet-sized
brain would not be able to contain the combinatorial explosion, and
there might be few general rules as designs include self-organization
and deliberate chaos; since good designs are rare in this space, they
will be valuable and not always easy to find (Moravec has argued
something similar when discussing the economy of Exes). 

So even a very bright individual might discern the global fitness
maximum in a subspace of immune designs, but can not handle the full
space. That suggests that genetic methods can be useful to find
unexpected new possibilities and search through it for new maxima not
amenable to intelligent search.

Energy is the problem here. While I think a workable nanite based on
silicates could be made, the biosphere is the major source of
high-energy chemicals on this planet. So it is the easiest target and
most useful; eating rocks would require so much energy that the
growth would be slow and the threat fairly minimal. And the earth's
crust appears to be at a very deep energy minimum, I don't see how
you could get further without tremendous amounts of energy.

I based this on Drexler's calculations of replication. Bacteria are
actually quite good replicators, thermodynamics seems to place some
limits to replication speed at a certain energy level (and you cannot
get much more than 1000 W/m^2 on the surface of the earth).

Yes, yes. But I'm trying to discuss the immune system problem here,
not the deliberate weapons use problem (as I pointed out in my last
posting).

Again, we seem to be arguing about two different things. This isn't a
solution to proliferation (although I like your term for it), this is
a scenario explaining why intelligence is likely to survive at least
a bit into a genetic takeover and likely influence the new ecology.

Good point. Most nanites would definitely have adekvate safeguards

Yes, that is entirely true. Once you have parasites, you need an
immune system.

Well, I think the rod-logic of drexler would do quite fine here. One
could imagine silicate nanocomputers covering the earth with a thick
and inert surface.

I have been working on a system, but it is not yet written up.
Basically, it will depend on what you want to defend.

And how do you trust the independents to not figure out how to
subvert reality in some way, or the entity to wield its power well?

Well, that depends on how much redesign the programmers could do. If
you have ever looked at genetically evolved programs, you know they
are a mess. Structured programming? Bah! Sphagetti code? Not even

I don't think the universe is perverse. We just like to think it is,
since it takes the blame :-)

Perverse posthumans might be a problem, which is yet another reason
to learn everything we can about how to create healthy humans that
can get along, and the psychology of self-augmentation.

Sigh. Who has read too much sf and seen too many movies now? You seem
to attribute the nanites with tremendous reproduction capabilities
and a very high level of intelligence, hell-bent on finding the last
survivors and killing them. Yes, such a nanoweapon could in principle
be created, but is it the realistic standard immune systems should be
measured against? In that case we obviously have to look out for the
heat-seeking, contagious-like-common-cold, fast-mutating retroviral
ebola viruses...

It is this assumption I want to challenge. If it has the tremendous
destructive potential you assume, it is a fairly logical assumption.
But can you really back it up with some hard calculations? 

You might be worrying about an imaginary ultra-danger, which will
suggest a course of action which is less than optimal but sounds
plausible Remember that we humans consistently overestimate the risks
of huge disasters and underestimate small, common disasters, and that
fear is the best way of making people flock to an "obvious solution",
especially if it is nicely authoritarian.

I think you are partially right, nanotech will be dangerous, but we
have to estimate the threat levels and what countermeasures that can
be created before we jump to conclusions about future politics. For
example, if decent immune systems can be created then the dishwasher
goo scenario is unlikely, and if relatively few have the twisted
genius and expertise to design Hollywood goo then it is a potential
danger but with a likeliehood of occuring that is low enough for some
planning to be done (like moving outwards, which ought to be feasible
at the assumed tech level). We need to get some estimates of these
factors.

I don't think that explanation holds; gas giants seem to be very
common. Most solar system models seems to predict them in the outer
solar system, and the few planets we have discovered outside the
solar system are (almost by definition due to our measurement
methods) gas giants.

     In my previous tidy scenario on the subject (conveniently limited to 
     "extropian" minded parents), I didn't factor in such a situation.  If 
     my parents had sent me to a small "church" school and been real 
     adamant about it, it would've been quite different from the sometimes 
     carefree nature of public school with its art, dancing and overall 
     diversity to observe and participate in.  My daughter pretty much had 
     that route in elementary and middle school.  Unfortunately, she was 
     very intelligent and hated public high school even though she wanted 
     the freedom it afforded.  She found it too big, the people too nominal 
     in their quest for learning and the tools for learning too limited 
     (schools not well-funded).  So it was the other end of the spectrum 
     for her.  Sure there were dances but the number of kids to DEAL with 
     was overwhelming.  She tested out of high school at 14 (there's a 
     happy ending, she did go to the senior prom <G>).  
     
     Point is, kids adjust to what they need to.  My daughter is very adept 
     at debate and negotiation (BELIEVE ME!) and she got that skill from 
     observing her mother (the lawyer!) who she lived with thru age 12.  
     However, on the minus side, she doesn't socialize all that well when 
     put in large groups.  She's used to managing/leading smaller, tamer 
     groups of people.  Hindrance or preference?

     interface, incorporating pen (like a Pilot) and voice interactivity.  
     It will have smart paper (already in development) which will 
     essentially be technologically-realized "magic slates" (remember 
     those?).  The "paper" will get fed instructions from the CPU 
     binder/cover.  An interface will enable any work, published or not, to 
     be displayed on the "pages" and read like a book...text at first, then 
     color pictures, then full-motion video, all on a thin piece of paper 
     that has been assembled to respond intelligently rather than just 
     passively receive some ink blots.  The trees will be so pleased that 
     we've made this paradigm shift and so, I imagine, ultimately will our 
     lungs (as long as we're bound to using them).
     
     Language has served us well for many centuries but we're still 
     clinging to it like it's the end all and be all of communication.  
     Communication needs to be streamlined.  In language, an abundance of 
     words need to be eliminated, icons incorporated, media forms enmeshed 
     to provide the most time-efficient method of conveying information 
     well.  Right now, video is in the hands of major corporation 
     interests: the Time-Warners, The ABC-Disneys.  They all have their own 
     profit-making agenda.  With the advent of the Internet, information is 
     now slowly being dislodged from these bulwarks (although they infest 
     the Internet as well...I'm hoping their investment in this medium will 
     be either their undoing or their rehabilitation, either would work).
     
     Once information becomes ubiquitous in its availability, I suspect 
     business as usual will be a moot point.  Market economy notions are 
     headed for the scrap heap.  And questions like Lily poses of Picard in 
     the Star Trek: First Contact about the enormous cost of a starship 
     will happen substantially sooner than the 24th century.
     
     So, start preparing that essay kids! Here's the topic: 
     
     "What would you do if you could do what you dream of rather than what 
     is expected of you?"

The Immortalists


Condemned to lifes shortness --its brevity,
We hope that someday we will find the cure:
Perhaps to extend our longevity
Or conquer both death, and lifes remote lure.
Many men say that we are merely fools--
Heretics detracting from our design,
And that we will never find the right tools
We need to extend our current lifeline.
Maybe they are right --the skeptics who say
That we should not try to control our fate,
Perhaps death is a force we must obey
With reincarnation to compensate;
But in the hope it is not, we shall try
To extend our lives however we can,
Adamant that we do not need to die,
And certain of the potential of man;
For each life has a beauty so much more
Than the sum of mankinds abilities,
Each life is a key to a portal door
Of all infinite possibilities.
We cherish this vivid reality
That life has a greatness all men should know,
That once we overcome mortality
There will be no limits to where we go;
Though there will be those who block our progress,
And those who will condemn our endeavor,
We will never stop, we will not digress
>From our objective to live forever.

     I noticed a big full page ad in Section A of the SF Chronicle today 
     which attempted to dispel concerns about people eating at Burger King 
     (due to the E coli scare linked to their meat distributor). I am 
     struck by the minimal amount of effort it takes to lull the public at 
     large back into a state of denial about the quality of food they 
     consume, not to mention the sources and conditions under which this 
     type of "food" is made available.  
     
     Accountability once again is the buzzword.  It would be interesting to 
     get the real skinny on how this large scale recall came about.  Was it 
     an unfortunate and largely unpreventable accident?  Is it mounting 
     carelessness and lack of thorough quality control?  Do the workers in 
     the meat-processing plants give a rat's ass what the general public 
     throw down their gullets?  Do the FDA inspectors?  Do the stockholders 
     of the companies supplying meat along its journey from Bessie to 
     Whopper? IMO, here is another instance where the myopic focus on 
     profit and the growing apathy associated with meaningless work 
     comingle and the result?  People getting sick from contanimated meat.  
     Thousands of cows, their lives, their waste, their grain consumption 
     wasted.  Maybe one plus is that it provides a sobering slap in the 
     face for a completely heartless industry.
     
     This weekend at the Renaissance Faire (which would've really been 
     enjoyable had I not felt a minute-by-minute pressure to buy this or 
     that by the incessant hawkers), I tried a marinated soy meat which was 
     being used in place of a BBQ beef product and it was quite good!  The 
     Burger Nouveau patties (for those of you fortunate enough to have 
     access to Trader Joe's) meet my still-carnivorous taste standards.  
     
     Why are the fast food chains not making anything more than SALAD and 
     very whimpy burritos available to people who want a quick, vegetarian 
     bite on the go?  Their fervent endorsement of beef and poultry at the 
     expense of cruel and unusual treatment that, were it a cat, dog or 
     monkey, they'd be hauled off to jail.  The animals' death is the most 
     merciful part of their existence!  Their lives (particularly the 
     chickens) are a living hell (if chickens could conceive hell that is).
     
     We've talked about the primitiveness of emotions and how animals (like 
     dogs and cats) obviously express fondness, fear, their desire for 
     food, their annoyance at being left alone.  Chickens may be stupid, by 
     our measure, but to sear their beaks off and cram them into cages 
     where, if they don't become sick, they go whacko from not being able 
     to scratch and have any space at all.  The ones that do not hold up in 
     these chicken concentration camps go to the soup vat.  The heartier 
     ones I imagine end up in the poultry department, Boston Market and the 
     Colonel's.  Again, their demise ends up being the best thing they 
     could hope (if they could hope) for.
     
     I've read that we already have the technology to GROW chicken muscle, 
     independent of it being part of a live, "emoting" chicken.  Does 
     anyone know about the progress of such technology.  The inhumanity of 
     our current livestock processing is galling and totally paradoxical to 
     the otherwise growing perception that animals have rights.
     
     So, there are a few points here that I'd like to put on the table:
     
     * the viability of emotions expressed by animals.  What is it that 
     makes those emotions sacrasanct, giving them the weight that promotes 
     being more merciful?
     
     * the technology of employing soy meat subsitutes or growing chicken 
     "meat" without the chicken in a biotechnical capacity.
     
     * the justification for maintaining a diet that has apathy, cruelty 
     and exploitiveness as its cornerstones (as still a majority of 
     westerns still do).
     
     Rick

So what? The problem is not the immigrants but the welfare system they find 
when they get there. If a country draws a line around its borders and says 
anyone who is inside that line gets all sorts of nifty financial benefits but 
anyone outside that line does not, then free immigration can not be allowed. 
I think free immigration is a basic human right and that's one of many reasons 
I oppose welfare. Fortunately it's becoming increasingly difficult to stop 
people from going where they want to go or hearing what they want to hear, 
and that's why I'm optimistic the present system is breaking down.

So what? True, Islam is an idiotic religion, but no more so than the 
Christian religion, or the Jewish, or the Hindu, or the Druid, or the UFO, 
or the ...

Who is "we"?  I'm not Dutch.

Things change, nothing is fixed in concrete. Historically Islam has been much  
more tolerant of foreign ideas than Christianity, it's only in this century  
that things changed. They can change again. 

I must say, if you attach a vast significance to the trivial little 
differences in culture or physical appearance among various groups of humans 
today, then you will be as unprepared as most people for the phase change in 
life of truly astronomical magnitude that will happen in less than a century.
                                                     
BTW, I assume by "liberal" you're using the 19'th century meaning, where the 
word mente more personal freedom and open to new ideas, the very opposite of 
today's meaning.

I have to disagree, I see the exact opposite.  Putting destructive technology

Hmmm.. that or the possible chance of death.. death please!

Isn't spontaneous order an extropian principle?

To fellow extropians-

I have a friend Michael Mateas, who is currently working towards his
Ph.D at CMU.  His work primarily revolves around developing believable
agents in a MOO or MUD environment.  I believe his work has direct
relevance in creating the kinds of personality improvement agents that
Max More talked about at the Extro-3 conference.  He has successfully
completed an artificial world where you the user interact with several
'believable agents' in a fast-food restaurant.  The agents behavior
changes in response to your actions. Your mission, if you decide to
accept it, is to survive and thrive the fast-food experience.

His original paper on the topic can be found at:

You know, I think so too, but I think that is only 2/3 of the truth. 
We underestimate small, common disasters, overestimate the risks of 
huge disasters, and we underestimate the risks of absolutley enormous 
disasters. Or we put them in the same category as the huge disasters 
without realising that they may be millions of times worse.

I think I know what you mean by "the innate perversity of the

Yes. It should be possible to model the first two waves 
mathematically. You have a roomful of nodes, and one node is the 
starting node. The starting node emits colonizers. When a colonizer 
arrives at a node, that node begins to emit colonizers too, after a 
certain delay time. Each colonizer can be sent to a any node. Which 
colonizers do you send to which nodes in order to colonize all nodes 
in the shortest possible time?

Maybe nukes, but that presupposes that they have enough intelligence 
to do Uranium mining and to put together a warhead. Chemical 
explosives would be easier to have them manufacture if you couldn't 
give them superintelligence. --Tossing it into the sun seems a bit 
farfetched and unnecessary.

Yes, yes. At least in the absense of a working immune system, but we 
have doubt's that such is possible. Do you have any concrete reason 
why it could not work, though?

Right. Though see my Safe Libertarian Future scenario in my reply to

claim that it is likely to happen.)

Well, as long as there exist a chemical compound with a higher 
binding energy than the components have in naturally occuring rock, 
doesn't this mean that the reaction would be *exotherm* so that the 
only energy we will need is for start-up. And even if each digestive 
cycle were to take a longer time than for organic substances, this 
would not matter much since we are dealing with a exponetially 
increasing number of parallel processes. --This is a question to

There are two separate issues here. Your first statement was meant to 
support your claim that we could hide away from bad nanites, so I 
assumed you refered to the actual speed of a bacterial infections. 
Your last statement says somthing not about the actual speed of 
bacterial infections, but about the speed of a bacterial infection in 
ideal circumstances --continuous medium, unlimited food etc. I might 
agree that in those circumstances there might not be much difference 
between a nano-plague and a biological plague; but what we are 
talking about is the real world, and therein bacteria are quite bad 
replicators in the sense that a new strand of bacteria won't cover 
the whole earth in a matter of hours. What are the Drexlerian 
calculations you refer to?

The immune system problem is part of the deliberate weapons use 
problem. We want an immune system that can make us safe from a 
Saddam Hussein with nanotech. If we were certain that everybody would 
use nanotech in a peaceful and responsible way then we would not need 
to care much about the immune problem. E. g. we could simply design 
all the nanomachines to be non-evolvable. (This is done by building 
them in such a way that any single one or a few mutations would lead 
to a non-viable machine; only a cosmic coincidence would yield 
something that can reproduce.) So I'm not sure about which problem 
your are trying to solve.

My original remark was only about a possibility: if we are lucky, the 
entity would benevolent and then this could work. However, now 
when I come to think about it, it might be possible to have a stable 
postnanotech libertarian society after all, contrary to what I 
previously believed. Here is my idea:

Safe Libertarian Future:
The scenario assumes that many humans value freedom and independent 
personal existence higher than anything else. When nanotechnology 
approaches, they realise that if freedom is allowed in a world with 
strong nanotech, then some mad person will certainly design the 
doomsday virus. So they realise they have to give up on freedom. But 
then some bright person comes up with the idea that all people upload 
and that only a robot is left with the ability to operate in the real 
world. The whole system is hardwired so that the robot only executes 
instructions that have been agreed upon by the majority of the 
uploads. In their virtual reality, the uploads can do anything they 
want: each one has unlimited individual freedom. The only thing they 
can't do in the virtual reality is to mass murder a lot of other 
uploads (the virtual physics doesn't allow destructive nanomachines 
to be built, for example). The uploads cannot influence the external 
world either, except when a majority decision can be made. But for 
many decisions, this should be feasible: e.g. colonising the galaxy 
to provide more Lebensraum etc. One can even imagine refinements of 
this scheme such that each individual would have his own robot that 
he could to what he liked with; though this presupposes that the 
robots could be built in such a way that nobody could use their robot 
to do anything that would endanger the computer on which they all 
existed.

This is the only way I can think of that a very nearly 
completely libertarian society, without any guardian or international 
government, can exist long after the arrival of strong nanotech.

That just preserves the spores BETTER.  Low water activity in the case of
spore survival is an advantage.  For instance vacuum freeze drying is the
best method currently available for keeping spores alive. (Just add water and
nutrients to revive them).   Suboptimal water activity will stop or slow
growth and can make some on-spore forms of bacteria _more_ susceptible to
other hostile conditions.  You can look in the book _Preservative-Free and
Self-Preserving Cosmetics and Drugs_ (see below) the for which ones are
affected. 
 
<< Of course, things might hide inside a rock

Vacuum is not considered to be a problem for for bacteria.  For instance,
vacuum packed meat is vulnerable to _Clostridium botulinum_ (another spore
former, BTW) growth and botulism toxin formation. 
 
Pressure is also not a problem for bacteria.  I personally found no bacterial
reduction at 65,000 psig (the highest my system would go).  Later, I read
120,000 psig also had no reduction in viability.

I mean that you can study emotions in the laboratory, and that they're so
obviously present - and obviously useful - that debating philosophy is
ridiculous.  There's so much practical work to be done.

Cycles:
  1A.  Programmer writes a piece of code to do something.
  2A.  Code evolves into something small, dense and tight.
  1B.  Code leaps into new evolutionary space and discovers new algorithm.
  2B.  Programmer expands algorithm and generalizes it.

I think that evolutionary programming is mainly useful for three things.  At a
low level of power and sophistication, it's good for optimizing pre-existing
programs.  At a high level of sophistication, it can invent new algorithms. 
And at a very high level, it acts as a symbiont to programmers.  A programmer
hacks up an inefficient but general algorithm, and then the EP automatically
uses it as raw material and incorporates it into all existing programmings. 
To put it another way, imagine that when somebody had invented the quicksort,
all programs in the world used the quicksort a few moments later.  In effect,
this would let the programmer write code on an enormously higher level.  As if
the language itself was sentient.

But we don't have that kind of EP yet.

How much time would it take for a nanomachine to construct a nuclear weapon? 
I think we can assume that nano is at least as destructive as nuke.

Okay, so I'll list my "Top ten ways to destroy all human life using only a few
thousand dollars worth of current technology."  Or maybe not.

You'll just have to take my word on this one.  We're too damn close to the
brink already.  If nanotechnology can build cities, it can destroy them.  If
nanotechnology can heal a broken arm, it can cause subtle lesions in the
prefrontal cortex and amygdala.  Where nanotech is concerned, the trick isn't
taking over the world - it's doing it so that nobody else notices.

Remember that the Bad Guys aren't operating under the same restrictions as the
Good Guys.  The wannabe dictators will use directed evolution on a scale no
Good Guy would dare to contemplate.  And evolving mutually competing predators
will go a lot faster than mutually supporting immune systems.

Our immune systems are unimaginably more sophisticated than a virus or a
bacterium, using controlled evolution to combat natural evolution.  And yet we
still suffer from colds and diseases.  The only reason that the viruses
haven't killed us outright is that it isn't good strategy.

I want to repeat this, because it's important.  Our immune systems are the
closest analogue to proposed nano-immunities.  The mismatch in available power
and sophistication is enormous.  Our immune systems learn from experience, use
controlled and directed evolution, have memories... everything but the ability
to consciously design things.  And yet the viruses waltz casually through our
bodies, because it's so much easier to destroy than create.  Sometimes a virus
which has deliberately evolved not to kill the host will be expelled from the
body after a few weeks.  Lethal viruses who've taken the gloves off thrive for
years under continuous assualt by our immune systems and the designed
pharmaceuticals of science.  And really lethal viruses, the truly destructive
ones, kill us directly.

Imagine a virus as sophisticated as the immune system.  No contest.  The sight
would be pathetic, or even moving if the immune system managed to stay on its
feet for a few milliseconds.  And, thanks to the relative speeds of evolved
destruction and evolved protection, the viruses will actually be more sophisticated.

It is easier to destroy than create!

Well... I'm not competent to estimate the percentage of the population with
the genius and expertise to design death goo.  The "twisted" part can pretty
much be taken for granted.  And I truly don't think death goo would be that
hard to design.  If any human is even capable of designing an immune system,
then the average educated person will be capable of breaking it, given time
and effort.  Any twisted genius will go through it like tissue paper.

As with nuclear weapons, the issue is really quite simple.  This is in
occasion where the destructive power of X is not diminished by spreading it
among more hands.  Military and governmental power is diminished by
distribution; hence the U.S. government.  Nuclear power is diminished by MAD;
any number of Nuclear Powers greater than two decreases stability.  The
situation will be pretty much the same with nanotechnology... except that a
first strike will have a different probability of succeeding.  If that
probability is high enough, MAD won't work and nano should be confined to a
*single* group.

Hmm, you mean like the risk for dinosaur killer asteroid impacts
or vacuum decay? They seem to belong in the category of disasters
that are so absurdly devastating that they do not appear real; we
can relate to nuclear war and plagues of nanites, but not the
truly big disasters?

However, I'm not sure there is much evidence for your statement
that we underestimate the enormous disasters, but I would love to
be proven wrong.

I do not think that is what I meant, but in an arms-race everybody suffers
a lot and the person that evetually loses, loses big-time (ask any Russian

That is certainly very true. For instance: over here people drive like
crazy (another way to get rid of their agression?), not very smart in a
country with a Pop.density of 1000+/Sq Mi. We have a LOT of traffic
accidents. I've been in three serious ones myself (could also relate to my
way of riding my ATB ;-).

In response to Den Otters 'rant' (learn a new word every day):

The Dutch judicial system pisses me off on a regular bases too, but if gun
ownership in Holland is ever made 'free' I'll be taking a very long
vacation to a safer place like Cambodia or Afghanistan or such since most
Dutch folks are as clued up on firearms as my goldfish is on Post-Kantian
ethics (not that I own a goldfish, but you get thet point). After six
months or so our unemployment-rate should be nil, as well as our housing
shortage.

 >The immigrants are responsible for a disproportionally great percentage of
 >crimes (what a surprise!) according to recently published police statistics

A (yeah yeah - pinko)suggestion (sorry I have to say this):
What if you relate Crime-rate to average income (immigrants are on average
very poor by dutch standards)? Might be interesting. Rich people generally
don't commit violent crimes - they have too much to lose.

 >(there was quite a fuss about this, because the results weren't
 >"politically correct". The sanctimonious Dutch are *very* squeamish when
 >it comes to "ethnic issues", maybe even more than you guys...)

This is what is known as our "Anne Frank Syndrome". The genocide on Jews in
holland was more effective than in any other country (exept Poland) because
Holland was such a neatly organized country. Of the 125.000 Jews living in
Holland less than 10.000 survived the war. Ever since then being called a
'racist' or 'nazi' means instant social death in Holland.

Thank's to John Clark, I couldn't have said it better myself.

In spite of many things (not least of wich is the 60% income tax) I
wouldn't trade my Dutch passport for any other in the world. Hey, Den wanna
come over for a beer or something?

But all the political stuff aside, I suspect many Americans want to hold-on
to their guns because they just LOVE shooting them. And (suprise, suprise,
against better judgement) I must agree. On a few occassions I have had the
pleasure of blasting away with an AK-47 (Pakistan), two Clock's
(Switserland) and an M-16 (Wisconsin). Yes, it's fun. It's primitive.. but
I can't deny it.

We could say a lot more about this, but I think maybe we should do it off
the list and make some room for more hard science (where on earth do y'all
find the time to write all this stuff?).

Just to warm some 'All American' hearts (but no less sincere!)

Thank you America:
For doing in Bosnia what Europe should have done in '93
For Winning the Cold War for us
For paying for that (Well, 90% anyway)

I dcan't speak for Eliezar, but my reason to limit speculation on the
post-Singularity era is that it's essentially unbounded. The SI will be
able to do anything that's not prohibited by the laws of physics, and it
will know the laws of physics. With no constraints, we would really be
speculating on the motivations of the SI. I can (and do) specualate
about this quite a bit, but an attempt to have a rational discourse on
this subject is essentially equivalent to theology, not science, Do it
for entertainment, but don't expect to discover the "right" answer.
I would be very interested in discussions on the era leading up to the
Singularity. In particular, what can we do to minimize societal upheaval
while accelerating the pace of technological advance?

Sorry, step 2A doesn't occur that easily. GAs tend to produce
bloated, redundant and weird code; their strength is that they are so
good at finding flexible solutions. 

The basic idea above is sound, Thomas Ray has suggested something like this
to get completely unexpected solutions to problems nobody has yet posed.

Numbers, please. It is easy to claim something like this, but is it
really true? 

Building a nuke: you need around 10 kilograms of uranium 235 (or whatever
isotope it was). There is around 2 grams uranium / tonne in the crust of the 
earth, of which 0.72% is U235, so to get 10 kg you need to process around 
7000 tonnes of crust. I'm not sure how much energy is required to reduce
the UO2 to pure U, but it is a noticeable amount (are there a chemist
in the house?). Assuming the nanites cover a large patch with solar
collectors, they can get around 500 W/m^2, which has to cover their
replication, search through the crust, reduction, isotope separation and return
to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now 
(it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take
a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a 
week. 

Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything
within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)
is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty
of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular
bonds), and nanites are bad at making blast waves. OK, this is an unfair
comparision since nanites are more similar to bacterial or viral infections.

I would like to do some more careful calculations on this (or rather, that
somebody with the right knowledge did it instead of a bumbling amateur like
me), but it is IMHO clear that we should not be overly worried about
nano-built nuclear weapons but rather nano-ebola. Everything in the world
has limits set by the laws of nature.

Ever thought about the fact that the immune system isn't mutually supporting?
It is rather a balance of predators which do not predate on each other since
that destroys their fitness. 

Good guys will be motivated to contemplate directed evolution since the bad guys
do it; and they tend to have more brainpower and money on their side. I
think the weapon of openness is important here.

Exactly. So the major question is: is it possible to create a nanite
infection that is deadly (or subtle) enough to wipe out all competition?
Don't reflexively answer 'yes' to it, try to give a considered answer
of why it is likely (or why not). Note that it would have to be able
to spread across the world fast enough to subvert everyone, or circumvent
all attempts at detection. That is assuming a lot.

Have you studied medicine? Then you know viruses certainly do not waltz causally
through your body (of which around *one kilogram* apparently is immune cells, if 
you are a normally built male).

> It is easier to destroy than create!

You repeat this as a mantra. And of course you have the second law of
thermodynamics on your side. The problem is that you do not attempt to
make quantitative comparisions between the strengths of different systems,
and instead rely on plausible-sounding arguments. That is definitely
*not* a good strategy if you are trying to discuss something important
where we do need a well planned policy.

Sigh, here we go again. What is your evidence for this? A few months ago
somebody on sci.nanotech posted a challenge for people to come up with
nanotech immune systems and he would find flaws in them. I don't think
there was any follow-up, which is sad, but it might be worth taking up
here on the list. Unfortunately I do lack the time to deal with this
as carefully I would like, since I consider this very important, but 
let's try a simple sketch to see how easy it is to vanquish a designed
immune system:

The body is surrounded by an inert skin (say diamond); attempts to
physically breach it can be detected from the inside and the surrounding
region sealed. The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory
or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections
can be isolated. Immune devices move around, interrogating "cells"
(subsystems) by comparing their surface markings with allowed types
(this list can be kept secret from someone who disassembles a device
by using a trapdoor function), and occasionally disassembling the 
cell to check its innards. Other immune devices check the general
activity, looking for deviations from the normal state (there is
a paper on the net somewhere about using GAs to evolve anti-hacking
agents, this is something similar). If a compartment is found to be
infected it is terminated with extreme prejudice (the human body
uses the granulocytes and their nasty cocktail of free radicals,
chlorine acids and proteolytic enzymes, this would use something
worse or simply throw out the infected compartment from the 
organism). Note that production of new immune devices can be done
by assemblers in well defended deep regions, and that the 
devices themselves can be fairly simple since they do not need
to replicate, just find threats. 

So, what are the obvious holes?

Joost,

If so, would you put that down to genetics or upbringing?

I agree with you. IMHO it's a logical conclusion that the capacity for
intelligence is genetic, and that the fulfilment of that capacity is
environmental.

This ignores one thing: viruses do not destroy, they create.  A virus is
primarily interested in reproduction, not destruction.  Any destruction
which occurs is largely a side effect, bursting cells to free the newborn
virus particles.  This does play some role in helping the spread of
the virus, but probably it would be even better for the virus if the
converted cells were able to keep cranking out new virii indefinately,
and there were some mechanism to get them out of the cell.  In some cases
it is the body's own immune system which destroys virus-producing cells,
not the virus itself.

The creation-vs-destruction model is a misleading picture of what happens
in viral infections.

Applying this to the gray goo scenario, the thing to remember is that the
gray goo must replicate in order to be effective.  A single gray goo
disassembler will not cause much damage.  And whatever mechanisms it uses
to replicate will be vulnerable to attack just as much as the systems which
it is trying to "eat".

In nature, we have a distinction between predators and prey.  Large numbers
of animals have pretty much given up on trying to defend themselves,
relying instead on avoiding predation, and fast enough reproduction to
overcome the loss due to predators.  This leads to a model where we think
of gray goo replicators as the predators, and ordinary nanotech as prey.

But this is not the right model.  Think instead of interactions among
predators, each seeking to be as aggressive as possible against the
others.  Think of lions attacking bears, badgers against wolverines.
Think of armies against armies, or spy vs spy.

Barring nuclear destruction, it is not clear that gray goo will win
the battle.  Gray goo is not interested solely in destruction.  Rather,
it is a replicator like everyone else; it seeks to preserve its own
structure and function, it seeks to reproduce, it seeks to protect itself.
It must do these things in order to survive.

My prediction would be a band of "war zones", where the battle rages,
with surges as one side or the other gets a local advantage.  Between
these zones would be relatively stable regions, dominated by cooperating
replicators.  But the border shifts, and occasionally a stable region
is overcome.

Each side seeks to destroy the other, but that is an over-simplification.
Actually there are many factions, some seeking to destroy all others,
others cooperating.  Can game theory give us cause to believe that the
nice (in the technical sense) replicators will win?  Will the hackers
and madmen cooperate in their efforts to destroy the world, or isn't it
more likely that each attempts to destroy all others?  As the good-guy
nanotech cooperates while bad-guy factions kill each other, it may well
be that we can expect the good guys to have an advantage.

Robin,

Perhaps to create is not *necessarily* to torture, but it can be. 

I have heard teenagers say, miserably:

  "I didn't ask to be born. And now that I am born, I am going to die!"

Some (though none that I have met) take ultimate control of their lives
from fate by killing themselves before fate gets a chance. I recently took
the decision whether or not to participate in the creation of a new person,
and decided that, on balance (only just!), I am glad that I was born. I
doubt that most give it a thought before they procreate.

Yet one man's torture is famously another man's pleasure, and there are
both prisoners in jail and politicians in the grave to prove it. So until
we figure out the right and wrong of the future, perhaps the past can offer
some advice: do to others what you would have done to yourself.

Regards,
Darren

<< It would be interesting to  
      get the real skinny on how this large scale recall came about.>> 
 
The problem was NOT _E. coli_, that would be ridiculous because ALL RAW
mammalian meat is contaminated with _E. coli_, there is no control known that
will eliminate it under standard procedures.  Gamma irradiation is not
standard yet for beef.  The main control is COOKING the raw meat and kitchen
sanitization.   
 
The problem *was* that the hamburger was contaminated with _E. coli_
O157:H7--the special strain that causes bleeding and sometimes death.  This
was not the normal strain of _E coli_ you and I have by the 100s of billions
inside us normally.  That's right EVEN the vegitarians!  
 
So,. . . There are also no controls in raw beef for this 0157:H7 strain, for
the same reasons as the normal _E. coli_.  Cooking is the control.
 (_Salmonella_ is on all chicken and is uncontrolled, too.  Again, the
control is cooking and kitchen sanitization.)  

The FDA has (at least in the past) said: 
1.  since you can't control _E. coli_ don't even monitor for it, because it
is normal.   
2.  you must monitor for O157:H7 because we are getting heat from the public.
 So they issued a special advisory asking O157:H7 be monitored January 1997.
 The FDA will add a law forcing the monitoring and control of O157:H7 in the
new HACCP rules this will be mandatory on December 12, 1997. 
3.  even then, if you find it you do not HAVE to recall your product, but it
is highly suggested.
6.  since there are no really good controls for raw beef,  you are out of
luck unless you gamma irradiate your beef.  But, some people don't what you
do to that either. 
 
<<  Was it  
      an unfortunate and largely unpreventable accident? >> 
 
At this point cooking and kitchen sanitization are the prevention.  There is
no effective prevention for raw beef.  
 
<< Is it mounting  
      carelessness and lack of thorough quality control?>> 
 
It is a lack of a good raw beef (raw means uncooked) control for _E. coli_ 
And some food sellers let raw (no antimicrobial control) beef be consumed, by
undercooking it.  
 
<<  Do the workers in  
      the meat-processing plants give a rat's ass what the general public  
      throw down their gullets? >> 
 
Maybe, but _E. coli_ is "normal."  The meat processing people don't even
consider it a problem, because cooking is thought to be the control, not
them.  They have no controls really, they never have had controls (besides
the poor ones listed below). 
 
<< Do the FDA inspectors?>> 
 
What can the inspectors really do if there is no microbial controls for _E
coli_ in beef?  Well, they look at it, check for gross problems, look to see
if a lot of intestinal matter is being ground in, check temperatures, and
equipment sanitization and make sure the batch records are adequate in case a
recall is recommended.  But, that's about it. 
 
<<  Do the stockholders  
      of the companies supplying meat . . . >> 
  
They had better, because right now their companies are in danger of being
shut down and they will loose their investment.

  Is there a mailing list or other forum just for extropians?  Perry's
words reflect my sentiments.  I still remember my first day on the
extropian newsgroup:  I had finally found my philosophy etched (typed)
by the hands of another.  But it soon became obvious that the newsgroup
was cluttered by coercivists and stagnantites (too blind or fearful of
our self-improvement).  I asked if there was a more extropian forum and
was led to this mailing list.
  The mailing list is a vast improvement over the newsgroup but, with
the combination of increased traffic on the list and less leisure time
on my hands, I find myself yearning for a more focused forum.
  The difficulty (for me) is in trying to avoid the standard "freedom is
wrong/impossible" arguments generated by statists while still being sure
that I am receiving all the worthy postings.  Obviously this is very
subjective.
  I guess I am not saying anything new here but if there is another
forum, I'd would appreciate receiving info on it.  If not, I'll just
continue on this list.
  Thanks.

     Media monopoly seems to be a global phenomena.
      
     The avenue of practical response seems to be:
     Intelligent use of the internet - Are there any with a journalist bent 
     interested in compiling a factual, growing database of these kind of 
     events that the nation states don't want people to know about? Noam 
     Chomsky has been doing this for years in publishing and film making. 
     
     The internet is the only medium not broadcast from central, it comes 
     from everywhere. It transcends national borders until a government 
     (like Singapore for example) decides it best to restrict its peoples 
     access to the medium. This list is an example of the propogating of 
     idea's and information normally not available to the serfs. 
     
     If a global network of people willing to provide information on their 
     governments or corporate activities and able to back up their 
     reportage with evidence (PICTURES) were established; we wouldn't have 
     to wait for the media and it's owners to decide what news is fit to 
     print. As this is possible to achieve right now, we don't have anyone 
     else to blame but ourselves. What better way to maintain journalists 
     standards than by setting up a strong alternative medium? How could 
     any government with a preference for freedom of speech possibly 
     complain?
     
     There are already existing several organisations providing stories and 
     swapping videotapes around the world. 
     
     Given the prevelance of conspiracy theories, libel hungry lawyers and 
     those on vendetta's some sort of scale could be introduced to indicate 
     the reputability of the source. Decentralisation of editorial control 
     is essential, however, and not at all impossible, given the right 
     structure to such a database.
     
     If such an entity already exists, can someone please tell me? It needs 
     better advertising to be effective anyway.
     
     Think about it. It just takes a little organisation and involvement.

Yes, this is probably a fruitful area of inquiry. 

Some things worth considering:

How well do people in general adapt to change, and how much do they
like it? Are there basic traits of flexibility? Can flexibility be
nurtured by culture or amplified artificially? 

In the future scenarios developed by Aleph, I noticed recently that
catastrophe theory could be applied to society. Essentially the
catastrophe surface was controlled by the parameters of how much
society tried to control new technology (social impact statements vs.
invent whatever you like) and how well it adapted to new technology
("Internet is a fad" (an actual quote from the Swedish communications
minister!) vs. "Let's use this, with some caution"). I found that
at least in our scenarios (which may or may not reflect reality)
a catastrophe could occur if society didn't adapt; when a society
attempting to control technology fails, or when a previously free 
society due to popular pressure really enforces technology controls,
a very fast transition can occur if the society has not adapted to
the technology, likely with social upheaval as a result. Besides, 
in the no adapption case the internal tensions in society were higher.

[Note: in only one of the four scenarios was a singularity a noticeable
future possibility; in one other it might occur, but a more likely 
long-term future would be a branching of humanity into very different
directions, and in a third it might occur further in the future based
on a non-western culture]

How will economy change in the time up to the singularity? Can today's
corporations adapt fast enough, or will the break up?

No, nuclear war and especially plagues of nanites belong to the 
truly big disasters.

1. Small, common disaster: car accident

2. "huge" disaster: Tjernobyl, major earthquakes

3. enormous disasters: grey goo, all-out nuclear war

There is more difference between 2 and 3 than between 1 and 2.

I think people would do well to pay more attention to the dangers of 
killer asteroids and vacuum decay, if it weren't for the fact that 
there are much more probable disasters in category 3 that they should 
concentrate on instead.

I agree. This single group could be demorcatic, though.

Even so, the nanites could cover continents with construction sites 
so you couldn't bomd them all out. Dynamite should be much easier and

As I asked in an ealier posing, wouldn't you *gain* energy if you

I think Eliezer was trying to establish a lower buond on the 
destructive capability. The reason I begun to talk about dynamite was 
that it would mean that we can be certain that the bunkers you 
suggested wouldn't work agains a designed killer nanite.

Yes, if it is the first nanite infection, there would be no 
competition to compete with! (Biological organisms compete in a lower 
division.)

Well, if the organism is in a free environment, then the plague would 
attack all parts of the skin simultaneously. The whole skin would 
thus have to be shed. The plague would immediately attack again, and 
soon the organism would run out of resources. Alternatively, the 
plague could build explosives and blast your organism. So it seems 
that your organism could not be a transhuman, factory or a city, but 
would have to be the whole planet.

And if the organism is the whole planet, then this would of course be 
equivalent to a totalitarian state. (Deviations from the normal 
state= activities of some individual that the state does not approve 
of, even if that individual hasn't harmed anybody yet.)

It is still interesting to see where this will lead. This thread 
continues to produce an extraordinary number of interesting comments!

It would be nice if we spent more time trying to improve the system

Sorry guys...I can't pass this up...I was all saddled up..ready to go
..getting coffee and eating breakfast ....and this thread kept nagging...and
nagging...so I gotta throw in my nickles worth...
(unsaddle...disconnect GPS...computer in Yakkity-yak mode...lite cigar...take
off boots..)

Now!...several things I question.

1...It's easier to destroy than to create.  We'll it appears that may be
so...but since nature always takes the path of least resistance
(right?)...then howizzat that life exists in the first place?  I submit that
there is an underlaying and contervailing force (uhhhh.....lemme
see....yeah...EXTROPY)...

2.  To stave off this terrible menance we gotta have a world police state,
keep it a secret...yabida yabida yabida...(preachers, prophets, dictators and
demagoges of all flavors been saying this forever)...

Several obvious answers to this..."when it's time to Railroad...we GONNA
railroad" (a much mutilated quote from early american history)...in other
words when all the pieces are available...someones gonna put them together...

To stop this we gotta keep it a SECRET...yeah...sure...

NO!  We must <forceably supress > those <insert group name>...

yeah right...is working real well in Northern Ireland...The Soviet Uniion did
real well in managing their Police State..etc..etc..etc...I could go on...but
this is one of those memes that so obviously won't work...yet intelligent
people keep coming back to it...amazing.

couple of examples of the difficulties of MAKING it work...

You gonna prohibit DEEP THINKING?  Consider what could be done with
intelligence augmentation..and cyberspace....suppose someone decided to
"hibernate" for a few million years <subjective>...(a day..week or month real
time) and mull over the problem of nanotech...how you gonna stop that?

You gonna prohib taking a LONG WALK?   Real long...like out among the Comets
in the Ooort Cloud...or farther...if someone goes out there and develops
nanotech...and is pissed cause you run him off...uh-oh.

An I'm still not convinced that self-replicating nano assemblers are gonna be
that easy....or even possible.(yeah...well possible...like a steam powered
airplane...but not practicle).. I could go into the ideas that biological
nano-assemblers exists for a reason...maybe that's the onlly way that works?
 Because all the components necessary are gathered together in a neat,
readily available package...fuel, building components...etc.  Where as
outside the biological realm this problem get greatly more difficult...sure
 atoms are everywhere...but the RIGHT KINDS of atoms?  That's why we gotta
process mountains of ore to get a little metal...<Ever been to an open-pit
copper mind?  Awesome...<and I don't wann hear about it from you Enviromental
Wackos...shaddap)>  By the time the poor little nanoassembler got his act
together the show would be over.

I keep thinking of Neal Stephenson's "Diamond Age" scenario...I think that
nanotech will come via the Matter Compiler route...and soon <a few YEARS ago
a high school science fair in California was won by.....a fully functional
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope <STM>>

Well...that lets a little of the steam out...I had a lot more to say (I

I prefer to use the term grey goo to denote whatever nanites cause 
indiscriminate destruction. But anyway, nanites could be designed to 
be interested solely in destruction.

Yes. The goo might fight a downhill battle, though, towards a lower 
energy state? It would be interesting to think about this in more 
detail.

My intuitions are exactly the opposite. Your prediction seems to 
presuppose that the first nanopower won't obtain world dominion, an 
assumption I find very dubious. But even if we disregard the genesis 
problem, I still doubt that the situation you describe would 
be stable, though I don't have any short explanation of why I think 
so yet.

What the hell are these nanites living on?!  Their very life requires
energy, not to mention, as Anders noted, the cost of trying to
concentrate extremely diffuse and oxygen-bonded uranium.  Solar
collection will take lots of area, be noticeable, and be exposed.  Shade
it, dust it, bomb it.  Oh, not to mention the probable heat emissions
from all this activity.  We're talking very unstealthy things here.

And they're not living off of rock.  It's hard to get lower energy
states than found in a lot of rock without using nuclear processes.
That's why aluminum mining is so expensive.

I challenge this "lower division" assumption.  Antibodies can't gum up
the works of nanites; phagocytic cells can't enclose and dissolve them?
Hydrogren peroxide and free radicals are popular weapons.  Oxidizing
chemicals vs. small pieces of pure carbon; I bet on the white blood cell.

Remember, life is nanotechnology.  The design is obscure and it's all
wet.  Defensively, the latter is not necessarily a disadvantage.

} > > It is easier to destroy than create!

Yes.  So, is it easier to create nanites in a hostile environment, or
destroy them?  

And is the energy state of diamondoid material higher than that of
organic material?  Probably, in which case this gray goo plague needs
constant input or can only grow by processing lots of material -- which
means that it grows very slowly.

Wait, diamond nanites are attacking diamond skin?  If there's so much
energy for the plague to live on, obviously your outer defense shouldn't
be a hard shell, it should be a friendly counter-plague, like the
friendly flora living on our mucous membranes.

Damn complex plague, building explosives in a coordinated manner.  You
sure it doesn't have internal communiation lines that can be attacked?

I agree, the welfare system is the main cause, the (illegal) immigrants are
the symptom. I don't blame *them*, we'd probably do the same if we were in
their position. As usual, the blame lies with the politicians and (thus)
with the people who elected them  (btw, I don't vote).

That's the way *rational* people would do it...Besides, many of the
immigrants are "illegal", but the government lacks the willpower and
the popular support to take some firm action.

Free immigration could only function in a world with a fairly (culturally,

It may very well be breaking down (slowly), but what will replace it?
Whatever it is, it's probably not much better, if not worse. You seem
to forget that most people aren't "rational libertarian entities", and will
be attracted to the more "extreme" solutions if the situation gets worse. 
I think the last major war is a fine example of that...

No western country, and certainly not Holland, is ruled by theocrats.
State and society are pretty secular. Islam on the other hand is very much
alive and omnipresent in Islamic states. Go live in Iran, and feel the

Are you sure? You're sounding like one of our socialists :)
"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again) in general. Most
"western" countries have either stagnant or even deminishing populations
(-growth), which would be *great* if _all_ ethnic groups did this. As we
all
know, they don't (for cultural/religious reasons). Even this wouldn't be so
bad (just a little overpopulation and related problems), if they had a
belief
system that would resemble our (19th century liberal) model, which values
things like freedom and progress (*no*, we're not perfect either, but
western
societies are generally a better place to live in than say the Arab
countries,
and if there *is* going to be a singularity, it will be a direct result of
the
Euro-American effort and the values that (however compromised) are 
associated with these cultures). Try promoting the extropian principles
in the Middle East or Africa etc, and see how far you'll get...

Yes, they can change either way. But the way it looks *now*, it's "bye,
bye singularity" when the Muslims take over. 
Do you really care so little about your future and freedom? 
The only reason why *some* none-western countries are "keeping up
appearances" when it comes to technological progress and human rights
etc. is because of massive western support/pressure. I really doubt it
whether civilization as we know it (let alone something more advanced)
would hold if Europe and the USA totally collapsed. What do you think?

I don't care about physical appearance, and the "trivial little differences

in culture" are the differences between life and death, extropy and
entropy,
singularity or dark ages, freedom or slavery etc.

There will always be (plenty) of people who'll refuse to get uploaded
into some virtual reality asylum, what about them? Would they be
forced to upload (upload or die!)? After all, if these people had the
same level of technology they could be a serious threat to the virtual
libs. The same goes for "alien" entities. IMHO a democratic system
like the one above is almost by definition a severe handicap in case
of a conflict with "free" outsiders, because while the democrates are
busy debating and voting, the enemy has already launched his proton
torpedoes or whatever. 

What would happen if someone trashed the robot (the only outside link),
would the VRs be trapped in their "dreamworld" forever?

Anyway, I think the only way you can stay reasonably free *and* safe is
when everybody (possibly in small like-minded groups) leaves earth and goes
in different directions. A 1.000.000 lightyears or so seem (with the
current laws of physics) like a pretty safe barrier. Maybe by the
time we run out of "space" (if this is possible at all), we'll also be
smart
enough to avoid an all-out conflict (Universal War 1).

An asteroid could hit in a matter of seconds, we wouldn't have much chance of
survival.  The influx of nanotechnology will be a slow and controlled
process, new technologies are always looked upon with caution.  If
destructive nanites were released today that would be an 'enormous disaster'.
 But nanotech will slowly find its way into everyday life, the ability to
create and protect will increase with the ability to destroy.  It's likely
that destructive nanotech could be nothing more than a cold when up against
our advanced immune systems.  These immune systems could have far more
computing power than any nanite, and will be able to outwit even the most
advanced destructive force.  And why keep the immune system within the body?
 It could do survailence work, tell you if any nukes are being built in your
area and launch a preemptive strike!

Before we start uploading ourselves and only communicating with the outside
world via democratic robots, think of nanotech's ability to update us.  If
only 1 in a million people are crazy enough and clever enough to 'goo' us,
then network the million sane minds to create a defensive system.  Putting
the power in the hands of one person or one organisation is a great way to
get yourself killed.  Distributing that power through the masses may seem
like suicide, but it's the only route to survival.

Good point, but AFAIK we've still found few stars which have such planets;
some (many?) of the other stars could still have planets which are just
too small to see.

Hmm, I'm not sure of the theory you're quoting, but if it's what I think
it is (that Jupiter pulls comets into the inner solar system when they
wouldn't otherwise come here) then I guess it would depend on whether the
gas giant is better at 'hoovering up' passing comets or pulling new ones
in. I can't see an obvious reason for preferring one possibility over the
other.

I think media coverage of this kind benefits governments (especially the US
government).  It gives people hope, "if we could just stop the government
shooting kids in Mexico, everything would be okay" and stops them from seeing
the bigger picture (ie you're getting screwed).

Some time ago the EPA (FDA, FFA, ERA, SPCA,NAACP <<????>>> I dunno...one of
them gubment sneaky snakes) decided it needed to ban smoking...for our own
good you know...and mandated right there in the constitution...(the third
extension to the left of the fourth penumbra from the right.)

So it decided to do a pissylogical study <surely this name is not right...it
makes too much sense>...The first time it did it using scientifically
accepted norms and practices...99% confidence interval and all that.

Well that didn't work...nothing showed...didn't get the results they wanted..
So do it again...throw out a few studies...lower the confidence
interval...stuff like that..well it didn't work again...and again.

But ...FINALLY..(gotta give them boys and girls credit...they're persistent)
they got a %30 percent chance of getting some kind of respiritory ailment
from "second hand" smoke.  That's more like it....why we can pass all kinds
of legislation, rules...etc...and generally interfere with peoples lives and
collect more taxes.

Which is what they proceeded to do...the Attornies General suite against the
Tubacker Industry is a case in point...<Attornies General is just another
name for crooked politician...why should we expect them to be moral or
ethical?>

Meanwhile....another pissylogical study was done <<<loooove that wordd>>>>

It had to do with the relation ship between abortions and breast cancer in
women.  These folks were a little more ethical than the gubment crowd...they
run the study right...

And guess what?  100% better chance of a young lady getting breast cancer
later in life if she has had an abortion than not.

Ooooops....that is NOT politically correct....whatawe gonna do?

Tell the truth?  Yeah...that'll work...fool 'em...they ain't expecting that
from us.

In pissylogical studies (so I understand) anything less than 100% is just
noise...100% is considered "weak"...so the pro-abortion types told the
truth...saying that there was only a "weak" link betwen abortion and breast
cancer...(never mind that that weak link has been verified by numerous
studies...internationally)

And now all the liberals are happy...

Meanwhile...one of the other alphabet soup agencies wants more power and
authority...so they gotta plan...toughen the Air Quality Standards...and lets
by pass Congress to do it...after all they're elected...subject to voter
pressure and all that...we'll get the Philander in Chief to sign an executive
order...

Which he did..

.but this gubment agency is very reluctant to show anyone the studies that
supposedly confirms the need for the for the new tougher (and very, very,
very expensive standards...probably put a lot of companies out of
business...and make things 15 times more expensive than they oughta be rather
than ten times as they are now)..

Kinda neat huh?

100% is "weak"- no need to be alarmed
30% is grounds for lawsuits and regulations
(?)% is good enough for forcing the whole economy to its knees...<for the
children...don't you know>

Just another example of Truth...Justice...and the Liberal Way.

   08/25/97
   
   By Charles Ornstein / The Dallas Morning News 
   The Kaufman County sheriff, reacting to a botched drug raid last week
   in which deputies stormed the wrong Terrell house and strip-searched
   two innocent women, has replaced his head narcotics investigator and
   vowed Sunday to take other action to prevent such mistakes.
   
   Sheriff Robert Harris said Sunday that Capt. George Pelphrey will no
   longer head the department's narcotics investigations. The sheriff
   said he hasn't decided whether he will further discipline Capt.
   Pelphrey, a 15-year department veteran, for approving last Tuesday's
   raid of June Nixon's house on Sue Lane.
   
   Ms. Nixon, 57, and her 28-year-old daughter, Melissa Cheek, were
   watching television about 7 p.m. Tuesday when 15 Kaufman County
   deputies burst through the front door.
   
   They handcuffed both women, and then a female deputy strip-searched
   them in front of Ms. Cheek's 6-year-old daughter, Sheriff Harris said.
   
   Capt. Pelphrey, who heads the criminal investigation division, could
   not be reached for comment Sunday. But the sheriff defended the
   officer's record.
   
   "He's very well-informed, he's very well-trained and he's done an
   outstanding job over the years," Sheriff Harris said. "This is just
   one of those things that we have to investigate to see if maybe he
   didn't do everything he should have done. We just don't know that."
   
   The real drug suspects, who live down the street, watched the raid
   from their front lawn, Sheriff Harris said, and laughed as deputies
   passed by. Those suspects had not been arrested by Sunday, but the
   sheriff said they would be.
   
   The deputies realized that they had entered the wrong home when they
   did not find weapons or drugs on Ms. Nixon or Ms. Cheek, the sheriff
   said. Officers offered to fix the front door, he said, but Ms. Nixon,
   a schoolteacher, turned down the help.
   
   Ms. Nixon and her daughter would not speak to reporters Sunday. Their
   lawyer, Hunt Bonneau of Dallas, said they were considering a lawsuit
   against Kaufman County.
   
   "They're your all-American family," Mr. Bonneau said. "That's what's
   scary about this. You elect your officials and you pay those guys to
   protect you. And those are the very people that are coming in and
   intruding on you. We're all kind of in awe at this point."
   
   Sheriff Harris said he will finish an investigation into the incident
   Monday or Tuesday. He won't decide on any action against Capt.
   Pelphrey until then, he said. No other officers are under
   investigation, the sheriff said.
   
   The sheriff also said he would now personally review any search
   warrants requested by his officers. He said he hasn't done that in the
   past.
   
   "I will take a tremendously active role in reviewing the investigative
   portion before the execution of any search warrant is approved,"
   Sheriff Harris said. "I want to make sure that I am hitting the right
   premises."
   
   In last Tuesday's raid, the sheriff said, "I know we hit the wrong
   house and there was some reason for it."
   
   Investigators are supposed to check addresses at the post office,
   confirm them with water and electric records and then conduct
   surveillance at the prospective home, he said. Some of those things
   apparently were not done, Sheriff Harris said.
   
   Mr. Bonneau said his clients' civil rights were violated. He said he
   is waiting on the results of his own investigation this week before
   deciding whether to file a lawsuit against the county.
   
   He said he doesn't understand how the mistake could have happened.
   
   "With all the access to information that the government has, this type
   of thing shouldn't happen unless there is a lack of due diligence
   there," Mr. Bonneau said Sunday. "Our task is to make sure where the
   breakdown was - who was lazy - and to make sure it doesn't happen
   again."
   
   The lawyer said Ms. Nixon has lived in the house for more than 30
   years. Neither she nor her daughter has a criminal history, Mr.
   Bonneau said.
   
   The Kaufman County deputies did not show a search warrant when they
   entered the house, he said, and were "pretty invasive" during the
   strip search.
   
   Ms. Nixon and Ms. Cheek repeatedly told tactical officers that they
   were law-abiding citizens, Sheriff Harris said. But because
   investigators hear that all the time from true criminals, they
   continued with their search, he said.
   
   "We've arrested people 70 years old, who look like your typical
   grandmother, for cooking drug labs," he said. "The physical appearance
   of an individual doesn't always denote if they are narcotics
   traffickers."
   
   Kaufman County Commissioner Rod Kinkaid said he was troubled by the
   incident.
   
   "It appears to be something very serious and something that we need to
   make sure never happens again," said Mr. Kinkaid, who has served for
   more than two years. "I'd like to know what really did go wrong and
   what the details are so corrective action can be taken."
   
   Several searches by Kaufman County sheriff's deputies - one drug raid
   and one arrest involving underage drinking - have drawn attention in
   recent years.
   
   In 1989, Sheriff Harris publicly apologized to two families for a raid
   that turned up no drugs but left two houses damaged and family members
   shaken.
   
   Three years ago, county officials agreed to revise some rules on the
   handling of prisoners after parents of Highland Park High School
   students sued the county. The parents contended that officers
   illegally entered private property and raided a teenage party to raise
   money in fines. The county paid $65,000 in legal costs, under terms of
   the settlement.
   
   Sheriff Harris said his department is competent and frequently trains
   rural sheriff's deputies in other Texas counties. During his 12 years
   as sheriff, his office has confiscated more than $40 million in
   illegal drugs, he said. Deputies will not stop going after drug
   targets following this incident, the sheriff said.
   
   "We're one of the best trained sheriff's departments in Texas," he
   said. "Our officers work hard. They have a large work load. If you
   make one mistake, you are certainly going to be criticized for it,
   much more than the praise you get for all the good things you do."
   
   As for the actual drug suspects on Ms. Nixon's street, Sheriff Harris
   said: "We're not going to take them off the list."

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[This isn't an advertisement, by the way:  it's a request for participation ]

I own an Atari Falcon (1993), which I use for everything I do now.

I bought it in mint condition, for UKP 100 from a private forensics
science consultant on CIX -- http://www.cix.co.uk -- whose pride and joy it 
was. It's essentially a modest single-board 'supercomputer.'

It was the last of Atari Corporation's own home computers.  It's a
computer buff's machine.

It's a multimedia, desktop publishing, graphic arts (I've got APEX), games
and educational and business and Internet platform.  There are tens of
thousands of solid programmes and utilities for it _for free_, and a
thriving worldwide network of Atari computing enthusiasts.

It has the German NVDI which triples the display speed, with beautifully
scaleable font selections.

Atari Corporation is now defunct -- bad marketing and financial management.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

This is the 'Great Idea':

The Falcon looks like a big, slightly boxy but elegant standalone
keyboard. That's it!  It outputs RF or video direct to TV, or to a mono
monitor, or a graphics-quality monitor. It operates in up to 65,000
colours from a palette of 262,144.

[ OK, Russell, it's not a Silicon Graphics WorkStation! ]

It runs Motorola 680x0 processors (CD Hades clones run 68060s).

It has a solid OS and GIU, develooped from Digital Research's CP/M 68K in
250k. of ROM, and it ordinarily has 1 to 14 megs of RAM.  You can do the
Internet on a 1 meg. Falcon!  (On a 1 meg  ST with a single floppy,
actually.  There are nice integrated WWW suites in just 250k of code. I've
worked run thiogs this way! Quite feasible, if a bit heavy on
disk-swapping, though).

It loads the OS and GUI into RAM, and puts you  straight to
the desktop with no disks at all!

(The Germans at Magic! have an even more compact pre-emptive multi-tasking
operating OS and GUI for it, coded in hand-optimized Motorola assembler,
which is taught in European technical colleges, and running up to five
times faster).

It has full 32Mhz. 56001 DSP facilities, enabling downloadable SoftModems
and protocol upgrades.  EXTERNAL I/O, too!

It has a Motorola maths and floating-point co-processor.

It has a socket for an Intel processor, for PC emulation.

It has an internal expansion connector: upgrade to ISA and/or PCI.

It has stereo digital sound in and out. Therefore it can handle voice
command and 100wpm. text input too, given the software.

It has SCSI II, LAN, RS232,  parallel, MIDI, expanded joysticks and
controller ports, ROM cartridge port...

It has an internal 1.44 meg. 3.5 floppy drive (which reads PC disks too).
There's an existing world-wide network of online Atari enthusiasts.

There's tens of thousands of programmes online, every conceivable kind of
mature software (ST's have been around for over ten years), nearly all of
it free or shareware.  There are top-flight commercial packages too.  Most
of them are online.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

It doesn't 'fall over' all the time like Windoze, and it's easy to fix.

It _doesn't_ have 'back doors', latent viruses, and routines which can be
remotely activated to scan your hard drive and interleave outgoing data
packets to a destination other than whatever you're accessing.

It doesn't clutter up your living-room.

And it goes like lightning.

[ FX: "FLASH!!!" ]

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
So we redesign the case.

We redesign the motherboard a bit.  Several people doing this already,
especially Computer Direct in Alberta, Canada, the best in the 
business.

      http://www.compdirect.com

 Shiraz Shivji (NeXt, Apple), designed the first ST then quit Atari 
 Corporation).

We move the power supply (smallish -- loads of people produce such things
for next to nothing) out into to the power cable (handy for differing
local voltages) and input low DC voltage instead. A bit safer and easier to 
replace or upgrade, too.

We removve the internal IDE or SCSI II Hard Drive.

We substitute rear bays for:

An optional plug-and-play internal ZIP drive

An optional Hard Drive

An optional internal plug-and-play CD-ROM.

An optional radiomodem.

We source good-quality clonemakers.  It's a relatively simple design, and 
there's a fair amount of spare capacity around ATM.

We talk nicely to Motorola, asking them to keep the US government off our
case, please!  And to provide organizational and technical support.

      http://www.motorola.com

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

We then have a basic, cheap Internet machine -- a WebTV and Network Computer 
_and_ a standalone personal computer/Work Station, with full expansion and 
upgrade capability to top Graphics Works Station level.

The later Atari STe (same case but lesser internals) sold for 150 UKP retail. 
Everything's gotten cheaper since then.

You can carry it home in a smallish box with a handle.

Plug into the mains, connect to your TV aerial socket with a two-way
pre-emptive switchbox, or into an SVGA monitor, as you wish.

Plug an ordinary phone jackplug into the back.

And you're off!!!

Now sit back in your armchair:

Point a cheap ($10?) optical wand at the screen to move the cross-hairs
around, and click.

You're onto the Internet!

Add an internal ZIP drive?  No problem.

Or an internal Hard Drive?  Of whatever capacity?  Easy-peasy.

CD-ROM drive?  Easy.

You want a memory upgrade to _1 gig_?  Computer Direct will oblige!

WHAT?  What about all those famous stories where a GA does in 28 steps what a
human could only do in 31?  GAs produce code that's tight where ours is
bloated, and bloated where ours is tight.  Hence the double cycle.

Well, there's a couple of questions I'd pose about nuclear nanotech:

1)  Can mini-assemblers build mini-thermonuclear devices?  If you have 10
grams instead of kilograms, but you still put the deuterium at the center and
jacket with U-238, could you get the same effect?  What about custom-assembled
crystals that will collapse easily and tightly... maybe laced with water to
slow neutrons down?

2)  What about direct fusion devices?  Inertial confinement would be my guess.
 Take the deuterium and imprison it inside a fullerene-bracketed block of
diamond, then apply a large energy pulse, perhaps from an enormously efficient
quantum-well laser.

3)  Given either of the two above, could you build a REALLY HUGE thermonuclear
bomb, perhaps by surrounding the item with a huge U-238 crystal?  Direct the
blast in a specific direction using the properties of crystals, maybe with a
bit of quantum mechanics mixed in?  Use the blast to pump a graser?

In other words, nanotechnology operates as close to the level of nuclear
reactions as we operate to the level of chemical explosives.  I can't help but
think that there will be similar improvements in technology.  Shaped charges. 
Fuel-air-explosives.  You get the idea.  Only some tiny fraction of atoms fizz
or fuse.  Maybe with a properly shaped crystal, perhaps utilizing a few
quantum properties to guide neutrons or arrange collisions, you could improve
that by an order of magnitude.

I speculate that nanotechnology will result in an improvement in nuclear
weapons comparable with the superiority of TNT over gunpowder, for similar
reasons.  And while some of the quantum calculations above may seem rather
numerically intense, remember that the calculations will probably be done on
quantum computers.

I don't see why.  First of all, they'll be able to construct explosives
completely to order.  But let's be conservative and figure that they use TNT. 
I'm far from an expert on explosives... but couldn't you get a bit of an
improvement by detonating the ENTIRE bomb with electronic synchronization, so
that the entire blast arrives time-on-target?  A shock wave is just that, a
wave.  So modern TNT is a huge splash made up a lot of little uncoordinated
splashes, while nanotech TNT is the precisely synchronized sum of all those
splashes.  Almost exactly like the distinction between a light bulb and a laser.

Like, say, lightspeed?  Or thermodynamics?  My "workarounds" page for things
like that is still up.  Again, I'm trying to point out that a bit of
imagination is necessary to see the enormous destructive potentials here.  I
think we can safely extrapolate a *little* bit beyond current capabilities. 
Most of what you're saying has nanotech being less dangerous than modern
technology.  I can't help but compare this to the old saw about "Atomic
technology may someday equal the capabilities of present bombs, but it is
unlikely to produce anything more dangerous."  [Paraphrase.]

It could go either way.  Maybe the bad guys kidnap all the scientists and then
use pain-center stimulation to achieve faster results.  Idealism may win
battles and break ties, but it is not a defense to be trusted.

Alternatively, it might only have to take over a single power base.  Your
question assumes that the goo, once detected, is doomed.  My version assumes
that the goo, once established, is undefeatable.  This is pretty much what
we're arguing.

How can I make quantitative comparisions between systems that don't exist? 
I'm just trying to point out the qualitative causal forces at work.  When
we're finished cataloguing, we could try to set up a quantitative comparision,
bearing in mind that it would be utterly false-to-fact and useful only for
speculative purposes.

Isn't diamond something that can be set on fire at sufficient temperatures? 
Isn't the crystal fragile when properly angled forces are directed against it?
 How much of an insulator is it for temperature?  What about gamma rays?

Sealed by what?  If it's better than diamond, why not surround the whole body
with it?  If the sealant is worse than diamond, or is diamond, why wouldn't
anything capable of penetrating the external wall go right through the sealant?

What detector mechanism are you using?  Can I falsely trigger it over the
entire body, thus making the "detector" useless and redundant?  If sealed-off
areas are easier to attack, wouldn't the false alarm let me peel off an entire
layer?  And why couldn't I just repeat the action until you were the size of
an apple core?

Okay, so you've made the problem of immunity recursive on immunity for a
single section.  This may actually be an excellent plan of defense, allowing
for partial breaches and reserves.  But a design for an immune system it's not.

Okay, I see a trend developing in your plan.  Detection is the important
thing; it's assumed that pockets of infection, once detected, can be
obliterated.  Very much like the human immune system.  But if viruses could
outfight white blood cells, we'd be dead.  I'll conceed that fooling detection
might be made difficult, almost impossible, through the use of digital
signatures.  But again - how do you keep a single cell from being penetrated? 
Once a cell is penetrated, you destroy it - but does the destruction keep the
infection from spreading?  A single spore might be defeated by this strategy. 
A sea of gray goo won't be.

No comment.  Part of it isn't very complicated, given digital signatures. 
Nor, as far as I know, can a nanotech penetrate a wall invisibly.  I'll
concede you perfect detection.  For this discussion, it's the fight I care about.

Why shouldn't the infected compartment terminate a nearby one with extreme
prejudice, and do it first?  As far as I can tell, your strategy simply lets
me destroy your entire complex cell by cell.  Penetrate a cell, watch it go up
in flame... repeat.

And the gray goo can do likewise... but it has more resources, since it
surrounds the city.

> So, what are the obvious holes?

The real obvious one is this.  Your immune system - any immune system
conceived along these lines - requires that two nanosystems fight each other
to a standstill.  If two nanosystems fight and destroy each other, then any
city in an island of gray goo is doomed.  The goo simply makes repeated
attacks, and each time, the city shrinks a little.  We won't even speak of
such horrors as cutting off that city's solar power.

In short, the immune system requires that *defense* have an advantage over
*offense*.  I can conceive of any number of ways that this could happen.  I
shall now proceed to list them.

The most obvious way is to have a symmetrical battle.  Two systems battle. 
They destroy each other.  A small no-mans-zone is created.  But then, both
city and sea expand into the zone at the same rate, gobbling atoms as they go.
 If more nano is required to destroy than to defend, even by a small amount,
then the city actually builds up more raw material as it goes along.  Maybe
ditto for energy reserves.  Depends on the details of the molecular landscape.

Then there's the barrier whose surface is stronger than the amount of energy
that could be concentrated on any one point.  There are two opposing forces
here.  First of all, the barrier is dispersed and the energy is concentrated. 
But the barrier is deep, while the energy might be a single pulse.  Depends on
the details of the molecular battleground.  A miniature swords-vs.-armor thing.

Moravec has a great discussion of exotic forms of matter(1).  "Higgsium" is
1e18 times as dense as water; "Monopolium" is 1e25 times as dense.  My
impression was that Higgsium might be hard to penetrate, even using Higgsium
projectiles; only Monopolium would suffice.  With Higgsium and without
Monopolium, then, any area taken might be easy to hold onto.  With Monopolium,
the reverse is true.

Similarly - and here I speculate without knowledge - there might be a way to
give a material an unbreakable "quantum surface tension".  Or subbaryonic
picotechnology - "chromatic technology" - might use "quark barriers", surfaces
as unbreakable as a proton.  (From what I know of quantum chromodynamics, this
is incredibly unlikely.  The bubble would have to be pushed out by truly
inconceivable forces; pre-Plank-time Big-Bang-type forces.  But hey, what do I know?)

Then there's the simple possibility, dependent on molecular details of which I
know nothing, that defense on the molecular level has an innate advantage over
offense.  Certain molecules or nano-screens might simply be easier to form
than to break, just like atoms or quarks.  As long as it is theoretically
possible to pierce the screen, the possibility of piecemeal destruction
remains - unless the screen is easier to "heal" around the breach, regaining
the broken area.  Or the screen might be theoretically impossible to breach,
which is what I've been speculating about all along.

For that matter, one can speculate about a zone of space being made friendly
to one force and hostile to another - maybe with electrical power being
transmitted along scrambled frequencies; a carefully targeted attack or
resource.  Maybe, even after a nuke in that area, the zone would be more
quickly regained.  If attack requires "opening" to an opposite attack, or
breaching a zone, then the city might regain more than it lost.  But this
seems unlikely.  I can't really envision a "zone" that a nuke wouldn't
destroy.  The only plausible persistent zoning would be the property of being
surrounded by the good forces, rather than the bad forces.  Which means that
the bad forces can peel the good guys like a potato; each time an attack
occurs, a convexly curved surface turns flat.

Nanosystems are always faced with "destruction by induction".  That is, you
can always destroy one cell; therefore you can destroy the whole thing.  To
defend against this, it is required that the system expand faster than the
destruction OR that it be impossible to destroy one cell.

This actually opens up a whole new vista of defense.  If a city has an innate
advantage over the sea where expansion is concerned - if a compact form beats
an englobing one, perhaps due to internal bracing or some such - the city can
easily and quickly regain any area lost, even break into space and escape.

I also speculated along similar lines in two places earlier; one with healing
shields, another with the city grabbing the additional mass required to attack
rather than defend.

Speaking of escape, there's another workaround for "destruction by induction".
 If you run into space, the gray goo might hurl itself after you, but it won't
have the overwhelming resources required for "destruction by induction".  In
addition, the effort of destruction might simply provide the city with a
velocity boost.  Certainly things in space will be different than on the ground.

--

So there are a lot of immune systems, just as there are many forms of attack. 
It's just that defense being favored over attack requires too much exotic
technology; the exotic attack technologies are far more conservative than the
exotic defense technologies.  The majority of strategic considerations are in
favor of attack; the only really hopeful strategic consideration is the city
being able to quickly expand into rich zones of destruction.

Ergo, it is easier to destroy than create.

Corporate adaptivity is an enormous problem. If corporations
cannot adapt quickly enough, the economy could fail
catastrophically. However, I believe that the financial system
is even more vulnerable to rapid change, and that most individual
humans are more vulnerable still. In particular, until quite
recently, an individual who learned his or her parent's skills
could find a job. Today, I would be unemployable if my skill set
was limited to the skills I had ten years ago. Thus, historical
analogy is of limited usefulness here.

If there is any interest in this subject, perhaps we could set
up an outline and decide what subtopics should be investigated.
Alternatively, we can just free-flow as we usually do, but in
about a week we can summarize and then fill in the gaps.

OK, a clarification. What you refer to is likely Tierra, where long 
initial organisms evolve into shorter organisms due to competition for
scarce memory. I was referring to commonly used GA algorithms (the
Lisp-like trees invented by Koza), where there usually are no size
constraints. 

If you make small programs more fit, small programs will evolve, but
if you keep the size contraint they will not evolve well (that needs
a large genome/code). So a better solution is to first evolve big and
baroque programs, and then make size more and more relevant, creating
shorter, less correct but more efficient programs. I read
some amazing results where they got 2-3 instruction programs that solved
a myoelectrical pattern recognition problem rather well this way! Of
course, in the case of immune systems you would not care much about the
code size.

No. A fission bomb is based on the creation of a critical mass, where the
growth of neutron flux due to fission is larger than the loss into the 
surroundings. Unless nanotech could build a neutron reflector (which I
doubt is physically possible?) it would still need several kilograms of
fissible material.

Doesn't sound very likely, although I'm more iffy on the physics here. First,
the entire structure would have to be macroscopic in order to do any damage,
so there is no real need to use fancy fullerenes to keep the hydrogen in.
And you would need to store enough energy for the laser, and somehow compress
almost all of the hydrogen, not just a small pellet (ah, thats the problem!)
which seems to be nearly impossible to do using laser light.

Well, you could always pile up as much U and deuterium as you wanted around
it. The extra U would not really do much except make it dirtier (it will
mainly be blown away by the explosion instead of fissioned), but the
deuterium would add to the blast (that is why you can make fusion bombs
as large as you want). 

Directed nuclear explosions doesn't sound likely, since at present we
are relying on random nuclear fission with no preferred direction. If
we could make neutron mirrors things might get different.

That is likely, if there is an interest. But remember that nanotech isn't
much closer to the nuclear level than we are - it still cannot interface
directly with it, just move the atoms around. There are fundamental
physical problems here we need to look into to get the nano-nukes.

But where does the energy in the explosives come from? Remember conservation
of energy - when you make explosives you have to add energy beside the
chemical energy of the raw material to make the energetic but unstable
TNT molecules (electrical energy -> chemical energy). The same is true for
the nanites - if they want to turn a lawn into a bomb, they need more
energy than will be released in the eventual blast.

I think something like this is done already, although not with the nano
precision you suggest. You might improve the current state a bit, but it
is likely not a quantum leap.

What I am trying to do is theoretical applied science - using known laws
of physics to discuss what can and cannot be done. You can always say that
unknown quantum effects will circumvent all that, but it is an empty
speculation until you show that these unknown effects really do exist. 
Note that we should speculate beyond current *capabilities*, not current
*physics*.

Well, if that turns out to be history's judgement on my part in this thread,
so be it. But remember, there were people expecting a cure for the common
cold in the early 70's too...

I would like to get some expert in on this, since my medical knowledge is
more neuroscientific than immunological (I'm not an immunologist, I just
pretend on the net :-). Basically, the immune system is programmed to
destroy, destroy, destroy - everything. But during the complex process
where white blood cells are bred the cells that would kill unsuitable
things (like each other, the body etc) are weeded out, as are the "meek"
cells. The rest are just barely tamed, and will with no hesitation destroy
any cell that doesn't show the right antigens, and everything in the
vicinity.

Or maybe the good guys spread a nanite which give all bad guys migraine
when they think evil thoughts. Get real, this sort of unrealistic Hollywood

It seems so. But as others have pointed out, your claim that destruction is
fundamentally more efficient than creation suggests that if I know about
your goo I can destroy it.

We can't do any cataloguing based on a priori ideas (qualitative causal forces),
we need something more solid than that. I prefer theoretical applied science,
it allows us to compare not-yet-existing systems.

Yes, but so is almost everything. I never said I would sketch an 
*invulnerable* system, just a sufficiently strong system. For any immense
shielding I can come up with you could always invoke an even greater 
cosmological disaster ("But your immune system can't stand a supernova!").
This exercise is trying to look at defenses against gray goo, which
is the real problem, not macro-level warfare. 

Diamond is an useful start, but as an outer skin I would actually use something
more inert.

> Isn't the crystal fragile when properly angled forces are directed against it?

This is a mere matter of design, I don't think diamond crystal is the best
way to go, more likely a flexible matrix of jointed diamondoids. 

>  How much of an insulator is it for temperature?  What about gamma rays?

It conducts heat well, and as far as I know is transparent for gamma rays.
But you are not seriously suggesting grey goo radiating gamma rays?
(that would BTW be very bad for the goo too, since nanites are radiation
sensitive; and I could have radiation shielding in the skin while the
goo would be unprotected (since grey goo carrying around lead is easy
to find and exterminate by taking it away)).

Diamond does quite nicely here, although even more inert materials would
do better. The breaches can be of two kinds, a strong
external force making its way in, and in that case we are talking about
macro level defense and offense again, or nanites forcing their way through
the walls. In the later case, they would need energy to breach the
walls if they are inert, and it would be exothermic for the defenders to
thicken their walls. If they turned the surrounding compartments into
a "diamondoid scar" the energy in the infected compartment would not
be enough to breach the barrier, and the whole infection would require
a lot of external support (which could be broken).

I have been thinking of having nanometer "pipes" criss-crossing the barrier, 
containing linear molecules which break or vibrate when interfered with. You 
cannot detect them from the outside (just diamond, and then an opening - 
oops!), and the signal into the compartment will give information about 
where something is going on.

Sounds like something that could be designed away. OK, I haven't yet
tried to sketch how the control systems ought to look (I haven't got the
time even for doing this discussion properly! :-( ). The software
part is of course even more important than the hardware part.

But basically, if you trigger all the surface cells, don't you think the
system will immediately (assuming some intelligence somewhere) guess
the strategy?

It is a partial solution, and makes the problem more manageable. The body
uses something fairly similar with its internal barriers (it is surprising
how strong the blood-brain barrier is, even adrenaline can't get through!).

A sea of gray goo is also a macro-level problem. It is obvious, it can
be fought on the macro level (meaning that human or transhuman intelligence
have the time and space to implement defenses not just based on what their
ordinary immune systems can do, but also their other available resources). 
For example, it wouldn't appear impossible to nanofacture "antibodies",
very simple nanites which disrupt the goo nanites, en masse once the goo
is understood. 

I have noticed that your approach seems to be that when subtle attacks
doesn't work, you invoke maximum overkill instead. But that takes a lot
of resources, and can often be disrupted more easily than a subtle attack
(compare "AAARGH! The goo has my password!" to "Ouch, this goo is corrosive,
let's wash it away in a shower of hydrogen peroxide").

Thank you. Let's go down to the real battle - dismantling nanites.

Hmm, like Stalingrad? ;-) You assume that the destroyed cell will no
longer be a problem. But what if it turned into a cube of inert diamondoid?
Then it would also be a hinder, and give me even more time to develop
countermeasures. 

I see that I have been a bit too defensive (I usually am in strategy),
since you are right in that just slowing the advance of the goo won't
win the fight. So, to get back to how the body works, I'll better
develop antibodies and macrophages. 

An antibody would be a very simple device that sabotages a certain nanite.
It could be a molecule that binds and then tends to stick to other
antibodies, trapping the goo nanites as dimers or polymers. A macrophage is
simply a selective disassebler, which destroys a certain kind of nanite
or structure. Assuming I have detected the infection the next step would
be to make antibodies and macrophages against it, and start spreading them.
Note that they would be produced faster than the goo since the goo would
have to both reproduce, breach security and defend itself while the 
antibodies and macrophages would just be produced (although a goo-like
macrophage is an interesting and dangerous concept) and sent on their way.

I think you are thinking too much of ants fighting here. I see it more
as chemistry, especially protein interactions. It is much easier to make
something which binds goo into an inert mass than to build a goo eater.

An isolated immune system in a world where nobody else has immune systems
is weaker than a system in a world where nanodefenses are common. The ultimate
defense would of course be to have immune systems everywhere, defending
not just the transhumans but the himalayas, squirrels and grass. A bit like
the current state in biology, really.

Yes, this is the crux. I contend that defense is easier.

OK, but at this level I simply escape into my own basement universe (Mitch

unexpected ambushes). Dragons vs. invisible pink unicorns again?

Good point. There are certainly some molecules which are much easier to
break than to form, and hence allows me to make good detection systems or
nanites whose programming is erased if they are opened. I think there might
be some structures which are very troublesome to destroy on the nano level.

Or that you can make the loss of a finite number of cells bearable. If their
loss removes the threat (for example by forming a nanoscar), then the
defense side will win.

Another good point. While I believe in active shields, space is IMHO the only

Hmm, we still disagree. I don't see why you have to invoke exotic technology
for this. But I think we have touched on some of the most important
aspects of nano-warfare, and to quote Arnie, "I'll be back". Let's try
to get some real nanotechnologists, immunologists and strategists into
this discussion.

It wasn't an arms-race until the government made it one.  Compare:

On one side, we have the Weaver family who were well armed but minding
their own business.  Nobody has credibly claimed that they were a 
threat to the government or anyone else.  Certainly they never attacked 
any official.  On the other side, we have federal agents who blackmailed
Randy Weaver, and when they came to arrest him, *killed his dog* before
anyone knew they were there.  (When Weaver's son shot back he was killed,
and never knew who killed him.)  Who's the threat?

Then there's Don Scott, a millionaire who lived near Malibu.  Government 
agencies paid someone to say he saw marijuana growing on Scott's land so 
they could seize it.  They broke down his door at midnight, without 
warning.  Scott got out of bed with a gun (a little revolver, I believe) 
but without his eyeglasses -- not a smart move, but when you're awakened 
by a battering-ram, it's easy to make mistakes.  They killed him.  
(No dope was found.)  Who's the threat?

: If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,
: cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.

Well then, let's get rid of the cops.  After all, they kill in error 
far more often than non-cops do.

In the real world, a number of states recently made it easier for 
ordinary people to carry guns, and violent crime *declined*.  (Not
including some of the most populous states, so overall U.S. numbers 
are still rising.)

: In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.
: our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).

Only 15 times?  If guns were the problem, the factor ought to be
a lot more than 15, because the rate of gun ownership differs by
more than that.

You also have a less fanatical War On Minority Drugs.
U.S. murder rates declined steadily from the repeal of (alcohol) 
Prohibition (1933) until the Sixties; since then, they have risen steeply.

That decline was *not* interrupted by the return of millions of soldiers
with their trophy guns.  The subsequent increase was *not* interrupted
by the Gun Control Act of 1968, or any other gun control legislation.

: Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the
: private ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns
: and such has something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that
: between 1965 and 1975 more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in
: the US (10 for every American killed in 'nam).

And even more than that were killed by medical negligence.
Shall we outlaw the practice of medicine?  
(Hillary is working on it, but that's another thread)

How many of those half-million were shot by police?
How many were shot by citizens in self-defense?

How many crimes were *prevented* because a citizen demonstrated
the ability to defend himself?  Nobody counts those, but they're
estimated at more than a million each year.

: For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns

Tell it to the German Jews.  They had no guns 
and they trusted their government a little bit.

Are you seriously suggesting that our government would *begin* to 
behave decently if we turn in our guns?

(Maybe you can trust your government because it's so much nearer.

Government also lacks the ability, incompetence is not always a bad thing.

Nonsense. There are lots of menial tasks that need to be done around my house,
they need no special skills and I would be happy to pay somebody a dollar an
hour to perform them, but not more, I won't pay minimum wage because to me
it's only worth a dollar an hour. There are millions if not billions of
people in the world who would consider a dollar an hour wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice. Both of us would be better off if we could get together,
but one thing prevents us, government.

As for cultural differences preventing free immigration, if I found a culture
to be unpleasant then I wouldn't want to go to that land, if I didn't then I
would.  What's the problem?

I have not forgotten, the market can not guarantee a libertarian society,
nothing can, but it can encourage it. Suppose government did not force you to 
buy law and police protection from them, suppose there was competition and you
could purchase the laws you liked from companies that were willing to enforce
them. It's easy to vote for some idiot politician who says he will stop your
neighbor from sinning, it's much harder to shell out cold hard cash for it.
For example, in this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing
string bikinis on the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty of 
prudes and it doesn't cost them anything to vote. Now let's consider this if
justice was sold as a commodity. The prude is considering 2 protection
companies that are identical except one has a law against bikinis and a
decency patrol to harass women on the beach 20 miles from his home, the other
doesn't but uses the money saved to send an extra security patrol through his
neighborhood at 3Am. The prude would have to be very prudish indeed to pick
the first Private Protection Agency.  Justice is no different than anything
else, if you want to maximize it sell it in a free market.

              
        >"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again)

"Cool", what a word to describe blowing up the Sun. :)

About fusing He-3 and N-15 in the core: haven't you just reinvented the
"helium flash", a phase in the normal evolution of stars?  My
recollection
is that according to the accepted models of solar evolution there is a
very brief phase when all the He-3 that accumulates in the core during
the H-burning phase ignites, and the fusion rate goes as temperature to
some obscene power, that's why they call it a "flash".  I'm a bit
suspicious of your estimate of the time required for the sphere to reach 
the core, because the effect of the helium flash is supposed to
propagate
to the surface for thousands of years (i.e. nothing spectacular can be
seen on the surface).  I understand that you're hoping to keep the bomb
in solid state all the way, but so many orders of magnitude still make
me
nervous...  Also, even if it does reach the core and ignites, the output
is still gaseous and has to travel upwards for ages.  (Unless you can 
collect neutrinos, of course.  :)

Not yet, and the first web version will be in swedish. We spent
a weekend coming up with the scenarios, but then nobody took
up the job of writing them up (I have a pile of very good notes
here), so eventually I got fed up and began the work myself;
due to time limitations it will take a while. But they will appear,
that I promise.

Interesting that you mention them, they seem to fit in quite
well (although the Russian revolution may have had other reasons too).
Japan would be a nice example of an adaptor society, while France
was a non-adaptive society.

That might be a good idea, although we might start the free flow
by mentioning some important factors. Societal, economic and individual
adaption to new technology and system changes is one important aspect.
Another might be how fast counter-movement appears and how strong
they can become.

There is a good chance we will never be attacked by aliens. And if we 
were, then those aliens would surely be smart enough not to attack us 
unless they were certain that they could easily win whatever we did. 
If alien invasion really were an issue, we could develop an automated 
missile launch system or something like that.

Well, I spoke of "the robot" figuratively. In reality this would

all directions.

Well then you would agree that we need some temporary accomodation

Use dynamite then. But energy wouldn't be a problem.

As I said, if it covers a whole continent you can't do that.

With nanotech, we might be able to catalyse arbitrary prosesses and

energy.

Of course, nanomachines can do everything biological cells can, since 
these are a special kind of nanomachines; but they will be able to do 
much more since they can be use all parts of design space, not only 
that little corner that was available to evolution.

No, in that case the grey plague would not turn everything into 
diamonid material but into something in a lower energy state than 
organic material (which is in a very high energy state: that's 
part of the reason why we eat beef and carrots instead of stones).

Yes, but even that would not save you long. You would run out of

But those communication lines are on the outside of your organism. 
You would need an immune system that extends all over the place and 
that does not allow any significant competition to arise anywhere. 
That's what I'm saying. Your castle is not safe.

Yes it is! You are simply assuming energy will not be a problem,
in which case high-energy nano could of course easily wipe out
anything. But in the real world energy *is* a problem; even
building a solar collector system for nanites is non-trivial 
and doesn't give that much power. And in the uranium-extraction
scenario discussed here, chemical binding energy is not available
since the materials are already at a very low energy state. 

I have noticed that many people overestimate the power of
nanotech because they forget the energy needs. A good example
is Williams' _Aristoi_.

Yes, but rock is mainly oxides and silicates. You can't use it as a
fuel. 

I think there is some confusion here about binding energy etc (no
wonder, I'm not 100% sure about the terminology myself). Just to
get things straight: each molecule has an enthalpy, which is
roughly its "chemical potential". If chemical A and B are transformed
into chemicals C and D, the difference in total enthalpy tells
us how much energy is needed to cause the reaction (if the
difference is negative), or how much energy is released (if the 
difference is positive). These are absolute thermodynamic constraints,
in addition energy might be needed to start the reaction, although
this can be lowered using catalysts.

So the problem here is that the enthalpy of pure uranium or TNT
is high, while the raw materials have a low enthalpy. So you need
a lot of energy to make them, even if your nanotech is good.

Could we get some numbers here? What is the average enthalpy of
organic stuff compared to diamond?

There are already nanopowers.    

The standard scenario of the advent of nanotech is that someone will, in a
very brief time, go from where we are now to diamondoid nanotech.  If a
human immune system or army tried to fight off a diamondoid aggressor, it
would be like a bear trying to fight a helicopter gunship.  Hence, the 'gray
goo problem'.  However, I think the standard scenario is wrong.  

Consider a spectrum of nanotechnologies.  At one end is life, at the other
end is diamondoid nanotech.  Our present-day nanotechnology, called 'life',
is energy-efficient, sloppy, abundant, hard to reprogram, slow to reproduce
and physically weak and vulnerable.  Diamondoid nanotech consumes lots of
energy, can be extremely precise, does not yet exist, is easy to reprogram,
is quick to reproduce, and is physically strong and tough.  I doubt that
engineering will suddenly leap from one end of the scale to another.  All
the plans I've seen and heard for getting to the first assembler produce an
assembler that is far from diamondoid.  The hope is to use that to produce a
slightly better assembler, which will be used to produce the next
generation, et cetera.

Just as Drexlerian nanotech is made of diamondoid material, we can think of
life as being made of 'nylonoid' material.  Protein is chemically similar to
nylon, and about the same strength and stiffness.  The stiffer the basic
material of which the nanotech is made, the more precise an assembler can
be, and the more tightly bonded the materials it can assemble.  More tightly
bonded materials are stiffer, so it takes a stiff assember to make a stiffer
assembler.  So we can imagine bootstrapping from present-day materials to
the ultimate:

   Nylonoid assembles Kevlaroid.
   Kevlaroid assembles quartzoid.
   Quartzoid assembles sapphireoid.
   Sapphireoid assembles diamondoid.

Each of these stages is very valuable in its own right, and will open up a
range of new possibilities.  And each of them will require thousands of
genius-years to bootstrap to the next level.  Nobody will get from the first
to the last level alone and in secret.  By the time someone develops
diamondoid weapons, the world will have years of experience in fighting with
weapons made out of kevlaroid, quartzoid and sapphireoid.

--CarlF

PS.  Kevlaroid = amide-bonded unbranched polymers with only one degree of
freedom instead of the two that proteins have.  Quartzoid = strongly
cross-linked ceramics assembled in solution from metal oxide moeities (SiO4,
MgO2, etc) and hydroxyl and organic side-chains.  Sapphireoid = the same,
but assembled in vacuum, mostly AlO3 moeities, and no organics.

Dear Sir,                                           27 August 1997

I have read with mounting horror of the terroristic ordeal to which Mary 
Kay Schmitz Letourneau, the Seattle teacher, is being subjected by <inter 
alia> the King County Prosecutor's Office (Norm Maleng, who mistakenly 
call himself a Republican; his 'Chief of Staff' Dan Satterberg; and his 
deputy, Lisa Johnson) -- henceforth referred to as 'SMJ.'

And by others who should have known better.


As Dan Satterberg well knows, after the death of comedian Lenny Bruce 
(albeit not my favbourite comedian), Assistant Attorney General in the 
case, Vincent Cuccia, said this:

"We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy.  We watched him fall apart.  We 
knew what we were doing.  We used the law to kill him."


I have thorougly investigated the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and 
her family, and have reached the following findings

The King County Prosecutors (SMJ), and their collaborators, initiated a 
series of coordinated terrorist attacks on Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and 
her family; they sought to "make an example of her" (so as to terrify 
others), in the exact words of a prominent Washington State Republican, 
who wants no part in it.


TERRORISM: "The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or 
property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or 
any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives." 
Such is the formal definition adopted by the FBI in 1982 and followed by 
other US government agencies.



SMJ have attacked the role of the King Country Superior Court itself. The 
purpose of the Courts in America is to administer justice, not to 'make 
examoples of people' for social and political reasons.


Worse (if anything could be) Maleng, Satterburg and Johnson have attacked 
the Constitution of the United States itself, and thus the rights of all 
Americans -- rights which they are personally _sworn to defend_.


Accordingly, my colleagues and my associates have taken actions which 
include the following:

I have filed Amicus Curiae briefs with the King County Superior Court.

These are available at:  http://www.agora.demon.co.uk  or from the Court.


I have filed formal complaints with the Washington State Bar Association.

I have discussed this case with US Attorney-General Janet Reno's Office, 
documenting the KCPO's transgressions.  They are following the case now.

I have discussed the attacks with a senior Anti-Terrorism officer of the 
fBI in Washington (including the possible collaboration of one or more 
persons in the Seattle FBI office:  they are examining these matters now.

I have discussed these matters with Hillary Rodham Clinton's office at the 
White House, who now have full details.


And with many, many others, in America and elsewhere


There follows the opening passage of -- and excerpts from -- my 
third Amicus Curiae Brief to the Court, which was due to consider 
sentencing in the case on August 29th.


{ SMJ are now trying to keep Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau locked up for 
even longer, by postponing the sentencing hearing to October 17th, on the 
pretext of examining (prima facie) unethical and unconstitutional 
'medical' sentences whose only purpose could be the attempted destruction 
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau's love for the father of her new baby 
daughter Audrey, who is being deprived of maternal contact and care in 
these crucial first months of her life].  The attempt to coercively 
'medicalize' ethics is a _disastrous_ policy.

 "Today, 29 August, 1948, the USSR exploded its first Atom bomb.

 A day of historic significance.
 
 Today, 29 August, 1953, the USSR exploded its first Hydrogen bomb.

 A day of -- literally -- earth-shaking significance.
 

 Both Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and I are children of the Cold War.


 And this day, August 2 1997, is in all truth a day of Destiny and a 
 a day of reckoning...


[1997 Note:  The brilliant American actress Dorothy Jean Seberg, from 
Marshalltown, Iowa, (see her in incomparable performances, in Otto 
Preminger's 'St. Joan', where -- as a 17-year-old girl -- she was 
chosen from 10 000 to play Joan of Arc; and in Robert Rossen's 
magnificent film 'Lilith.') was hideously and protractedly killed as a 
direct consequence of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's malicious actions 
against her.

Hoover circulated vicious press stories including one that the baby she 
was expecting was of mixed race, and imposed unbearable pressures on 
her. She miscarried, and tried to kill herself on each anniversity of 
her lost baby's death.  She was later found dead in Paris, her body 
stuffed into a car trunk by the side of the road).

David Richards' biography of Jean Seberg is titled 'Played Out.'


And radical actress Frances Farmer's horrifying autobiography, "Will 
There Really Be A Morning?" (filmed as 'Frances' with Jessica Lange. 
[1983]) as a truly terrifying public warning of the perils and 
consequences of coercive psychiatry.  We _cannot_ allow such 
terrorist acts be committed against people anymore...

    If all children (indeed, all of us) had ... inexpensive radio 
alarms, they would be greatly more secure from all kinds of abuse.  I 
have given this idea to Motorola Corporation. If JonBenet Ramsey had 
bean wearing one, she could have instantly summoned help, and could be 
alive today.  

I am a formal external adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District 
Attorney's Office in her case.

What was done to JonBenet Ramsay and to Mary Kay LeTourneau have 
matching patterns.  See especially the section 'The Little Fascist' in 
"What Do You Say After You Say 'Hello'?  The Psychology of Human 
Destiny"  by Eric Berne MD.

             'Values as the expression of the central order'

     'The problem of values is nothing but the problems of our acts, 
goals and morals.  It concerns the compass by which we must steer our 
ship if we are to set a true course through life. The compass itself 
has been given different names by various religions and philosophies 
... but I have a clear impression that all such formulations try to 
express man's relatedness to a central order.   In the final analysis 
the central order, or the 'One' as it used to be called with which we 
commune in the language of religion, must win out....

  If we ask Western man what is good, what is worth striving for and 
what has to be rejected, we shall find time and again, that his 
answers reflect the ethical norms of Christianity even when he has 
long since lost all touch with Christian images and parables. If the 
magnetic force which has guided this particular compass - and what 
else was its source but the central order? - should ever become 
extinguished, _terrible_ things may happen to mankind, far
more terrible even than concentration camps and atom bombs.'


    Werner Heisenberg, [1971] 'Physics and beyond: encounters and
conversations', published by George Allen and Unwin, London.


    Thorpe is emphatic in asserting that we must never forget that such a
conclusion must on no account be attributed solely to the Western insights
stemming from the Christian revelation; he gives the following Admonitions as a
further example, drawn from the Amerindian tribe of the Shawnees (who were
dispossessed of their Oklahoma lands in 1839).


TITLE: The Shawnee Admonitions:

TEXT: (1)  "Do not kill or injure your neigbour, for it is not him you injure,
you injure yourself."

      (2)  "Do not wrong or hate your neighbour, for it is not him that you
wrong, you wrong yourself.  Moneto, the Supreme Being. loves him also as she
loves you."

  Quoted from W.H. Thorpe, 'Purpose in a World of Chance' Oxford [1978].
  A Biologist's View. George, Allen and Unwin.


    This is clearly related via the central order to the (negative) 
Judaic injunction not to do unto one's neighbour that which one would 
not wish to befall one's self.  My own -- perhaps agnostic -- 
orientation is nearer Taoism [and Greek mythology]; but these ethical 
principles are capable of reformulation for most spiritual -- and even 
humanistic or atheistic -- contexts.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine
advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve 
o'clock, imagining this staccato message to his wife:-

    "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for... it's you and our 
little house and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the 
fighting chance, to go ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want 
out here... to win this war... to get home... To go back to living our 
lives in a land -- and a world -- where *every* [wo]man is free to 
grow as great as [s]he's a mind to be...  where *every* [wo]man has an 
*unlimited* opportunity to be useful to himself [or herself] and his 
fellow men [and women]...


      Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no 
matter what they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to 
keep America a land of *individual freedom*! 

_That's_ what we're fighting for... 

_That's_ what we're willing to die for... 

_That's_ the America we want when we come home."


So say Mary Kay Letourneau and I, I would guess.  Amen.

I don't have the numbers handy, but I know the relative magnitudes.  These
bonds have about the same energy:

C-C single bonds
C-H single bonds
O-O double bonds
N-C single bonds

These are much lower in energy:

O-H single bonds
C-O double bonds
N-N triple bonds

Organic stuff is mostly carbon, bonded to other carbons, and to hydrogens.
Diamond is carbon bonded to carbon.  The carbon atoms in the two cases have
the same energy, but the hydrogen that you throw away in going to diamond
can be reacted with air to release water and enormous amounts of energy.
You also get energy by releasing the fixed nitrogen in the living thing,
unless the goo needs nitrogen too.  

Chemically speaking, this is the process that forms charcoal by burning wood
with insuffcient air.  A diamondoid goo attacking a forest would probably
look like a wildfire that left living charcoal in its wake.

Hopefully you get the point; we've seen this all before, throughout
history. Time and again a technological advance has occured which scared
people because it seemed that the advance would inevitably give the
possessor vast power which they could use to take over the world. Yet for
good reasons, this hasn't happened; provided there are multiple groups who
can develop a new technology, a balance of power soon occurs and
eliminates this possibility. The only difference today is that your
preferred scenario could come to pass and one group could already be
powerful enough to prevent competitive research. 

Frankly I think you're caught up in 'singularity-ism'; being able to build
nanothings will not lead to 'gray goo' overnight, and while the bad guys
are working on it the rest of us will be putting together defences. The
first nanotech world war wouldn't be a good place to be, but it won't be
one-sided unless we deliberately make it so. I really don't see any good
reason to believe the 'nanotech followed by human-level AI a few seconds
later followed by the singularity just before lunch' scenario which has
been proposed many times on the list.

And without wiping itself out in the process; somehow the 'gray goo' has
to determine whether that object it's dismantling is another 'gray goo'
nanite, and once we find out how it's doing that we can fake it. Suddenly
we're immune... (computer viruses have precisely the same problem). 

> So, what are the obvious holes? 

The only obvious one is that an attacker could duplicate the markings of a
valid cell and would then be safe from the immune system. If we all use
different markings then this would require an lot of work on the part of
the attacker. 

Of course the simplest way to avoid these kind of attacks is simply to not
be there. All the current discussions seem to imply that we'll stay here
on Earth just waiting for some maniac to wipe us out (and there are plenty
of ways to do that *without* nanotech). There are certainly disadvantages
to zooming off into the cosmos with a group of people you trust, but it
will be a damn sight safer than staying down here.

As far as I can see there are really only two solutions if such a
'nanotech catastrophe' is possible; either the Borg or the Armadillos --
one sentient entity takes over the universe and eliminates or absorbs any
competitors who might harm it, or we live in deep space in small,
heavily-armed groups and treat anyone we meet with great distrust.
Nicholas seems to be on the side of the Borg, whereas personally I'm for
the Armadillos; I can think of few things worse than being the only entity
in the universe.

I'm currently researching a paper on the legal implications of nanotech.
I've re-published (ahem...illegally) the only law review article written
on the subject at http://pw1.netcom.com/~hagbard/Nano.htm My hope is
that list members with opinions as to how (if at all) the government
will or should react to the prospects of nanotech will peruse this
article and express their thoughts on the matter. Please do not pass out
this URL unless you run it by me first -- I'm trying keep the copyright
infractions to a minimum. 

I plan to continue posting the most interesting bits and pieces of my
research at the same site for all to discuss.

First point: there's energy in more than the bonds.  Diamond is higher
energy than graphite on the surface; it's kinetics that prevent diamond
from decaying into lower forms of carbon.  I don't know if these
magnitudes are comparable to bond energies, but I don't think diamond
and charcoal can be treated the same.

Second point: I don't know if "energy" is entirely the right
concept.  As I remember, reactions are thermodynamically favored if the
free energy of the reaction is negative:
dG= dH - T*dS
G being free energy, H being enthalpy, T being temperature, and S being
entropy.  I think I can safely say that diamond has a lower entropy than
coal, meaning dG would be more positive, and less likely to happen.
I don't know what the entropy of living organisms or nanite structures
would be like.  Both lower than coal, presumably.

Burning stuff gives energy, -dH, but turning it into diamond would be a
negative dS, giving -dH - (-) giving -dH + something, which may well be
a positive dG, and thus non-spontaneous.

I have no intuition about buckytube nanites, which these days might seem
easier to make anyway.

Thank you!  Let's think about this.  What happens to charcoal if you
light it in oxygen?  What happens to very finely powdered charcoal if
you light it in oxygen?  I've said before that very small and rapidly
moving particles of carbon residing in oxygen while exposed to UV seemed
somewhat flammable.  Maybe nanites wouldn't spontaneously combust.  But
methinkest that my first answer to Nicholas should have been "oh, I'm
being attacked by a sea of gray goo?  I'll toss out a burning match..."

You seem to have utterly missed my point.  A nanite invading an organism
is a machine floating in an aqueous environment being glommed by
antibodies as well as swallowed and exposed to highly oxidizing
chemicals.  "It's easier to destroy than create."

Actually, as I remember, the original gray goo scenario was of nanites
spreading and gobbling whatever they could, starving the biosphere by
grabbing all of the biomass.  That's where the concern about
indigestability comes into play; bacteria may not be able to usefully
eat nanites.  White blood cells don't have to eat nanites, they just
have to destroy them.  I think pre-empting the biosphere is a somewhat
more realistic threat than eating it directly.

Again, where did this sea of nanites come from?  Yeah, invading one
would be bad, but how is the current world going to turn into isolated
castles in a sea of goo?

Hear, hear!  The more I study this Gaia that I am embedded within
(Gaia being the biolayer, not the planet, which is Terra) the more
my relationship to Gaia becomes a love-hate one.  She's Mom, all
right... no question about that, and I do pay my props to Mama G...
but I really think it's time for me to get out of the house before
her odd habits and idiosyncrasies start driving me crazy.

This is actually a heavy question within ethics.  I think I share
Mark's preferences here... if I had the misfortune of finding myself
alone in the cosmos, I would almost certainly set myself to the
task of making other people, or at least fumbling my way through
search space looking for an implementation path toward that end.
(Lee Corbin's happy-boxes are just no good for a decent conversation.)
But one real brain-stretcher for me is trying to think up arguments
in favor of the continued existence of other people that I could
present to some obdurate Robyn Hitchcock who sings "I'm not afraid
to be the only person on the planet".  That coming up with such
arguments that seem plausible to me is very difficult, scares me
a bit.  But not much more than a good roller-coaster ride.

(P. S. Is there a Pink Goo in the goo bestiary yet? If not, I
suggest we use Pink Goo to refer to Old Testament apes who see
their purpose as being fruitful and multiplying, filling up of the
cosmos with lots more such apes, unmodified. Moravecians should
get a charge out of throwing this one around. There are probably
some interesting SubGenius interpretations for Pink Goo as well.
I like it because it's morally ambiguous.  Sometimes I enthusiastically
identify as a member of the Pink Goo horde (parents take note of
this!).  But other times I think perhaps we ought to do something
about the Pink Goo problem on this planet: Pink Goo can result in
insufficient slack.)

Having <nothing better to do>...a little while ago...I cruised the Web
extensively... (I loooooooove the net....just THINK of a question...and you
can FIND OUT!!!...If Id'a had this as a KID!!)  with hydrogen on my mind.

And lo and behold...

there are a dozen or so companies working on Fuel Cells which do or could run
off hydrogen...producing electricity and distilled water as the only
byproduct.

There is an Ocean Thermal Energy Converter alive and well at the University
of Hawaii...It's rated at 200KW of which 20KW is left over after
overhead...<Twenty Kilowats of FREE electricity...didn't cost anything for
fuel...didn't cause ANY pollution...didn't deplete ANY natural <what other
kind is there?> resources> They don't say anything (I don't think) about
electroliysis...but what's to stop it?

There are several dozen modified Buses  currently running off Hydrogen.

Gas or Diesel engines need only slight modification to run off Hydrogen.

(But everyone seems to be waiting for Government ASSistance.)

Here's a possible scenario....(<since I have nothing better to do>...when I'm
not bashing government...I design things...in my head...the rest of me is
busy driving)

Some bright boy (or girl) designs a Von Neuman OTEC....a seed...this seed
need not be small...In fact I evision something in size  between that of a
semi-tractor trailer rig and small freighter (ship)..factory produced...by
the ???<dozen..hundred??>

Take the OTEC seed and place it in  deep (the deeper the better) tropical
water relatively close to the equator..there must be a minimium of 36degree
temp differential between the bottom and surface....not rare...LOTS of ocean
fits the bill)

The OTEC seed  hits bottom  and unfolds (or hangs suspended and
unfolds..details..details).. a tight mess of wires , the "skeleton" of the
pipe reaching from the frigid depths to the sultry surface knits itself into
structural forms (stiff leg sea structures) borrowed from the oil
patch...once assembled the "wire frame" is electrically charged (Solar Panel
array...mini OTEC...diesel generator...<details..details>.

A property of sea water is that charged wire tends to accumulate depositions
of minerals from the water...sea-ment.   This seament can be extremely
strong...structurally strong. Strong enough (with the wire "re-bar" for the
structure of the OTEC...only the "guts" need be transported to the site. The
rest "grows".

Eventually a tube condenses from  the bottom to the surface...a low pressure
high volume electrically powered pump (Turbine?)(installed via telepresense
remote?) pushes the frigid water, into the tube, to the {(or near....probably
better to be beneath storm surge depth) [but the equatorial tropics have
mostly vertical air movement...horse latitude..Doldrums...so storms are rare
]<???seems logical????>)} surface. There the rest of the Open Cycle Ocean
Thermal Energy Conversion unit is located.  (Vacum Pumps...Steam
Turbines...Electrical Generators...Condensation Units ....government health
inspectors <NOT>)..  for specifics of the technical details dial up OTEC on
your search engine...check out the  Hawaii   research center. 

Three immediate products arise from the OTEC...distilled water (five times
less salt than tap water)...Electricity...and nutrients from the depths
(surface tropical waters are typically nutrient poor)  An infinite
<well...lots and lots and lotss> amount is available.

Use your imagination as to the disposition of these there primary products..
 I have..my imagination includes the on-site production of Hydrogen..(and
oxygen?).it's liquidification..and transport to sea side pipeline terminal by
a fleet of WIG's (Wing In Ground Effect craft..(I figure water propulsion
would be most fuel effecient..prop or water jet)..{.there's web pages on them
too) fueled by the "boil off" of the liquid Hydrogen...upon arriving at the
pipeline terminal they offload the majority of their load saving enough for
one craft to make the return trip....then queing and connecting to be towed
back to the OTEC for another round....no fuel costs...possibly robot craft
.(except for one crew...or maybe not)

The offloaded Hydrogen is then transported via natural gas pipeline (after
boiling to ambient temp) <seems like some use of the tempeture differential
could be found..such as electrical generation? to run the pumps...to feed
into the grid?> to points of use. (natural gas has a high Methane
content...which itself has a high Hydrogen content...the addittion of
molecular Hydrogen to the natural gas should cause no problems I would
guess..for the time being..eventually the Hydrogen could be kept pure and
sold and used as is...(thus elimating the creation of COtwo...and hastening
the next Ice Age...which would lower sea levels , bury Alaska under a glacier
and cause Texas to double in size...such a deal!!!)

Other minor side-effects of the OTECs might be unlimited Lobster
Thermidor...or other "domesticated" species..grown in the Sea Farm made
possible by the nutrients brought to the surface...

"We Have The Technolgy...We Can Rebuild Him"...

It's been tried before, for example in South Africa and Israel...needless
to
say it didn't (doesn't) work very well. It basically means slum cities at
the edge of "rich areas", or at least ghettos. Intercontinental travel will
probably remain relatively slow and cumbersome for a long time to come,
and way beyond the financial capabilities of your "dollar an hour" people.
In other words: if you want cheap workers, they'll have to live relatively
nearby. Since most of the good spots are already taken by the more
fortunate folk, this means heavy concentration in shitty areas, which 
traditionally are a source of crime and unrest. Before you know it you'll
have apartheid and the like.

The problem is others (less "fortunate" than yourself) coming to *you*. If
immigration really was totally free, all successful places would be overrun
even faster by masses of poor immigrants (in your case wave upon wave
of Mexicans, I guess). In the ever more automated modern society there
[is] will simply not be enough work for all these people, so you'll get
extreme poverty (with all it's side-effects) on your doorstep (there is no
social security system to help the poor, so we *are* talking *real* poverty
here, and [thus] a lot of very desperate people. How long will they look
at your (relative) wealth before they "touch"?) The cultural differences
will only wider the chasm initiated by poverty, and will make it mentally
easier for both parties to "dehumanize" the other (human nature, dude),
and it's a lot "easier" to kill/rob/rape etc. an "alien" opponent.
Like I've mentioned earlier, this is the road to a SA-(little pun here)
style police state.

The "private protection agencies" will probably evolve into *states*, with
their own "turf" (country), "protection money" (taxes) etc. The correlation
between what you pay and what you get will eventually fade, and you might
end up with a truly medieval "city state" scenario, with bands of thugs 
roaming the countryside, despotic rulers, lots of small wars...the works.
Hardly an improvement, I'd say.

The bible belt is just that: a retarded area in an otherwise apparently
more sensible region (country). You have no bible belts in Islamitic
countries because in fact the whole country is the belt. The fact that
we (the Dutch have a bible belt too) have separate names for highly
religious regions is a good sign; it means they're something abnormal.

You can do better than using these cheap semantic tricks to discredit the
"opponent". I presume you're not very familiar with the local (Dutch)
politico-social situation, but that apparently doesn't prevent you from
dismissing my worries as "xenophobia". You must be wise indeed.

This wasn't my take on Nicholas' scenario.  Everyone lives in VR, and
nobody is allowed out into the physical world.  So life would indeed have
some limitations.  But this is far from a Borg collective.  The individual
lives of people within the VR could be as diverse and varied as under any
such scenario.

In fact we have often supposed that people would voluntarily move into
VR once it developed to the point where it was advantageous.  In VR you
could have magical powers over your environment, making objects appear
and disappear at will.  You could have the most sumptuous possible living
arrangments, culinary delights, every sensual pleasure imaginable.  You
could possibly even adjust and manipulate your own mentality directly.

Plus, you can probably run a lot faster in VR than in the real world,
so to the extent that there is an economy based on producing new ideas,
VR inhabitants are going to be much more competitive.

Actually, Nicholas' scenario could be adjusted to allow people to "go
native" and live out in the real world, as long as they were restricted
from access to technology which could threaten the computers running the
VR where everybody lives.  A few die-hard realists living on a south seas
island (who insist on walking on *real sand*, not the VR stuff that just
*seems* real) wouldn't bother anyone.

Still, Nicholas' idea can hardly be considered consistent with principles
of non-coercion, especially in the early days when people are rounded up to
be vaporized (and uploaded).  Don't forget, a lot of people even on this
list have resisted the idea that uploading preserves their identity.  So
any forced move to VR is going to be heavy on the "force" aspect.

Exsqueeze me? Since when have South Africa and Israel had
unrestricted immigration for all comers (which is what John K
Clark's post was about)?

It seems to me that the only example of unrestricted
immigration for all comers was the United States of America
before the Chinese Exclusion acts (and the later total
regulation of immigration in the 1920s).  I don't know about
you, maybe it's just a trace of Yankee chauvinism in me, but
I'm rather pleased with the results of *that* experiment in
unrestricted immigration for all comers.  I mean, compared to
the alternatives.

You "Caucasians" must be really smart if you think that South
Africa and Israel have unrestricted immigration for all comers.

Again, I suppose that the nineteenth-century USA proves your
point for you.  For over a hundred years, the immigrants just
rolled in, with no regulation whatsoever, and the country just
kept getting poorer, and poorer, and poorer... (Um, wait,
that's not exactly what happened, was it?)

Um, mechanism please?  How will insurance premiums evolve into
taxes?  How will turf-monopolists exclude competition without
annoying (and losing) their customers, and thereby losing their
revenue base?  I hope you can come up with something better
than Nozick's goofy scenario from ANARCHY, STATE, AND UTOPIA.

"Caloric" needed no replacement, because it meant something other
than thermic energy; it "referred" to an illusory fluid that doesn't
actually exist. Probably "Caucasian" needs no replacement, either,
but if you really want one, it's probably more honest to speak of
palefaces, or more colloquially and metaphorically, of white people.
Of course, "Caucasian" includes all Arabs and most of the people
in the Indian subcontinent... is it your intent to include these
people in your referent, or is this just an embarrassment of early
twentieth century physical anthropological usage to you?  I have
to guess the latter, since you reserve much of your venom for
Muslims, who are mostly Caucasian according to the traditional
usage of that word.

We need to answer the following questions:

Can a nanite colony produce a net energy output by eating 
organic material/earth crust?
What is the best upper bound on the time it would take to digest a 
given large volume of the substance?

We do not require that the end product is diamond, just that the 
nanites can extract net energy from the material. My preliminary 
guess is "Yes" to the first question (both wood and earth crust), and 
"A very short time." to the second (because the time should be largly 
independent on the volume, since the nanites can multiply and divide 
the labor)

Certainly, but the amount of chemical energy contained in a

By getting up very early in the morning, before anyone else was 
awake. But seriously, the point is that it could happen so fast that 
nobody has time to do anything about it before its too big to be 
obliterated with bombs etc. But Ido  agree that it's important to 
think in terms of processes (i.e. not forgetting the genesis problem 
-how could anything *become* that way?)

That organism would itself be floating in an aqueous environment 
being glommed by nanites from all directions, unless your immune

By the nanites eating up everything that is not protected by a global

Are you proposing that you are going to sit on the roof of your

Interesting. There is no easy way to tell whether you are right. The 
maturation time of nanotechnology is certainly an important parameter 
in predicting the future. There are two things I could take issue 
with. (1) Will nanotech mature slowly? And (2), given slow 
maturation, will that mean that a multipolar world order can remain 
stable?

(1)
Why exactly do you think every stage will take thousands of 
genius years? (I presume you mean good-scientists years?)  Isn't the 
design work fairly tractable (Drexler has already produced some nice 
designs) and it is mainly the lack of molecular tools that prevent us 
from starting building things? Better CAM would help a lot, and it is 
on its way.
	As you point out, each partial achievment would bring great benefits 
to the power that makes it, so wouldn't this mean that it would have 
a good chance of pushing further ahead, leaving the competition 
behind?
	If superinelligence (that could perform a thousand genius years in a 
short time) comes before nanotech, or is developed at an early stage 
of nanotech, then the bottle neck would almost certainly be the 
hardware, the molecular tools, and in such a case the maturation 
process would be almost instantaneous.

(2)
I believe the answer to the second question is No. I think there 
would either be a negotiated merger, or the stronger power would 
obliterate the weaker, and then immediately rebuild itself, and then 
expand spherically at a good fraction of the light speed. A Yes 
answer to (2) would presuppose that a negotiated merger isn't made, 
and that neither power can know with a great probability that it is 
strongest, or that the stronger power has some absolute ethical 
prohibition from attacking its weaker rival.

I'm finding this discussion a little hard to follow, perhaps because I've
lost track of the scenario.  With all the talk about attack and defense,
good and bad guys, gray vs blue goo, there are a few variables which are
unclear:

 - Motivation of gray goo creators:

	- Want to destroy all life/structure, including their own
	- Want to destroy just competitive forms of life, protect their own
	- Want to build up as much complexity for their own purpose as
	  possible, willing to destroy everyone else in the process


 - Relative strength of gray goo creators:

	- First possessors of nanotech (or of some advanced nano), nobody
	  else has anything which can compete
	- One of a relatively small number of groups with access to this
	  advanced nano
	- Same access to advanced nano as everybody else
	- Other groups have more advanced nano than goo creators

The strategies and outcomes will be likely to vary considerably depending
on where along these ranges the scenario lies.  Are there other variables
which need to be identified to help understand the possibilities?

Yes, that is one of the main reasons. Another is that if one 
nanopower is stronger than another, then it can eliminate it and 
easily repair all damages it contracted in the war.

No, I have not sided with anyone. I have only discussed the factual 
problem, what is likely to happen; not, what would be nicest if it 
happened. I think it's important not to let our desires influence the 
way we estimate which scenario is most probable.

Definitely the skill bases to deal with both levels of confrontation 
overlap, and a child more skilled in basic assertiveness and 
negotiation may deal more effectively with a bully.  I used to do 
trainings in peacekeeping skills, and many persons (including myself) 
have been able to apply those skills in dangerous or threatening 
situations.  

I wouldn't claim that you can always bargain your way 
out of every bad situation, but my original point didn't require me 
to claim that.  There is a vast difference between ordinary 
socialization into cultural dispute resolution mechanisms and facing 
a gang attack.  If anything, the gang members and bullies are the ones 
who missed out on part of that socialization process, and they don't feel 
subject to school authority anyway, as evidenced by their blatant 
behavior.  I would not agree that they are produced by the school 
environment as part of some "submission to authority" process--their 
problems were probably formed in the home environment.

There may not be an immunologist in the house, but I've been reading a
recent textbook for the past few days.  Unless a strong chemist can
assure me that fine particles of diamond or buckystuff can resist
hydrogren peroxide, free radicals, and other oxidizing goodies (possibly
including hydroxyls, I forget) I think our white blood cells are quite
capable of destroying an ingested nanite.

However, I'm not sure the immune system would know to go after the
nanites.  It's basically a question of whether the nanites would trigger
an immune response.  Our systems are most sensitive to foreign proteins,
preferably large or with special aromatic amino acids.  Synthetic
homopolymers -- only one building block -- tend not to trigger
responses.  Killer cells are activated by peptide fragments displayed on
the membranes of cells containing them.  (Dextrorotary amino acid
proteins tend not to trigger an immune response, because our enzymes
only break down levorotatory amino acids.)  On the other hand, "large,
insoluble macromolecules are good immunogens" so I don't know how pure
carbon nanites would be responded to.  Presumably someone could get some
idea by injecting small carbon particles into a lab mouse and seeing
what happened.

As I said, carbon-nanites are probably an overrated threat, due to the
flammability problem.  I'll give you some more threatening ideas:

(1) bacteria based on right-handed proteins and sugars, but equipped
with tools for dealing with both orientations themselves.  No natural
life would be able to digest them (usefully; they'd probably die in
stomach acid) but they could go through the biosphere.  I have no idea
of what's involved in reversing the handedness of an amino acid --
possibly breaking it down and rebuilding it from scratch.  That would
probably put a kink in their style, but they could still be annoying.

(2) Rock-nanites, based on AlO, SiO, or relatied mateirals (quartzoid,
sapphireoid.)  Their elements are as abundant as carbon, and they're
already burnt, so the flamethrower attack won't work.  They'll probably
still be low in entropy, and they'd have to be disassembling biomass for
the hell of it, not because they were using it to grow themselves
(except as an energy source, perhaps.)

Of course, I don't think anyone's really working on sapphire nanites.
People who worry about this should hope that Carl's progression is
wrong, and that we do start with bucky/diamond nanites.  Rampaging
mistakes at that level will be easy to control.  Then by the time more
resistant nanites start wandering around strong nano-defenses would
already be in place.

One nanite generates a sphere of daughter nanites; don't they start

they know how far to go for a given volume, or what that volume is?
(And how fast can nanites crawl, anyway?)

Hal's right; we are having a problem agreeing on scenarios.  I don't
associate "gray goo" with "nanopower".  I've been mostly assuming gray
goo is disassmblers run amok.  If not, how is the source controlling and
protecting itself from the nanites?  (How are the nanites not eating

How would the organism be floating in an aqueous environment?  I don't
float in an aqueous environment.  And if you accept immune systems
fighting nanites then you can't assume the organism is in a sea of goo,
because to make that sea the nanites would have had to eat lots of other
organisms with immune systems.

You'd said they'd use high explosives; I said that was pretty smart for
good.  You said they'd use lines of communication outside my "castle".
If they're dependent on lines of communication to attack me then
disrupting those lines with cannon is a perfectly viable stategy.  No
communication, no dynamite, I'm safe.

Really though, their best bet for high explosibes is themselves.  Coal
dust can make a pretty boom, due to the high surface area for the mass.

Note the different scenarios we're jumping among.  Nanites trying to
invade an organism.  Nanites trying to become a sea of goo without being
bombed or dusted.  A sea of goo against a hardened and nano-capable
(but not global) bunker.  Sometimes it's real goo; other times it's
stuff with internal communcation and solar panels, trying to make
dynamite or nukes.

Personally I'm still suspicious of this conception of nanites.  Little
atomic manipulators made of a single type of material trying to be more
capable than whole slews of complex enzymes, often dependent on
different transition metals, crawling around in a vast variety of
environments, and being able to take over the world in their first
generation.  They have to get energy, deliver it over distance
(otherwise my bunker need only be a dais of hematite or bauxite) and in
some scenarios, communicate, perceive, and plan against macroscopic
entities.  Right.

Yes, there would be this one point of violation of individual 
rights. As we all should know, the fit between ideology and reality 
is seldom perfect; and it's the latter's fault but the former's 
problem.

I agree with your agreement with Hal, that we have problem agreeing 
on scenarios. As I have explained earlier, I don't think that the 
problem of accidental goo is very interesting, for we can design away 
the possibility of mutation. I am therefore focusing on deliberately 
designed destruction-goo; in the simplest case we can assume a 
religious fanatic that wants to destroy the world. The basic issue 
has been whether a private (non-global) immune system can deal with 
this threat.

A low tech scenario, which would not allocate any sophisticated 
mobiliy to the nanites themselves, would be that somebody sprays them 
over a forest from a small aeroplane during the night. Most people 
would not want to do that, of course, but it suffices that there is 
one such individual in the world and then we are all dead.

No, they could eat dead organic material, or inorganic material.

No, nanotechnology makes use of many types of materials.

No, not in their first generation. Even when nanotech itself is 
mature, the "little atomic manipulators" have to multiply themselves 
many times over before they reach macrosopic quantities.

Well, the message you're replying to sat on my laptop for a day or two
before I logged on to send it; I was replying to his original scenario of
a 'super-UN' controlling the entire world and ensuring that no-one was up
to anything naughty so that we'd be 'safe'.

But that's still not safe. Any alien nanotech guru can come along and
trash the planet; hell, any passing alien joy-rider can smash up the VR
with a rock. So if the VR collective really wants to be safe it has to
send out probes to eliminate or absorb any other life it finds; it has to
control everything, or it's not safe. This is what I meant by the 'Borg';
the 'super-UN' or VR collective is an entity which must control the
entire universe to ensure its survival.

>So life would indeed have
>some limitations. But this is far from a Borg collective.

I'm not so sure. Certainly it wouldn't appear internally as a single
organism, but the uploads are still forced to run other people's
programming (i.e. agree to limit themselves in the name of safety) and
eliminate anyone who refuses to upload. Eventually the VR mechanism will
cover the entire universe (and is a single computer running a trillion
uploads one entity or a trillion?).

That's true, but I don't remember anyone else suggesting that we should
deliberately cut ourselves off from the outside world.

But how would the folks in the VR do that? In order to prevent the
natives from building anything which could threaten the VR, they would
have to have more robots to monitor the natives and control them. But
then who's going to prevent a maniac inside the VR from stealing one of
those robots and threatening the VR with it?

But such a situation would be unsafe, and if we're so concerned about
safety that we'd cut ourselves off from contact with the external
reality, then we'd never allow that.

Of course there's a *big* difference between the kind of immigrants you
get when you say 'hey, come over here and we'll give you lots of welfare
money for doing nothing' and when you say 'hey, come over here, but if you
can't find work we won't help you'. We're talking about the latter case,

Dear Sarah,

I suppose that Tony has just considered the difference between 
*sexual* attraction and *erotic* attraction... although we usually 
say "to make sex" and not "to make eros"...

Indeed, he after wrote:

Rearranging graphite to diamond is a very low-energy operation, 0.69

T dS is usually about 10% as large as dH at room temp.  However, if it would
make you feel better, we can calculate it (with the help of the Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics). 

You're forgetting all the water vapor that gets thrown off.  The entropy of
gases is immensely higher than that of solids.  The reaction 

C6H12 + 3 O2 -> 6 C + 6 H2O 

has a net entropy *gain* of 49 e.u. because it absorbs three moles of gas
and releases six moles of gas.  (I will treat living things as if they were
made out of a typical liquid hydrocarbon, C6H12.)  This makes the reaction
that much faster than if no entropy gain were involved.

The difference between diamond and graphite is a smidgenly 0.8 e.u.  I don't
think coal can be much higher entropy than graphite.

Yes, I mean thousands of years of work by good scientists and engineers.

Boy, you must be a philosopher or something.  It's clear you've never done
any engineering (:-).  I will respond with three points: (1)
self-reproducing machines are comarable in difficulty to other technologies
that required thousands of genius-years to develop, (2) simulation is not
enough, and (3) Drexler hasn't done much.

(1) The minimum self-reproducing device (mycoplasma genitalium) seems to
require about a million bits of information.  I don't think we'll be able to
get much smaller than that with our artificial equivalents.  That's about as
much information as is embodied in a car or medium-size piece of software.
To develop from having no experience in automotive technology whatever to
the point where you can build a reasonably effective car took at least
thousands of genius-years.  Ditto software.  The first piece of software
that I'm aware of that was over a million bits long was OS/360, developed in
1964, at a cost of 5000 man-years, to say nothing of all the research that
it took to bring software technology to the point where they could even
start the project. 

(2) Simulation doesn't solve the problem, because reality always holds
surprises.  In the software business, any piece of software can be simulated
with arbitrary precision, because to run it is to simulate it.  Does this
imply software can be made perfect?  No, because the world around the
software is incapable of being precisely simulated.  I just checked, and 26%
of the software project I'm currently working on is test code, essentially
designed to simulate the loads the real users will put on the system.  And
will that make our product bug-free?  Fat chance!  You have to put it out in
the world, watch it break, figure out what happened, and redesign it.  All
these steps are hard.

(3) Drexler and Merkle are two very (very!) smart guys.  They have labored
for years, and designed what?  Some bearings, a transmission, a PLA, and a
Stewart platform?  And you claim this shows how easy it is?  I'd hate to see
an engineering task you considered hard!  If we keep working at this rate,
we should see a complete assembler in around a millenium.

This assumes that it is possible to acquire the massive resources needed to
develop the next generation without letting anyone know how the current
generation works, or even that it works.  I would suggest that this is
impossible, since the resources have to be gathered either by selling
products or extortion by threats of violence.  Both of these are highly
visible activities.  As soon as the world realizes that there is massive
power to be had, everyone will work like crazy to catch up.  Companies other
than Ford make cars, and countries other than Britain use railroads.

I entirely agree.

There is at least one other possibility, and it is the one that keeps the
world system stable: the cost of subduing the smaller power is more than the
profit obtained from its submission.  Please explain why an imbalance in
nanotech is more likely to make this solution infeasible than does an
imbalance in e.g. nuclear missiles, or iron swords.  Nanotech makes the cost
of conquest smaller, but also reduces the profit of conquest, since
everything gets so much cheaper with nanotech.  What are you going to get
from your conquered enemies?  Natuaral resources?  Go to the asteroid belt!
Lebensraum?  Well, that's OK if you like scorched earth.  I'd rather have my
own O'Niell colony.  A nation of slaves?  Oh boy, they'll sure be an
economic bonanza.  

I'm being sarcastic here, perhaps more than I should be, but I genuinely
don't see the payoff to instantaneous extermination of foriegners through
nanotech, espescially when your enemies will have at least nuclear weapons
and at best nanotech only one generation behind your own.

Slow relative to what, Star Trek? Travel has never been cheaper in the 
history of the human race and it's getting cheaper, but that's nothing 
compared to what's happening in communication. Trying to keep people in their 
place, in the same little pigeonholes they've been stuck in for centuries is 
just not going to work.

Where the people who work for me want to live is up to them not me. Obviously 
if they don't like to travel and they don't want to live near me then there  
could be a problem, unless they  tele-commute.

Apartheid was precisely why the immigration policy of South Africa caused

you have more pigment in your skin than me, then it doesn't take a brain 
surgeon to figure out that it will cause unrest.

Today virtually any Mexican who wants to live in the USA can, it's illegal

live  here because the welfare is so nice, and this delights me because it's

if they could get a job and become productive, and what on Earth is wrong

States claim rights that individuals or corporations don't have, even if the  
advantage is small at the beginning they use it to gain more power and soon a 
monster has evolved. Private Protection Agencies (PPA) have no rights an 
individual doesn't have and if they tried to get more the competing PPA's 
would not like it. The aggressive PPA would need a large very expensive army 
to enforce its edicts and that means it would have to charge a higher premium  
for its services and that means customers would drop them like a hot potato 
and go with another agency, they wouldn't be thrilled about turning their  
front yard into a war zone either. No money no army.

Also, the leaders of countries tend to the sort of people who like to have 
power over people, the CEO of successful private protection agencies would be  
the sort of people who are more interested in making money than  saving face, 
if not the stockholders of the agency would be very unhappy, they'd dump him 
and find somebody who can make money not glory for them. It's a fact, 
stockholders don't give a damn about glory, they want cash. 
                  
There is yet another safeguard, the instant a PPA starts acting in a  
totalitarian way, shut off it's money supply, go to a competitor and stop its  
cancerous growth in the bud. That is a powerful tool that we don't have today,  
you are forced to keep sending money to your country even if you hate what  
it's doing.
 
Does all this prove that a PPA can never turn into Big Brother? Of course not, 
we're talking about human relationships not something simple like mathematics, 
but I think it does show that it would be more unlikely to turn bad than our 
present institutions.

Well, to begin with we have Malthus. Darwinian pressure to fill the 
available ecological space, etc. Personally, I don't think that these 
arguments are as strong as many think when they are applied to a 
post-transition world, but they tend to persuade people. The way I 
prefer to think about it is in terms of a superintelligence who 
attempts to maximize what it thinks is physical value-structures; 
i.e. it wants to organize as much matter as possible in the way that 
it think has most value. Except for possible strategic or ethical 
reasons, it makes no difference whether the matter is virgin 
territory or some other computer is has already organized the matter 
in a sub-optimal way.

I think my school experience helped with this.  I learned to negotiate for
all the wrong reasons.  Getting out of trouble was an art form and comes in
useful in everyday life.  When I was at school me and some friends were
planning for a life of crime, social engineering of teachers was perfect
practise and we became so good at it we could get away with anything.

I was only ever on the other end of the stick - the end with the comfy grip -
which will win me no friends on this list.

In my early school years I got to do all the beating, after which I was
nuetral.  There's something to be said for kicking the shit out of people
*before* they get to an age when they can do serious damage.  By the time I
got high school all those kids I use to beat up where much bigger than me,
but they left me alone.

Every fight I've been in has ended with the other kid coming up with an
excuse to leave, or my friend switching in to 'psycho' mode and deciding to
bring bricks into the equation (A psychotic friend is a must for anyone
entering public school).

I did once get attacked by a man weilding a bag full of shopping.  After
which we waited around for two weeks to see where he lived so we could
firebomb his house, but he never came back :-(

Nice!

For me school was 5% fun (joking, burning, breaking, stealing, hurting and
blowing things up), 70% boredom, and 25% that I didn't attend (I missed about
3 years because I couldn't cope with the 70% boredom).  But I never had as
bad a time as many of the people on this list.  This is no reason to say it's
a good thing, even if we had all had a great experience at public school
there would still be room for improvement.

Interesting.  Metabolism already uses FeS crystals for electron transfers.
 Although they're used for energetic purposes and not structural perhaps this
would be a place to start for quartzoid nanotech.

But what if its value-structure made it regard "natural" or "unchanged"
systems as good? This view is already prevalent in our culture, and
it is not unlikely that an SI might think that its preferred form of
complexity might include the activities of "simple" forms of life
and environments in addition to its own structures. It can be a purely
esthetic choice.

This would presume that there is a decision procedure for
optimality, would it not?  I have yet to run across any such
decision procedure; if you've got one, I'd be fascinated to
hear more about it.

If there is no decision procedure for optimality, then I think it
makes considerable difference whether the matter is homesteadable
frontier or someone else's property.  Of course, this may be what
you meant by "strategic or ethical reasons", but I think the
questions go deeper than that, right into the heart of whatever
you intend as the referent of "optimal".

http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/6401.html

Hugo de Garis is interviewed by Wired and describes his views of the AI
future.  He foresees the creation of super-intelligent AIs, "artilects"
(artificial intellects).  The race to create these AIs will be, along
with the nano race, a principle form of competition in the next century.

Some will favor creating these machines, which are arguably our
replacements: the Cosmists.  Others will oppose them, the Terrans.
de Garis sees the future somewhat similar to Moravec, with the Cosmists
escaping from the Earth, dominated by Terrans (rather confusing choice of
terminology there).

Moravec suggested that this would lead to temporary stability, with
the AIs in space leaving the earth alone for some time while their own
skills matured, but de Garis sees a more violent short-term outcome.
The Cosmists will seek refuge in space where they can build their
artilects, while the Terrans will pursue them with intent to destroy.
The Cosmists will need to develop their own offensive capabilities as
quickly as possible in order to counter the threat from the Terrans.

Meanwhile de Garis is working on building a million neuron milli-brain
based on a new configurable cellular automaton chip from Xilinx.  Then
he'll use evolution (or should we call that directed evolution?) to try
to make the brain smart.

Sounds like he's got a ways to go before his machines take over.

I think it is a matter of what kind of optimism you have: passive
optimism ("Things will get better, so I can as well relax") and
dynamic (or active) optimism ("We can make things better"). 

One way of presenting the Singularity idea to avoid passivity is to
point out that we can detemine what kind of singularity it will be.
Do we want a singularity where a small nano-elite transcends and leaves
everybodye else in the dust, a Borg-de Chardin singularity where we
all become one, a cambrian explosion of new kinds of beings or
a heads-in-the sand Singularity where things happen without any
attempts to control them? Individual choices will make these
more or less likely.

Does anyone have an educated estimate as to how long it will take
nanotech researchers to bootstrap from Drexlerian engineered protein

*how* it might be done, but lacks (?) any estimates of the time frame. 

Related question: the consensus seems to be that we will have something

I started wondering about your reality some time back, EvMick.

I then decided that actual reality isn't all that relevant. You're

I disagree with your politics. Basically, we have uploaded a tiny

On the Foresight Exchange on-line game (nee Robin Hanson's Idea Futures),
I created a claim for people to bet on the date that the Feynman Grand
Prize will be awarded by the Foresight Institute (no relation to the
Foresight Exchange).

This prize requires the design and construction of 32 copies each of
two nanotech devices: a robot arm capable of .1 nanometer positional
accuracy which fits within a 100 nm cube, and a computational device,
an 8-bit binary adder, which fits within a 50 nm cube.

I would guess that meeting the required .1 nanometer positional accuracy
for the robot arm will be difficult with protein based assemblers.
.1 nm is about the size of a hydrogen atom.  Without knowing much about
the stiffnesses involved, it seems likely that a protein based system
will have more slop in it than that.

There may also be some difficulty in building the adder out of proteins.
50 nm is not all that big.  Ribosomes are about 25 nm in diameter and
although what they do is important, they are basically enzymes which
catalyze the assembly of amino acids.  As far as is known they have no
moving parts.  Ribosomes presumably had to be that big in order to get
the active sites shaped the way they had to be.  So it is questionable
whether you could build an 8 bit adder out of proteins in a 50 nm cube.

Based on this I think that awarding the Feynman Grand Prize will require
progress beyond proteinoid nanotech, to something similar to diamond.

The claim on the FX game has not been very heavily played, a dozen
shares changing hands every couple of months.  But for what it's worth,
the date predicted by the players has hovered around 2025-2030.  So if
we get a simple form of nanotech in the late 2010's, to pick the magic
"twenty years off" where breakthroughs always seem to hover, this would
suggest another 10 years or so to produce diamondoid nanotech or
something similar.

BUt please consider DNA sequencing as an analogy. The first sequences
were
done by incredibly labor-intensive analyses, yielding, after many years
of effort, analyses of strings of 50 or 100 bases. A technician can now
sequence 100 bases in an hour, compare the result to known patterns,
cross-check for similaries, and eat lunch at the same time. Yes it
takes years to build the first tools, but after you have the tools
you can automate them and operate at the next level of complexity.

As with DNA sequencing and  semiconductor design, the fundamental
tools for nanotech are physical, but after the fundamental tools
are available, subsequent advances in design efficiency depend
primarily on software.

Drexler, Merkle, et. al. are design the equivalent of transistors
and resistors. After you have enough basic building blocks, your
design can proceed to the next level. Yes, better building blockk
will enable better next-level designs, but the first small set of
building blocks, the set that can be assembled by an assembler
built from that set, will IMO also provide a basis for "Goo".

The problem with defensive nanotech IMO has never been a lack
of potential capability, but rather stems from the lag time
between the introduction of the goo and the devevelopment of
the defense. the goo can replicate and overwhelm the defense
before the defender has time to design an effective counter for
tbe goo. The existing immune system works because it can learn
to build a new kind of defense from standard parts very quickly.
When it cannot learn fast enough, it fails.

In the scenarios we are discussing, the first goo will be
designed either by accident or deliberately, by humans at
human design speeds. It will have to be countered by
human design efforts operating at human design speeds. Design
of a flexible nano-immune system capable of adaptation to a
full range of threats is an entirely different level of
design complexity. Thus the problem is that the time from the
beginning of the attack until the deployment of the defense is
long enough that the defender is already dead, or assimilated,
or whatever.

IMO, the sequencer (1985?) was the first assembler. It builds
atomically precise structures from feedstock according to
keyboard commands.

3D micromachined SPM arrays making 'semi-precise' (precision in critical
features) whazits. 'Transition-tech' litho/molecular

Biomass is energy-rich.  But it's a limited source.  If you turn a large

Scenario: New York City is the last city left.  All other continents are
a seething mass of grey goo, released by the first "nano-power", which
is also the religious fanatic above.  This goo is fuel- or
solar-powered; does not have internal communications, and thus doesn't
do dynamite or nuclear bombs; and is made of aluminosilicates, so it
won't burn.  How NYC survived to this stage I'll ignore, but I'll assume
it has acquired some stockpiles as necessary.  Also that NYC has more
researchers than any single lab.

First line of defense: shaded concrete moats.  Convertible into nanites,
but very energy poor.  Nanites crawling over the surface (probably not
in a straight line, I'd guess random walk strategies are used) get
washed off by water hoses.  NYC has plenty of water available.  This is
probably a temporary solution, especially if the nanites anchor
themselves to the surface at each step (that should slow them down?) or
can tunnel underground (sink concrete curtains, then they won't have
energy to go through.)  But that's okay.

Since the beginning of the crisis researchers have been working on
captured nanites.  Obviously they're looking for countermeasures --
chemicals which will gum up the nanites, or dissolve them, or
something.  But they're also busy figuring out how the things work; by
releasing the nanites the "nano-power" has thrown away its only
advantage.  Perhaps the NYC researchers will be able to come up with a
predator nanite for the goo, which they then release around the
perimeter.  Counter-goo!  Or should I say Bronx-goo?  Defeated nanites
and recaptured land become new resources for the counterattack, solving
the problem of limited resources.  Soon New York has conquered the
world.

No global immune system; no private nano-immune system to begin with.
Just physical barriers which hold until superior intellectual resources
outfight the attack.

} mobiliy to the nanites themselves, would be that somebody sprays them 
} over a forest from a small aeroplane during the night. Most people 
 
Scenario: these are presumably carbon-based nanites, if they eat wood.
The forest is quickly consumed into a huge lake of goo, but the area of
the lake can only spread so far -- only the perimeter nanites are
useful.  In the meantime it's been noticed, and someone ignites the
mess, causing possibly the world's larges fuel-air explosion.  This
scatters lots of nanites all over the place, leading to the "nano-Pern"
scenario: people rush out to find growing puddles of nanites and
flamethrower them.  Concrete houses become a big fad.  Again, nanites
are quickly captured and analyzed, this time by a research establishment
dwarfing that of the previous scenario.  Life is unpleasant, and the
ecosystem is having lots of holes eaten in it, at least at first, but
total destruction is not imminent.

The "designs" I've heard of have been of single types of materials, or
limited families of materials.  They supposedly can manipulate anything,
but it's all made of diamondoid.  The flammability of which no one seems

There is a difference between the three systems you mention, on the 
one hand, and nano self-replicator on the other. Mycoplasma 
genitalium, automotive vehicles and comersial software are all 
required to be fairly optimized. To build an optimised nano 
self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make 
something useful that can replicate. For example, a universal Turing 
machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is 
very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year 
task, to do it. The feasibility stems from the fact that you have 
identical components that you can put together into bigger identical 
components, and so on, and at each step you need only consider the 
apparatus at a certain level of abstraction. If this is the right 
analogy for nanotech, then the design work would seem tractable, once 
the right tools are there. But I will take your opinion on this 
issue into account in my future thinking. And debugging is also a 
complication.

Those are again optimized designs. What about the rod logic 
computer? And I didn't Drexler give it as an exercise to his students 
to design an autoreplicator when he taught a course at some 
university? I am not sure about how detailed these designs are, 
though. (Could anybody tell us this, please?)

If the early generations of nanotech can be used to build things, 
those things can be sold without giving away details about how they 
are made. Or if the early generations can be used to build better 
computers, then the military might benefit from that while keeping 
the project secret.

But the leading power will work like crazy to keep the lead. If they 
all work equally hard, the one that starts out with an advantage 
should get to the goal first. The main point we are discussing is 
weather the other powers would by then have obtained enough nanotech 
to effectively defend themselves against the leading power. I think 
the major military advantages could differ dramatically between some 
of the pairs of adjacent generations, so that the first power to 
develop the later version would have an easy match against the power 
who has the earlier version. This means that even if the whole road 
to advanced self-replicators is long and slow, there would still be 
some point where a slight progression yielded huge military payoff

Forget about the earth, what is at stake is half the universe (the 
chance to double the amount of value-structures you can create) and 
the possibility of getting rid of an enemy that might decide to 
destroy you at a later time. (Even more than this if there are more 
than one rival power aspiring to nanotech.)

Not all foriegners would need to be exterminated, only those that 
refused a negotiated merger. But if genuinely hostile powers were not 
extreminated (or disarmed) at this point, it would only be a matter 
of time when they would be in a position where they could 
exterminate us.

Whether nukes are a complication depends on how advanced nanotech we 
are talking about. I agree that they would seem to retain some 
deterrence at the early stages.

The outcome also depends on whether a superinelligence is in 
controlled or whether the powers are ruled democratically by ordinary 
people. In the latter case we would have a further complication.

Subduing the enemies might be more acceptable to the masses if it 
could be done without bloodshed and harm to the other nation's 
population. Advanced nanotech would make this possible.


What we are discussing lies at the very heart of the future. Maybe it 
has never been done so incisively, anywhere, as we are now doing it, 
on this thread.

I just had a bizarre thought. On this list, there are what might be
termed "reputations" and more loosely, "identities." Should not slander
and libel apply to these virtual constructions as well? If your right to
freely associate by way of modem is curtailed because of someone
impersonating you, or making things up about you, should you not have a
reason to seek damages? Of course, damages would be mitigated by the
extreme closeness of the group (and perhaps the ability of list members
to dismiss such things as probably inaccurate) but in the end, what's
the difference?

Do you know why Foresight has chosen these criteria (including the

Is it that these criteria represent the "final step" so-to-speak?

Thanks for your response. 

My observation in all this is that given the typically reactionary
nature of law and legal thought (i.e., "lack of vision"), the regulatory
schema as it exists today will not be able to cope with the technology
and its many varied implications (which are, for all practical and
historical purposes, just around the corner). Without assigning a
normative value to the demise of regulation in our society, it is a
topic that I want to explore in some depth.  

We have a course entitled Science and the Law here at school. Elsewhere,
there exists theoretical applied science. Why not Theoretical Applied
Science and the Law? IMHO intelligent people need to know about this
technology and its implications. One of the most misdirected group of
intelligent people is the legal community. Call it "tunnel-vision",
"careerism", or whatever, lawyers and law professors, judges and
legislators (with exceptions) have an overblown percpetion of their
importance in the grand scheme of things. There is nothing worse than a
regulation based upon imperfect information. The process of regulation
is a slow evolution rooted in trial-and-error. If the pace of change
antecedent to nanotech will be as fast as many believe, and rightfully
so, the time-frame for this process is drastically reduced and thus,
there exists less time to consider the effects of the regulation. 

Which is bad news for everyone.

Nanotech will be regulated, I am certain. My hope is that the
regulations will correctly balance the risk-return equation.  

Regards,

Hagbard

You seem to be assuming a bunch of isolated powers or labs working
toward nanotech, with one having and keeping a vital lead.  Setting
aside the probability that progress will be too gradual for a massive
discontinuity to develop, the non-leading labs can collaborate, applying
more brainpower to the problem than the leading lab can muster, and
abolishing the lead.  (I don't say reversing the lead, as the easiest

You're changed scenarios again!  First it was destructive gray goo

if there was a leading power they could still be nuked, making
declaration of nano-war somewhat unattractive.

Nanotech is powerful enough to utterly subdue the enemy within days. 
Gunpowder can't do that.  Nuclear weapons could have done that, but we didn't.
 Nanotech reproduces, which places it above nuclear weapons in that everyone
can have one.  If only three or four powers had nanotech, the situation would
have stability comparable to our own, multiplied or divided by a factor
equivalent to the "first strike" possibility of success.  If everyone (N>100)
has nanotech, the situation is the same as if everyone had a nuclear
*arsenal*.  We'd be doomed.  QED.

The Directive of Evacuation:
"Do not declassify nanotechnology until all persons wishing to leave the Earth
have done so."

I think this is a very Libertarian, cautious, ethical way to state the issue. 
Strategic considerations make it necessary to partition humanity and remove it
from large masses before allowing everyone access to nanotechnology.

I should also propose the easiest way to do this without leaving anything behind:
Carve the Earth's crust into citylike sections or hundred-square-kilometer
sections, whichever is larger, and lift all the sections into separate orbits.
 Transportation between sections must be provided.  Also roofing and
centrifugal gravity.

So, a bit after nanotech is discovered, the sky changes color, airports and
the Interstate undergo some peculiar changes, and space is filled with giant
spinning crowbars with domes on one side and counterweights on the other.

This may violate property rights, but much less directly than seizing any
particular person relative to anyone else.  You're simply adjusting the
macroscopic world a bit; no sociological or coercive action is involved.  If
you have to take an action that falls outside the Libertarian rules, that's
the way to do it.

Okay.  Well, it'd take more tech than I thought, but a few points:

Modern atomic technology goes like this:  You have a mass of U235, with all
the atoms inside being arranged randomly.  Atoms fission all the time, but the
material isn't very dense, so most neutrons escape.  Then an implosive
explosion occurs which condenses the material down to a tiny, tight ball. 
Neutrons collide with other U235 atoms, causing a chain reaction.

We all know this implicitly, but I'm verbalizing it so we can alter the scenario.

Now, my original suggestion was based on a passage from "Surely You're Joking,
Mr. Feynman":

	"It turned out that the army had realized how much stuff we needed to make a
bomb - twenty kilograms or whatever it was - and they realized that this much
material, purified, would never be in the plant, so there was no danger.  But
they did not know that the neutrons were enormously more effective when they
are slowed down in water.  In water it takes less than a tenth - no, a
hundredth - as much material to make a reaction that makes radioactivity.  It
kills people around and so on.  It was very dangerous, and they had not paid
any attention to the safety at all."

So you don't need neutron reflectors; just ordinary water.  I'm not sure
whether "10% to make radioactivity" and "10% to get critical mass" are the same
thing.  Could be a power relation I didn't factor in.  I'd be surprised to
find out that they were unrelated, though.  Still, it could be that no amount
of water decreases the size of a critical mass.  Let me know if so.

My guess is that current bombs don't use water amplifiers, because the bombs
would go around radiating lethal radiation all the time, and the material
inside would melt.

So.  The bomb is made of multiple concentric shells, with a small space left
between each shell.  A millisecond before the bomb goes off, water is pumped
into the space between shells.  Then the bomb crushes, and the water decreases
the amount necessary for critical mass.  Or, if that won't work, you can have
oxygen and hydrogen in close proximity.  The bomb crushes, and then nanotech
very quickly turns the oxygen and hydrogen into water.  Or with nano-precision
shaped charges and precisely positioned oxyhydro, you might be able to set up
the reaction to occur naturally as a result of the explosion.

And, getting a bit speculative, what if you take U235, store it in ordinary
water, and then use nano to "catch" the slowed neutrons that emerge?  Could
you store the neutrons and use them as a catalyst for the bomb?

The fullerenes would be macroscopic too.  (Arbitrary size, at least in
theory.)  The fullerenes are there to help hold everything in place - for
confinement.  Now that I think about, they'd hurt more than help, so forget 'em.

Inertial confinement only operates on a single pellet, the fuse.  (Ha ha!) 
The problem with inertial confinement is delivering enough energy. 
Quantum-well lasers are something like 10 to 100 times as efficient, and I
believe they aren't difficult to construct given nano.  Englobe the whole
pellet with lasers instead of using one.  Then fire.  I think that you could
probably deliver at least 1,000 times as much energy as in modern inertial
confinement.  It'd take a gigajoule to set the thing off, sure, but then you
have a fusion explosion and you can use it to set off arbitrarily larger ones.

Or maybe you could set each and every photon to hit a designated atom at the
designated time.  I'm not sure that would be too hard in theory, given atomic
positioning and some quantum electrodynamics.  But (IMHO) it would take a HELL
of a lot of computing power.  FAR more than the mere exaflops the human brain
is estimated to use.  You'd probably need an entire quantum computer for each
atom, a quantum continent for the whole pellet.  So chalk this up as a
possible strategic advantage for black goo; if you can get a whole continent
as base, you might be able to get arbitrary amounts of energy from fusion.

Huh.  As I recall, the U238 fizzed when the deuterium fused, which is how
themonuclears got up to 50 megatons.  Well, either way, we're pretty much
agreed that given a small sun to start with, you can make arbitrarily larger ones.

It seems to me that this all depends on what kind of quantum properties we can
play with.  Light is very easy to play with.  Quantum electrodynamics lets us
make it sit up, roll over, and play dead.  We can send it pretty much anywhere
we want if we can make all the little arrows line up properly.  Now, are there
quantum reasons why we can't do this with neutrons or protons?  Or is it just
that we'd need to arrange atoms precisely?  If the former, nanonukes won't be
much improved.  If the latter, nanonukes will be continent-wreckers.

So they launch a few million square miles of solar power satellites. 
Admittedly, those are then vulnerable.  Do you really think energy is going to
be a problem?  Maybe some of the black goo will be suicide exploding nanites,
or battery nanites, imported from the Solar Collection Continent.  Current
technology can always be taken as a lower limit.  Does nano imply fusion?  Ask
some fusion researcher:  "If you had complete control over the molecular
structure of matter, and could get anything built of available atoms just by
wishing for it, could you build a powerful fusion reactor?"

I note we've gone from "Nanites can't handle blast waves" to "There won't be

When I invoke quantum nanotech, I'm taking something you can do with photons,
and assuming you can do it with neutrons or protons or atoms.  I truly don't
know how plausible that is.  Probably some of the stuff I mentioned will work,
and some won't.  I'm not a physicist.  What I know of Heisenberg and Penrose
makes it seem that neutrons and protons are subject to the same tricks as
photons, but only over very short distances and very short times.  So, unlike
photons, you need to be operating at a much lower scale.  How much lower, I do
not know.  It would probably depend on the application.

Feynman diagrams show a photon hitting an electron, but when we make a mirror,
we don't know which electron the photon will hit.  Nanotech might let us
invoke specific Feynman diagrams; fire one specific photon at one specific
electron; position one specific nucleus to be hit by one specific neutron.

Even if you can't quite do THAT, the ability to create precise crystals and
precise positioning has moved you quite a bit Closer To The Bottom.  It's
precise spacings of one type or another that let us play so many quantum
tricks with photons.

Underestimating a technology is Clark's Law.
The kind of error distinguished scientists make.

You named a timelike error, like nano arriving next Tuesday or in 2070.
The kind of error bash young scientists make.

Finally, I'm not history, but this argument can't happen without two sides. 
Which side is right is not relevant to the value of your contribution.

Okay, so our immune system uses directed evolution to create attack nanites. 
Just because the attack nanites are unsophisticated does not mean the immune
system is unsophisticated.  There's strategy, tactics, and dynamic evolution
of new attack nanites.  The actual battles may be between idiots, but the
supporting operations and design of the idiots is where victory will be
decided, and where relative complexity is calculated.

That was my point, although it was directed more at the dangers of idealistic

But you *do* need an invulnerable system, or at least one that is invulnerable
to goo.  I can reasonably invoke any forces modern technology is capable of
wielding, up to and including nuclear weapons.  If black goo reduces your city
to radioactive ash, you lose!  It doesn't matter how sophisticated your
defenses are!  I am darn well entitled to demand that your immune system stand
up against nuclear weapons, because in practice, that's what going to be used!

Not impossible.  Not at all impossible.  If you have a layered defense system,
a diamond shell, and Fog seat belts, the city might be perfectly capable of
withstanding a nuclear attack.  It would lose a layer of defense, but might
well be capable of rebuilding it before more black goo crossed the radioactive
zone.  In addition, as I pointed out, the city might gain more than it lost.

Even so, it's entirely possible that, on any planet, the black goo wins.  All
the time.  Every time.  The Universe is under no obligation to make things
easy for us.  Hence the proposed Directive of Evacuation:  "Get everyone off
the Earth, into partitioned space colonies, before releasing nanotechnology to
the world."

> Your claim that destruction is
> fundamentally more efficient than creation suggests that if I know about
> your goo I can destroy it.

There is, of course, something to that.  The problem is preventing it from
being mutual destruction.  The surface area of conflict, and strategic
compartmentalization, mean that if destruction is easier than creation, then
attack is easier than defense, and both parties lose equal amounts of
resources until only one is left.  Don't forget that your resources may be
devoted to supporting humans.  Also, nanobattle might end in stalemate, but
even so eliminate all higher-than-nano structures such as humans.

My mental picture of these conflicts is partially drawn from Conway's Game of
Life, in which a single particle can destroy an enormous, complex structure. 
Things on the molecular level will almost certainly be different.  Even so, I
know of no better image.

Though molecules are FAR more robust than any Life structure I have ever been
privileged to look at, the actual "front" might still resemble a game of Life.
 Energy pulses through and breaks all bonds, creating a no-man's-land
reminiscent of randomized Life.  Both sides grab at the atoms and volume
created.  Tactically, the situation appears symmetrical.  Strategically, it's
hard to tell who has the advantage.

Still, let's dwell on the tactics for a few moments.  The goo can send a
shaped explosion aimed at the city, so that the no-man's-land is composed of
formerly city material, rather than equal amounts of city and goo.  Can the
city send shaped charges back at the goo?  Yes.  Can the city "grab" the
no-man's-land thus created?  Locally, yes - although there is one *minor*
tactical advantage, which is that the goo is independent and the city is
structured, so that the city has to expend more effort to build into a given
amount of volume.  But I'm claiming a lot of battle intelligence for the black
goo, while the city's first line of defense, rather than being diamondoid, may
be independent 'munes.  I think that, tactically, there's a match.

Strategically, I'm assuming the goo has unlimited material, while the city has
limited material.  I'm assuming that nuclear power is cheap enough that both
have unlimited power.  (I'm also assuming the city is padded, so nukes can't
kill it outright.)  Also, the goo surrounds the city.

Try this tactic.  First, the goo hits the city with a vaporize-one-layer
attack, even though this also vaporizes a layer of goo.  Then it detonates a
nuclear weapon next to the city.  This pushes the city into the goo,
dissipating the no-man's-land and replacing it with the soft goo.  The goo is
using, as a strategic/tactical advantage, the city's rigidity.  If the city is
surrounded by a layer of soft goo, it's difficult to tell what happens.

The city is a steel ball surrounded by 'munes surrounded by goo.  A nuke stirs
things up.  Since goo outnumbers 'mune, most of the city is now surrounded by
goo.  The 'mune stirred into the goo can be treated as isolated spores and
obliterated with overwhelming force.  The city has lost some mass.  Moreover,
this is a one-way tactic; it cannot be used against the goo.

Sigh.  Gray goo, yes, a sea of black goo, no.  I am not proposing that goo
spores will radiate gamma rays.  War goo might.

I am mainly worried about macro attack and defense.  If it is easier to
destroy than create, this translates into a strategic advantage for the human
in spore attacks.  You just find and destroy the spore, using nuclear weapons
if you feel like it.

I'd be more inclined to trap the spore in something solid, heat it to a few
thousand degrees, pass a few thousand amperes, and hurl into the nuclear
reactor that powers the city.  If you can make something the spore can't get
into, you can make something it can't get out of, and will be greatly aided by
the fact that you don't give a damn about living conditions inside the trap. 
Diamond scar?  Diamond cyst!

Okay, sounds to me like they're perfectly vulnerable to spoofing.  And
regardless of whether I can "detect" them from the outside, why shouldn't I
simply assume they're there?  Can they be fooled if I know they're there
(although not exactly where)?

Of course.  But even so, the detectors are useless.  You offered an advantage;

I don't deny it's an effective partial solution.  Like the principle of proof
by induction, it's a very useful solution.  But you still need to write the
recursive function, not just decide to use LISP as a language.

Which is more complex, more subject to disruption?  You, or the goo?  I won't
discuss transhuman defense against the goo; that's their problem.  But human
intelligence might NOT have the time to implement defenses in nanowar.  Not if
things move too quickly; not if evolution controls the battlefield.  Anyway, I
think that nanowar is the problem.  If nanowar is easy enough, destructive
enough, the Evacuation becomes necessary.

The gray goo problem is overrated; it's black goo we need to worry about.  We
can get along just fine without any self-reproducing nanites, ever.  We can
make 10 capable of constructing 1, given plans broadcasted by remote signal. 
If we can't use remote signals, we can use super-redundant "queens" to carry
the information that directs 10 to make 1, or 20 to make a queen.  Will this
slow down reproduction?  You bet.  Who cares?  It's not the speed that makes
nano reproduction so powerful, it's that it happens at all.

Subtle attacks are operating under enormous strategic disadvantages.  Not that
they won't be possible.  I've noticed and informed authorities of my share of
analogies between computer security programs and toilet tissue.  But we can't
discuss subtle attacks, not really.  Subtle attacks will mature slowly as the
power of nanotech unfolds, as with computer security in our times.  What could
a 1950s programmer say about computer security?

If it is inert diamondoid, is that more of a hindrance than the outer shell?

Besides, this whole discussion is looking obsolete anyway.  Any rigid outer
defense is toast.  It has to be surrounded by explosive-equipped soft 'mune. 
At most, you can have a rigid outer defense as a pretty shell.

It has often struck me that homogeneity is a tremendous tactical advantage in
battle.  Well, not really, only in this past thread.  But even so, homogeneity
means you have no delay time to bring up specialized warriors; you can replace
all fallen comrades simply by stirring things up.

But even granting your case, if the goo has so much as a cubic millimeter to
call its own, it can keep its queen reproducers in the center while
surrounding itself with warrior goo, just like the city.

Why can't the goo use antibodies and macrophages against the 'mune?

The tactical symmetry remains unbroken.

Aha!  A tactical advantage for defense over offense!  It is easier to keep a

If nanotechnology was released on Earth, the 'munes would have to be
EVERYWHERE.  The air.  The water.  Earth's molten core.  Otherwise, the goo
could gain a foothold.  At all costs, the goo can *never* be allowed to become
a sea.  While it is spores it can be obliterated in mutual annihilation.  As a
sea, it obliterates you.  It's not quite a molecular game of Go.  You have to
outnumber and outdeepen your enemy, not just surround it.  But even so...

Yeah, but the problem with rigid structures is that they can be destroyed by
explosives.  There are no invulnerable shells.  A blast creates a free area
which both sides try to gobble.  Sit there in your shell and you're dead meat;
the goo will send a shaped charge to create an asymmetrical dead zone, eat the
whole thing, and repeat until you're the size of an apple core.

I disagree with the whole concept of a nanoscar.  If there is such a thing,
you turn it into your first line of defense, not wait until after you've been invaded.

You aren't serious, but even so... after all that?  The whole discussion?  I'm
debating it, not asserting it, although considering the existence of TNT and
nukes, destruction is close to axiomatic on the molecular level.

A nice piece by Moravec.  One of those Little Bits of Everything.  Superdense

I don't know what the motivation was for choosing devices with this
particular level of sophistication and difficulty.  Obviously there
would be a wide range of alternative choices.  I asked/complained a bit
on sci.nanotech about it, but I didn't get much response.  My view was
that the devices were too difficult, that you'd have to have a fully
mature nanotech to produce such devices, and that the prize would be
more useful if it rewarded a stepping stone on the path to nanotech,
rather than adding (infinitesimally) to the reward at the end.

I suspect that there is an implicit assumption of a particular path
towards nanotech where these devices would in fact represent an inter-
mediate point.  The fact that 32 copies are needed presents a hint.
Specifically, an atomic force microscope enhanced with interchangeable
tips which can catalyze certain bonds might work.  You'd probably only
be able to build one or a few copies of the nano device, so 32 would
perhaps be within reach.

Even if this is the explanation, I would still complain that the FI ought
not to be endorsing one particular path and designing a prize which only
makes sense if that path is followed.  (Personally I think the biotech
route to a protein assembler makes more sense.)

I read that law review article you posted, but I felt that they missed
the point.  The authors seemed to think that the difficulty would arise
in trying to fit nanotech into the current regulatory framework.  They
went into a lot of detail about how it would be hard to decide whether
an in situ nanotech cell repair system was a drug or a medical device.

My feeling is that it is more likely that nanotech will provoke the
same over-reaction as biotech, namely that research on it will be
heavily restricted.  There will be different levels of containment
necessary, only certain kinds of designs will be allowed, working with
biological specimens will be restricted, certain applications will be
"born classified" as is the case with nuclear research, ethical review
committees will have to sign off on any new direction for research, etc.

All this regulation is likely to hinder the rate of progress in nanotech
development, and may even limit it so much that only the military is in
a position to develop advanced nano.

Who can know what the right answers are?  We all know that both the
risks and return are almost incalculably high.  I certainly don't claim
to know what the right path is to steer around the dangers.

A retreat to space is the most likely method of negating the sea's strategic
advantages, leaving the local tactical advantages of home ground.  Even if the
goo can fling unlimited missiles after you, they'll be defeated, and their
material consumed, only adding to your size.  Even so, spacegoers might be
vulnerable to being surrounded, or having their light cut off.  But any city
on a planet is untenable, since the planet might turn into a sea.  If you have
all the material you're using, leave for space while you still can.

So then we have the following scenario:

1.  Drexler (for example) gets nanotech in some hidden laboratory.

2.  (Dictator phase.  These actions are taken without debate.)
  A.  Drexler disables all nuclear weapons.
  B.  If there is any obvious and safe way to do so, human bodies are
strengthened to survive the coming disruption.
  C.  Drexler builds a fortress for himself and hides within.
  D.  Drexler announces nanotech.

3.  (Monopoly phase.  Debate, but only Drexler has nanotech.)
	Drexler directs the nanotech to take each city, build it a Colony, and fling
it into space.  He might also give some mechanism whereby an individual can
request his own Colony; I'd want one.
	Drexler also directs the nanotech to build a transit system between Colonies;
and to build some huge number of spare Colonies so individuals or fringe
groups can have them.
	He doesn't have to disturb the surface of the Earth (except for all the
missing cities); he can use the sea floor for raw material, and even bring up
a lot of extra sea floor in case we need more.  Maybe even the asteroids would
suffice; would there be enough of each element?
	Sweeping the Earth for farmers would be harder and more arbitrary, but it
could still be done.
	At the end of phase three, Earth is depopulated.  All inhabitants are
compartmentalized in space, either in Earth orbit or spread through Earth's
orbit.  Note that this whole phase has to take place in minimum time, and that
Drexler has to do it all himself.  (This suggests, in practical terms, that
nanotech centers should have complete plans for Colonies always on hand.  And
we might start looking for popular consent... bearing in mind that there'll be
a lot of "I *like* Earth" whining until actual nanotech is demonstrated.  But
it needn't come as a shock.)
  Even so, can one person do all the nano-design work involved?  I don't know.
 I should think we'd need high-level crystalizable designs, the physical
equivalent of pseudo-code.  Can we do that?  Right now?  What would be needed
to do that right now, in terms of cash and computer power?
  Since the whole point of this is to avoid spreading contamination, and to
avoid the goo gaining an overwhelming material superiority, the Colonies
should really orbit the Sun, be at least 10,000,000 miles from Earth or any
other planet, and be at least 100,000 miles from each other.

4.  (Nanotech phase.)
	Drexler makes nanotech freely available and abdicates.  The goo cannot become
a sea due to lack of available material; it must spread by spores and
therefore immunity is workable.  It might be necessary to implement primitive
'mune in the colonies before GNUing nanotech.  All such systems will
necessarily be primitive, however, because they will be implemented only by
one person and designed only by whatever pre-nano team does the pseudocode.

In this situation, I'd go off alone, above the ecliptic, and far away from
everyone else, maybe snagging an asteroid along the way to use for raw
material.  I'd remain in communication, using what 'tech became available and
offering my own suggestions.  But mainly, I'd be experimenting with neural reprogramming.

I don't know how the rest of the populace would take it.  I don't know how the
Extropians would take it.  I don't know whether warfare could be devastatingly
prosecuted on that scale, with nukes and lasers disrupting the fragility of
space.  I don't know what kind of mutual defense treaties would be organized. 
I don't know what countries would survive.  I don't know what life will be
like.  I don't know what the Singularity ETA would be.

But...

We'd have nanotech.  And, if not safe, at least we wouldn't be doomed.  This,
I think, is more or less the minimum change in rules for nano 'mune to work.

-- Disadvantages.

1:  What if there's an enormous advantage for offense over defense in space -
not in nano 'mune, but in ordinary warfare?  What if one Colony can, in a
first strike, wipe out a thousand others?  Will we be safe from the goo, only
to be devoured by each other?

2:  I can't help but think that at least some dictatorial powers are going to
be needed to evacuate the Earth.

3:  How many Colonies will succumb to gray goo within themselves, from foolish
experiments?  What percentage will survive?  What percentage will be left?

4:  How does Drexler, all by himself, do all this?  What's the minimum size of
the Nano King's Court?

True-blue, Tiplerian Omega-Pointers are my favorite "religious" freaks.

My first reaction to the criteria (as I posted) was that they compose
the "final step." I tend to agree that $250,000 is less valuable at that

Foresight is steeped in Drexler -- he's the friggin' Chairman for pete's

That holds water for me.

I don't have the science background to assign a sensibility to either
case, but I do know that Drexler's works are persuasive to a layman. Can
you point me to discussions concerning likely route technologies other
than the Drexlerian biotech route?

I agree. I'm considering an approach based upon the biotech and GE
regulatory models. Perhaps a critique of sorts, where they went wrong,
effects, etc. There's been a lot more written on those topics than
nanotech to say the least. One good point made in that article was the
necessity of reasoning by analogy. Theorizing is only possible in
science due to physical law -- there are things that we can do and
things we can't. The only reference point in the legal realm is what we
have as law already. Analogy is the weakest form of argumentation, but
in the case of nanotech regulation predictions, it is the best
predictive tool I can think of.

Or Japan, since the Japanese government has been sinking yen into MITI,
ERATO, PERI and a zillion other acronyms for a few years now (look at
Drexler's article in Foresight #9 for some details).

Nor does anyone that I know of. But, I'm optomistic that given
sufficient forethought, societal future shock is avoidable.

Yes, I think that is what most of us secretly think. OK, I'm

I assume you know about the Borg from Star Trek (if not, watch out
for my essay about borganism in next Homo Excelsior). de Chardin
refers to the jesuit mystic and paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin
and his pseudoscientific but influential idea of how the 'noosphere'
of thinking on Earth will get more and more interconnected, until
it merges into a superorganism which he called the Omega Point
and identified with Christ (yes, this was the source of Tiplers 
ideas).

Probably not possible. It is a matter of nuclear properties rather tham

Not quite. Water acts as a neutron moderator, i. e. it slows "fast' neutrons 
down,
increasing the collision cross section, hence the rate of nuclear reactions.

Just so.

Nyet. Free neutron half-life is about 15 minutes. Also, an atom cannot 
"grab" a neutron, only a nucleus can, changing the isotope or causing fission.

***Very, very good Mr. Yudkowsky.***

 What you have started to describe is a device I
conceived several years ago and have not published, called "Mr Fusion". This in 
fact constitutes the first public disclosure. And yes, it is very much like 
current laser inertial confinement, except the EMP front is vastly more 
structurally refined. Each laser is individually addressable. It may be possible 
to convert some portion of the released energy directly to electric by using the 
QM well as receivers.
See "The Optical Assembler" interview at the NanoTechnology magazine website for 
a description of a similar array.

Yes, but this still requires bettter plasma dynamics modeling and the rest of 
the things that have been just around the corner for the last forty years.

I like it, but without nanotech space colonization is much less economical;
with nanotech it becomes easy. So I assume you must have a stage where
the nanopowers (whoever they are) produce the necessary infrastructure, and
then declassify it? Sounds awfully altruistic to me, I doubt that would
come to pass.

On the other hand, do not ascribe to central planning what can be ascribed
to self-organisation: if nanotech is developed, it will first be fairly
limited and mainly used in labs by people in white coats. Then its products
will be marketed and sold, and eventually every home will have its own
assembler-tank. But it will take a while, and while it is unlikely there
is any way to prevent the spread of knowledge and ability to build nanotech
it will still be a lag between the companies and organisations that first
developed it and "the masses". During this lag period it is IMHO less
probable that nanotech will be misused in a globally dangerous way
(fewer people involved, less powerful technology), and it would give
the necessary capabilities to get off-planet as soon as possible. After
a while everybody will (in principle, if not in practice) have access to
nanotech anyway, and living in an orbital habitat starts to sound very nice...

I'm not sure what you mean by a decision procedure for optimality. 
The values themselves I take as givens. They might be design in by 
its constructor or they may result from some accidental occurence; I 
don't assume that they can be deduced from some self-evident axioms 
or something.

Given the values, it may or may not be trivial to translate them into 
micro-level descriptions of the value-optimal physical state. That 
depends on what the values are. But whatever they are, we can be 
pretty sure they are more likely to be made real by a 
superinelligence who holds those values than by one who doesn't. 
(Unless the values intrinsically involve, say,  respect for 
independent individuals or such ethical stuff.) The superintelligence 
realizes this and decides to junk the other computers in the 
universe, if it can, since they are in the way when optimising the 
SI's values.

Without a 100% reliable *global* immune system that will be 
equivalent to giving everyone access to the launch buttons for the 
world's total nuclear arsenal, as Eliezer said. Collective suicide.

Why do you think that a multipolar world order with nanotech would be

We are trying to discuss several scenarios at once on this thread, 
that's why it seems like some suspect rethoric maneuver is taking 
place. The nihilit fanatic is only dangerous if nanotech becomes 
everyman's tool, as Ander's said he think it will. But before 
that happens, we have to look at what the big, leading institutions 
would do with it.

I don't know about that. As far as existing law goes, the four basic
divisions of "intellectual property" are copyright, trademark, patent,
and trade secret -- all federal laws. 

Copyright applies only to "works of authorship." It's what most people
think of when they consider intellectual property, and I assume now it
is what you are thinking of since you mentioned software. Copyright
protection arises at the instant an original work of authorship is fixed
in a tangible medium of expression. By this construction, it doesn't
seem to apply here. Unless you use nanotech to record your latest
screenplay in a readable form (somehow) in combinations of atoms, you
have not really authored anything (authoring a new form of matter?).

Software receives protection under copyright not because of the function
it performs but because of the property interest in the code which has
been authored by one or more people (what if the abstract idea of the
GUI was protected by copyright?) Again, it's the code that is protected. 

So, since trademark law is for business names and logos (xenon atoms
spelling IBM?) and trade secret law is for information kept secret by
its owner that is not easily duplicable, the only real issue I see (off
the tippity-top of my head) is that of the ability to patent either the
process or the product. 

My initial reaction is that this would be a quagmire. I have no idea
about patenting the process of molecular manufacturing. IMO, even if it
were allowable under current law, such a patent would probably be void
as against public policy, much like the Atomic Energy Act of 1954
excluded the patenting of inventions 
useful solely in utilization of special nuclear material or atomic
energy for (obviously) atomic weapons.  

On the other hand, patents are granted everyday for new chemical
compounds. This kind of manufactured product (whether done by engineered
proteins or nanoscale assemblers) seems clearly patentable. A thought
just occurred to me, what about diamondoid? My inital guess would be
that it would be an interesting court battle. Clearly, diamondoid is not
a product of human genius, rather, it is the result of physical law. If
it turned out that there was only one way to make it, and that process
was also patentable, then no one else would be able to make it
(legally). But this seems unlikely for the reason I sketched above.

Software piracy is an everyday occurrence, of course, and the
enforcement problem is definitely a major issue. How does Merrell-Dow
stay in business when their drugs are being made in basements?

I think the article you mentioned is interesting, but a bit fumbling;
the legal problems of drugs vs. medical products are obvious but
solvable, while the far-future aspects were treated a bit too light-
handedly. Uploading isn't the first thing to worry about once we
have nanotech. 

As I see it, the main legal problem will be that matter has become
as malleable as software, with the acompanying problems of intellectual
property. We still have not solved that problem even today, and it
will likely get worse. How do you get paid for information and ideas,
when they can be copied endlessly? How can you enforce copyrights
on software or physical objects. 

In the long-term future one could imagine a shareware economy, where
creators get paid by others on a voluntary basis; since physical
scarcity has become irrelevant it is no disaster to be uncreative,
you can simply live on the products other design for fun. In this
scenario the software and designs are free, and there is no need
for copyrights. Unfortunately this is very far from our current state, 
and might be an unlikely state to end up in.

Another big problem currently being analysed on the extropians list
is of course how to avoid dangerous nanotech. How do you enforce
that replicators all need a rare, artificial "vitamin" or cannot
replicate in nature (current genetic research seems to manage it)?
What about weapons laws? What is a weapon is largely a matter of
creativity, and with nanotech some weapons might be created just
before use (should we outlaw weapons designs?) or apparently
tame nanotech used as a weapon. Can one distinguish between different
kinds of nanotech, so that one kind can be labeled weapon and another
drug?

Apropos drugs, even early nanotech can make drug production trivial.
This can have interesting consequences for the War on Drugs, organized
crime (what happens if the junkies can download a freeware design for
heroin?) and for creative neuronauts, who can develop drugs which
are devices (and hence not under the jurisdiction of the DEA in the US?).
Perhaps one could clarify the law, to outlaw all systems that in
some artificial way interface with the pleasure and motivation 
centers of the brain (with allowances for medical use).

They don't have to be.  For libertarianism to work BETTER than statism,
all we need is for people to behave MORE wisely in their private capacity
than in their political capacity.  I'm looking for improvement, not

It's not so "metaphorical" in languages that are low on the
Berlin-Kay scale.  What the heck does he mean by that, I hear
you ask.  To be brief, there are plenty of languages that have
only a few color terms; e.g. in Swahili the only true adjectives
for color[*] are translated as `black' `white' `red' -- but their
older meaning is more likely `dark' `pale' `warm-color'.  In such
color-poor languages, I *am* white, because `white' embraces a chunk
of color-space much bigger than the 1/16 or less that we give it.  On
another hand, by that standard a lot of "yellow" people are white too.

[*] Swahili has other color terms, but they're periphrastic:
`green' = `of the color of leaves', `gray' = `of the color of ash',
`blue' = `of the color of _buluu_'.  Presumably these are newer
than the three adjectives.  (For all I know, colloquial Swahili
has true adjectives that didn't make it into my books.)

How do you defeat a nuke with detectors on the outside that detonates

Yes, it is remarable how many people are stuck with the idea that an 
effective defense *must* be possible. That's blind faith. And even if 
effective defense is possible, there is still the genesis problem; 
but by another leap of faith, that problem *must* be soluble too, 
even within an unregulated mulipolar world order. I suspect there is 
some ideological prejudice at the bottom of this.

An interesting way of looking at it.

Do you literally mean "push"? That would seem like fantasy.

I agree. As I think is clear from my postings, goo designed to 
destruct is what I meant by grey goo, but from now on I will call it 
black goo.

Right. An infallible global immune system would be reguired. A local

August 23, 1997 Science News reports "Reservoir of water hides high

 "Brain doubles up on marijuanalike agents" by J. Travis in August 23,
1997 Science News online
<http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc97/8_23_97/fob2.htm> summarizes a
970821 Nature report by Piomelli, et.al., on 2-AG: "Investigators now
report that the brain makes a second THC-like compound, called sn-2
arachidonylglycerol, or 2-AG, and it does so in much greater
quantities than anandamide." 

2-AG "is made by the hippocampus" and "may play a role in the
deliberate forgetting" associated with the long-term potentiation of
memory.

It sounds like we could figuratively call it the brains
highlighter. The compound has also been found in the intestines,
spleen and pancreas, indicating it plays some role in those organs as
well.

>From a consciousness (and perhaps cryonics) perspective, its
interesting that they noted that "2-AG can prove difficult to detect
in the brain because the compound degrades rapidly after death.
Piomelli's team avoided that problem by quick-freezing brain tissue
within 10 seconds of a rat's death and then analyzing the tissue."

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 333 August 26, 1997    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein

TRAPPING A SINGLE NANOPARTICLE BETWEEN TWO
ELECTRODES has been controllably achieved for the first time,
enabling researchers to deposit individual nanoparticles onto
surfaces and offering possibilities such as single-nanoparticle
switches.  Researchers (Cees Dekker, Delft University of
Technology, dekker@qt.tn.tudelft.nl) construct a circuit
containing two platinum electrodes separated by as little as 4
nm--a gap that the researchers believe to be a world record.  To
trap nm-scale molecules or clusters, they immerse the electrodes
in a solution containing the nanoparticles.  Applying a voltage to
the electrodes polarizes each particle and attracts a particle to the
gap between the electrodes.  Once a particle bridges the gap,
current flows through the circuit, and a resistor then sharply
reduces the electric field, discouraging any additional
nanoparticles from entering the gap.   In principle, this
electrostatic-trapping technique can work for any polarizable
nanoparticle; it has been demonstrated for nanometer-scale
clusters of palladium (Pd) atoms, carbon nanotubes, and a 5
nm-long chain of thiophene (a conducting polymer).  The
researchers have also studied the properties of single electrons as
they cross a Pd nanocluster between the electrodes.  (A.

Actually, way back in Engines, Drexler recommended that these be *limited*
assemblers.  The kitchen "build anything machine" would be restricted to
building items from a catalog.  New designs would be carefully reviewed
before being added to the approved list.

The biggest problem with this scheme seems to be preventing someone from
getting access to unrestricted nanotech via some means.  Either they find
a way to subvert their limited assembler, or they do it the old-fashioned
way, via biotech or STMs or self-assembling chemicals, etc.  Or, more
disturbingly, members of the original group which developed nanotech may
have retained access to the technology in its most powerful form, "just in
case".

If there are several different groups pursuing the development of nanotech,
then it would be even more likely that we would end up with many groups
with access to full nanotech.  Sci-fi ideas like having the first nanotech
group create a plague which seeks out and destroys all the other research
don't seem plausible.

So in this scenario there are a few groups with full nanotech, which
hopefully they use responsibly (or not at all).  Everybody else has
access to limited assemblers, which create the kinds of improved products
we associate with nanotech, but don't let them destroy the world.

Um, nanotech (of the sort you're talking about) doesn't exist yet,
so it can't subdue anyone. The English language does have conditional
moods and future tenses, and sometimes their use is appropriate.

Nicholas Bostrom, in a different post, reponded to Carl Feynman's
discussion of the engineering difficulties we will be able to expect
in the development of mechanosynthetic nanotech by pointing out
that optimized designs will not be necessary to achieve self-reproduction.
But as a strategic point, I would expect that non-optimized designs
would be very easy to design countermeasures for (or just blow away
with a blowtorch, as Damien Sullivan suggests).  In order for
molecular nanotechnology to present a serious military threat to
existing soldiery, highly optimized designs would have to be
developed. I agree with Carl Feynman's assessment that this will
take much time and many, many engineers.  In such research efforts,
open exchange of information is likely to keep traditional published
scientific work at least neck-and-neck with any secret developments.

Of course, if large amounts of tax money are dumped by governments
into secret development projects, such as current cryptography work
conducted in the US National Security Agency, that could tip the
balance in favor of the scenarios that Nicholas Bostrom fears. (One
more reason to thin down the public sector, eh?)

I'm sorry, folks, but certain elements of this thread are starting
to look like disasturbation to me.  Seriously, I think ordinary
old biotech is a much more real danger (designer plagues and the
like) to us right now.  I would definitely expect some nasty
bioweapons mishaps, perhaps resulting in millions of human deaths,
long before we see any serious threat from molecular nanotechnology.

I suspect that an entity driven by values that were trivial to
translate into micro-level descriptions of the value-optimal physical
state would quickly succumb to competition from strategies of
entities with more complex values with more unpredictable outcomes.

An entity with more complex values would not find it trivial to do
calculations of optimality, and would likely refrain from destroying
computing hardware for fear of inadvertently introducing a suboptimal
overall state. Particularly since market interactions allow one to
freely exploit as much computing power as one can pay for (and I'm
including human attention and cognition in here as well... many of
us on the list are professionals paid for our personal computing
time).

I don't know.  I see existing hardware as a resource to be used,
not as raw feedstock atoms.  People fantasize a lot about ab-initio
scenarios, but ab-initio stuff on a large scale is usually much
less economical than bootstrapping from real, existing, computational
resources.  Current economic theory (I still favor the Austrian
school) looks abstract, general, *and* solid enough to me that I
doubt superintelligences are going to be able to evade its dictates.

Yes, I agree. It is conceivable that an SI would have conservatism or 
naturalness as values. (Presumably because those values were 
prevalent in the culture in which it was built, so that these values 
were programmed in.) But that's what they are: specific values that 
would have to be explicitly added, not something that we can take for 
granted.

In general, I think we can say the following: Sentimentality values 
will be less prominent than they are today. By sentimentality values 
I mean values that are dependent on an object's historical origin or 
specific association with a beloved one etc. Why would they be less 
prominent? Because at least in some cases they are valued only 
indirectly, for the psychological effects they produce (a curl from a 
lost lover elicits memories and nostalgia, for example). But in the 
future, these effects will be more efficiently produced by 
manipulating the brain or the emotional centres in the 
superintelligence (assuming it has bothered to preserve them). 
So the physical objects (such as Mother Earth) would no longer be 
needed.

No, none of those are "optimized".  Insofar as they are optimized, germs and
commercial software are heavily optimized for miniumum design requirements,
even at the cost of performance.  Living systems in particular are bizarre
cobbled-together things.  Their energy use is a reasonable approximation of
optimal not because they are well-designed, but because the thermodynamic
processes they use are very efficient.  Even with "inefficient" and indirect
chemistry, they still come out pretty well.

Nobody has presented a self-replicating Life system.  All Conway did was
produce a feasibility proof, so you know it *can* be done.  Actually
designing such a system is still considered not yet possible.

I think a machine-phase nanotech will be far harder to design than current
biological nanosystems.  Chemical thermodynamics does a lot of work in
current enzyme-driven systems, like locating substrates, moving substrates,
and performing the reaction.  The biological system need only design the
enzyme.  In current machine-phase proposals, all that has to be done
deliberately, greatly adding to the complexity of the design, and to the
energy costs.  Frankly, the proposals for wild machine-phase nanotech sound
to me like they will need a host of Maxwell's demons inside instructing the
device what to do to obtain its stupendous energy, and then telling it how to
find all the individual atoms it needs to make itself.  Locating vast numbers
of halogens in a non-aqueous environment is a really tough task.  Even in a
saline solution, grabbing and using the chlorine won't be easy.

Von Neumann concluded you'd need about 250,000 parts in an environment
specifically designed for replication.  I think 1,000,000 in a lab
environment where chemicals and energy are provided for the replicator is a
reasonable lower bound.  Chemistry isn't specifically designed for
replication like Von Neumann's system.

Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the

real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind of

I recently read a review of Churchlands "Engine of Reason" in PSYCHE
(see http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-29-dacosta.html) and
started thinking about this again and decided to look up eliminative
materialism.  I found a nice overview of the philosophical categories
in Richard Vitzthums "Philosophical Materialism", a lecture given to
the Atheist Students Association at the University of Maryland,
College Park, on November 14, 1996, available at
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html
:

<When someone today describes himself or herself as a materialist,
they generally mean they stand somewhere in a spectrum defined at one
end as reductive materialism[3] and at the other end as eliminative
materialism[4]. [SNIP] One promising theory is that networks of
neurons in the brain consist of subsidiary groups of neurons or even
individual neurons that serve as the axes of a multi-dimensional
system of coordinates that can mathematically translate one kind of
value to another kind of value. [SNIP] eliminativists hold that the
theory is so revolutionary and so much more convincing than current
theories of the brain -- for instance, that the brain is basically
propositional and language-oriented -- that it will eventually
displace and replace the linguistic theory, just as the modern theory
of mental disease displaced the medieval theory of demonic possession.
Against them stand the reductive materialists, I among them, who share
their enthusiasm for the new theory but believe that it will
successfully reduce at least portions of the old theory the way
Einstein's relativity successfully reduced Newton's laws of motion.>

<[4] Eliminative materialists contend that minds don't exist, that our
'vague talk' about things like feelings, thoughts, desires, etc, needs
to be eliminated from our vocabulary and replaced with precise
scientific terms referring only to brain states.>
(http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F4)

I couldnt disagree more! Vitzthum also states that "eliminativists
and reductionists believe only in physical substances and properties".
 Is software *and its usage* simply a "property" of the computer on
which it is running?  I think these accounts are lacking a key
concept, organization, which has been well developed by systems
science and cybernetics (cf. Principia Cybernetica).  In fact, some
connectionists are beginning to wonder whether they have not been
paying enough attention to system architecture (cf. "Connectionist
Learning: Is It Time To Reconsider The Foundations?" 14 May 1997 post
by Asim Roy at http://neuro.psy.soton.ac.uk/~at/Archive/0026.html)

< [8] Functionalists claim that mental states are functional states
(rather than brain states) which connect input (environmental
stimuli), other mental states (interconnected functions), and output
(behavioral responses) in a cognitive system by means of causal
relations. [Snip] Most functionalists are physicalists [materialists]
in that they hold that only appropriate physical states could serve as
such causal intermediaries. But they... [hold that] mental properties
cannot be identified with physical-biological properties.>
(http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F8)

This sounds much closer to my way of thinking about things, except for
"rather than" in the first sentence - I would say "as well as". The
"identified" is key in the last sentence - few complex systems are
reducible to the *sum* of their parts because some parts are dual
purpose, participating as components in several systems, even serving
several functions simultaneously.

Another very useful reference was Lyle Zyndas metaphysics handout,
"Churchland on Eliminative Materialism" for a 1995 Caltech course at
http://sun1.iusb.edu/~lzynda/handout14.html :

< Churchland argues that functionalism is in fact a reactionary theory
that tries to save an outmoded conception of our mental lives (folk
psychology) by abstraction. Folk psychology is made immune to advances
in neuroscience by postulating that its categories (beliefs and
desires) are only "functional states." According to Churchland, this
is a scientifically illegitimate move, as illegitimate as an attempt
to save alchemy in the face of the new chemical theories of Lavoisier
and Dalton by postulating that its categories were merely "functional"
and not really chemical. >

Well, sure, its a "scientifically illegitimate move" *if* your
research is aimed *only* at mechanical description! But, is the
scientific method appropriate for guiding all forms of human activity,
such as poetry or sexuality? When it comes to structural descriptions
and engineering research, eliminativism is probably the appropriate
description, especially with major paradigm shifts. BUT, I would
counter that its a *philosophically illegitimate move* to deny any
sort of functional analysis!  I think this is particularly true in the
case of neuroscience (as opposed to chemistry, for example) which is
still in its infancy.

Im beginning to feel that this eliminative approach advocated by
Churchland reeks of throwing out the baby with the bath water and
leaves us, for example, wallowing for years in the intricacies of
neural net vector processing when there are important architectural
and relational issues that we should also be addressing.

The National Food Processors Association (NFPA) and the USDA wants FDA to
lift the ban on meat irradiation to prevent food poisoning such as Hudson
Food's ground beef:
 
     WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Efforts by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to help ensure the safety of the nation's food supply "should
focus on preventing food safety problems, rather than on unnecessarily
expanding USDA's enforcement powers," according to Dane Bernard, Vice
President of Food Safety Programs for the National Food Processors
Association
(NFPA).

     It is NFPA's belief that USDA should focus its resources on *prevention*
of 
food safety problems, rather than on greater recall *authority.*  More than
four 
years ago, USDA asked FDA to approve the use of food irradiation -- a 
treatment that kills pathogens such as _E. coli_ 0157:H7 and _Salmonella_ --
on 
red meat.  This scientifically proven safe and effective technology has
already been approved for a number of other food products, such as fruits,
vegetables and poultry.  Irradiation for food has been endorsed by an array
of national and international food safety and health experts. USDA should
press FDA to act now.  The safety studies have all been completed and have
passed multiple peer reviews four years ago.  The FDA should not wait to make
this important food safety tool available for use on meat.

I thought this might interest those of you who are the investigators,
microbiologists and epidemiologists. 
_____________________________ 
Intentional microbiological food contamination is extremely rare, but it does
occur.  
In 1984, at "The Dalles," Oregon, 751 people who ate in ten restaurants
became ill with _Salmonella_ food poisoning.    
  
After local health department epidemiologists began receiving an inordinate
amount of complaints of food poisoning, an investigation was launched.  See:
_A Large Community Outbreak of Salmonellosis Caused by Intentional
Contamination of Restaurant Salad Bars_, Torok TJ, et al.  The investigators
looked into the health of restaurant employees, the town water supply, and
the food suppliers the restaurants used, yet no common factor could be found.
  
  
  
A year later, the investigators had enough information to link a religious
commune to the outbreak. The group had contaminated salad bar fixings and
coffee creamers at the restaurants with a strain of _Salmonella_ bacteria in
the hope of keeping voters away from polling booths on election day; one of
the items on the ballot could have negatively affected the commune.

Why?

And even if that is the case, don't forget that the step from rather 
optimized designs to highly optimized designs might be fairly quick, 
and if that's the step that creates the big military potential, 
then...

I, on the contrary, think that this is the most interesting thread 
we've ever had, and that it is really exciting that we are begining 
to think seriously for the first time about the strategic situation 
that will arise when nanotech is developed.

(Fairly optimised). Germs are highly optimised, given 
certain design constraints, shaped as they are by immense selection 
pressure and short generation cycles. Cars are optimised. Much 
commersial software is also fairly optimised. But you have a point 
here. There is also commersial software whose performance is not 
optimized, and in some cases it can still it can be highly 
non-trivial to design it. So if that is the relevant analogy then it 
points in the direction Carl intended it to.

Really? I thought I've heard that the Universal Turing machine was 
actually designed, with streams of gliders serving as tape etc. But I 
may be wrong, in which case I'm glad you pointed it out. Do you have 
any references?

  In my plans for immortality, I am trying to assess the viablilty of brain
transplantation.  Within a few months, if not already, I will be able to make
 clones of myself from, say, an epithelial cell.  I can pay some, or many women
in any of many nations to bear and rear my son(s).  In 20 years, when I am
dying of cancer, or some new disorder which hasn't yet been cured, will I be
any better off?  Even in the best scenario, where a universal nanomachine has
been constructed, disease mechanisms and pathways will not be elucidated
overnight. Cures will likely require a great deal of NP protein conformational
analysis & simulation, which even MP nanocomputers will hardly speed up.
 Uploading has the same problem with the research time required to figure out
what makes a neuron tick.  Cryogenics is an iffy procedure where information is
lost in the process (it might be in a slightly better state 20 years from now).
 But, say I were able to track down one of those 20 year old clones growing up
in South America.
  All a brain really needs to keep functioning is a good blood supply?  Surely
it is within today's surgical technique to be able to route a few of my son's
arteries to those going to my brain?  Nerve grafts don't sound as easy, but
really aren't necessary.  I would be willing to keep my brain activity going,
albeit in some monstous pit of hell without senses, to be able to hold out
another 50 years until a cure for my disease or a new host can be found.  I
imagine it as a sort of Zaphod-Beeblebrox arrangement, but my head would
probably be hanging limp while my son's head appeared normal.  As long as I
wasn't dying from a brain disease, my son's blood, et al should keep me alive
without worries of rejection, etc.  Although, might my cancer be contagious to
a clone?
  OK, so assuming the the medical technique is practical, what will it take to
get my son to agree to the surgery?  We would be family, but a monetary
incentive might be necessary.  What about the legal issues involved here?  What
would be a good nation for my son to have citizenship in?  (yes,
diversification would be a good idea).  What about if I made a clone of myself,
made it sign a contract, then gave it a lobotomy so it couldn't back out?
 Screw ethics when its my longevity at stake.
  Anybody know of any good cloning labs?

Got a Question Mr. Retired Civil Servant..

Quote an article on the web.

A friend of mines cousin from Germany visited him recently. When the 
talk turned to politics in America, she informed him that people in 
Germany were utterly mystified by something. "We understand that your 
president is an amoral crook - but how unusual is that for a 
politician?" she observed. "Yet everyday our newspapers are full of 
stories like Clinton refusing to sell F-16 fighter jet technology to 
Germany while selling it to China, and all the spy deals hes made with 
Beijing. So everyone in Germany is asking now: why isnt your President 
Clinton being tried for treason?"


I beleive you said something about "when push comes to show...etc. etc."

Enquiring Minds want to know.

Throughout the 'goo prophylaxis' thread, you seem to completely ignore the
possibility that trade may be more profitable than conquest, that employment
may be more profitable than enslavement, and that symbiosis may be more
profitable than extermination.  I don't see why the principle of comparative
advantage should not continue to apply even in a world with vast disparities
in material power between different actors.  

This point does not, of course, imply that all or even most of the human
race will make it into the Diamond Age, but I think that it at least allows
the possibility of a more diverse and comitous world than you believe possible.

Frank hasn't published any technical article on his recent results.  The

things that turned out to be bogus.  It's impossible to judge his results at
this time.

Let's see... he kept his job, lots of people discussed his theory, and the
government gave him several million dollars to put an instrument up on a
satellite to decide matters one way or another.  The worst thing that
happened was that almost everyone told him he was wrong.  Now, if he turns
out to be right, he becomes very famous and respected.  It seems to me that
this is science working exactly the way it ought to.  How would you have had
people act differently?

The non-leading labs have a vital advantage: they will know at least the
vague outlines of what works.  This will keep them from running down the
multitude of blind alleys that are inevitable in pioneering technology.
Consider the development of super-weapons during WWII: in say 1940, all the
governmets involved faced the question of where to put their resources.  The
Germans wasted vast efforts on ballistic missiles and rocket planes, while
the British and Americans worked on A-bombs, radar, and cryptanalytic
computers.  If the Germans had known which of these were going to pay off,
the course of the war would have been different and far worse.  As soon as
the Americans used their A-bombs, the Soviet Union started a development
effort.  Even with their devastated economy and crazed government, they were
able to catch up quickly, exactly because they knew where to put their efforts.

Whoever gets some level of nanotech will have to exploit it to fund further
development efforts.  Such exploitation will immediately provide valuable
clues to everyone else in the world about which way to run.  While the
leading lab is running down the next set of blind alleys, everyone else in
the world will be catching up with them by the direct route.  (If you would
care to claim that it is possible to profit from an advance in nanotech
without providing valuable clues as to its nature, I would be happy to argue
that in detail.)

This is an absolutely standard scenario in the technological competition
between companies.  Often the *second* company to manufacture a new product
is the one that ends up dominating the market.

>And it would be more attractive to

So much the better for spreading the knowledge.

Lots of things reflect neutrons, the best is Beryllium because it has more 
atoms per volume than any other element, but Beryllium is very light and a 
good tamper needs to be heavy. Any heavy element, like lead, would fit the 
bill but for reasons I will explain later, in a modern H bomb U238 
(the common isotope) is used. 

The chemical explosive used is HMX, also called OCTOGEN, it has a detonation 
velocity of 9100 meters per second verses 7000 for TNT. 

             
      NO2     H2      NO2

        /     |     \
     NO2      H2    NO2

       HMX or OCTOGEN
             
The explosive does not push directly on the plutonium it pushed on the heavy 
neutron reflector around the inner sphere of U235 (the rare hard to get 
isotope) or Plutonium. This massive tamper has several jobs, it reflects 
neutrons, it helps to make the spherical shock wave more even, and when the 
plutonium or U235 starts to get hot its great mass slows the expansion and 
so gives the plutonium more time to complete its nuclear reactions.

Water is in no way involved in the physics of a nuclear explosion but it is
involved in the manufacture of nuclear bombs, more specifically plutonium,
and plutonium works even better than U235 in a bomb. A neutron is more 
likely to react to common U238 if it's moving slowly, and water slows down
neutrons. When a slow neutron hits U238 it does not undergo fission but it
turns it into U239, this has a half life of 24 minutes and it decays into
neptunium 239, this has a half life of 2.3 days and it decays into
plutonium 239, and plutonium 239 has a half life of 14,000 years and works 
great in bombs.

Make a bunch of uranium rods in which the U235 has been enriched from its
natural .7% abundance to 2%, make sure there is water between the rods, 
without it the reaction will not go and if the water is not flowing the 
reactor will get very hot very fast and you're in trouble. Let the reactor 
operate for several weeks then stop it and take the rods out. The slow 
neutrons have turned much of the common U238 into exotic plutonium that can 
be separated from the uranium by simple chemical means.

In a H bomb the fission trigger gets the deutroniun and tritium so hot they
fuse, when they do it produces a helium 4 nucleus with 3.5 mev of energy,
but more importantly a neutron with 17.6 mev of energy. When a neutron with 
this enormous speed hits U238 things are very different than when a slow 
neutron does in a reactor, the U238 fissions and releases a lot of energy in 
the process. In fact, in a garden variety H bomb 70% of the energy released 
comes from the fission of the heavy U238 tamper, although of course that 
wouldn't be possible without the super high speed neutron produced from the 
fusion reaction.
                                        

        >it could be that no amount of water decreases the size of a critical 
        >mass.  


Anything outside of the sphere that reflects neutrons will reduce the critical 
mass, it also depends on purity, especially for uranium. For 100% U235 and 
assuming no neutron reflection you would need a 15 kilogram sphere to go 
critical, at 40% you would need 75. For plutonium at 100% just 4.4 kilograms 
would do and even at 25% purity a 20 kilogram sphere would go boom. These 
figures can be reduced with neutron reflection and if the chemical explosive 
compresses the fissionable metal to greater than normal density. If the 
tamper is massive it will slow the time it takes for the sphere to expand 
enough to stop the reaction, so you get a bigger more efficient explosion.

Of course we don't know what would happen to a brain if you cut off all
external nerves for 50 years, but kept it supplied with blood.  It's easy
to assume that total insanity would result, but we really don't know.
Conceivably you might fall into a coma and remain unchanged after a
short while.  The real question from your point of view is whether the
memories and personality could be preserved or restored.  Certainly the
odds would be better than with death and burial, but it's not clear how
they would compare with cryonics.

Actually if you're going to transplant the whole head, presumably you
could keep your eyes, ears, nose and mouth active.  You could even
speak using mechanical assistance.  So you don't have to assume that
you'll be without senses.  It could be a life not much worse than a
paraplegic today.

The procedure would require some considerable reconfiguration of your
son's circulatory system.  As I recall, the head uses a surprisingly
high percentage of the fuel/oxygen consumption of your body.  So the
circulatory system alterations would not necessarily be trivial.

Brain tissue ages just like any other; your neurons will suffer decreased
functionality, gunk building up, DNA damage, etc.  The circulatory system
and other tissues may fail as well.  So just keeping a good blood supply
won't guarantee metabolic survival.  You may also be more vulnerable to
misfortune or even attack as a head stuck on someone else's shoulders
than you would as a suspendee deep in a vault full of liquid nitrogen.

If the cancer has metastasized, it is conceivable that some cells might be
lodged within your head, and could eventually float into your son's body.
Perhaps he could undergo some chemotherapy to help prevent this.

Yes, especially if he's been raised remotely, I would assume that he would
require some compensation to carry your limp head around on his shoulders
for 50 years.  It hardly sounds like an attractive proposition from his
POV.  If you are wealthy enough, though, probably almost anything could be
arranged.

Legally, there seem to be two issues.  One is whether your son is truly
consenting to the procedure.  Let's suppose that can be dealt with.  Then
there may be general ethical prohibitions by society which prevent this
kind of "unnatural" treatment.  For that purpose you'd want a country
which is open-minded about this kind of thing.  Perhaps Russia, with its
atheistic background, will evolve into an anything-goes society in the
next few years.

> What about if I made a clone of myself,

Giving your clone a lobotomy without its permission would be illegal,
and wrong.  I think you will do better to stick to consensual arrangements.

>  Screw ethics when its my longevity at stake.

Ethics can represent rules of thumb for success.  The better ethical
grounds you can find for your arrangements, the more likely you are to
carry them off.

>   Anybody know of any good cloning labs?

The Raelian movement is a religious cult which has embraced the idea of
human cloning.  You might contact them and see whether they have done
anything to implement their plans.

I wouldn't be surprised if this has already been discussed, but...

All I've heard and read of uploading concentrates on taking an intact
brain and "reading it" to another substarate, a non-trivial task by any
measure.  Instead of this approach, how about using a biological brain
as a scaffolding upon which to build an "uploaded" personna.  After
extensive and successive augmentation, the grey matter will matter less
and less. The personna of such a being will begin to spred out of the skull
and into the hardware/software, so eventually the wet stuff will not
do anything that isn't done by the hardware/sotfware.  Take that brain to
the recycle bin-- or what the hell, sell it!  Maybe use it as the seed for
another version of you...  What would you do with your brain if you no
longer needed it? 

Uploading from this approach can for many of us can be considered to
already be underway.

        I have a succinct feeling Everett Mick might like this one...


Uncle Sam


Someone is dying right now.
His hands are clenched and clammy,
His mind is swimming in a limitless sea
Of democracy.
They told him that he could speak
(The government is the they),
But when he tried to speak his mind,
They took that privilege away;
So, now that he has no language,
Now that he has no real power,
He is dying in the arms of Liberty
(Herself, dying by the hour).
Since he tried to follow the charter
And have power by the people,
He is now perishing in order--
Told to obey tradition
And use cognition.
Democracys hypocrisy has quelled his free will,
And a death of sorts has brought him some disease;
He knows the rules of life are all too clear:
Never question traditions or challenge authorities.

Someone was kind enough to point out to me that AMG recently wrote:

There, you may be right; although I'd count Eisenhower too. Not on
humanitarian/mensch grounds, but on the grounds of being someone who was at
least slightly inclined to actually speak his mind. Harry was a relatively
plain-spoken man, Ike somewhat less so; "after them, the deluge"--image
became all, and shortly thereafter the old party system, warts and all, but
where roughly twenty thousand people who cared enough to wade through all
the cigar smoke could actually pick a candidate (and expected to be told by
him what he stood for), transmogrified into the toad-on-steroids
PAC-representation scheme we are currently saddled with. Since somewhere in
the Nixon years, there is zero reason to keep one's promises to anyone _but
the people who paid_ to see you elected--the very thing the law(s?) that
caused PACs was(/were?) supposed to keep from happening. Quel ironee.

The other thing I keep in mind is that Harry was president for the last (in
the sense of "most recent"--_vide_ "The Fourth Turning") time the US
culture had as subtext "we're all in this together". I had a dream the
other night which was set in that time. At one point during the dream, I
made a point of thanking someone for doing something, then realized they
were looking at me funny because _they weren't doing it for me, they were
doing it because it was the patriotic thing to do, and we should both
already know that..._, and I wondered if they'd spotted me as being from a
"foreign culture" and were going to report me as a possible spy. 

I was actually seriously worried about the gaffe. Then I woke up.

ObExtroContent:
If _The Fourth Turning_ has any merit, this might become a cultural
commonplace again. Has anyone here given any thought to the tradeoffs
involved in surviving/thriving in such a time?

Curious how the child - the `son', or more accurately twin brother -
abruptly becomes an `it' in this thought-experiment.  I'd had the
impression that extropians were by choice and principle averse to killing
other human beings whenever they felt like doing so, or just because, and
in the absence of a lethal threat from that other human person, it was to
their advantage.

And while I'm being sanctimonious, preachy and politically correct, I
suppose I might as well add that I detest the suggestion that evil,
rampaging, mother-fucking nanites should henceforth be coded as `black
goo'.  Are people here *really* so deaf to the coded and offensive

spectrum-coding, but what about `war goo'?  Uber-goo is not a colour, after
all...

Subject: HISTORY: Franklin and the Fire From Heaven
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I am currently reading a biography of Benjamin Franklin, Esmond Wright's
"Franklin of Philadelphia" 1986 Harvard U. Press, as part of my on-going
study of the 18th century Enlightenment as a rich lesson-plan for extropians
and the transhumanist movement.  Naturally, Wright recounts Franklin's
scientific and engineering work with electricity as a pivotal part of
Franklin's life story.  Every American elementary school student absorbs the
image of Franklin as a dabbler with kites and thunderstorms, but may not
learn that in fact Franklin was really a person who "found electricity a
curiosity and left it a science," in Carl Van Doren's phrase.  His 1751
pamphlet, "Experiments and Observations on Electricity at Philadelphia in
America", was the most systematic account of electrical phenomena to date and
electrified (ahem) the European intellectual establishment with its
systematic debunking of the then-current (ahem) "two-fluid" theory of
electricity.  Among Franklin's contributions to what we would call physics
was the experimentally confirmed development of a theory of positive and
negative charge and also of a systematic vocabulary of the phenomenon.  He
can be credited with either coining or regularizing the use of the terms
armature, battery, brush, charge, condense, electrify, Leyden bottle, and
nonconductive.

Ever the practical man, Franklin was definitely the developer of the
lightning rod as an architectural element, and he worked vigorously for the
use of lightning rods to protect buildings and shipping.  Lightning being a
traditional symbol of divine retribution, the increasing use of the lightning
rod during the middle years of the 18th century became a, well, lightning rod
of contention and a symbolic rallying point for those who we can today
rightly see as the precursors of modern humanistic and scientific
materialism.  As Wright puts it, lightning rods became a "test of
enlightenment among men."  Traditional religious thinkers condemned the
lightning rod as a "presumption against God", an "intervention in God's
purpose".  Thus, debates about such things are not new to our time, and the
ultimate power of humanistic utility a goal not only of our own age.

An interesting historical aside and irony can be found in the lightning rod
debate.  Apparently quite a few communities still dominated by religious
superstition actually outlawed the use of lightning rods.  Saint Omer in
France was one of these.  When M. De Vissery de Boise-Vale sought to protect
his home with a lightning rod in the 1780s, his neighbors tore it down,
supported by a local ordinance.  A celebrated court case followed in which M.
De Vissery de Boise-Vale was supported by the more progressive members of the
French scientific community.  And who were the lawyers in the case?  For the
prosecution, none other than Jean-Paul Marat; and for the defense, none other
than Maximilien Robespierre.  Of course, in these two figures we can later
see the bloody dangers of radicalism in any cause: In Marat the tyranny of
the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, and in Robespierre the dangerous
knife-edge of an overconfidence borne of an uncritical belief in one's own
rationalism.

Actually, "black goo" is not accepted usage. Grey goo is the common term
for nasty out-of control nanites, and the names red goo (for deliberately
designed goo), green goo ("cleanse the planet"-goo for militant greens)
and khaki goo (military goo) has been suggested as names for aggressive
applications of nanotech. 

(Then there is golden goo, accidentally dangerous nanites intended for
wealth production and blue goo, police nanites acting against the 
other kind).

So there is no need to be preachy or use the term black goo.

Yes, it has already been discussed (great minds often think alike),
it is commonly called gradual uploading. Many of us think this is the
most likely form of uploading (although getting rid of the biological
core might be trickier than we think), and it also nicely solves the
AI vs. human problem - artificial intelligences will rule the world,
and we will be a part of them.

Very true. I have noted that I'm slightly less intelligent and efficient
if I don't have access to my website, my search engines, remembrance
agents, editors and files...

My guess is that to make brain transplantation safe enough to be considered
would require technology so advanced that other forms of life extension
might be viable. But cutting off heads and keeping them alive sounds
reasonable (!).

I would claim it needs constant input to remain viable. Sensory deprivation
is rather destabilizing, and without any signals from the outside the
sensory nerves and cortex will start to atrophy. After 50 years, there
would not be much left of you.

Maybe you could found a religion and convince him that keeping daddys head
alive was ordained by God?  ;-)

I understand how you feel, but you better take the reactions of other 
people into account. They can be more helpful or dangerous than anything
else.

You don't need much technology to do cloning, just an ordinary IVF
lab with some expertise in cell culturing.

Well...no ...I never did.  And I might have to agree with your assesment

I'm just about convinced that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a navy missle.

The evidence supports it...as far as I can determine...and the only opposing
view is (suprise) that of the government...or it's toadies.

Now it's bad enough (terrible in fact) that such an accident could
happen....and accident it almost surely was..

 (missle shot at target drone....glitch cause loss of lock on drone...missle
flies free for a bit...re-locks on "target of opportunity"...commercial
aircraft)


But it is infinitely worse to deny, and lie about it.  What little faith
anyone has in the government is rapidly erroding.

Everyone is invited to check out the site "Counter Culture - End of the World
News- Just the facts" and express an opinion.

I just keep thinking of all the previous government denials which later
turned out to be lies...(.reading "Derilection of Duty" would probably be an
unhappy experience for me.)

Sorry Folks...the devil made me do it...I just found this in my "e-mail
box"...it seems appropriate.

NO MEDIA BIAS: "This is your ace news anchor, and it's the year 1543
A.D. The modern study of astronomy has shown the superiority of the
human intellect in discerning the movement of the stars, the sun, moon,
and the planets around the earth, as first deduced by the great Greek
astronomer Ptolemy 1400 years ago. The geocentric universe is well
rooted in both science and religion, and has been an accepted fact since
nearly the beginning of recorded history. After all, anyone can simply
stand outside and watch the sky, and see the sun and moon rising in the
east, revolving overhead above a firm and unmoving earth, and finally
setting on the other side of the sky. How could anything be more obvious
than that the earth is stationary, and the heavenly bodies are revolving
about our earth at the center of the universe? Yet every so often,
someone challenges the truth and tries to advance extremist views. Yet
we believe in diversity, and we will bring you those fringe theories as
they arise, for you, our audience, to hear. We now join our expert media
analyst, expert astronomer, and expert on just about everything else
worth being an expert in. Our expert is interviewing that backbencher
Copernicus about his radical, some might say extremist, publication
which he calls "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres". Over to
you..."

     "Mr. Copernicus, you have been called an extremist, a bombthrower,
for your belief that, if I have it right, the earth is actually spinning
around in space, and is actually moving around the sun. Now, if your
fantastic theory is correct, there are times when some of us are
actually hanging upside down. Now please tell our audience, do you
really believe all that? Spinning around and we don't get dizzy? Hanging
upside down and we don't fall off? Are you telling this audience that
every focus group and opinion poll is wrong, and that people have been
wrong for over 1000 years? Mr. Copernicus? Mr. Copernicus? I'm sorry
folks, Copernicus has just walked off, refusing to talk to us, muttering
something about media bias. Back to you at the anchor desk."

     "Thanks. Our audience appreciates your attempt to throw the light
of truth on the dark underside of society. Every once in a while some
mean spirited radical comes along with unproven ideas, trying to upset
the settled facts as everyone knows them to be, and we here at the
Narrowmind News Network will continue to report on those fringe
theories, and continue bringing you the real facts, truthfully and
without bias. For the children."

     Sometimes truth is a matter of perspective. Falsity becomes
accepted as conventional wisdom, and anyone voicing such wisdom does
not, in their eyes, display bias by simply stating the facts.
Conversely, anyone challenging the conventional wisdom is deemed to be
on the fringes of society. How could it be otherwise? How can one be
biased by simply stating the "truth"? Those who perceive the
conventional wisdom to be in error understand that the speaker of the
"truth" is speaking with bias. Our media is infected with a pro-status
quo bias, and enunciation of the conventional wisdom brings their
reporting no closer to the truth. Our "independent" media operates as
much of a disinformation machine as any run by any totalitarian
government of the past. By subtle distortion, selective reporting, and
outright misrepresentation, our media paints the picture which they
believe advances their goal of maintaining their position of power and
influence in our society



The above comes via something called "RightNow"...for us conservative,
bombthrowing anarchist reactionary types.

hi,

I visited a web site where a guy has a theory for what crop circles mean.  He
believes that the designs are 3-dimensional when spun at the center and
create objects, or parts to something, like a machine or something, like in
Contact.  Or maybe something at nanoscale.  Interesting theory.  The aliens
are trying to say something, or several things.

here's his web page

    Can I appeal to someone to summarize this thread? I think there is 
original work being done here, but I have been too busy to keep up with 
it. I forwarded one of the messages to Rob Freitas, who expressed 
interest, but he is extremly busy writing the *Nanosystems* of medicine
(31 chapters, two volumes).
   Rob posted related essays, "Police Nanites", on sci.nanotech a few 
months ago, which will be in a book at some point. Perhaps some of
the work accomplished here might be suitable for inclusion in that.

The toadies you refer to would include the entire crew of some
Naval vessel. As I recall, you were an Air Force crypto tech. Would
you and your buddies in the Air Force have agreed to keep a secret
equivalent to a shoot-down of this flight? I know my buddies at
the Army communications center (I was an E5, MOS was 72F) would not.
Why do you think the crew of that ship would keep quiet? These
young sailors are fundamentally the same type of guys as you and I
were at that age. (Well, OK, I admit that sailors are different, but
not that way.)

Sailors are young americans that are not much different from
other young americans. This also applies to junior officers. If a 
missle have been fired from a ship that night, at least some of
these guys would have seen it, and at least some "sea stories"
would have leaked.

Senior enlisted people and officers are somewhat older americans
who aren't all that much different from other americans of the
same age. You may argue that these guys have chosen to be
facist oppressive Statists. It's possible that some match
that description, but not the ones I've met.

<Please excuse if you receive this twice -- I sent it to the List before and

I am currently reading a biography of Benjamin Franklin, Esmond Wright's
"Franklin of Philadelphia" 1986 Harvard U. Press, as part of my on-going
study of the 18th century Enlightenment as a rich lesson-plan for extropians
and the transhumanist movement.  Naturally, Wright recounts Franklin's
scientific and engineering work with electricity as a pivotal part of
Franklin's life story.  Every American elementary school student absorbs the
image of Franklin as a dabbler with kites and thunderstorms, but may not
learn that in fact Franklin was really a person who "found electricity a
curiosity and left it a science," in Carl Van Doren's phrase.  His 1751
pamphlet, "Experiments and Observations on Electricity at Philadelphia in
America", was the most systematic account of electrical phenomena to date and
electrified (ahem) the European intellectual establishment with its
systematic debunking of the then-current (ahem) "two-fluid" theory of
electricity.  Among Franklin's contributions to what we would call physics
was the experimentally confirmed development of a theory of positive and
negative charge and also of a systematic vocabulary of the phenomenon.  He
can be credited with either coining or regularizing the use of the terms
armature, battery, brush, charge, condense, electrify, Leyden bottle, and
nonconductive.

Ever the practical man, Franklin was definitely the developer of the
lightning rod as an architectural element, and he worked vigorously for the
use of lightning rods to protect buildings and shipping.  Lightning being a
traditional symbol of divine retribution, the increasing use of the lightning
rod during the middle years of the 18th century became a, well, lightning rod
of contention and a symbolic rallying point for those who we can today
rightly see as the precursors of modern humanistic and scientific
materialism.  As Wright puts it, lightning rods became a "test of
enlightenment among men."  Traditional religious thinkers condemned the
lightning rod as a "presumption against God", an "intervention in God's
purpose".  Thus, debates about such things are not new to our time, and the
ultimate power of humanistic utility a goal not only of our own age.

An interesting historical aside and irony can be found in the lightning rod
debate.  Apparently quite a few communities still dominated by religious
superstition actually outlawed the use of lightning rods.  Saint Omer in
France was one of these.  When M. De Vissery de Boise-Vale sought to protect
his home with a lightning rod in the 1780s, his neighbors tore it down,
supported by a local ordinance.  A celebrated court case followed in which M.
De Vissery de Boise-Vale was supported by the more progressive members of the
French scientific community.  And who were the lawyers in the case?  For the
prosecution, none other than Jean-Paul Marat; and for the defense, none other
than Maximilien Robespierre.  Of course, in these two figures we can later
see the bloody dangers of radicalism in any cause: In Marat the tyranny of
the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, and in Robespierre the dangerous
knife-edge of an overconfidence borne of an uncritical belief in one's own
rationalism.

On the Foresight Exchange game, the claim TWAm is about whether flight 800
was shot down by a missile.  The criterion is basically that the missile
story becomes accepted enough as the true explanation that it is reported
as fact by two major newspapers before Jan 1, 2000.  This does leave
open the possibility that although the plane actually was shot down by
a missile, there is a successful cover-up which lasts at least another
2 1/2 years.

Presently the claim is trading very low, only around 2 to 3.  This means
that the traders basically see only a 2-3% chance that the missile story
will turn out to be the accepted truth in the given time frame.

There is also a claim TWAC which says that a bomb blew up the plane,
and that is trading in the same very low range.

At this point the traders on FX seem to strongly believe that neither
a bomb nor a missile blew up the plane, or else that a coverup of these
events will be successful.

Just a few thoughts on Mark Crosby's post:

Einstein's successful reduction of Newton's theory of gravitation
as a "special case zone" within the predictions of relativity theory
was mentioned as an example.  However, I suspect that present-day
psychology is closer to Aristotle's physics than to Newton's.
Newton's physical theories did not reduce much of Aristotle's theory,
because he was building on the work of Galileo and Kepler and
other anti-Aristotelean polemicists.  So I don't think this
particular analogy offers much support to the reductive
materialists.  But I can see how it would be convincing to
someone who might have studied more present-day psychology than
I have, and who thinks it's about as good as Newton's stuff;
such a person might find this argument for reductive
materialism convincing.

Personally, I'm very interested in looking at some of the psychology
and philosophy of Buddhist scholars, and this stuff is not as
accessible to me (for various reasons) as the work of European
scholars, so I haven't yet done much of it.  I do know there was
at least one materialist school of philosophy within early Indian
Buddhism, but I've forgotten the name.  The ethical focus of most
Buddhist philosophy distracts from their insights into phenomenology
(which I find more impressive than anything I've seen by the European
school of phenomenology) and psychology, but I'd expect to find
some good stuff there, if you care about theory and not just about
what comes out of the lab.

Nicholas Bostrom asks:
 > Why?

Much of the cruft and "bad design" that people complain about
in biological systems, at least at the nano level, seems to me
to be rather intricate defenses against hostile life,
especially viruses.  The "junk DNA" that gets spliced out of
mRNA by the spliceosomes in the course of transcription, for
instance. It has been hypothesized that the spliceosomes
developed as a defense against retroviruses, which are capable of
inserting their own DNA into the host germ line.

I'm starting to suspect that (at the nano level, not at the
macroscopic mechanical level) life is highly optimized for survival
under hostile conditions (where the source of the hostility is
mostly competing life forms).  The incredible dice-rolling device
that generates the DNA that codes for antibodies, etc.  The metabolic
thermodynamic efficiencies, as has been noted elsewhere, are also
rather better than human beings can usually attain with designed
mechanical devices.

Biological systems often have a tradeoff between toughness and
fecundity. Some species are fragile but extremely fecund, like
mayflies and corals/medusas. The species that are tough (like human
beings) are rarely prolific. The big fear about molecular
nanotechnology is the self-reproducing aspects, the fear of a
highly prolific system.  I think that design tradeoffs would
make the first generation of highly prolific nanotech be either
fragile or extremely energy-inefficient, or both.

I would expect that we'll have considerable experience in
dealing with prolific nanotech, with energy-efficient nanotech,
and with tough nanotech long before we ever have to face off
against nanotech that has all three of these properties.

 > And even if that is the case, don't forget that the step from rather

This speculation usually rests on the idea that we will, in
parallel, have developed AIs or easily replicable uploads that
will be able to do good engineering work far more rapidly than
present-day human beings can.  Otherwise, I think Carl
Feynman's estimates that the capabilities of nanotechnology
will unfold over the course of several "technology generations"
(and not in one fell swoop) are on the mark.

I doubt that uploads will be possible without molecular nanotechnology
for use as probes to determine the structure and processes of a
living brain in order to accurately simulate it.  So I don't think
we can rely on uploads to speed up nanotech development and
substantiate your fears.  We'll have plenty of experience with
nanotech (and time to develop defenses) before we have any uploads
to accelerate the development of nanotech.

That leaves non-upload AI, which I grow increasingly skeptical
about. (This could change any month, though.)  Minksy and Lenat
and a lot of other people who know a lot more than I do are probably
going to hate my saying this, but the most plausible course of
attack in this field right now looks to me like playing with feedback
nets using a bunch of different unsupervised-learning algorithms.
I am pretty sure that most such systems that have been built have
produced no behavior more interesting than catatonia, but I would
expect that if non-upload AI has a future, this is where it's going
to come from. (I'm not ready to lay any money down on this prediction,
though.)

The problem, as Minksy would probably point out, is that such
systems are intractable.  Well, there are lots of systems that used
to be intractable that aren't anymore.  Heart surgery was an
intractable proposition five hundred years ago.  I don't know what
it would take to make working with those sorts of systems intellectually
tractable, but I'll probably spend a little while thinking about
it.  I'm sure I won't be alone in this.

What it comes down to for me is that a lot of our intuitions about
the possibilities in future technology is based on our common
understanding (common among extropians, at least) that we are
physical beings, that our very bodies are existence proofs for
nanotechnology and that our brains are existence proofs for
physically-embodied intelligence.

I would expect the first physically-embodied artificial intelligence
to follow the "intractable" patterns of the existence proof. There
is no existence proof for physically-embodied artificial intelligence
based on an abacus architecture.

Dear fellow Extropians,
EvMick raises an interesting point that most people make, although they
may not realize it. 
It is the problem of opinion based on superficialities. Discussing public
policy on the basis of an individual's personality and/or ideosyncrasies
rather than the cumulative thought processes, constraints and
contingencies that go into value determinations is simplistic. 
This is understandable. The mass media tends to focus on personalities
rather than ideas. Most of the public, therefore, tends to thoughtlessly
follow that simplistic lead.
I'd continue on along this stream of thought, but, at the moment, my wife
is calling me to dinner.
More later.

Got a Question Mr. Retired Civil Servant..

Quote an article on the web.

A friend of mines cousin from Germany visited him recently. When the 
talk turned to politics in America, she informed him that people in 
Germany were utterly mystified by something. "We understand that your 
president is an amoral crook - but how unusual is that for a 
politician?" she observed. "Yet everyday our newspapers are full of 
stories like Clinton refusing to sell F-16 fighter jet technology to 
Germany while selling it to China, and all the spy deals hes made with 
Beijing. So everyone in Germany is asking now: why isnt your President 
Clinton being tried for treason?"


I beleive you said something about "when push comes to show...etc. etc."

Danny, several of the guys who initiated the crop circle hoax have
come forward. They've explained their methods. There are no instances
of crop circles that cannot be generated by these methods.

Now, lets apply Occam's razor: Which is more likely, that all
crop circles are hoaxes, or that most are, but a few are generated
by aliens, and the aliens started after the first hoax?

Actually about 30% are man made.  Theres a big difference between the two,
the alien ones have bent stalks, which are impossible to duplicate(the

Interesting. So are you saying that it simply doesn't matter if
a politician is (or all politicians are) lacking in character?
Or if a political system reliably produces (rewards, whatever)
only politicians who are lacking in character?

Also, I am interested to hear your theory of how a participant in
the democratic process should go about following "the cumulative
thought processes, constraints, and contingencies" when deciding
how to vote.  Most of the methods I have run across for attempting
to keep track of these things either seem unreliable (I had thought
that character was a good guide, but now you seem to be telling us
that it is not) or else to take up so much of my time in researching
my vote that I have no time left in which to earn taxes for the
state.  

This is especially the case where I live, in California, because
we have an extensive system of initiative and referendum which
requires a great deal of research to participate in in a meaningful
way.  Of course, research is not literally *required*, so the
results of the elections are sometimes a bit surrealistic.  I
suppose that's why I like living in California.  I've always been
fond of surrealism, and I find the political environment here
to be quite Daliesque.

(Oh, dear, I shouldn't have said that last.  It's clearly
evidence that I need to get my head shrunk by professional
help.  State-licensed, of course.)

Well, I was kind of attached to spectrum-coding.  Green goo, gray goo, black
goo... blue goo for 'munes... purple goo for Barney...

I think that we should keep things in perspective.  There's a tendency, which
I fully support, to change the name for "black" every few years(*).  Negro,
black, African-American - it'll be something else by the time nano goes
public.  And, if I may be so bold, "black" was a silly name in the first
place.  They aren't black.  They're brown.  Just like "whites", who are
actually beige.  I'm willing to bet it was some prejudiced fellow who decided
to spectrum-code races with the terms traditionally synonymous with Light and
Darkness.  If you're going to code races by color, call them "beige" and
"brown", including "light brown" and "dark brown", and maybe people will start
to realize how ridiculous it all is.

Spectrum-coding is a great way to visualize abstract concepts ranging from
battling nanotech to resistor strength.  I'm not going to give it up because
some poor guys got slapped with the wrong end of the spectrum.

"Red goo" is not an acceptable alternate to "black goo" because nobody can
translate it mentally.  "Khaki goo" is just plain silly.  "War goo",
abandoning the spectrum, is acceptable; as is "death goo".  "Mataglap" would
be fine, since it's easy to translate into Something Evil.  Except that in
"Aristoi", the term was synonymous with any destructive goo, so we'd be
changing the terminology.

"Black goo" is instantly recognizable as Malevolent Goo.  I've taken to
calling the two sides in chess "chocolate" and "vanilla" so that no prejudice
is implied by vanilla going first.  I offer this as proof of my concern.  But
how we feel about "black goo" may determine the fate of the world.  So I'll
use the most appropriate terminology, with the most appropriate connotations,
and to hell with all racist silliness.

One of the most trivial applications of nanotech is to change skin colors. 
Maybe then the Sneeches(**) among us will quit fighting.

-- Notes: --

(*) = Because prejudice does build up, attached to a particular name, and it's
harder to hit a moving target.  What possible harm could a simple change in
terminology do?  (Unless it's a STUPID change, like from "handicapped" to "disabled".)

(**) = Not a racial slur; Dr. Seuss has a wonderful story - makes racism look
as silly as it is, without preaching against it - about the "Star-bellied" and
"plain-bellied" Sneeches, in which a "Star-off" and "Star-on" machine was invented.

Some people say (correctly I think) that we can know almost nothing about 
what things will be like after the singularity, BUT then they tacitly assume 
that the rate of change after The Spike will level out into a plateau of 
sorts, a very high plateau to be sure but a plateau nevertheless. I see no 
reason why that should be true and think we should expect an accelerating 
rate of change for the indefinite future.
 
Let's assume sometime after the singularity, around breakfast, a suicidal nut 
case makes some black goo with the intention of destroying the world. About 
the only thing I can say with any confidence about the world after the 
singularity is that life will be fast and things will change, so by lunch 
time this black goo would seem comically old fashioned, positively stone age
compared to the vastly improved nanotechnology that had been developed in the 
following 4 hours, an eon of subjective time. The black goo might look pretty 
scary in the first few milliseconds after it was made, but after a geological 
age (a minute or two) it would seem more pitiful than scary, like a man armed 
with a flint ax trying to concur the world.
       
In the long run intelligence will always beat stupidity, so to be really 
dangerous, life destroying dangerous, you'd need to make an intelligence 
hostile to all life that could improve itself faster than any machine anybody 
else could build. That's a very tall order and far beyond the capacity of  
"goo" of any color that some Bozo cooked up in his basement.

Huh? I see no problems at all with this term. In our culture red is often
associated with aggression and danger, and red goo makes sense.

Why? It might not be a deadly serious term, but it suggests something that
has come out of a military lab and used by the traditional (IMHO soon to
be very outdated) armies.

War goo is an useful term, since it tells what is intended, but death goo
is a bit too diffuse: does it mean death to a certain person (like the 
"quicksilver" I wrote a short story about), all people who are in contact 
with it or all ordered systems?

I have added Mataglap to my terminology pages since it is an interesting
term, but it is too vague to be very useful. It has the connotations of Evil,
which is impractical in serious discussions about goo capabilities since
we are more interested in the tactical or long-term aspects, not whether
the nanites themselves have some metaphysical evil (one could argue that
gray, red, khaki and green goo are all evils, but the nanites themselves
are just tools for somebody to comitt evil).
 
> "Black goo" is instantly recognizable as Malevolent Goo.

Yes. I don't think it is specific enough to be useful, but it is recognizble.
The problem is that it encompasses accidental goo, deliberately designed
malevolent goo and Ubergoo built by Powers that look malevolent but really
isn't (see the story _Kadath in the Cold Waste_ for a fine take on it
(forgot the author, but make a web search for Kadath and Mars, and you
will likely find it)).

How exactly do know when you're past 'the singularity'?  If there is going to
be an accelerated rate of change for the indefinite future (a point on which
I agree), how do you point to a place in time and say, "that's the
singularity"?

Sounds interesting. I couldn't find either the essay or the man. Do

Yes, but competing *biological* life forms. It hasn't evolved to

What about the step from highly optimized designs to very highly 
optimized designs? By then we should have AI. And  very highly 
optimised attack will almost certainly win over merely highly 
optimised defense.

I think you are vastly overestimateing the acceleration. A speed-up 
of the order you talk about would require new hardware, and that 
hardware needs to be assembled, which is a physical process which 
cannot be made arbirarily fast. This means that a minute or two 
would not ba a "geological time", even if we assume that the arrival 
of superinelligence had completely cut away design and debug delays.

But suppose that you were right about this. Then the first power to 
get to the "singularity" (I sometimes wonder whether that term 
doesn't do more harm than good) would only need to be a *few seconds* 
ahead of the competition to become the ruler of the universe (at 
least in absence of aliens). I reality, of course, the leader would 
be months ahead, so this would automatically enable the leading power 
to eliminate all competition.

Ok, let's make a quick cost-benefit analysis for a SI whether or not 
to destroy another budding SI who refuse a negotiated merger.

Destruction (Kill the tyrrant in the craddle)

costs:
(1a )Some resources has to be deployed for a brief time while the 
rival is destroyed.

(1b) If the rival has been allowed to reached a fairly advanced 
stage, then the operation might incur some damages which will take a 
little while to repair.

(2) We also lose all labor output that the rival could have done and 
from which we could have benefitted through trade.

benefit:
(1) Instead of having to share the universe with our rival, we get it 
to our selves. This means we gain 0.5*(resources in the part of the 
universe that will ever be colonized). This is a *huge* benefit.

(2) We eliminate the risk that the rival will one day try to destroy 
ourselves. Thus, untill we meet advanced Extraterrestrial 
civilizations, we get the benefit of total safety from external 
threats.

Costs (1a) and (1b) are neglible compared to benefit (1). Cost (2) is 
also smaller than benefit (1), because we can use the resources we 
conquer to produce the same amount of output as our rival would have 
had, and this output will now be ours, we won't need to buy it first.

Even without benefit (2), the benefit side far outweighs the cost 
side. The only plausible considerations that could change this would 
be either a balance of terror involving total mutual annihilation, or 
the inclusion of specific sorts of strong ethical motivations

As Drexler has said, there is a difference between know-how and 
know-what. But yes, they will have an advantage -- an advantage 
relative to the state of the leading power before it had developed 
nanotech. But relative to the state of the leading power at the time 
in question, they would of course still be at a disadvantage.


We need to clarify the issue:

Let's simplify and assume that we can get to advanced nanotech 
through the sequence of discoveries N0,  N1, ..., Na...

In no particular order:

N(1997) is where we are today.

Nredgoo-i is where universally destructive goo of generation i can be 
made. (i=0 is red goo that could extinguish all intelligent life if 
there were no immune system.)

Nimmune-i is where a (global) immune system can be build 
to deal with red goo of generation i or lower.

Nimmune-abc is where a good nanodefence against ABC and conventional 
warfare is possible

Nsuperintelligence is where superintelligence can be built.

Ncad++ is where nanotech gives substantial imrovements to nanodesign 
computers (hardware of software)

Ncommersial is where nanotech can be used to make large commersial 
profits (>1 billion$)

Ngeneralassembler --self explanatory

etc.


It seems that what you are arguing is that even if 
N(leader)>>N(competition) at some early stage, it still holds 
that (F1), for every i, 

if
(N(leader)>=Nredgoo-i and N(leader)>=Nimmune-abc)
then
N(competition)>=Nimmune-i or there is a j such 
that N(competition)>=Nredgoo-j and N(leader)<Nimmune-j

Design-ahead efforts might mean that when enabling technologies 
arrive, a lot of designs can be immediately implemented.

Advancement of technology means shorter design-cycles means a given 
cronological time difference corresponds to a greater technological 
lag. If not sooner, this design-cycle acceleration will occur when 
machine intelligence begins to be developed.

These are reasons against (F1)

But even if (F1) were true, it would still not follow that we 
could have a stable multipolar nanotech world order. Military balance 
need not imply military stability. Two fighting men with guns pointed 
to each other's heads are in power balance, but their situation isn't 
stable. (This example is from Drexler.) It takes an aditional 
argument to establish  (F2) that a first strike won't be 
successful.

>(If you would

Good. Note that it is not necessary for my position that such 
commersal benefit is possible. However, I think it is. We could for 
example mass produce certain medicines that can also be made without 
nanotech but only at great cost. The same holds for a number of other 
products. We could even sell things that aren't possible to make 
without nanotech without revealing too much about how we bootstraped 
the tools necessary to make them.

The singularity is not an absolute concept but a relative one, beyond that 
point things will be so different and be changing so fast that prediction on 
its nature are almost purely guesswork. That means there will always be a 
singularity because it keeps receding into the future. I also think that 
because our minds will keep getting faster the subjective time (but not the
objective!) to the singularity will always stay the same. For this reason 
some prefer the term "horizon".

There are also well-known instances where 'crop circle experts' have
identified 'hoaxed' circles as 'real' circles made by aliens because of
features which humans supposedly couldn't reproduce. The 'Circle-Makers'
page on GeoCities is very instructive; I don't have the URL handy, but I

A problem with this argument is that some things
speed up, and others don't. It's the differential rates
that are dangerous. I can't predict past the singularity,
but the current discussion has been pre-singularity. It
has assumed that the evil goo would be designed by
humans, not by an SI. In the human-design era, the
design rate remains in the days-to-years regime, while
the replication rate is in the minutes-to-hours regime.
This is why I'm concerned. We won't have time to design
defenses for the goo after the fact.

I see only one way past this problem. We must strive to
precipitate the singularity before the advent of the ability
to design evil goo. Probably the best way to do this is
already underway: see to it that designs for a nanotech
computer technology are already available prior to the
existance of the first assembler. Then we have at least
a chance to build massive nanotech computing capacity
prior to the release of evil goo or grey goo. Fortunately,
most goo scenarios appear to depend on the availability of
this computing infrastructure to build the control elements
to the goo. So the "only" remaining problem is finding
a way to get to the SI from the nanotech computer base,
or at least to get to an ability to design goo defenses
in the minutes-to-hours time regime.

You are correct that in the post-singularity era, the
self-enhancing SI or SIs will operate in yet another
regime. In that regime, there are still rate differences,
but of a different order. You speak of effectively
unbounded increase after the singularity. I agree that
the rate will continue to increase but the increase IMO
will be so rapid that it will shortly reach the constraints
imposed by the laws of physics. So while is disagree with
your unbounded rate increase, I agree that there will be
no post-singularity era in which our current concepts of
intelligence, art, freedom, individuality, etc. will have
any meaning. These concepts will be completely superceeded
by whatever abstract concepts the SI or SIs choose.

As a matter of definition, I use the term "Singularity"
as Vinge does: the point in the future past which prediction
becomes meaningless.

We're talking about gray goo here, right?  That has to live in the wild,
without getting all its little cogs and conveyor belts clogged up with
natural molecules  that just happen to fit into its various nooks and
crannies.  I don't see any way to solve that kind of problem without
actually putiing it in the world and seeing what fails.  If you're talking
about something that can only replicate in a sterile tank of ultrapure
feedstock, I'd be willing to believe that it could be less 'optimised', but
it is also far less potent economically and militarily.  
Further, a certain minimum level of 'optimality' is needed for a
self-reproducing device to function at all: if the mean time until failure
is less than the mean time until reproduction, growth is impossible.  Thus,
a self-replicator is analogous to an orbital rocket: there's no use for a
launcher that only gets up to 90% of orbital velocity.

I agree that Conway's Life self-replicator design could be carried out to
completion in a short time.  However, it is not a good analogy.  The Life
world is perfect, so engineering reduces to mathematics.  Moreover, Conway
designed his machine to function in an infinite vacuum, so the complexity
produced by the impingement of the world is not present.  I doubt that a
Life self-replicator could exist in a sea of random pixels, inasmuch as any
design for Life machinery I have seen will be completely destroyed by a
single erroneus pixel.

No they aren't.  Thay are pretty much the first designs they came up with
that didn't explode in simulation.  And they totally ignore issues of
manufacturability, optimization of peformance, radiation tolerance, failure
rates (short of instantaneous explosion), and some other things I haven't
thought of that will turn out to be totally critical once we try to build
these machines.  All these things can be ignored for a proof-of-concept
simulated prototype, which is what they needed to prove their point.

>What about the rod logic

The only part of it designed to atomic precision was the PLA (programmable
logic array) I mentioned above.  Even there, only the rods were designed to
atomic precision, not the frame that holds them, so maybe I shouldn't count it.

I wasn't in that course, but I've read Nanosystems closely, and the
replicator design in there is at a fairly high level of abstraction.  It's
detailed enough to convince me that nanotechnology is a feasible technology,
which was its purpose.  It is by no means designed to atomic detail.

More later.  Must sleep.

Actually I thinking of the FBI and the news media..but you have a point.

 As I recall, you were an Air Force crypto tech. Would
 you and your buddies in the Air Force have agreed to keep a secret
 equivalent to a shoot-down of this flight? I know my buddies at
 the Army communications center (I was an E5, MOS was 72F) would not.
 Why do you think the crew of that ship would keep quiet? These
 young sailors are fundamentally the same type of guys as you and I
 were at that age. (Well, OK, I admit that sailors are different, but
 not that way.) >>


In my career field secrecy was a major concern...we were told not to tell
ANYONE.....ANYTHING..... about ANYTHING.... actually it even caused some
psychological problems with some of the younge more trusting guys.

And yeah...I do think that it could be covered up given the scenario I
sketched...particularly if the missel was sub-launched. Very few onboard the
launch vehicle would know what or if the missel hit...it was supposedly an
over-the-horizon shot..

The senior NCO's and the Orificers would be most likely to toe the
party-line...they've been trained in obedience for much longer...and have
more to loose.  (from my experience in the VietNam. debauchle....I could tell
you a few stories about THAT..)..and the "sea stories"...(called War Stories
in the AF)..would be irrelevant....there are always War Stories...it's a
major form of entertainment.

Sad to say...I think I'm still leaning toward the missel theory...wish I
wasn't.

Interesting stuff. The quick degradation suggests that it is fast-acting
and has local effects, perhaps like nitrogen or carbon monoxide. Could
be a retogerade signal in LTP.

Yes, the exchange is open to everyone (http://www.ideosphere.com/fx/). The

I am absolutely delighted that finally, finally the acknowledgement
"creativity" as an important component of our future is being recognized in
more than one field. 
Dr Stephen Thaler's approach is a milestone in achieving strides in AI,
however the article itself does make assumptions that are debatable.  

It is my view that in the future, near and far, that "creativity" will be
understood and appreciated more than ever.   This includes not only the
psychological ramifications of creativity, but also the practical
applications of creativity as being as vital in our thinking as intelligence
is.  The "Creativity Augmentum" in the 21st Century, as I see it, will
certainly be worth investing in.

Let's not, and say we did  :-)

I've got a few questions that keep running through my head about all this
nanowar and psychedelic goo talk - so here they are:

1.)  Can anyone give an estimate to how long it would take for nanites to
alter the human body?  For instance, how long would it take to change the
gender of an adverage adult, considering heat, efficiency and the fact you
don't want to end up with a pile of gooey organ material?

2.)  How much does the brain grow and change per day?  (This is related to
keeping consciousness when uploading by slowly merging human and machine
components).

3.)  Anyone like to speculate on survailence possibilites of nanotech?
 Nanocams, nanobugs and nanobrainalteringthingies?

I think it's time we burned the term "singularity."  If one power got to a
'singularity' and it was progressing at 1 month per second the other power is
likely to be progressing at .9999 months per second, the difference would be
minimal.

Many parts of this thread seem to revolve around the idea that one person
makes progress while the rest of the world stands still.  The nanotech
'revolution' will be a combination of work from all corners of the world.
 Defense and offense will progress together, minimising the threat of goo of
any colour.

The media really does focus on the individual instead of the issue. It sure 
makes discussion of more than foreign affairs less than enlightening. Just 
think of the impact that the mass media has on subjects such as religion, 
science, the arts, history, and all the other subjects that make up our 
lives.

I really enjoyed reading the post about Franklin's and other's fight 
against all the backward superstitious things people think. It's got me 
thinking about some of the discussions I have been reading in the various 
chat rooms and NGs; particularly the ones dealing with religion or social 
issues. For the most part, Christians and other "main stream" religions are 
comfortable with scientific reasoning even though they may not always agree 
with the moral implications of the technology that science makes possible. 
But there seems to be a strong presents of others on the net that 
categorize themselves as witches, pagans, and other similar religions that 
attack not traditional theology issues but scientific thinking its self. 
They are very preoccupied with magic and belief systems that could care 
less about the natural environment as understood by the scientific 
community

What is of interest to me is they claim to be growing in numbers. I believe 
their growth just may be true because the primary motivation for their 
growth is a hatred of science its self - something I hear more and more of 
every day from lots of different people. Many of the things that science 
makes possible can be real scary to people who don't have the benefit of a 
good education. This, combined with the fact that the cutting edge of 
science in many fields is no longer intuitive and understandable to an 
average person makes many people want to go to a simpler belief system that 
is pre-enlightenment in nature.

I get the sense that many of these people are spiritually scared to death 
about the very subjects that this list talks about on a regular basis. I 
also think that they are gaining in influence and isolating science from 
everyday life replacing it with superstition. That is real bad. One day, 
science just may find that it is locked in a castle with the peasants 
outside the gate with their pitchforks and torches wanting to burn it for 
its heresy.

It seems the enlightenment is very fragile indeed and we should not take it 
for granted.

True, but even now the distinction between hardware and software sometimes

The black goo must physically move too, spread over thousands of miles if it 
is to destroy all life. In that time a Nanocomputer could perform a gargantuan 
number of calculations, and to the minds running on those machines the spread 
of the goo would seem to move about at fast as the hour hand on your 
wristwatch.
              

        >This means that a minute or two would not ba a  "geological time" 


The fastest signals in the brain move at 100 meters per second, many are much, 
much, much, slower. Light moves at 300,000,000 meters per second and Nano 
computers would be far smaller than neurons, further increasing the speed 
advantage.

Yes, I think that's true, but we were talking about black goo. If the first 
team that develops Nanotechnology consists of a bunch of homicidal maniacs 
then we are all in deep shit, but that's not the first time something like 
this has come up. If you're attacked by black goo you won't be one bit deader 
than you would be if you were vaporized by an H bomb.
                  

        >I think you are vastly overestimateing the acceleration.
                  

I'd say more but a million and one things have just popped up and I have no

I don't think that technical creativity is a separate
quality from artistic creativity or any other kind of
creativity. I focus on technical creativity only because
I'm interested in its effects on technically-augmented
enhancement of intelligence.

My 14-year-old is just starting high school at Thomas
Jefferson High School of Science and Technology.
TJHSST is arguably the best high school in the country.
Interstingly, one of the major concerns that many students
have before deciding to go there is that they will be
required to be science nerds. A few of the students are
in fact science nerds, but the percentage of students
with strong interests and abilities in the arts appears
to be much higher than in other high schools, and the
students are encouraged to take courses and to participate.

Interestingly, if in fact a post-human SI evolves to the
point of being limited only by the laws of physics, then
esthetics and creativity will be the only remaining
determinates of the SI's actions. In effect, everything the
SI does will be art.

I'm engaged in a debate with an old friend about libertarianism.  He has made
the assertion that:

> the market has never opened itself to integration without being forced to.

I don't think this is true, but would love some help in coming up with some
good examples.  The first one that comes to mind is Jackie Robinson and the
general desegregation of professional sports in the U.S. in mid-century --
well before the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Any others come to mind?

Of course, as I've been pointing out to my friend, it's hard to make
assertions about REALLY free markets, because there have been so few examples
of them.

Except that if you try to translate it mentally, without having heard of it,
it comes out as "hot goo".  I want a term that's recognizable without
training.  "Blue goo" is better than "gold goo" or "white goo" for protective
goo, because "white goo" isn't Benevolent in the same way that "black goo" is
Malevolent, and "gold goo" sounds Nice without being Protective.  (Note that
in the standard spectrum, gold goo actually has a malevolent meaning.)  "Blue
goo" initially sounds like "cold goo", and in this sense "red goo" would make
a nice opposite.  The police-protection sense, I think, is confined to America
and a few other countries.  (Is it an international symbol?)  Note that "red
goo", in some places, might have the connotation of "stop sign"; they'd think
it was the opposite of "green goo".  "Silver goo" might be as good as "blue
goo", again because of the instinctive translation; silver is the opposite of
black in a way that white is not.  It also has the connotation of protection,
particularly if mentioned after "black goo", and does NOT translate to
ANYTHING malevolent.

In this sense, I think "silver goo" is superior to blue goo, since - although
not necessarily protective - it's clear that this goo isn't doing anything
bad, and if mentioned in the same context as "black goo", it's obvious that
the "silver goo" is set up to oppose it.

Because nobody can visualize khaki in the same way they can visualize blue or
silver.  It takes up too much cognitive sub-effort; the term turns into a mere
noiselike label.  Khaki is not a semantic primitive in the same sense as
"silver", "black", "war", or "death".  This makes the term "khaki goo" a
subrecursive term, making it harder to think, harder to use, and harder to chunk.

For goo of a unique purpose rather than a general philosophy, or an esoteric
philosophy, a spectrum term should not be assigned.  Spectrum coding
translates only into very basic connotations.  "Assassin goo", "poison goo",
and "chaos goo" are the appropriate terms in each case mentioned.  "Red goo"
can substitute for "chaos goo", but only for Magic card players.

Nobody is getting mystical about "black goo", although it could be argued that
I've gone off the deep end with respect to color coding.  Having the term
recognizable as Malevolent is also important to having understandable
conversations.  And like it or not, the connotations of a term form an
important part of the framework on which we hang all associated knowledge. 
"Goo" has the connotation of being formless, despite "black goo" (at least)
being very highly ordered.  Complain about that, if you're looking for
unhelpful connotations.

Not really.  Any malevolence has the connotation of being deliberate. 
Particularly by contrast with gray goo.  Anyway, such sub-connotations are a
matter of usage; the important thing is to have a term whose connotations
sketch, and do not conflict with, the usage we intend to hang on it.

And, as always, I ain't discussin' Ubergoo.  THEIR problem.  Not mine.  Great
story, though!  And I'm borrowing the term "Kadath" as a scenario label for a
Power-class collective VR with new information as a ultimate goal.

A Web search on Stephen Thayer doesnt turn up anything other than

(cf. http://www.imagination-engines.com/cmissue.htm)

"Surpass[ing] human powers of creativity" at this point seems
doubtful; however, this is definitely the development direction needed
to spur AI beyond the lab, especially the ability to link together
multiple neural nets AND have the different nets cooperate in pursuing
various functions.  The really interesting idea in the Creativity
Machine is described in the MSN article as follows:

<Thaler claims he can achieve that final step [artificial creativity
and consciousness] by connecting two neural nets using a phenomenon
which he calls the virtual input effect. While one neural network is
released to daydream, another alert partner polices the emerging
stream of ideas for anything that looks practically useful. The second
network acts as a sort of filter in the brainstorming process
weeding out good ideas from bad. > 

This also seems to me to be the right approach - creating
communicative layers for different tasks.  However, I suspect it
will be necessary to add *at least* a third layer.  This two-layer
approach sounds like traditional client-server architecture compared
to three-tier approaches.  In this regard, Pat Hayes (a recognized AI
authority) had this to say:

< Minksy and Papert's demolition of the Perceptron depended crucially
on that machines having only two 'levels'. At the time it was generaly
assumed that this wasnt really important, but we now know that it was.
Three levels and you can do all kinds of wonderful things, quite
escaping the M&P critiques. It took a good few years to realise this.>
(http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online.html in "Hayes Response to
Sutherland")

MSN also quotes Thayer as saying:
<"Because concept generation results from an internal, high-speed
dialog between two neural networks, totally out of the hands of a
human operator, we form an autonomous, creative agent">

Yes, but without other evaluative modules and some grounding in the
real world, it will still require a human artist to sort out the junk
from the insights.  Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing -
the more people who use this tool, the more variation and selection
well get, as opposed to letting the program gyrate in its own
separate reality.

This certainly sounds like an interesting approach (see below after my
brief review of Churchland). 

In criticizing eliminative materialism I wanted to note that I wasnt
against departing from the traditional science paradigms in some
areas. Especially regarding folk psychology, theres certainly some
Jungian and Freudian concepts that could be better replaced with
computationalist terms.  I was primarily ranting against the tendency
of some (not Eric, probably not Churchland) to say that talking about
anything other than bare brain states would amount to some sort of
vitalism.

After my post, I decided it was time to pull Churchlands book out of
my to-read stack and see what he actually had to say in this regard.

The last section of ch.9 in Paul Churchland's _The Engine of Reason,
the Seat of the Soul_ argues that "human massively parallel prototype
activators" are different from "serial algorithm executors", or Turing
machines, and that this can account for the superiority of human
pattern recognition over rule-based machines: "this capacity for
activating relevant prototype vectors, makes algorithmic plodding
largely unnecessary". This insight is one of Churchland's greatest
contributions to cognitive science.

Churchland also makes excellent points about fallacies held by the old
functionalists. But, that's because they "cared relatively little
about exactly what processes take place inside us, so long as they
implement the right input-output function [and their] presumption
about the nature of those processes was mistaken: it portrayed them as
algorithmic to the core." I would agree with Churchland that "it does
matter what physical processes take place inside us, and they are not
just executing a program" (p251). 

BUT, on the other hand, I don't think "high-dimension activation
vectors [only] have intrinsic meaning within the human neural
architecture" (p244). Churchland probably does not imply that 'only'
that I have inserted because, at the end of ch.9, he adds: "No one
claims that the silicon retina is conscious ... Its representations
will not be a target of or a part of something's consciousness until
it is embedded in a larger cognitive system..."

This "larger cognitive system" also has its own degrees of freedom,
including the ability to ALSO use rule-based approaches, plans (cf.
Bruce Bridgeman ON THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND LANGUAGE in
Psycoloquy at
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/psyc-bin/newpsy?article=3.15&submit=View+Article
) and goals that subvert the "intrinsic meaning" by adapting existing
tools to perform new functions in a constructivist manner. Some, e.g.,
Patrick Hayes, see this larger cognitive system as a virtual machine.
It is in this sense - some independence, the ability to form abstract
representations, and to both select ones environment and ones
responses to it - that the larger cognitive system can be considered
'software' *in comparison* to the lower-level 'hardware'. Having
programs and algorithmic repertoires can actually free us up to think
of other things when engaged in mundane tasks. The key to freedom here
is having various levels of processing.

It is important not to take this software / hardware dichotomy too
rigidly, but applied in moderation it can allow adaptive functions to
emerge. Contrary to what Churchland supposedly says elsewhere about
eliminative materialism, I would suggest that, at these higher levels
of aggregation, Churchland's "prototype activation vectors" become the
symbols, schemas, analogies & stories of the linguistic levels of the
mind. This emergent array of functionality is how I define 'software'
as opposed to some strictly deterministic program.

-------------------
Regarding Buddhist philosophy and AI, perhaps the psychophysicists
have done the most to apply some of these principles to neuroscience. 
For example, one intriguing paper by Robert A.M. Gregson is called
"n-Dimensional Nonlinear Psychophysics: Intersensory interaction as a
network at the edge of chaos".  BTW, if you do a search on
Robert+Gregson, youll mostly get back links to stuff by an old
Extropians list participant, Ben Goertzel, who has a lot of stuff
online along these lines.  Hes back in the U.S. (at
http://altair.comoc.com/People/ben/ ) and working on an AI /
Web-search project called WebMind.  Another serious psychophysics
researcher, whose works seem more practical to me than the Roger
Penrose school of quantum consciousness, is psychiatrist Gordon Globus.

Another essay I recently found that tries to reconcile
computationalism with Eastern philosophies is Copthorne Macdonald's
"An Energy / Awareness / Informational Interpretation of Physical and
Mental Reality" essay ( http://www.cop.com/zygon1.html ). Macdonald
used to write for Mother Earth News and despite some spiritualist red
flags, the essay is really pretty good. He does endorse the
psychophysics of Gordon Globus, but he also develops the systems
science notion of levels of reality, and systems, that I find so
important. He points, in particular, to the work of Ervin Laszlo in
the 70s & 80s (cf. _The Systems View of the World_) and develops the
notions of directed evolution that I find intriguing.

Macdonald also describes Roger Sperry's emergent interactionalism:
"emergent entities then interact causally with each other at their own
level". But then he proposes: "The assumption that awareness is
fundamental suggests a somewhat simpler and more direct explanation of
brain/mind relationship". Basically, he takes the line, similar to
that of Globus, that "[neural] correlates represent physically
embodied information about the attended-to quale, and are available
for use in unconscious 'computational' processing - perhaps to
initiate behavior, or to flag (by creating an emotion) a danger or
opportunity. I am suggesting that ... qualia are generated in
relatively simple neuronal systems and that the selective attention to
these qualia produces neuronal data that is used in the [higher-level]
computational phase of the evaluation process."

This is very similar to what I was proposing for 'hardware' vs
'software' levels of the mind in regards to Churchland and the claims
of eliminative materialism. Macdonald cites Libet's work on sensation
vs. decision lag time to conclude: "The implication here is that even
though conscious intentions may arise from unconscious sources, if one
is sufficiently alert it is possible to make a conscious choice to
abort the intended behavior before it actually begins".

This is made possible by having a system with multiple levels of
control, as described in the current thread about Stephen Thayers
Creativity Machine.

Interesting. So are you saying that it simply doesn't matter if
a politician is (or all politicians are) lacking in character?
Or if a political system reliably produces (rewards, whatever)
only politicians who are lacking in character?

Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians,
Although I did not mention constructive ethical and moral behavior in my
comments relating to the formation of public policy, I thought that it
would be understood that a strong ethical and moral foundation is apriori
in this regard.
An error in judgement is the assumption that politicians make policy.
Actually, mostly they primarily make a great deal of flatulating noises
which the media dutifully reports as policy statements. The reality of the
siuation is that numerous analysts collect as many facts as possible prior
to a policy proposal and jointly present a summary and analysis to those
who make the ultimate determination. It should be pointed out that most
policy is initiated and instituted within the various agencies of
government. Only where enabling legislation and appropriations are
required does the legislative branch become involved. Most policy
determinations (either domestic or foreign) are never noticed by the
general public.
****************************************************
      
Also, I am interested to hear your theory of how a participant in
the democratic process should go about following "the cumulative
thought processes, constraints, and contingencies" when deciding
how to vote.  Most of the methods I have run across for attempting
to keep track of these things either seem unreliable (I had thought
that character was a good guide, but now you seem to be telling us
that it is not) or else to take up so much of my time in researching
my vote that I have no time left in which to earn taxes for the
state.  

Dear Eric et al,
This is a major part of the problem. Since the time of George Washington
most people have been to preoccupied with their basic survival to pay much
attention to the complexity inherant in the administration of a democracy.
As with most professions, administration of government is an area of
academic specialization. Initially, the profession of law was broad enough
to include the social philosophies of the 18th and 19th centurys. As our
society has evolved and become more complex, the arts and sciences have
had to become more complex as well. There is now simply to much
information for the "average" individual to absorb and convert to
knowledge and, ultimately, wisdom.
Possibly, through collective knowledge of the Extropians can we evolve
further so that a greater percentage of our citizenry can develop the
capacity to function on the broad and interdisciplinary level required for
participation in the further evolution of humankind and its social and
cultural structures.    
********************************************
This is especially the case where I live, in California, because
we have an extensive system of initiative and referendum which
requires a great deal of research to participate in in a meaningful
way.  Of course, research is not literally *required*, so the
results of the elections are sometimes a bit surrealistic.  I
suppose that's why I like living in California.  I've always been
fond of surrealism, and I find the political environment here
to be quite Daliesque.

(Oh, dear, I shouldn't have said that last.  It's clearly
evidence that I need to get my head shrunk by professional
help.  State-licensed, of course.)

Dear Eric et al,
I think you just stated my point from a different perspective in a far
more succinct manner than I did. Obviously, I suspect that the research
that is required to understand the long effects of any referendum or
initiative is beyond the desire of most members of the public and the
media.

Another thing that has been bouncing around in my head is OTEC.  Try
visualizing how it will work...either the open cycle or the closed cycle
version.  THAT'LL keep you occupied for a few miles....er....hours.

Anyway...it occurs to me that the tempeture differential between well water
and ambient air temp in many places at many times of the year exceeds the
minimium requirement for OTEC....(only in this case it'd have to be called
something else)...particularly if boosted with a little solar augmentation.

On the other hand...in the winter in many places the reverse is true...the
well water temp is that much higher than the ambient air temp.

In either case is a "table top" demo model possible? (or even household power
generation?) Or ....since the reputed effeciency is only 2 or 3
percent...must it be huge to operate at all?

Just a Thought.

As some of you have no doubt surmised...I have a bad attitude...I know I do
because I've been told so since I was a wee tot....usually by an elder  or
other "authority figuref" whom I was getting the better of in an argument (I
thought of it as reasoned debate).

Also no doubt noticed by some of the more astute members of this list is my
bent toward anti-authorianism.  Hence one of my favorite questions over the
years to proauthoritarian types is"

"At what point is it morally and ethically correct for a group to do
something which is morally and ethically incorrect for an individual?"  

That is...presumably it is incorrect for individuals to steal...but if it is
called taxation (by a group) then it is OK.

Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to kill....but if it is called
"execution" (by a group)..then it is OK.

Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to extort, ....but susrely you get
the point.  My question has always been what is the minimium group size?

Isn't it written somewhere (Federalists Papers? Constitutional supporting
documentation...some political speech by muckity-muck?) that the governments
just rights are derived from it's citizenry?  Suppose the citizenry doesn't
HAVE that right...then how can the coersive and oppressive state claim any
moral justification toward exercising same?.....other than force that is.

Another thing that I've often wondered.  Suppose a politician is making a
speech saying things that I think are admirable and true...only the
politician doesn't beleive what he is saying...he is only saying it to get my
support....

Is that politican lying?  Even though he is telling the truth... ?  Does
beleif in what you are saying influence whether it's true or not...?

At which point I was generally accused of having a "bad attitude"...which
presumably won the argument in favor of authoritarianism.

There's also an interview under `SciTech' with Arthur C. Clarke, who once
again touts for cold fusion.  He's not a dill, and he does great network,
so what the hell does he know that we don't?  (Not a word, danny.)

If quantum sources are available, all others will be wiped
                  out. Commercial cold fusion units are going on the market
very
                  soon. The first company has been launched and theyve got
                  plenty of money behind them. Then, with one final
flourish, he
                  quips, want to buy a cold fusion powered shaver? 

He is, of course, a terrible and inveterate punster and practical joker,
but I don't think he'd be joshing about something this consequential.

Natch; H.P. Lovecraft doesn't do nano.  It's some Web story written
probably in the past couple of years, with a Lovecraft-inspired title
probably because the author wanted to write a story with that title.  (I
don't remember any compelling analogy in the story itself, or reason in
the surrounding text.)

There's also the Red Cross and the Red Crescent -- perhaps red goo would
be widespread healing nanites?

Conversely, I have no idea where silver as protective comes from.  It's
been bouncing around my head going nowhere for several minutes now.
First three contacts are silver dragons in AD&D, the black-and-silver of
Minas Tirith, and C.S. Lewis's the _Silver Throne_ (Narnia) which was
associated with malevolence.  All of those hits have taken a while.  The
closest association I have with silver is magic, and even that's pretty
loose outside of proper context.  Siler goo doesn't do anything for me.

} Because nobody can visualize khaki in the same way they can visualize blue or

Agreed.

I think it may be time to give up on colored good.  "Gray goo" may work,
because it's been around for a while, and gray may imply machines, so
gray goo leads to mechanical, well, goo, which has got to creep most
people out.  I don't know how well this would translate, though.  "Blue
goo" and "green goo" were good for our culture -- policemen in blue,
ecofanatic "Greens" -- but they probably don't translate well.  (Hell,
colors don't necessarily translate well themselves, although I'd guess
this isn't a problem in Europe.)

And even "green goo" isn't that good -- sure, it's ecological, but maybe
it's blue goo for the environment, or what gray goo turns into after it
starts mutating and evolving (actually, I like that) or something else.

I fully admit that colored goos are cute, but the very fact we're having
this debate shows that they're not automatically intuitive, which was
the whole point.

"Police goo" and "war goo" give pretty good ideas.  (Of course, there
could be benevolent police good and police state police goo.  Sigh.)
There's also "plague goo", although whether that should apply to grey
goo (out of control parasitic nanites) or traditional "green goo"
(really a specific form of war goo) I'm not sure.

Thing is, we can afford to use confusing terms when the concept itself
takes explaining.  "Grey goo" works becuase you probably have to explain
nano-goo in the first place.  After that "police goo" and "war goo"
should be pretty obvious, more so than red, black, or khaki goo.
"Golden goo" might be worth keeping, if the idea of out of control
mining nanites isn't fully suggested by "mining goo".  "Plague goo"
could be war goo which used biological attacks.  "Gobbling goo" are
nanites which just replicate -- like "gray goo", and it also links to
the Gobbler von Neumann machines in Brin's "Lungfish" (analogous to
Berserkers).

Grey goo, police goo, war goo, golden goo, plague goo, gobbling goo
perhaps as deliberate gobblers vs. grey goo.  Green goo as a nanite
population beginning to become rather lifelike itself.
